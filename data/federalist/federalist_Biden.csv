How Joe Biden Ruined My Wednesday,"Last week, I woke up with pinkeye. It was not glamorous. I trudged to the bathroom and stared in the mirror, disgruntled. Then I wiped off my red, crusty eye, threw out my contacts, grabbed my glasses, and made an appointment with my doctor.

Not a huge tragedy, I’ll admit. But this was all before Joe Biden showed up.

My doctor’s office happens to be on a major road in Austin, Texas. But when I pulled up to the road, which is four lanes wide, it was completely blocked by at least four police cars. Weird, right? Thinking it was an accident, I turned and tried a back way.

Blocked. Four more police cars, lights quietly flickering. I tried again, cutting through a strip mall—and that’s when I truly beheld the somewhat disquieting power of the police state. The entire road, as far as the eye could see, was completely closed. Businesses were blocked. Doctors were blocked. Schools were blocked. A helicopter hovered above.

I stepped out of the car, heading for the nearest police officer, who was apparently giving another blockaded woman some rather annoying news. “It’s Joe Biden,” my fellow trapped citizen informed me, as the policeman—I’ll call him Officer Barricade—toyed with his walkie talkie. “And they don’t even know how long the road will be blocked.” Biden, it turns out, was in town to visit a domestic violence hotline, and he apparently didn’t mind wreaking a little traffic havoc along the way.

“I have an appointment with my doctor,” I said to Officer Barricade. “Do you know when the road will open up? Do you know when Biden’s supposed to come through?” The policeman shrugged. “Who does he think he is, THE KING?” I asked. That was when Officer Barricade, very politely, asked me to get back in my car.

Did I mention my hair was also unwashed? And that I was wearing yoga pants with some of my son’s breakfast cereal crusted to the knee?

I walked back, chagrined, with my new stranded friend. “I have to pick up my son from school,” she told me, anxious, checking her watch. “What do they expect us to do?” I turned, nodding, feeling the camaraderie. We were fellow victims. We were simpatico. We locked eyes. And that’s when she slowly backed away in horror, clawing her way into her car like Extra Number Twelve in a low-budget zombie movie. Ah, yes. My pinkeye. Did I mention my hair was also unwashed? And that I was wearing yoga pants with some of my son’s breakfast cereal crusted to the knee? There. I just did. I don’t blame you for running, lady, I really don’t.

“Oh, boo hoo,” you may be thinking at this point. “So you’re little late for your appointment.” OK, fair enough. But what about the person who had to get medicine for their feverish child? What about the person who got a frantic call from their elderly grandmother who turned on the stove and couldn’t turn it off? What about the unemployed person on their way to a hugely important job interview? Too bad, folks: “public servant” Joe Biden, the man Clint Eastwood aptly described as “just kind of a grin with a body behind it,” needs to get his armored battalion to a crucial, mission-critical…photo op.

Joe Biden needs to get his armored battalion to a crucial, mission-critical…photo op.

By my estimation, there were at least a dozen taxpayer-funded police cars lined up, waiting…and waiting…and waiting…for this very important man. (So important, apparently, that he was reportedly almost booted from the 2012 presidential team.) If you had decided to rob a bank at that very moment, or steal a bunch of candy from a bunch of babies, odds are you might be the luckiest felon on earth. Hey, now that I think about it, remind me to steal a few hubcaps next time Joe Biden is in town! (Do people even do that any more? A criminal mastermind I’m not.)

The V.P.’s motorcade, it should be noted, has been in trouble before. In the first two years of his vice presidency, Biden’s limo/police/commando brigade was reportedly involved in at least five crashes. One of the accidents killed a Maryland pedestrian. Another crash occurred on the way to another highly critical engagement—a visit to Jon Stewart’s “The Daily Show.” Biden didn’t mention the crash on air, as Forbes reported at the time, but “he did joke that having the roads cleared for him was a big perk. ‘Hell, I’ve never driven in New York with no traffic before,’ he told Mr. Stewart.” Wow. It sure was nice of all those New Yorkers to cancel their plans, engagements, emergencies, and lives in general for Mr. Biden’s TV appearance!

People in D.C., of course, are used to this nonsense. Many have come to accept politicians as “important.” They regularly watch elected officials abusing power, plowing through the streets of Washington like giant, deranged Stay Puft Marshmallow Men, wallowing in your hard-earned money. And it’s not just the politicians, either: Interestingly, our friend Biden’s cute but apparently feisty niece recently made national news for brawling with her New York roommate, taking a swing at cops, and then, upon her arrest, pulling the most classic, endearing routine of all: “Do you know who I am?”

Joe Biden’s Austin motorcade fiasco is a perfect symbol of our out-of-control federal government: it’s annoying, expensive, wasteful, and it’s constantly getting in your way. If you want to build a non-favored business, it will slap you with taxes and regulations. If you want to send your kid to a school outside of your zip code, good luck! If you like your doctor and your insurance plan, well, then, you can keep your doctor and your insurance plan. Ok, I’m just kidding about that last one.

Joe Biden’s motorcade is a perfect symbol of our out-of-control federal government: it’s annoying, expensive, wasteful, and it’s constantly getting in your way.

I understand that the vice president of the United States needs security. Others, however, aren’t so charitable. One particularly punchy commenter on the Austin American-Statesman’s website offered that the “secret service should only be able to carry a shotgun to protect Joe – he was very clear that was all anyone ever needs for protection.” But in a time of budget crisis—and if venturing out into the wild American hinterlands is really so dangerous for a glorious luminary like Joe Biden—do we really need the vice president blocking our roads and gallivanting all over the country, just to take photos with a few genial, well-intentioned middle-aged ladies laughing at his questionably funny jokes?

When your government can capriciously shut down roads just for propaganda purposes, perhaps it’s time to rethink the role of our elected officials in Washington, D.C. It’s clear that I’m not the only one who is a bit piqued with all of this: According to a recent NBC/WSJ poll, 60 percent of Americans want every single member of Congress fired and replaced. That’s the highest ever response to that question in the history of the poll. We’ll see how it plays out in the voting booths.

Here’s the good news: Thanks to Joe Biden, everyone else in Austin was apparently also late for their respective appointments, so when I finally showed up to the doctor, about forty-five minutes late, I didn’t have to wait very long. “How’s it going?” asked the receptionist when I checked in.

“I’m really annoyed with Joe Biden,” I answered.

She shook her head. “I know. Dude should just go home.”

But, of course, he didn’t. Four hours later, when my husband was late, due to come home with pizza for three starving boys under the age of six—“Where’s the pizza? Is the pizza truck here yet? Oh, Daddy’s bringing it? Where’s Daddy? I’m so hungry for pizza! The baby is eating the crayons! Why are you drinking straight out of that big bottle?”—I received a phone call.

“Yeah, so I have the pizza, but I’m stuck. Horrible traffic…I think they’ve shut down the road. It might be another half hour.” He paused for a second and added, “Did you know Joe Biden’s in town?”

Indeed I did. Oh, indeed I did.

9 Questions To Ask About Biden’s Work With A Gas Company In Ukraine,"Twitter is abuzz with questions about the involvement of Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter with a gas company in Ukraine. The company, Burisma, allegedly appointed Hunter Biden to its board of directors. In late April, around the time the vice president made an official trip to Ukraine, Burisma allegedly appointed Devon Archer, one of Hunter Biden’s business partners, to its board as well. Here’s a brief write-up on the story from the Moscow Times, an English-language news service based in Russia.

These dual announcements raise more questions than they answer. The prominence of the individuals involved — Hunter Biden is the vice president’s son, while Devon Archer was a major bundler for John Kerry and also his stepson’s college roommate — raises the question of whether the entire thing is a hoax.

1. What is Burisma?

Burisma appears to be a Ukrainian energy company with a focus on oil and gas exploration. However, independent information about the company is hard to find and even harder to verify. According to Businessweek:

Burisma Holdings Limited engages in oil and gas exploration and production. The company also engages in oil well drilling, production of liquefied natural gas, and undertaking geological studies. The company was incorporated in 2006 and is based in Limassol, Cyprus.

2. Is Burisma even a real company?

The company’s website is…rough, at best, and the domain does not appear to have even been registered until 2010 even though the company was allegedly founded in 2002 and incorporated in 2006. And as recently as July of 2013, the website was not even written in English.

Basic information about the business is also difficult to find. Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider noted on Twitter that the company lacked a profile in Bloomberg, an extensive database of business information, and had no Wikipedia presence whatsoever. Businessweek contained only a brief blurb about the company, stating that it was incorporated in 2006 and based in Cyprus.

Is Burisma a real company? Not one mention in the history of Bloomberg. No Wikipedia page, etc. — Joseph Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) May 13, 2014

3. Who is Hunter Biden?

Hunter Biden is Vice President Joe Biden’s son. He currently serves as the managing partner of Rosemont Seneca Partners, a financial and policy advisory firm. He was a long-time federal lobbyist, but left his old firm in September of 2008, before his father was elected as vice president.

4. Who is Devon Archer?

Devon Archer is a wealthy investor and Democratic campaign bundler with long ties to the family of Secretary of State John Kerry. He was the college roommate of Christopher Heinz, Kerry’s stepson, and also served as co-chair of the national finance committee for Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign. According to a 2004 profile in the New York Observer:

Mr. Archer represents a new breed of fund-raiser. In this age, the person with the most connections, who collects contributions from the widest circle of friends and contacts, has become the new macher in party politics.



You could call Mr. Archer a “baby bundler,” a well-connected macher-in-training who has spent every free moment of the last two years tapping friends, family, business partners and even Republicans for contributions to the Kerry cause. Ever since the Massachusetts Senator announced his candidacy in 2003, the dimple-cheeked Mr. Archer has dedicated himself to hosting cocktail parties at old-boy hideaways like the University Club and the Links Club, attending weekly finance-committee pow-wows and dialing, dialing, dialing for dollars. He has coaxed as little as $50 from his friends and cajoled the maximum, $2,000, from his family and business associates. In the process, he has outpaced veteran bundlers more than twice his age and joining the finance committee alongside such finance gurus as Steven Rattner and Richard Holbrooke.



Now his hard work is paying off, with the kind of convention access lowly Hill staffers can only dream of. He has a room at the Four Seasons Hotel, tickets to all the hot parties, access to the convention floor and face time with Mr. Kerry. The convention is his induction into the Democratic elite, and when the bunting comes down and the four-day Boston romp is done, there will be little doubt that Mr. Archer is the Democratic equivalent of a made man.

According to his company’s web page, Archer also serves on the board of the Howard J. Heinz trust and as a trustee of the Heinz Family Office. Howard J. Heinz was the founder of Heinz foods.

5. Did Hunter Biden actually get appointed to Burisma’s board (and if so, did he accept the appointment)?

As of this morning, all we really had to go on regarding Biden’s involvement with Burisma is a press release from the company’s website. When Rosemont Seneca Partners, Biden’s firm, was contacted to confirm whether the board appointment announcement was accurate, the company refused to comment on Biden’s involvement with Burisma. However, according to at least one White House correspondent, White House press secretary Jay Carney effectively confirmed the appointment earlier this afternoon.

Carney says Hunter Biden is a private citizen; his work at Burisma does not reflect an endorsement by the VP or the Admin — Jared Rizzi (@JaredRizzi) May 13, 2014

Politico also appears to have confirmed the board appointment:

Hunter Biden, the younger son of Vice President Joe Biden, will be joining Ukraine’s largest private gas producer, the company announced in a statement

“The company’s strategy is aimed at the strongest concentration of professional staff and the introduction of best corporate practices, and we’re delighted that Mr. Biden is joining us to help us achieve these goals,” Alan Apter, Burisma Holdings’ chairman of the board of directors, said in a statement, which was reported by The Moscow Times on Tuesday.



Biden, joining the board, will be in charge of the legal unit, the company said and will provide support for Burisma Holdings “among international organizations.”

6. What about Devon Archer? Is he actually on the company’s board?

Again, all we have to go on is a single press release posted on the company’s web page. Rosemont Seneca Partners also refused to comment on Archer’s involvement with Burisma. However, given the apparent confirmation of Biden’s appointment by the White House earlier this afternoon, it is probably safe to assume that Archer’s appointment did, in fact, happen.

7. Why would a Ukrainian energy company want Devon Archer or Hunter Biden to serve on its board?

Assuming that they have been appointed to the board, the most innocent explanation is that the company wants to increase foreign direct investment and views Archer and Biden as having the experience to make that happen. Archer, for example, is a long-time investor and financier.

The most disturbing explanation is that the company is attempting to curry favor with the U.S. government by enlisting the services of the close family friend and campaign bundler of the Secretary of the State and the son of the vice president. After all, Archer notes on one of his company’s web pages that his firm’s “relationship network creates opportunities for our portfolio companies which then compound to greater outcomes for all parties.”

8. How does Joe Biden have anything to do with this?

As far as we know, he doesn’t have anything to do with it at this point. However, he did visit Ukraine a day before Archer was allegedly appointed to Burisma’s board. And the White House announced yesterday, shortly before Hunter Biden’s alleged appointment to Burisma’s board was announced, that the vice president would visit Cyprus next week. According to the brief Businessweek profile of Burisma, the company is officially located in Cyprus.

9. This has to be a hoax, right?

It’s so bizarre that you almost have to assume it’s a hoax. It sounds more like a cliched movie plot — a shady foreign oil company co-opts the vice president’s son in order to capture lucrative foreign investment contracts — than something that would actually happen in real life. But the indications as of this afternoon are that the board appointments actually happened, and that a Ukrainian energy company has retained the counsel of the vice president’s son and the Secretary of State’s close family friend and top campaign bundler.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/05/13/9-questions-to-ask-about-bidens-work-with-a-gas-company-in-ukraine/,2014-05-13
Media Would Unleash Holy Hell On Handsy Joe Biden If Weren't Liberal,"Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays a bumbling (but certainly more competent than Joe Biden) vice president in HBO’s “Veep.” There’s an episode in season two where it’s January 6 and she is supposed to swear in senators but just can’t get her act together. She messes up small talk and doesn’t have her head in the game.

Yesterday, January 6, was sort of a real-life version of this. While the man who in real life is a heartbeat away from the presidency also messed up small talk, he was almost too locked in. He was extremely attentive. Particularly to underage girls. And, well, it’s not that big of a deal, I guess, but it got kind of creepy.

To wit (and I might actually mean this Trigger Warning for once: lecherous elderly man creeping on underage girl):

From 1:17 to 1:39 in this video created by the Washington Post (to whimsical music), Biden:

tells an adolescent girl, “Molly, come over by me,” grabbing her hand and pulling her close;

nuzzles into an adolescent girl who tries to keep him from kissing her by moving her head away;

tells another adolescent girl that her grandpop is one of the greatest guys;

and then asks a family if he can have a picture just with their adolescent girl. As her family teases them, he brushes her hair away and gets in close to her.

There were also these scenes:

— Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) January 6, 2015

Now, I don’t think any of these things are the end of the world. That attempted kiss and nuzzling in the video is really cringe-inducing and creepy, but I don’t think it’s going to permanently scar this girl. Many of us had to navigate such uncomfortable situations and it’s part of being human and interacting with others and learning how to avoid unwanted affection and whatnot.

But color me confused.

Just a few months ago we had media outlets and feminist activists praising the #YesAllWomen hashtag campaign that was about all the microagressions and macroagressions women deal with every day, from being told to smile, to being treated as if men have the right to touch their bodies. From a piece I wrote at the time:

Andrea Mitchell reportedly said, ‘Even 140 characters can be very powerful in times like these.’ BuzzFeed declared “’he tragedy in California has stirred a powerful reaction on social media.’ A Washington Post columnist gushed ‘#YesAllWomen: Elliot Rodger’s misogynistic ravings inspire a powerful response on Twitter.’ And Glamour gave examples of ‘Thought Provoking, Powerful#YesAllWomen Tweets in Response to Santa Barbara Tragedy,’ including one that said ‘because when a girl is harassed or even groped by a stranger in public, we’re told to “take it as a compliment.”’

And not long ago we had the media and feminist activists praising an edited video showing some of the purported 100 instances a woman was “street harassed” while walking in New York City. Some of what was shown was genuinely creepy and some of it was more along the lines of “you’re pretty” or “have a nice day.” The activist group that made the video was able to get media coverage in every single major newspaper and news show. It went viral on the Internet.

In November, as I wrote at the time, we witnessed a mob of online feminists harass a male scientist to the point of tears because of his sartorial choices. Dr. Matt Taylor literally landed a mother-freaking spaceship on a comet hurtling through space at a clip of 135,000 kilometers an hour, the first time humans had come even close to accomplishing such a tremendous feat. But when he discussed his team’s accomplishments on television, he was wearing a shirt made by a female friend out of fabric depicting cartoons of scantily clad women.

The outrage couldn’t have been more over-the-top. “I don’t care if you landed a spacecraft on a comet, your shirt is sexist and ostracizing,” read a real headline.The Atlantic reporter who started the “#shirtstorm” (Rose Eveleth) was widely praised for her efforts.

Those who pushed back against the insanity, such as University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds, who wrote an op-ed for USA Today, were accused by feminists of egregious behavior, including “doxxing.”

So let’s look at what the same media that freaked out over shirts and compliments did with handsy/pervy Joe Biden.

ABC News: Why Today Was the Best Day Ever to Watch Biden Being Biden

National Journal: “The Best Joe Biden Quotes From the Senate’s First Day”

New York Daily News: “Joe will be Joe. Vice President Biden couldn’t keep his compliments to himself when he spotted the youthful granddaughter of Sen. Orrin Hatch on Capitol Hill Tuesday. ‘I hope you have a big fence around the house!’ Biden told the girl, Emily, as she joined her family for a photo session with Biden to celebrate the swearing-in ceremony for the Utah Republican.”

CNN: “Joe Biden swearing in senators makes great TV”: “Uncle Joe was born for this,” the article cheerfully began, adding that the day was “full of surprises, outtakes and bizarrely charming moments.”

Here’s how the editor and publisher of Talking Points Memo treated Biden creeping on the teen:

Losing his touch > Awesome Little Girl Rejects Biden’s Kiss At Senate Swearing-In @TPM http://t.co/HOt2iG5yxD



— Josh Marshall (@joshtpm) January 6, 2015

Biden has long been known for getting affectionate and intimate with folks, this being everyone’s favorite example. And Bill Clinton has long been teased for touching beautiful women or being unfaithful to his wife Hillary with them. George W. Bush got a full article in the New York Times when he rubbed the neck of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and she seemed not to welcome it (“The Politics of Good Touch, Bad Touch“).

Each of these examples involves adult women, although two of them involve serious power differentials. It’s not the end of the world that Joe Biden got a bit kissy-gropey with underage girls.

But we all know how the media reacted to Sarah Palin being folksy. They clutched their pearls and lost their minds. They freaked out so much that many are still freaking out over every little thing she says, does, and thinks. (Not to mention every child she loves.)

And if Joe Biden weren’t a liberal Democrat? If he were a Republican (particularly one who wasn’t liberal and pro-choice—like the recently praised by, uh, Joe Biden Bob Packwood), we’d be talking about how he was engaged in sexual assault against helpless girls and how his micro-aggressions encourage and validate rape culture.

None of us can fully imagine what holy hell would be brought down on a conservative elected official who engaged in behavior like this by more or less everyone in the feminist-media-industrial complex. We wouldn’t be seeing jokey headlines. We wouldn’t see praise for the White House putting out a video on Biden being Biden. As if.

When the conflicting standards are this consistent, it can’t really be called a double standard, but it can be called out nonetheless.

"If We Get Donald Trump, Democrats Get Joe Biden","Please run, Joe. Please, please, please.

The news is suddenly filled with reports that Vice President Joe Biden is seriously considering a run for president. I think this is great news on three levels.

1) Hillary needs another challenge.

For a second time in a row, she has planned to be the “inevitable” candidate. But no one should ever be inevitable, least of all Hillary Clinton.

“Inevitability” was always just a bluff to cover up how weak and shallow her base of political support actually is. The problem is not just the usual air of scandal that follows the Clintons (most recently, her use of a private e-mail server to hide official correspondence). It’s also that her own party’s voters regard her as calculating, insincere, and motivated by nothing but raw ambition. The political establishment that supports her does so for equally calculating reasons, motivated by fear or favor.

Some say the problem is that Democratic voters aren’t sure who Hillary Clinton is. I think her problem is more fundamental and much harder to fix. It’s that everyone knows exactly who she is.

That’s why Democrats have been flocking to Bernie Sanders, a bewildered old hippie who really seems to mean all that woozy socialist claptrap. But Sanders is perhaps a little too far out, man. He’s used to being an independent gadfly and not being near the center of power, whereas Joe Biden is vice-president, which is—well, it’s not near the center of power, either. But he used to be a senator who was actually in charge of important committees. So he may pose a more formidable challenge.

The early response to the idea of his candidacy, including some pretty gushy prose, confirms our suspicion that everyone—the press very much included—really wants to see someone other than Hillary Clinton as a contender for the nomination.

But Biden’s importance isn’t so much whether he wins, but whether he blows the race wide open.

2) Because Democrats need another old white person in the campaign.

I’m joking, of course. Joe Biden is 72 years old. Hillary Clinton is 67. Bernie Sanders is 73. The only Democratic candidate who is not eligible for Social Security is Martin O’Malley, who is the former mayor of Baltimore, which pretty much disqualifies him. Joe Biden doesn’t exactly add diversity to that mix, but by breaking up support for Hillary Clinton, and particularly now, well before the contest has really begun, he opens the slight possibility that someone new and actually interesting won’t be scared out and might enter the Democratic race.

Democrats have been gloating about the disarray of the Republicans’ chaotic 17-person race, where the debates are going to be more an exercise in crowd control than an intellectual exchange. With no clear front-runner or heir apparent, this contest has attracted any Republican with an ounce of political ambition. But at least we’ve got a lot of young, dynamic, viable candidates.

Democrats could use some more of that kind of chaos. Don’t ask me who they’ve got coming down the pike, though. The great political disaster of the Obama administration is the way he has managed to win re-election for himself while hollowing out his party, not just in Congress, but on the state level. That’s precisely why they need any new blood they can find to provide some illusion of vitality.

But of course, Joe Biden provides plenty of his own peculiar brand of energy.

3) Biden levels the playing field of crazy.

Here’s the deal: if Republicans get Trump, Democrats should get Biden. It’s only fair.

I’ve already pointed out the similarities between the two:

You know which political figure reminds me the most of Donald Trump? Joe Biden, the famous senatorial blow-hard who turns every congressional hearing into an arena for personal grandstanding, and who is also famously unable to control his mouth. The only real difference between Biden and Trump? One had bad hair plugs, the other has a cross-hatched double comb-over.

Biden is a gaffe-prone and slightly creepy glad-hander with a history of pompous grandstanding, using plagiarized personal anecdotes, and proposing astonishingly bad policy ideas. But, as with Trump, all those glaring flaws are regarded as proof that at least he’s genuine. Here’s Mike Barnicle:

He is, perhaps, the least complicated man in public life. It’s all right there, on display, for anyone and everyone to hear and see, to criticize or applaud. There is no filter, sometimes to his detriment. There is never any pretense. There is never, not ever, any attempt to hide or even disguise an emotion…. Nobody wonders who Joe Biden is.

Well, Trump isn’t exactly a riddle inside an enigma, either. It doesn’t mean he’s going to make a good president, or that it’s a good idea to place in the highest office of the land a man who seems to lack proper impulse control.

But I’ll give Joe Biden one thing: he might actually be more entertaining than Trump. Maybe it’s the flashing whitened teeth and the blue-collar colloquialisms. Or maybe it’s just that it’s always a lot funnier when it happens to the other side.

Will Joe Biden Have To Answer For His Long Record of Terrible Decisions?,"Maybe he’s the one you’ve been waiting for?

So let’s for a moment imagine that Biden is a principled politician and wouldn’t say absolutely anything just to become president—this would be the third time he’d be running for the position. And let’s, for a moment, concede that Biden, after his flirtation with Elizabeth Warren and hiring of new staff, is the sort of candidate that can knock off the front-runner. But then let’s suspend our disbelief and pretend the media will hold the new candidate responsible for his previous positions and votes at least as strictly as they hold Marco Rubio accountable for his wife’s parking tickets.

If they did, they would find that Joe Biden has had, in some sense, more consequential conservative votes on record than any candidate running for president from either party. Or a better way to put it: his greatest legacy is a lack of coherent philosophy and a ton of politically convenient grandstanding.

The one issue that has generated some attention is that Biden authored the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which not only expanded the number of crimes subject to the federal death penalty, but also played a pivotal role in the explosion of incarcerations and the disproportionate criminal prosecution in poor black communities. Joe’s always been a tough-on-crime sort of guy, and as The New York Times pointed out recently

Despite reservations, Mr. Biden, who has served as the Obama administration’s unofficial liaison to the law enforcement community, has not only stood by the 1994 legislation, but has also frequently taken credit for it. As recently as this spring, in an essay on community policing for a book of bipartisan reform proposals put together by the Brennan Center for Justice, Mr. Biden referred to the legislation as the “1994 Biden Crime Bill.”

In addition to the “1994 Biden Crime Bill,” the vice president was one of the biggest proponents of the War on Drugs, taking a leading role in creating federal mandatory minimum laws that have put scores of non-violent criminals in prison. The kind of policies President Obama, Elizabeth Warren, every progressive, and many others have claimed are destructive. Biden also helped create the Drug Czar, a government official that oversees all anti-drug operations. As Biden explained to Time back in 2008, “I am not only the guy who did the crime bill and the drug czar, but I’m also the guy who spent years when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee and chairman trying to change drug policy relative to cocaine, for example, crack and powder.”

On the social front, Biden voted for the bigoted, anti-equality Defense of Marriage Act that has since been found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Biden voted in favor the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy which pushed members of the American gay community who wanted to fight for their nation deeper into the closet. Surely he will be asked to defend these votes by explaining how he evolved to his current position.

Biden has not only come out against federal funding for abortions, but also voted in favor of a 1999 bill to ban most partial-birth abortions, and in favor of the 2003 Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Surely if he supported a bill that protected post-viable babies, he must also support Republican efforts to protect viable babies and believe it’s wrong to harvest a baby’s body parts after she’s been born. I look forward to the Catholic Biden’s clarification.

On issues of war and peace, Biden didn’t simply vote for the Iraq War, he was a vocal proponent of going to war. In 2002, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden said that Saddam Hussein was “a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security.” Biden went on to say that there was “no choice but to eliminate the threat.” In October of 2002, he gave a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate advocating for going to war. How Americans–liberals especially–can vote for someone who, when confronted with most important issue of his age, voted the wrong way? “A dumb war. A rash war. A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics,” as Obama put it.

Before joining the administration, Biden was not only for increasing federal domestic spying programs, but he used to boast that the Patriot Act was essentially a copy of his own the anti-terrorist legislation from 1995. Either this is not true, or Democrats would be supporting the author of the Patriot Act. And Biden was a proponent of expanding the power of FBI wiretaps long before 9/11.

So, as we mock Donald Trump supporters for their ambivalence to the actual policy positions of their candidate, let’s remember that the other party may feature both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Biden’s erratic voting record–he supported the embargo on Cuba, for instance, promising in 2009 that the administration would not overturn it–makes all the sense in the world when you view it in context. When we set aside Biden’s smarmy Mr. Magoo-ishness, it’s worth remembering that although Biden may cast himself as some kind of dependable alternative to Clinton, and he would almost certainly be a stronger candidate than Hillary, he is also an escape hatch for those concerned about the ethical problems of an equally calculated candidate.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/08/25/will-joe-biden-have-to-answer-for-his-heresy-against-liberals/,2015-08-25
The New York Times’ Ben Carson Double Standard,"According to a national poll released Tuesday morning from CBS News and The New York Times, Ben Carson has become the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination. Carson now has the support of 26 percent of Republican primary voters, four percentage points ahead of Donald Trump.

That’s quite an accomplishment for what initially was considered a very longshot candidacy. Some might suggest it merits a modicum of respect—say, by referring to the longtime director of pediatric neurosurgery at the nation’s premier teaching hospital (Johns Hopkins) with the well-deserved title “Dr.”

Yet in the pages of the Times itself, more often than not, Carson isn’t identified that way. In fact, a thumbnail analysis I just did of Times stories using the media tracking service Nexis shows that Second Lady Jill Biden (who in 2007 received a doctor of education degree, or EdD, from the University of Delaware) is more than three times more likely than Carson to be called “Dr.” by The New York Times.

Nexis Survey Says

Through October 26, Nexis results show Carson’s name has appeared in The New York Times 373 times: 356 times as Ben Carson and 17 times as Benjamin Carson. On first reference (that is, the first time he is named in the story) he has been referred to as “Dr. Ben Carson” or “Dr. Benjamin Carson” 32 times, plus an additional 13 times on second reference. He’s been called “Mr. Carson” on second reference 57 times.

The contrast is even starker on New York Times blogs, which are more informal and thus should have less need for honorifics.

By contrast, Biden’s name has appeared 61 times. Seven of those times, she was referred to as “Dr. Jill Biden” on first reference and another seven times on second reference. Only twice has she been called “Mrs. Biden” on second reference. (The Times has never referred to her as “Ms. Biden,” so it isn’t simply a matter of preferring a less patriarchal terminology.)

Comparing those head to head, Carson has been called “Dr.” in 12.1 percent of the Times stories in which his name appears. Biden has been called “Dr.” in 23.0 percent of the stories in which her name appears. Carson has been called “Mr. Carson” in 15.3 percent of the stories in which his name appears. Biden is called “Mrs. Biden” in just 3.3 percent of the stories in which her name appears.

The contrast is even starker on New York Times blogs, which are more informal and thus should have less need for honorifics. Biden’s name has appeared on Times blogs 58 times. She’s been called “Dr.” on first reference 28 times, then once more on second reference. She’s been called “Mrs. Biden” on second reference four other times.

Carson’s name has appeared in Times blogs 191 times (five of them as “Benjamin Carson”). He’s been called “Dr.” on first reference 11 times and on second reference six other times. He’s been called “Mr. Carson” on second reference 66 times—including, most puzzlingly, twice when he was separately referred to as “Dr. Ben Carson.”

Let’s See Some Graphs

Thus, head to head, we see that Times blogs refer to Biden as “Dr.” nearly half the time (48.3 percent) while referring to Carson as “Dr.” just 8.9 percent of the time. She is called “Mrs. Biden” just 6.9 percent of the time, while he is called “Mr. Carson” 34.7 percent of the time.

Putting both the Times and its blogs together, you get graphics that look like this:

So there it is. Biden is three and a half times more likely to be called “Dr.” on first reference and twice as likely to be called “Dr.” on second reference as Carson. Carson is four and a half times more likely to be called “Mr.” as Biden is to be called “Mrs.”

Now for a Quick Journalism Lesson

The simple—and, no doubt, at least partially accurate—explanation for these findings is political bias on the part of the notoriously liberal New York Times. A more sinister explanation could be inferred that Carson’s race played a role. Is there any other potential explanation?

Actually, there is, but to explain it requires getting a bit into the nuts and bolts of how journalists use “style.” “The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law”—sometimes dubbed “the bible of journalism”—sets the template for questions of grammar, punctuation, and style for most, though not all, U.S. print publications. One very notable exception is, of course, The New York Times, which sets its own in-house style guidelines that deviate in a number of key respects from those of the AP.

To casual readers, the most notable difference is the Times’ use of honorifics. Thus, if a John Smith were to be quoted multiple times in a story, the Associated Press would, after that first mention, refer to him simply as “Smith.” The New York Times will refer to him as “Mr. Smith.”

The style guidelines on honorifics also differ in whether and in what way one acknowledges courtesy titles, such as “doctor.” In the “AP Stylebook,” the entry reads:

Use Dr. in first reference as a formal title before the name of an individual who holds a doctor of dental surgery, doctor of medicine, doctor of optometry, doctor of osteopathic medicine, doctor of podiatric medicine, or doctor of veterinary medicine: Dr. Jonas Salk.

Later in the entry, the AP also notes:

If appropriate in the context, Dr. also may be used on first reference before the names of individuals who hold other types of doctoral degrees. However, because the public frequently identifies Dr. only with physicians, care should be taken to ensure that the individual’s specialty is stated in first or second reference.

And finally: “Do not continue the use of Dr. in subsequent references.”

Although the entry does, in fact, permit the use of the title “Dr.” before the name of an individual with a doctorate (a point on which even many editors who enforce AP style sometimes are confused) it clearly discourages the practice. With either type of doctor, the rule is equally clear that you do it just the first time you mention the person in the story.

For its part, The New York Times style guide offers this:

Dr. should be used in all references for physicians and dentists whose practice is their primary current occupation, or who work in a closely related field, like medical writing, research or pharmaceutical manufacturing: Dr. Alex E. Baranek; Dr. Baranek; the doctor. (Those who practice only incidentally, or not at all, should be called Mr., Ms., Miss or Mrs.)



Anyone else with an earned doctorate, like a Ph.D. degree, may request the title, but only if it is germane to the holder’s primary current occupation (academic, for example, or laboratory research). For a Ph.D., the title should appear only in second and later references.

Aye, there’s the rub. The “whose practice is their primary current occupation” bit is important, as Carson formally retired as a neurosurgeon in July 2013. For any stories about him in the months since, during which he was first a motivational speaker and conservative activist, then—for the past six months—a declared candidate for president, it would be in keeping with Times style to refer to him as “Mr.” and not “Dr.”

It’s Not Over Yet

But hold the phone just a moment. That doesn’t let the Times off the hook.

There is, first, the issue that the Times style guide explicitly commands that “[f]or a Ph.D., the title should appear only in second and later references.” Now, technically, Biden doesn’t even have a PhD; she has an EdD. Leaving that aside, as the graphic above illustrates, she’s referred to as “Dr. Jill Biden” on first reference nearly one-third of the time that she’s mentioned in Times articles or blog posts, in direct contravention of the house rules.

She’s referred to as ‘Dr. Jill Biden’ on first reference nearly one-third of the time that she’s mentioned in Times articles or blog posts, in direct contravention of the house rules.

Moreover, the honorific is supposed to be granted “only if it is germane to the holder’s primary current occupation.” Biden is a retired teacher, just as Carson is a retired doctor. (She taught public high school for 13 years; she does continue as a professor at a community college in Virginia.) Her “primary current occupation” almost certainly is serving as second lady, but one could (and Times writers and editors no doubt would) also point to her role as president of the Biden Breast Health Initiative, a nonprofit devoted to breast-cancer awareness. In neither role is her doctor of education degree terribly germane—at least, no more germane than mentioning that a particular CEO also holds a law degree or MBA, which the Times would almost never do.

Even if one is charitable about the many times she was referred to as “Dr. Jill Biden” in political and national desk stories where only her status as second lady was actually relevant, Biden has received the title on first reference in stories from the style desk, on the ArtsBeat blog, and even on the Bats baseball blog. In none of these cases is her status as a doctor of education even remotely relevant.

Incidentally, our prior second lady, Lynne Cheney, holds a PhD in British literature from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. By my count, her name has appeared in The New York Times or its blogs 293 times. She has been identified as “Dr.” on either first or second reference exactly zero times.

What’s more, even if we confine the analysis solely to how the Times identified Carson before he retired, we still find the paper is more likely to signify that Biden is a doctor:

For stories that appeared in the Times or Times blogs through July 2013, Carson was referred to as “Dr.” on either first or second reference 29.6 percent of the time. Jill Biden has been referred to as “Dr.” on either first or second reference 35.3 percent of the time.

That’s despite the fact that Carson, who first graced the pages of The New York Times in a September 1987 story about his successful separation of Siamese twins, would spend at least the next 25 years of his public life known only as a doctor, with no political profile at all.

Finally, I would like to add two other factors that I think likely have some explanatory power: First, many Times writers, knowing only that Biden is somehow involved in breast-cancer issues, likely have the mistaken belief that she really is a medical doctor, and have just never bothered to investigate the matter. Second, many Times editors are, quite frankly, just pretty crappy about remembering and enforcing their own house rules.

Biden’s Career Is A Testament To The Hard Left Turn Of The Democratic Party,"It’s apparently never too early for presidential politics. Right now, former vice president Joe Biden tops, or nearly tops, every poll assessing the popularity of the potential 2020 Democratic presidential field. Biden, reportedly still mulling over whether 76 is too old to run for president, has claimed he’s the “most qualified person” for the position. Considering the players in the Democratic field, it’s difficult to argue otherwise.

Then again, the idea that experience is a determining factor for voters is a dubious one. The past two president have had little policy experience. Most of the Democratic field––at least the senators––has never voted for any consequential legislation. The most significant position, it seems, is how melodramatic a candidate can get about the imagined dystopia of the Donald Trump era. And when it comes to hyperbole, Biden is a heavyweight.

For Biden, though, another question remains: if his history and experience in Washington (he arrived in 1973) is the central argument for his candidacy, why does he spend so much of his time telling us how much he regrets his past decisions? The number of stances a former moderate Democrat has to reject just to be accepted by his party’s base is rather amazing. We’re not talking about inconsequential, long-forgotten partisan fights, either. We’re talking about some of the biggest debates of the past 50 years.

How does Biden feel about his 35 years of supporting virtually every expansion of the drug war and mass incarceration––even authoring the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act? He regrets it. How does Biden feel about his voting to repeal Glass–Steagall, which Democrats like to blame for the 2007 recession? He regrets it. His vote to authorize use of force in Iraq? He regrets it.

Has Biden ever really explained his 1996 support for conservative policy victories like welfare reform to the progressives of Democratic Party activist base? The then-Delaware senator even voted for the iteration of welfare reform that Bill Clinton vetoed. Has he ever really explained his strong support for the allegedly pro-bank bankruptcy bill of 2005 to anti-capitalist progressive dogmatists? Or his vote for an “immoral” border wall in 2006?

I’m sure Biden will regret all of it. Because Biden’s biggest regret is not being president.

When he’s not regretting his past, though, he’s evolving from it. In 2015, Biden gave a speech to a gay marriage advocacy group, only a couple of years after his boss, President Barack Obama, finally decided it was safe to support same-sex marriage. “In 1983 there was a Harvard student making the constitutional rights for gay marriage. I’m going to quote directly,” Biden said, “’Human rights radiates from the constitution, shedding light on the central values of freedom and equality.’ That was the basis of which I took on Judge Bork.”

The subtle dishonesty of this statement is a good example of Joe Biden’s preternatural shamelessness. It’s one thing to say you’ve “evolved” on an issue. After all, Biden will have to claim evolution on virtually every issue. Biden’s smearing of Bork and other judicial nominees is well documented. The ugly tactics the senator adopted are still a big part of Democratic Party playbook, as the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings show.

But Biden’s disgraceful conduct towards Bork came in 1987. Even 11 years later, in 1996, Biden supported banning gay marriage on the state level by voting for the Defense of Marriage Act. In revisionist liberal history, a reluctant President Bill Clinton was forced to sign the law under political duress. In the real world, plenty of Democrats, including Chuck Schumer, Bob Menendez, Dick Durbin, Patrick Leahy, Patty Murray, and, of course, Biden, supported it.

But Biden was so moved by a Harvard student’s statement on gay marriage that it took him around 30 years to change his mind––exactly when everyone else in his party did.

Abortion is another good example of Biden’s shamelessness. Before his vice presidential turn, Biden claimed a tepid pro-choice position that was predicated on the preposterous notion that a person can believe the procedure ends a life but also that it’s not a “political” issue.

Yet, back in 1976, Biden voted for the Hyde Amendment, a law banning federal funds to pay for abortion. (He voted to save the Hyde Amendment in 1993.) Back in 1981, it was the “Biden amendment” to the Foreign Assistance Act that banned any American aid from being used in research related to abortions. In 1982 (via reporting from Mother Jones), Biden proposed a law overturning Roe v. Wade. In 1984, Biden supported the “Mexico City policy,” which bans federal funding for private organizations that provide abortion, advocate to decriminalize abortion, or expand abortion services. In 1995 and 1997, Biden voted for partial-birth abortion bans that would be vetoed by Bill Clinton.

By 2016, the Democratic platform had an explicit call to repeal the Hyde Amendment. Biden supported candidates who backed zero restrictions on abortion–including a presidential candidate like Hillary Clinton, whose position had “evolved” from seeing abortion as “safe, legal, and rare” to supporting state-funding for abortions on demand from conception to crowning.

A constant theme over the 50 years has been that the Republican Party is “radicalizing.” Even Ronald Reagan wouldn’t be welcome in the modern Republican Party, goes the familiar argument. Perhaps the tone or focus of Republicans changed, but the contemporary conservative base supports many, if not most, of the same agenda items it did four decades ago. Deregulation. Tax cuts. Border protection. Social issues.

Biden’s constant rejection of his own record, on the other hand, is a testament to sharp, and continually accelerating, leftward lurch of the Democratic Party. The radicalism on the abortion issue is new, sure. But attacks on basic constitutional tenets are also new. The embrace of socialism is new. The rejection of a border is new.

Biden will be on board for all of it, of course, because Biden is always on board.

Can Brett Kavanaugh's Reset On Sexual Allegations Save Joe Biden?,"The strangest thing about the new allegation from Lucy Flores that former vice president Joe Biden touched and kissed her inappropriately is the timing. This is the kind of opposition research that generally lands just after a presidential candidate announces a run, not just before. Whatever the truthfulness of Flores’ claims, the timing seems to send a message.

It’s not just Flores. Leftist writers like Rebecca Traister at New York Magazine seem to be sending a clear message to Biden. “Jump in the pool,” they say, “the water is boiling hot and will disintegrate the skin off your bones and leave your legacy in ruins.” Many seem to believe Joe Biden cannot possibly survive these attacks, and a year ago that might have been true. But then Brett Kavanaugh happened.

It is easy to forget just how finished we all thought Kavanaugh was after Christine Blasey-Ford came forward with her unsubstantiated claims that she had been sexually assaulted. We all pretty much assumed he was toast, especially when further, even less credible, allegations against Kavanaugh began to emerge. But then something happened: Kavanaugh fought back. And he won.

Biden’s response to Flores is already more Kavanaugh than “believe all women.” He says he remembers the incident, supposedly an uninvited kiss on the back of the head at a campaign rally, differently. His statement also contains no small measure of defiance. “In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort,” Biden said in a statement. “And not once – never – did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.”

Growing up in Philadelphia in the 1980s, just a few scant miles from Biden’s Delaware, I watched politicians like Frank Rizzo, Joe Rocks, and Ed Rendell press the flesh, give hugs, kiss babies and yes, gasp, sometimes even women. Human beings touched each other without terrible consternation. Biden might not have been completely off when he blamed “white men’s culture” for all this touching. Especially for ethnic whites, as they were once known, such as Italians, Irish, and Jews, touching, hugging, and kissing are not taboo, they are part of daily life.

There is a reason Biden’s nickname is Uncle Joe. He has been serving in political office longer than I have been alive, and I’m old. He views his constituents as his family, quite literally. And he treats them that way, which includes physical embrace. What is remarkable about Biden’s statement is that he does not run away from this. Rather, he almost seems to admit that it is part of what makes him him.

This is where Kavanaugh comes in. “I like beer,” he said to the Senate committee that Biden once ran. His defiant face like that of the Covington Kid a few months later was a Rorschach test. To progressive scolds, it read like the embodiment of all the privilege, racism, and sexism they see everywhere. But to more people, it read as righteous defiance, an unwillingness to succumb to the absurd notion that men should sacrifice themselves on the altar of the Me Too movement and like Al Franken just fritter the rest of the lives away as treasurer of the home owners’ association.

Kavanaugh broke a fever in the body politic of the United States. He stood up. He is the reason that the top three Democrats in Virginia, enmeshed in scandals involving race and sex, remain in office to this day. And he may well be the model that helps Biden survive this attempt to cut down his candidacy before it starts.

Make no mistake, the “Creepy Joe” meme, long a mainstay of conservative Twitter, isn’t new, but the need for progressives to dredge it up is. Despite constant warnings from well-respected pundits and politicians that the Democratic Party electorate won’t stand for it, the old white guy who isn’t intent on abortion is leading the polls. Many Democratic voters are obstinately refusing to live in the box of identity politics that their betters have provided for them.

Some believe that a Senate confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice will define Biden’s presumed candidacy for president. This may be true, but it’s not the one most people think it is. Biden will not be sunk by his long-ago committee’s treatment of Anita Hill in Clarence Thomas’ hearings. But he may well be saved by Kavanaugh’s self-defense at his.

Dropping opposition research, like the Flores allegation, before a candidate even announces is rare. Generally it would be used to dampen momentum on the day the campaign begins, as we saw with drops on Beto O’Rourke and Amy Klobuchar. The message to Biden is clear: Stay out of the race. But in all likelihood, that is not what is going to happen. And that’s a good thing.

Like Kavanaugh, Biden seems poised to say that these ridiculous allegations bathed in the holy water of intersectionality will not erase his lifetime of service to the American people. There are many good reasons why Biden should not be the next president of the United States, but his physically affectionate nature is not one. And he shouldn’t let it be.

Lefties Try To Scare Joe Biden Out By Bringing Up His Creepy Touching,"As it becomes increasingly likely that Joe Biden will launch a presidential campaign, the former vice president has come under fire from potential rivals and the woke elite faction of his own party (including Big Media). The woke hope to scare Biden out of entering the race or, barring that, to ensure he makes a bad first impression with voters. The ploy could not be more transparent, but it carries risks his critics may not fully appreciate.

The most severe blast to date is an accusation by Lucy Flores, who ran for lieutenant governor of Nevada in 2014. Flores claimed that at a campaign event, Biden “got closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified… He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head.”

Second- and third-tier 2020 candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro wasted no time in pouncing on the story. “I believe Lucy Flores,” Warren said, adding: “And Joe Biden needs to give an answer.” Castro believes Flores too. Neither would say it disqualifies Biden from running, of course; they are just raising questions.

As Edward-Issac Dovere notes at The Atlantic, there are questions to ask about the Flores claim, if not the ones Warren and Castro want asked. Among other things, Flores not only backed Bernie Sanders in 2016, but until 2018 sat on the board of Our Revolution, a group formed by Sanders’ top operatives to preserve his grassroots infrastructure in anticipation of a 2020 run.

Flores was also spotted at Beto O’Rourke’s first big campaign rally last weekend. In addition, others at the event at issue are questioning whether the incident occurred (although this may be confusion over the specifics of Flores’ accusation).

Notably, the thesis of The Atlantic article is that Team Biden hurt itself by not having more of a pre-campaign organization that could help mitigate and spin stories like this, which is true as far as it goes. But the idea is also too clever by half.

Apart from whether Biden kissed the back of Flores’ head, stories about Joe being handsy and smelling people’s hair are essentially the Kobayashi Maru no-win scenario for his candidacy. Had Team Biden pointed out Flores’ biases, or suggested her unprovable accusation was inaccurate, Biden’s opponents would have stretched the news cycle with stories about how it was proof Biden has learned nothing since the Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas hearings, let alone the Me Too moment.

This is why Biden issued explanations, rather than an apology, about the incident. Any apology on this front would turn into a near-endless series of similar claims.

Indeed, in the post-Me Too era, the establishment media is probably going to be loath to raise questions about Flores, especially if she is a handy weapon in the campaign to stop Biden. Jake Tapper raised some of them.

To her credit, Flores admitted politics were the impetus for her coming forward. She added she found the Hill issue and Biden’s past pro-life stands to be problematic. Flores made it clear she considers Biden disqualified for a host of reasons.

Flores correctly notes Biden’s history of similar creepy behavior is well-established and previously was dismissed as an issue. It was particularly dismissed by her fellow Democrats (and the media), despite their claim to be the party of women’s rights. At the time, Biden’s space invasions were seen as just another eccentricity in wacky Uncle Joe’s repertoire.

Obviously, the Me Too moment has changed the seriousness with which everyone views such issues. But as far as anyone knows, Biden is no Harvey Weinstein, and Flores makes no such claim.

Barring the unforeseen, Biden’s antagonists will be left with a talking point undermined by Democrats’ past acceptance of inappropriate behavior by Biden and other Democrats. So the woke are not relying solely on Biden’s handsy work—which includes not only women, but children and at least one male state trooper—as a line of attack.

Rebecca Traister, writing at the same outlet that published Flores, recently laid out a full-spectrum dump of opposition research (whether she received it or compiled it is irrelevant here). She catalogues a litany of charges, including Biden’s opposition to forced busing, minimal pro-life sympathies, and defender of big banks. Even some of his achievements, like the Violence Against Women Act, are painted in patriarchal terms.

In Traister’s world: “Biden is the Democrats’ answer to the hunger to ‘make America great again,’ dressed up in liberal clothes. The New York Times‘ Jamelle Bouie has in fact argued that Biden’s racial politics have offered a form of Trumpism on the left, a ‘liberal cover to white backlash.’ To that I would add, he has provided liberal cover to anti-feminist backlash, the kind of old-fashioned paternalism of powerful men who don’t take women’s claims to their reproductive, professional, or political autonomy particularly seriously, who walk through the world with a casual assurance that men’s access to and authority over women’s bodies is natural. In an attempt to win back That Guy, Joe Biden has himself, so very often, been That Guy.”

The problem with the woke carpet-bombing campaign—aside from the question of whether much of it sticks—is that carpet-bombing eventually reaches the saturation point. If there were more nuclear charges, one might expect they would have been deployed. Once the woke have identified all the lines of attack on Biden, how are those attacks sustained through 2019 and into the actual primary season?

If Biden is a version of President Trump, the woke might consider Trump is president in part because he was willing to tough out any number of serious accusations against him and his campaign. Although the woke are empowered by the 24/7 outrage cycle on cable news and digital media, the incredible shrinking news cycle makes outrages more difficult to sustain in the face of a target willing to ignore them.

Just ask the top elected Democrats in Virginia, all of whom were expected to resign in the face of two blackface scandals and a claim of sexual assault. All three remain in office, and the stories seem like ancient history, despite having broken in mid-February. Outside the media—social and otherwise—riding out the storm often works.

"Is Joe Biden's Habit Of Touching Women Wrong, Disqualifying, Or Both?","Joe Biden’s habit of affectionately touching and kissing women in professional settings is well-established. He can’t deny it and shouldn’t try, given that he’s long behaved this way in full public view, which also suggests he’s never really believed the behavior to be wrong.

Is it? And if it’s wrong, is it also disqualifying? For all the outrage and the memeing, these are the relevant questions, and they’re absolutely different. As much as I’d like to mock Biden, who seems poised to jump into the Democratic Party’s presidential primary, I don’t want to perpetuate the notion that what he did was either wrong or disqualifying if it wasn’t. Standards are important, and influence the precedents we set. (Democrats might be remembering an ousted senator by the name of Al Franken right about now.)

To the question of whether it’s wrong, one of Biden’s most memorable “victims” doesn’t believe it was. Images of the former vice president’s touchy behavior with Stephanie Carter while her husband was sworn in as defense secretary in 2015 went viral at the time, seeming to perfectly encapsulate the dynamics between creepy men and the uncomfortable female subjects of their misplaced intimacy. But Carter disagrees with that narrative entirely.

In a new Medium essay titled “The Me Too Story That Wasn’t Me,” Carter wrote, “The Joe Biden in my picture is a close friend helping someone get through a big day, for which I will always be grateful.” The implication is that Biden’s gesture was actually comforting to Carter, which is basically the opposite of our public interpretation, and serves as a good lesson in drawing snap judgments from pictures. “Wrong,” then, is not an apt description for his behavior in at least one of the most high-profile examples of it. (Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., has provided another such example on behalf of his young daughter.)

Carter does not speak for everybody. Lucy Flores, the woman whose allegation that Biden smelled her hair and kissed the back of her head at a campaign event in 2014 precipitated this round of debate, said she didn’t believe he had “a bad intention.”

“I’m not in any way suggesting that I felt sexually assaulted or sexually harassed. I felt invaded. I felt there was a violation of my personal space,” Flores told MSNBC. “And it’s been dismissed as if it’s just Biden being Biden. Boys will be boys. No big deal. It is a big deal.”

Flores is asserting behavior that falls short of sexual assault and harassment can still constitute a “big deal,” which also remains a completely subjective measurement. Either way, it gets more to the question of whether Biden’s conduct is disqualifying than whether it’s wrong, as Flores certainly believes it to be.

I imagine there’s a mixture of women like Carter and Flores among the people Biden has touched in this way, some for whom it was fine and others for whom it was uncomfortable, even deeply so. In that sense, I think it’s fair to deem the behavior wrong, because his decision to act this way is predicated on an assumption that it’s okay, which was true of Carter but not of Flores.

I don’t know how many women fall into either of their categories, but I think it’s fair to say men should not assume women in professional environments are okay being kissed or having their shoulders rubbed or touching noses. That’s a reasonable sentiment, and one likely shared by a significant portion of women (myself included). Thus, it’s wrong to act on an assumption an individual woman is okay with it, because the odds she won’t be are high.

But is it disqualifying? The point Flores raised about Biden’s intentions is relevant here. I’m still of the persuasion that character counts in presidential candidates. On its own, an ignorance of personal boundaries, even if rooted in a deeper sense of entitlement or arrogance, is not a fatal character flaw. It could certainly be indicative of one, but that’s another matter to prove entirely. That is to say, Biden’s personal character is perfectly fair game for debate, but this alone isn’t enough to undercut his fitness for office.

All this is worth working through for two reasons: In this frenzied media environment, it’s (1) easy conflate bad behavior with disqualifying behavior, and (2) easy to join partisan pile-ons that contribute to the creation of incorrect standards. Both the question of whether Biden’s behavior is wrong and the question of whether it’s disqualifying provoke reasonably fair debates, but to argue those questions are necessarily the same is not correct.

"With Many Dems Worried About Abortion, Why Is Joe Biden Radicalizing?","Now that Joe Biden is widely expected to formally announce his campaign this month, his record on abortion is under intense scrutiny by members of the Democratic Party and left-leaning media outlets. On Friday, The New York Times’ Lisa Lerer outlined Biden’s evolution on abortion . The article frames Biden’s history as falling short of the current Democratic standard.

What is that standard? Abortion on demand, up to birth, for any reason.

“Some of Mr. Biden’s more moderate-to-conservative stances in his legislative record are raising questions in the party about whether he could win over an ascendant liberal wing eager to impose purity tests around issues of race and gender in 2020,” writes Lerer.

NARAL’s president Ilyse Hogue told the Times that, “anxiety is super high among women across the country,” and that “Joe Biden … is going to have to really get with the times and understand that standing with abortion rights is the middle, moderate position.”

Never mind the fact that abortion to the point of — possibly even after — birth is the most extreme position on abortion so, by definition, it cannot be the “middle, moderate position.” There is no more extreme stance on abortion than what the abortion lobby has turned into the standard Democratic position.

Biden Coming under Fire

Biden is under scrutiny for, among other things, having once voted to let states overturn Roe V. Wade, although he later voted against that. Biden’s spokesman, Bill Russo, defended Biden’s record on Roe by saying the senator had mounted “fierce opposition to the nomination of conservative judge, Robert H. Bork,” for the Supreme Court over 30 years ago, a move he claims was key to preserving the Roe precedent.

Although Biden has struggled to reconcile his Roman Catholic beliefs with his policy positions, he told the magazine America: the Jesuit Review in 2015 , “I’m prepared to accept that at the moment of conception there’s human life and being, but I’m not prepared to say that to other God-fearing, non-God-fearing people that have a different view.”

Biden, Al Gore, and many other Democrats used to oppose government funding of abortion. “It’s not the government’s business,” Biden explained more than three decades ago. He voted repeatedly for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal dollars from directly funding abortions.

Yet he was more pro-life than the hands-off position. The New York Times reports Biden’s stance in 1997 on a bill to ban partial-birth abortions: “‘It did not, as I would have liked, ban all post-viability abortions,’ he said, backing a proposal by Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic majority leader, that would include an exception if the mother’s health was at risk. ‘I was and still am concerned that in banning on partial-birth abortions, we do not go far enough.’”

Not supporting abortion on demand after viability would be an immediate disqualifier for any federally elected Democrat just two decades later, yet if a governor implies children born alive after attempted abortion don’t have the right to live, it’s just another controversy to weather until the news cycle runs its course.

Biden now says “government doesn’t have ‘a right to tell other people that women, they can’t control their body.’” The former vice president’s personal evolution on abortion is a microcosm of a greater shift in the national politics of both parties. Democrats’ radicalism has dragged Republicans down. With a Republican-controlled Congress and Republican president in 2017-2018, they should have been able to pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, but due to the moral cowardice of two Republicans—Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins—they could not. Just three Democratic senators braved the wrath of their party to vote in favor of the bill.

A Shift in Rhetoric and Beliefs

Scientists know more about life in the womb now than ever before, yet Democratic politicians are more radically pro-abortion than ever before, relying on nonsensical philosophical arguments instead of science. Republicans have accommodated the shift, in voting records if not in campaign rhetoric—bringing anything more restrictive than a 2o-week ban to Congress’s floor for a vote would be unthinkable.

Indeed, when do facts ever get in the way of progress? This is a heart matter, first and foremost, but the lure of campaign funding and sheer bully tactics have pressured Democrats to toe the line. The brutal tyrants of the culture of death have beaten the donkey into submission. Instead of pushing for state nullification of Roe like the slavery abolitionists , the elephant is lumbering along behind that donkey like another mindless pack animal.

If science can’t convince people who have access on demand to every expert in the country, as federally elected officials do, would pressure from voters make a difference?

Late-term abortions are deeply unpopular with the public, with just more than a third of Democrats saying they support abortion through the whole pregnancy (22 percent) or for the first six months (13 percent), according to the latest Marist poll . So, two out of three Democrats don’t support the position of the vast majority of their 2020 presidential contenders, or the positions of the majority of Democratic senators and representatives, 81 percent of whom had a 100 percent rating from NARAL in 2017. Democrat-leaning voters have already shown it’s not important for their representatives to have a moderate stance on abortion, so the pressure toward moderation is virtually non-existent.

As long as Democrats can successfully divert attention to more popular policy positions, they won’t have a problem rounding up blue voters who don’t agree with the dominant abortion-on-demand, up-to-birth position. Claims that Republicans are heartless and want to keep children in cages and “take away your health care” are apparently enough to justify voting for an abortion extremist, if indeed Democrat voters bother to frame it as a justification at all.

If abortion is acceptable on some level, then it is not hard to stretch a tacit blessing over all forms of abortion to protect popular entitlement programs, increase federal education spending, combat climate change, or whatever other policy positions are more important to the voter. For “moderate” pro-choicers, it’s not an all or nothing moral issue; it’s some, or some more.

Catholics lean Democrat 44 to 37 percent and, like Biden, are in favor of abortion in all or most cases, 51 to 42 percent. If most of these generally pro-choice Catholics are in the Democratic Party, as common sense dictates they would be, why would they be more staunchly opposed to abortion absolutism in 2019 than Biden himself? Despite his reservations, wouldn’t Biden vote for whomever the Democratic nominee turns out to be, no matter how radical his or her abortion stance? He also appears to be shying away from defending the less radical parts of his record as he prepares to launch his campaign, not turning it into an appeal to religious Democrats.

It’s no wonder. Not many voters who are truly opposed to abortion in all its forms, or even with the traditional exceptions for rape and the mother’s life, exist in the Democratic Party. Only 21 percent say it should be illegal in “all/most cases,” according to Pew Research Center, and that umbrella covers much more moderate views than the aforementioned pro-life orthodoxy.

Given these realities, abortion absolutism almost certainly will not make a difference in deciding the Democratic nominee. Will it come into play in the general election, though? Sixty percent of independents take the general pro-choice position of “legal in all/most cases,” and six in 10 Americans support at least first-trimester abortion.

Party Leadership Won’t Become More Moderate

It may seem shocking to non-Democrats (and even some Democrats) that the party’s leadership has camped out on the far end of the pro-abortion spectrum. Although Democratic leadership is out of step with the public’s opinion and majority opinion within the party on abortion, it doesn’t really matter in itself, because abortion moderation isn’t a litmus test for moderately pro-choice voters. They are more likely to vote for someone who will “protect a woman’s right to choose” than someone they perceive as wanting to restrict abortion rights, which means Biden is at a disadvantage despite his past views being more closely aligned to those of the Democrat majority.

Instead, the probability of the extreme stance of the Democratic nominee being a bridge too far for any significant number of independents is going to depend on how persuasively Republicans frame the issue. Voting against protections for infants born alive after attempted abortion is a pretty egregious act. If the GOP can capitalize on this evil to show how heartless Democrats are regarding the most vulnerable citizens, they may successfully leverage the issue to keep Donald Trump in office.

Once again, however, we come back to the fact that Republicans in Congress haven’t made protecting the unborn a priority, and there is only so much Trump can do in the executive branch. If federal abortion policy is to move decisively in a pro-life direction, a great deal of effort must be poured into primarying lukewarm Republicans in the House and the Senate with true pro-life candidates, in addition to challenging Democrat incumbents.

Pro-life Democrats, of course, should push back hard against the abortion lobby or else leave the party. America will face a reckoning one day for the evil she has permitted and supported in abortion, just as with slavery. Both parties would do well to keep that in mind.

"If He Wants To Win, Joe Biden Should Stop Apologizing","Joe Biden seems determined to blow up his campaign before it launches. The former veep’s recent actions suggest he does not understand the central question of the 2020 primaries or the value proposition of his candidacy.

Team Biden’s trial balloon about naming Stacey Abrams as Joe’s running mate predictably exploded in their faces. Moreover, it highlighted concerns about Biden’s age and lack of wokeness. Fortunately for Joe, this sort of kerfuffle probably does not reach the average voter.

Biden’s apologies for his record, however, are getting more attention and are more dangerous to his campaign. Biden does not seem to understand the 2020 primaries are about whether the Democrats remain the next version of the Party of Obama, or lurch drastically towards socialism and identitarianism. Consequently, Biden is abandoning his strengths to play on the turf of the narrow, “upstairs” progressive elites.

Consider how Democrats like to label themselves:

Republicans identify most with conservatism, Democrats identify most with Obama; Democrats split in ideological identificationhttps://t.co/7NKhd2QsTf pic.twitter.com/kLQP0vVZgp — Matt Grossmann (@MattGrossmann) March 6, 2019

The top choices are “Obama Democrat,” moderate, or liberal. Progressive ranks further down, with democratic socialist and socialist near the bottom. Biden’s brand is clear and generally more popular than those of his rivals.

Many pundits believe Biden will collapse like Jeb Bush in 2016, thinking his poll lead now is simply name ID. They may be right. But that name ID is related to Barack Obama, whose administration is far more popular with Democrats now than George W. Bush’s was with the GOP in 2015. Not even Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib dare cross Obama.

Biden has plenty of goodwill among rank-and-file Democrats. In a recent focus group of African-American women likely to vote in the South Carolina primary, one said “it’s the closest we can get to a [third] term for Obama [without] electing Michelle.” The only attack that registered was the Anita Hill issue.

The focus group mostly dismissed the attacks on any of the candidates the media thinks are a big deal. Again, politics ultimately happens more in the real world than on cable news panels and social media.

Therefore, Biden should stop apologizing. Rather, if and when he launches, he should find the earliest opportunity to say something like this:

“Like all of the candidates in the race, I have apologized for some of my record. I’ve publicly apologized for not running a better hearing when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. And I have regrets about parts of the crime bill I pushed back in 1994. Regrets are the costs of experience. If you think experience isn’t important, take a look at the White House right now.

“Despite those mistakes, Barack Obama took a very close look at me and my entire record, along with other people. Barack personally chose me to be his vice president, to work alongside him making all the tough decisions America faced in the years after the financial crisis. You know, he’s a pretty good judge of these things.

“Now, I know my friend Barack is not endorsing anyone in the primaries; that’s fine. I think he understands trying to play kingmaker can backfire.

“Also, I have learned from experience. This is why I championed the Violence Against Women Act and campaign against campus sexual assault today. It’s why I worked to reform the sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine. I am sure the other candidates feel the same way about their records. We cannot change the past, but we can learn and work to make tomorrow better.

“I know there are people in the media who think I have no business running. But if we’re going to judge people’s records, we should look at how pundits have done recently. In 2016, they told us Donald Trump was not a serious candidate. They gave him billions in free TV time. Then they told everyone Trump had almost no shot to win, which probably depressed our turnout.

“Did they learn anything from 2016? Since the midterms, the media has promoted a few Democrats from safe seats—and some losing candidates—as the future of our party. Our party is a big tent. But our House majority was built by dozens of moderates flipping seats from red to blue all over this country, especially in the Midwest, in states like Iowa. If we want to win in 2020, we must win states we lost last time. I don’t hear the media explaining how the other candidates in this race are going to do that.

“Some pundits claim to know exactly who the base of our party is. But I think Democrats are going to look at my entire record—and others’ records—with the maturity that Barack Obama did. Democrats care more about building a better America than digging through our high school yearbooks. And in the fall of 2020, Democrats are going to want a heavyweight standing toe-to-toe with Trump on that debate stage. And that’s why I’m going to be our party’s nominee next year.”

There are risks to baiting the establishment media, but acceptable ones. Those attacking Biden for being a white man will continue to do so. If he personally apologizes to Hill, they will move the goal posts. The woke faction is going to kick Joe in his gleaming choppers no matter what. The rest of Big Media is going to suddenly realize “What, Me Too?” Joe was always a bit creepy and a gaffe machine. Biden cannot hope to be the media’s darling.

Instead, Biden should remind Democrats why they like him, and everyone else that he is the big dog in the race—because he is until proven otherwise. Democrats love their betas, but when beating Donald Trump is the endgame, the alpha candidate is going to look pretty good.

To the chagrin of the left, Democrats often pick the “electable” candidate against a GOP incumbent. The issue being tested is whether they want to rerun George McGovern’s 1972 debacle instead.

Lastly, voters like authenticity. While Biden may continue to strike woke notes to display his evolution, he generally should run as Joe Biden. If you are Biden and this is your last hurrah, would you want to lose pretending to be someone else?

The Revolution Finally Comes For Creepy Uncle Joe,"“To punish the oppressors of humanity is clemency,” Maximilien Robespierre wrote in his post-French Revolution impassioned defense of state tyranny against the ruling class. “To forgive them is cruelty.” Robespierre, was, of course, the architect of the great terror, where thousands of innocents were sacrificed in the zeal of purifying fire, as every revolution undergoes.

While observing that revolutionary social restructuring, Edmund Burke compared the virtues of a fixed rule of law in relatively peaceful England: “To give freedom is still more easy. It is not necessary to guide; it only requires to let go the rein. But to form a free government; that is, to temper together these opposite elements of liberty and restraint in one work, requires much thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and combining mind.”

In what became the most recurring twist of irony thereinafter, Robespierre was himself guillotined. Talking of revolutions devouring their own children brings us to Joe Biden, who is the frontrunner in the Democratic primary without having announced that he is running. He is also perhaps the first candidate whose candidacy is already toast, even before he starts the sprint.

He seems to be aware of the great danger to his possible campaign, as he’s released a response to the mounting allegations of sexual impropriety and weirdness against him:

Biden is in trouble… two more women just came out to the New York Times about how he made them feel uncomfortable with his physical contact/words. One of them is a survivor of sexual assault.https://t.co/qbbkxdnmrn — Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) April 3, 2019

Social norms are changing. I understand that, and I’ve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That’s my responsibility and I will meet it. pic.twitter.com/Ya2mf5ODts — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) April 3, 2019

As Emily Jashinsky pointed out, “Biden’s personal character is perfectly fair game for debate, but this alone isn’t enough to undercut his fitness for office.” True. Ideally, a candidate’s personal life shouldn’t be more than a consideration, as long as his policies are formidable or even workable.

Cardinal Richelieu said, “If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him.” The fact is, no one is a saint, and we shouldn’t expect our politicians to be, either.

Biden’s sanctimony and corruption, for example, are a far greater threat to the republic than his perplexing olfactory manners around nubile women. But, sadly, that is beside the point. This is a Democratic civil war, come sooner than some expected. And boy, did it arrive in style.

A former Biden backer, Lucy Flores, claimed that years back, when Biden was vice president, he stood behind her and “inhaled” her hair (whatever that means) then “proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head.” The timing of the revelation screams oppo hit, but that is, again, beside the point.

Soon, a second woman, named Amy Lappos, accused Biden of unwanted touching and “rubbing noses,” Polynesian-style. Obviously, the standard question of “why now” arises. Flores, for example, is a professional feminist, according to CNN, and has “challenged power structures” before. The left media seems to be piling up against Biden, with Vox and “The Daily Show” hitting at his Creepy Joe problem.

Biden could have blown it off all at once by not bowing down to the powerful feminist lobby within the Democratic Party. Recent polls suggest American males are flocking en masse to the candidates who are outrightly and often roguishly masculine.

President Trump, for example, commands overwhelming support among working-class men, often without college degrees, who feel that society is changing around them and becoming more feminized, but lack people to stand up on their behalf. Me Too seriously dented confidence in Wall Street, media, and academia, where the Pence Rule (of not being alone after hours with a woman) is increasingly gaining momentum.

One can be for or against these developments philosophically, but it is undeniable that upper-middle-class feminism is restructuring society, and a backlash is brewing. Biden, therefore could have simply brushed aside all his, er, dalliances, and asked reporters why they did not raise these issues when he was VP for eight years. It would blow open the Democratic primary.

But he cannot. First of all, he is a very strange man with numerously documented evidence of weird and baffling behaviour. While it may be debatable whether he intentionally made women uncomfortable or was, for lack of better word, just a bit handsy and awkward, even old-fashioned, he is now being judged by the standards he worked tirelessly to create.

Of course, the benefits of doubt and due process should apply to him as well. But no one worked more to erode due process with regards to sexual misbehavior than Biden himself. During the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court hearing, saint Biden opined that women’s claims of sexual assault should be presumed to be true, prima facie—no question, no reason, no arguments.

Biden was the one tasked with selling Obama-era campus sexual assault measures, and once said that sexual activity requires affirmative consent at all times. Biden was the one to promote preferences for accusers over equal rights for the accused, thereby radically attempting to restructure hundreds of years of Anglo-American jurisprudence, which hinges on the fundamental principle of innocent until proven guilty. He called Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and her supporters “culturally Neanderthal” for championing due process for the accused on campus.

Neanderthal, eh? How’s “Believe Women” working out?

It seemed odd that the MeToo madness took hold in the left, which is traditionally more invested in libertinism. Who were they thinking would be the bulwark (sorry) of moral uprightness, Hollywood? Even Mos Eisley is cleaner.

Biden should have known his time of reckoning would come, and it won’t be from the right, but his own side willing to go all Brutus on him.

Radicalism can vary in nature, but the one thing that remains constant throughout history is that radicals often die in the fire they start. Robespierre was executed. Leon Trotsky felt the cold steel of an ice pick in his head. Lin Biao was murdered. The entire first Politburo of the Soviet Union, including Grigori Sokolnikov, Andrei Bubnov, Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev, were all executed by Joseph Stalin.

The reason is something far older and perverse than ideology: it is human nature. Power, as Lord Acton’s profound and timeless understanding communicates, tends to corrupt. And no one chases power more ruthlessly than leftist ideologues.

For all his revolutionary zeal, Biden is now simply an old Plymouth 1971, and new models are already available for their moment in the sun. Biden should have known his time of reckoning would come, and it won’t be from the right, but his own side willing to go all Brutus on him. Al Franken should have been a warning sign for Uncle Joe.

In a certain sense it is unfortunate what is happening to him, and in an ideal world, he would be judged fair and square, and not on hearsay accusations from years ago by political opponents with a clear inclination towards rival candidates. But it is not an ideal world, and right did not set these standards, and hypocrisy can only be tolerated for so long.

Joe Biden was instrumental as a cynical arbiter of social morality. What he did not realize, due to his revolutionary zeal-induced myopia, that the shoe would inevitably be on the other foot. He made this bed for himself to lie upon. It’s tragically ironic, like a play written by Sophocles, but such is life.

Joe Biden On Anita Hill In 1998: ‘She Was Lying’,"Former vice president Joe Biden repeatedly said on The View on Friday that he believed Anita Hill from the moment he heard her tale of sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas. But he previously told Sen. Arlen Specter that it was clear her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee included lies.

“Not only didn’t I vote for Clarence Thomas, I believed her from the beginning. I was against Clarence Thomas, I did everything in my power to defeat Clarence Thomas and he won by the smallest margin anyone ever won going on the Supreme Court,” Biden told “The View’s” Joy Behar.

But in 1998, Biden admitted to Specter that “It was clear to me from the way she was answering the questions, [Hill] was lying” about a key part of her testimony. The exchange was published in Specter’s 2000 memoir, “Passion for Truth: From Finding JFK’s Single Bullet to Questioning Anita Hill to Impeaching Clinton.”

The issue is important, as the media and other partisans rewrite the historical record about Hill and her accusations. The widely watched hearings revealed inaccuracies in Hill’s various versions of events and ended with 58 percent of Americans believing Thomas and only 24 percent believing Hill. There was no gap between the sexes in the results. In the intervening years, activists have relentlessly attempted to change the narrative, writing fan fiction about Hill, bestowing honors on her, and asserting that her disputed allegations were credible.

On “The View,” Biden claimed, “If you go back and look at what I said and didn’t say, I don’t think I treated her badly. I took on her opposition. What I couldn’t figure out how to do — and we still haven’t figured it out – how do you stop people from asking inflammatory questions?”

Prominent media partisans attacked Specter for asking tough questions of Hill. Or really, just for asking simple questions she struggled to answer. He began by noting that many people had reported Hill had praised Thomas and his nomination to the Supreme Court. These included a former colleague at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where both Hill and Thomas had worked years prior. Another person corroborated the colleague’s claim.

Hill disputed their claims. She also disputed the former dean of her law school, who said she had praised Thomas as a “fine man and an excellent legal scholar.” Then she claimed she didn’t know a woman named Phyllis Barry, who had told The New York Times that Hill’s allegations “were the result of Ms. Hill’s disappointment and frustration that Mr. Thomas did not show any sexual interest in her.”

Under questioning from Specter, in which he mentioned that two colleagues had provided statements attesting that she knew Barry, Hill was forced to concede that she knew her and had worked with her at the EEOC.

Specter then asked about the major contradictions between her testimony to the Senate and her interviews with the FBI. Her testimony with the Senate was much more colorful and descriptive even though it took place just days after her FBI interviews.

Finally he asked Hill about a USA Today article that claimed, “Anita Hill was told by Senate staffers her signed affidavit alleging sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas would be the instrument that ‘quietly and behind the scenes’ would force him to withdraw his name.”

Specter read from the article: “Keith Henderson, a 10-year friend of Hill and former Senate Judiciary Committee staffer, says Hill was advised by Senate staffers that her charge would be kept secret and her name kept from public scrutiny.” Later it said, “They would approach Judge Thomas with the information and he would withdraw and not turn this into a big story, Henderson says.”

Specter asked her if this was true, attempting to find out what Senate Democrats had arranged with Hill. Nine times she denied the claim, demurred, or otherwise attempted to get away from the question. She said she could vividly remember events related to Thomas from many years prior, but couldn’t quite remember this conversation from weeks prior. Specter described the scene in the book, and even interviewed Biden about it:

After this exchange Biden recessed the committee. Biden told me in November 1998, ‘It was clear to me from the way she was answering the questions, she was lying.’ ‘At that point I truncated the hearing and recessed it early for lunch,’ Biden said. ‘I turned to my chief of staff and said, ‘Go down and tell her lawyers that if her recollection is not refreshed by the time she gets back, I will be compelled to pursue the same line of questioning the Senator [Specter] did. Because it seems to me, she did what he said.’ Biden, as the committee’s chairman and top Democrat, would have carried great sway if he had suggested publicly that Hill was lying when she repeatedly answered questions about Thomas’s potential withdrawal by saying she didn’t remember.

Now that he’s running for president again, Biden may be trying to avoid the reality of Hill’s weak testimony or his role in encouraging her to answer the question forthrightly. But in 1991, when Hill came back from lunch, her story had changed.

“There was some indication that the candidate — excuse me — the nominee might not wish to continue the process,” Hill admitted. Asked to clarify whether a particular staffer had told her that Thomas “might not wish to continue to go forward with his nomination, if you came forward?” Hill again admitted, “Yes.”

The exchange was just one example of why so many Americans outside of the liberal media thought Hill lacked credibility. Specter credited Biden’s warning to Hill about her lies as helping her with her eroding credibility: “Hill’s afternoon modification of her morning testimony, therefore, was not only deliberate but calculated to avoid greater erosion to her credibility.”

There were many problems with Hill’s claims, including that the record showed she had followed Thomas from a protected service job at the Education Department to one at the EEOC. The Yale Law graduate claimed she was confused about whether she could keep her job at the Education Department. She’d also voluntarily accompanied him to a speech, and had repeatedly called him with pleasantries. Thomas’ secretary had kept logs of Hill’s many calls. One message simply said she was calling to check in, for example.

Two FBI special agents swore out an affidavit after Hill’s testimony outlining “contradictions” between her interviews with them and her testimony. Special Agent Jolene Smith Jameson wrote, “Professor Hill made comments that were in contradiction with statements she had made to SAs Jameson and John B. Luton.” They also disputed her characterization of how honest they instructed her to be.

The media, who have defended Hill for decades despite inconsistencies and inaccuracies in her story, are upset that Biden didn’t apologize to Hill. “Biden Struggles to Apologize for Anita Hill’s Treatment, Reassure Women,” read the headline for Bloomberg’s Jennifer Epstein’s “news” story.

On “The View,” one interlocutor told Biden that people were upset he hadn’t allowed other women to testify against Thomas. He explained that he tried to get them to testify, but there were problems and that forcing them to testify may have been worse for Hill. He was understating wildly, referring to the last woman mentioned in this summary of problems with Hill’s alleged witnesses:

Hill’s four alleged corroborating witnesses provided very weak testimony. One witness told Committee staff that the alleged harassment happened before Hill ever worked for Thomas. Another witness claimed that Hill had no political motives to oppose Thomas because she was a conservative who fully supported the Reagan Administration’s civil rights policies. This representation was false. Angela Wright, who many claimed would provide similar testimony as Hill, declined to testify because of serious credibility issues related to her motives and her previous efforts to falsely accuse a supervisor of racism.

Much revisionist history has been drafted by partisans who oppose Thomas’s judicial philosophy. It’s true that Biden did his best to help Hill, including concealing witnesses who would have been a disaster under examination. But even he admitted to his colleague Specter that Hill was lying.

Hill’s allegations against Thomas were far from convincing when she made them, and the passage of time has done nothing to bolster the veracity of her accusations. But based on the uncritical acceptance of the revisionist history of the Clarence Thomas hearings, it’s crystal clear that journalists would do well to familiarize themselves with the actual facts of what happened and call Biden to account for his treatment of Thomas.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/28/joe-biden-on-anita-hill-in-1998-she-was-lying/,2019-04-28
Biden’s Alleged Financial Ties To China Overshadow His 2020 Bid,"China has brazenly threatened U.S. liberty, including our freedoms of commerce, navigation, and communication and the life and limbs of our servicemen and civilians. It has sought to chill speech on U.S. soil and influence our elections. It harbors expansionist ambitions that further imperil our liberties and those of our allies. In short, there is no greater challenge for American in the realm of national security and foreign affairs.

At a time in which the political-media establishment’s stated concern over foreign influence in the U.S. political system is paramount, we should be asking one question of every U.S. candidate and official: Where do you stand on China, and do you have any entanglements—economic or otherwise—with Beijing that create a conflict of interest or the appearance thereof?

This issue, largely missing from the public discourse, was raised at a recent meeting of China hawks in the financial community by a former President Trump confidante, perhaps telegraphing a critical campaign debate to come. Aiming his fire specifically at the newest entrant to the Democratic presidential field, former Vice President Joe Biden, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon asserted: “Joe Biden’s gotta come 100 percent clean on his relationship and his family’s relationship with the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] … We need to know every piece of involvement that Joe Biden has had with the Chinese Communist Party, the Bank of China and all the financial institutions in China.”

Biden’s China Ties

The ex-Trump advisor was alluding to “Clinton Cash” author Peter Schweizer’s reporting in his 2018 book, “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.” In the book, Schweizer writes about the link between Biden’s role in U.S.-China policy, and a deal consummated by his son Hunter Biden’s investment firm Rosemont Seneca Partners with the Chinese government. In Schweizer’s telling, during an official December 2013 trip:

The vice president is negotiating a bunch of very sensitive issues with the Chinese, including the South China Sea, trade, tech transfer, etc. Biden is criticized on that trip for basically going soft on Beijing. Shortly after they return to the U.S., Hunter Biden’s firm receives a $1 billion private equity deal from the Chinese government [via the Bank of China]. Not from an American business in China; from the Chinese government itself. It later gets increased to $1.5 billion. We have no way of knowing how much Rosemont made on the deal because there are no disclosure requirements.

Schweizer asserted that this was the first time the Chinese government gave a Western firm access to a cross-border investment fund formed in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone. In the wake of these revelations, spokesmen for Hunter Biden and his partner at the now-defunct Rosemont Seneca, Christopher Heinz—stepson of former secretary of State John Kerry—disputed the conservative author’s claims.*

Bannon tied what he framed as a sweetheart deal for Biden’s son to the Obama administration’s appeasement of China—a line of attack adjacent to one President Trump has started to pursue:

Joe Biden was there [in the White House] for eight years. We had the Munich of the 21st century [which] was allowing the CCP to build those islands [in the South China sea]. And what Obama did [sic]? He … moved one marine brigade to Darwin, Australia. That’s the pivot to Asia. Oh, except, having [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping] come in the Rose Garden, look him in the eye, and on world TV shake his hand and said [sic], ‘No more cyber attacks, no more cyber theft,’ and [then] double down in the next year. Joe Biden has to answer the question: ‘What did you know, when did you know it, and how much money has your family and you personally taken from the most murderous regime of the 21st century?’

This is a blunt question from a political bomb thrower, but that does not make it any less legitimate or indicative of the fact that President Trump may harp on this issue.

Committee on the Present Danger

The challenge to Biden came at a meeting of the newly assembled Committee on the Present Danger: China (CPDC), a reincarnation of the original “Committee on the Present Danger” convened during the Cold War to awaken Americans to the threat from the Soviet Union.

CPDC, led by Brian Kennedy, the chairman and current president of the American Strategy Group, and Frank Gaffney, the vice chairman and current executive chairman of the Center for Security Policy, and comprised of leaders across the political, economic, national security, and media fields, aims to “defend America through public education and advocacy against the full array of conventional and non-conventional dangers posed by the People’s Republic of China.” The CPDC meeting, focusing on China’s “unrestricted economic warfare,” was led by a variety of experts who raised other salient points.

Roger Robinson, a former member of President Ronald Reagan’s National Security Council who helped craft the plans to defeat the Soviet Union economically, and heads a business analysis firm that tracks China’s global transactions, highlighted the threats to national security and human rights that Americans are unwittingly underwriting through their investment portfolios.

Outspoken China critic Gordon Chang suggested that China’s purportedly unending substantial economic growth is fraudulent, and called on the Trump administration not to provide the CCP a lifeline via a trade deal but rather to significantly tighten the screws, including substantially ramping up tariffs and banning the importation of goods and services that have benefited from Chinese intellectual property theft.

Hedge fund manager Kyle Bass of Hayman Capital, one of the few to accurately predict and profit from the subprime mortgage crisis, echoed Chang’s contrarian view about the weakness of the Chinese economy, claiming that his research indicates China is running desperately short of U.S. dollars, which in combination with its massive money-printing, piling up of debt, and command and control economic and political system, indicates impending economic doom.

David Goldman, president of Macrostrategy LLC and columnist for Asia Times, was more sanguine about China’s economic prospects. Goldman claimed that the innovation and technology behind China’s Belt and Road Initiative—spearheaded by telecommunications national champion and leader in the race for building fifth-generation (5G) infrastructure Huawei—illustrates a drive for dominance in a capital-intensive industry that poses dangers for America that we must countenance with a comprehensive response.

Dan David, a money manager who uncovered and blew the whistle on billions of dollars’ worth of fraud in Chinese companies discovered only in research conducted after he had profitably divested of them, fraudulence detailed in the documentary “The China Hustle,” argued that the key to countering China’s malevolent behavior is to speak freely about their illicit activities. The underlying message from all of the speakers was that China is the seminal threat to the United States, and the United States has largely allowed this to happen through our own greed and willful blindness.

How will American Elites Respond?

Notable was the concurrence among the policymakers, captains of industry, and intellectuals featured in the meeting with a provocative narrative: The “Deplorables’ pension funds financed” China, corporate America has served as the “lobbying arm for the CCP,” and Wall Street is its “investor relations department.” Channeling Trump administration official Peter Navarro, Bannon added that while American authorities are now highly attuned to unregistered foreign agents regarding the much less powerful Russian adversary, it is time to investigate those on Wall Street and in corporate America pressuring the Trump administration to make a trade deal at any cost.

America’s elites will no doubt writhe at this rhetoric. But is it because they consider such words distasteful and needlessly incendiary, or because they recognize that political and financial interests are, and have been, trumping the national interest for decades—especially with respect to the rise of Communist China?

If the silence over Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D–CA)’s favorable policies towards China, her family’s profiting from China-linked investments and the Chinese spy on her staff for 20 years is any indication, there is little will in the political-media establishment to grapple with these issues openly and honestly.

Yet if we as a nation truly care about the corrosive, destabilizing nature of foreign influence, should not we be most concerned with the greatest foreign adversary of all? Should not business leaders be presenting a united front with members of an increasingly united federal government to drive as hard a bargain as possible to fundamentally change China’s behavior, and provide real teeth to any punishment should it fail to adhere to a deal, as it has done repeatedly in the past?

As the CPDC’s speakers made clear, U.S.-China policy not only deserves to be at the center of the 2020 presidential election, it must be at the center of the 2020 presidential election.

* After the publication of this article, a spokesman writing on behalf of Chris Heinz asked that we clarify that the claims disputed by representatives for Heinz and Hunter Biden were distinct. Specifically, the spokesman asserted that: “Chris Heinz was involved in Rosemont Capital. Through Rosemont Capital, Mr. Heinz owned a minority interest in Rosemont Seneca Partners until 2015. Despite being misreported, neither firm was involved in the Chinese deal Bohai Harvest RST. At no time have Chris and his family had an interest in or involvement with Bohai Harvest RST.”

Why Anita Hill’s Grudge Against Joe Biden Could Be His Achilles’ Heel,"The rollout of Joe Biden’s third presidential campaign went about as well as he could have hoped. Despite his lackluster performances in the campaign debut video and some of his first speeches since declaring his candidacy, Biden raised impressive amounts of money and saw his already strong poll numbers go up once he entered the ranks of the already swollen Democratic presidential field.

With the current RealClearPolitics average of polls showing him with a 39 to 15.5 percent lead over Bernie Sanders and with the rest of the field only in single digits, Biden deserves the title of early Democratic frontrunner. Unfortunately for him, Biden has a problem named Anita Hill.

Biden carries an enormous amount of political baggage after almost a half-century in Washington politics. His opposition to forced busing for desegregation in the 1970s is heresy in today’s intersectional Democratic Party, where identity politics is the coin of the realm. His championing of the 1994 crime bill that is credited with massively increasing the number of African-Americans who have been incarcerated is just as much of a problem for the same reason.

But unlike those issues, Biden’s Anita Hill problem is embodied in a person rather than a talking point. Since, as Hill recently told The New York Times, she has not been mollified by his recent expression of “regret” (but not an apology) for his conduct toward her in 1991 when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, that could create the kind of obstacle that might be enough to outweigh electability in the eyes of a critical mass of Democratic primary voters.

The Biden lead is built on three elements. One is his near-universal name recognition after eight years as vice president and 36 years in the Senate. The other is his reputation as President Barack Obama’s loyal foot soldier, a real asset in a party where the 44th president is still political royalty. Last and perhaps most important is the belief that he is the most electable Democrat running, something members of the anti-Trump “resistance” value perhaps even more than ideology.

Can Biden Beat Trump?

To Democrats, including many who count themselves as staunch liberals, beating Trump and making the bad dream of 2016 finally go away is all they care about.

Seen in the light of their desperate desire to oust Trump, nominating a woman, a minority, or a gay man who better represents the beliefs of the party base doesn’t seem so important. If Biden can manage to spend the next year campaigning in a manner that will give Democrats the impression that he can stand up to Trump and avoid sounding like the “crazy old Joe” stereotype that the president will pound away at (such as his recent statement in which he said “Margaret Thatcher” rather than “Theresa May” when referring to the current British prime minister), then he might coast to the nomination despite the competition.

Many Democratic voters came of age long after the epic and divisive battles over busing and aren’t likely to judge Biden too harshly because of what he said during the Nixon, Ford, or Carter administrations. The same is largely true for the crime bill that was passed a quarter-century ago.

Those issues also have less power because Biden is not running as a moderate Democrat but as one who is very interested in portraying himself as just as much of a supporter of radical causes like the Green New Deal and a vast expansion of federal entitlements. Although it dates back to events that took place nearly 28 years ago, his Anita Hill problem poses a much greater danger to his prospects.

When Me Too and Anita Hill Join Forces

That is partly due to the enormous importance of the Me Too movement that began to dominate conversations about sexual harassment and assault in late 2017. It was lost on no one that the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh last fall was something of a rerun of the circus surrounding the Thomas hearings Biden presided over. The treatment of Hill must now be viewed as a contemporary concern rather than one rooted primarily in history, as is the case with Biden’s other past stands.

Hill also looms as a threat to his candidacy because Biden is too afraid of the left to defend himself. Although the notion of his cruelty to Hill is now part of the liberal catechism, the truth is that Biden doesn’t owe her any regrets, let alone an apology.

Biden didn’t merely vote against Thomas. The justice and his defenders rightly held Biden responsible for the circus atmosphere in which Democrats brought forward a last-minute accusation to derail his confirmation.

Thomas was looking directly at Biden when he famously said that he was being subjected to “a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” in which unsubstantiated “sleaze” was being publicly hurled at him. Thomas’s impassioned defense of his character and reputation convinced the majority of Americans at the time, and that convinced the Senate to narrowly confirm him.

But over time, as Thomas maintained a dignified silence about his ordeal, his detractors in popular culture and the media seized control of the narrative. In that retelling, the judge’s guilt was assumed. That’s how Hill acquired the reputation as a secular saint who had been sacrificed by men like Biden on the altar of male privilege.

Although the collective memory of the hearings is now one in which Hill was scorned and disbelieved, the senators did not treat Hill discourteously. They did question her closely about her charges; they asked for details. They probed for inconsistencies and asked reasonable questions about her dealings with Thomas and how and why she had stepped forward to accuse him.

That was enough to raise doubts about her testimony in the minds of the public as well as the admittedly, all-male committee. Moreover, as the late senator Arlen Specter (who was Hill’s most persistent questioner on the committee) noted later in his memoirs, Biden admitted to him that he believed Hill was lying.

Is Biden to Blame for Hill’s Poor Showing?

The idea that Biden should have conducted the hearings differently only makes sense if those accused of sexual misconduct must be assumed to be guilty until proven innocent. Biden’s committee didn’t prevent Hill from making explicit and detailed accusations about what she said Thomas had said and done. And the accusation that he denied her right to bring in corroborating witnesses is another myth that collapses upon closer examination. But in the Me Too era, asking an accuser to substantiate or corroborate her allegations is considered to be a form of unconscionable abuse.

That’s why, when Christine Blasey Ford stepped forward to accuse Kavanaugh of teenage misbehavior that could neither be conclusively proved nor disproved, none of the Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee dared pose a single question to her. Even their designated counsel refrained from doing anything more than gently asking about details with nary a question about any inconsistencies or discrepancies in her story.

The reckoning for a culture in which sexual harassment and even assault was not treated as serious crimes was long overdue when the Me Too movement emerged. But the idea that those who make such accusations should not be challenged or that the accused has no right to defend themselves against what they allege to be false charges are parodies of American justice.

The problem for Biden is not just the way the public now views the Thomas hearings, but also the fact that Hill seems to be still burning with resentment at him. Hill is a living, breathing symbol of Me Too who could, if she chooses, act as a personal scourge of Biden that could be greatly destructive of his presidential hopes.

Should Hill be willing to keep speaking out about Biden’s alleged offenses, it will be a far more telling blow than any references to the Thomas hearings, either direct or oblique, from the other Democratic challengers. As her New York Times interview indicated, Hill intends to judge Biden’s performance in the upcoming campaign. That leaves open the possibility that she may choose to personally intervene to make further demands upon Biden, to claim that his responses are unsatisfactory or to give a boost to one of his competitors that could demolish his lead.

In a very real sense, Anita Hill holds Biden’s presidential future in her hands.

The Early ‘90s Called Joe Biden. They Want Their Foreign Policy Back,"In a recent rally, the septuagenarian former vice president flashed his pearly set and declared, to the utter confusion of foreign policy analysts across the Euro-Atlantic, that China is no threat to the West: “China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man.”

Beijing is the world’s second-largest economy, and increasingly isolated due to its revanchism in the Asia Pacific. It is confronting Australia, India, and Japan simultaneously, challenging the U.S. Navy and British Royal Navy every day. It’s returning to Maoist totalitarianism and Chinese civilizational exceptionalism, the leader of artificial intelligence and genetics research, with advanced space warfare capabilities and highly advanced stealth and hypersonic warfare capabilities.

China is a chronic thief of intellectual property, a great power extensively buying lands (and governments) across the world, a manufacturing giant in a trade war, and a great power engaged in espionage, cyber warfare, and naval buildup. Yet, according to the front-runner of the Democratic presidential field, it is no threat to the United States and the West.

Biden is obviously wrong about China. In fact, Biden is wrong about a lot of things. Like Johnny English, it is his job to know nothing, be wrong, and goof around. He has a glowing smile, 1950s social mannerisms, righteous rage at social justice issues to update himself for the kids, and is catastrophically wrong about every single foreign policy position possible.

Let’s start with the biggest position that would come back to haunt him as president. I was a rookie reporter covering the U.S. vice presidential candidates’ debate when I saw the difference between a quietly earnest if wonkish Paul Ryan, and a smug, condescending Biden, with a media fully disposed in the latter’s favor. It was Biden who dismissed whether Russia was a revanchist power.

While one can argue about how much Russia was a “threat” per se, no one would deny that Russia is and will be an adversarial power, and something Biden’s administration not only didn’t perceive, but when informed, dismissed mockingly.

But that is not all. Biden is stuck in time, as the world changed around him. For example, Tucker Carlson writes in his book, “Ship of Fools,” “In the fall of 2002, a total of seventy-seven senators voted in favor of the Iraq War resolution. This included the majority of Democrats, and 100 percent of the party’s rising stars. Two future presidential candidates who voted for the war, John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, also happened to be future secretaries of state. The future vice president, Joe Biden, voted for it…”

He also notes that, during Vietnam evacuation, “Senator Joe Biden of Delaware agreed; he introduced legislation to curb the arrival of Vietnamese immigrants, accusing the Ford administration of not being honest about how many refugees would be arriving.” Vietnamese immigrants, needless to say, are one of the most successful and assimilated groups in the United States, but that’s beyond the point.

The point is Biden never thought independently about what might be good or bad, but said the things the Democratic base wanted to hear. In 2002, Iraq War support was simply good politics, even though now no one talks about it.

Biden also argued for a renewed troop surge in Afghanistan, a conflict that has long transformed from a war to an imperial law and order mission, similar to what the British did in the 1890s, against Afghan rebels in North West Frontier Province. Funnily enough, when the most consequential decision of the Obama administration came, such as the raid to kill Osama Bin Laden, Biden argued against it. Obama, of course, took the advice of his generals instead.

To Biden’s credit, like a broken clock he was right about foreign policy twice. During one of the most catastrophic foreign policy decision in modern Western history, when Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power, and Susan Rice were arguing for toppling Muammar Gaddafi, which turned Libya into a slave trading hub and mass migration springboard, Biden apparently argued against it. He was also apparently overruled and then went on to fully support the Obama intervention, even when he despised Clinton, according to his aides.

Likewise, he was the first one to publicly state that there are no good Syrian rebels, because all are Qatari-funded Islamists. But then he promptly backtracked, genuflected, and apologized. He should have stuck by both, because history could have proved his caution and restraint right. But he did not.

The problem for Biden is much more than that. He reminds me of the grandmother in “Good bye, Lenin!” who fell in coma during the Soviet years, only to wake up after the fall of the Berlin Wall in a unified Germany, yet her grandson must continue an elaborate hoax to assure her that she is still in communist Germany, so she doesn’t have another shock and suffer a stroke.

Biden, likewise, is also stuck in the heady days of early 1990s triumphalism, with an expanding North Atlantic Trade Organization, an European Union that is a prospective trade ally, and the world fit for liberal interventionism and democracy, with a hope that China would eventually be entrenched as a pillar in the liberal order.

Unfortunately, none of that came true, and China is pretty much the biggest rising great-power rival challenge to an established superpower, compared to the history of rising-power challenges, from Sparta to Athens, Carthage to Rome, the Spaniards, Napoleon and Germans twice, to the Brits. There’s an academic consensus about it, and Uncle Joe is wrong once again.

Most importantly, however, he is opposed to his own base. Recent studies suggest, that Americans overwhelmingly, distinctly support a restrained foreign policy and less liberal interventionism and democracy promotion abroad, this stance is even stronger among the Democratic base.

The findings in this survey suggest that American voters are not isolationist. Rather, voters are more accurately described as supporting ‘restrained engagement’ in international affairs—a strategy that favours diplomatic, political, and economic actions over military action when advancing U.S. interests in the world. American voters want their political leaders to make more public investments in the American people in order to compete in the world and to strike the right balance abroad after more than a decade of what they see as military overextension.

Guess who won an election promising just that?

It is a mystery that President Trump cannot transform his foreign policy instincts into electoral support, but one can blame Trump’s poor PR, lack of strict message discipline, and continuous mainstream media opposition for that. The fact remains, however, that Trump is more attuned to a non-interventionist America than his prospective rival Biden.

It is still too early to say what would happen. The primaries and the debates haven’t started yet. While one can be sympathetic to an affable grand-fatherly figure, one should be careful about someone who has repeatedly, to use a liberal catch-phrase, been on the “wrong side of history.”

Joe Biden Pats Ocasio-Cortez On The Head On Climate Change,"It has begun. This week in an appearance with Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, keeper of the progressive zeitgeist, has come out shooting against Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden. Biden’s campaign apparently told Reuters last week that the former vice president was looking at middle-of-the-road options for tackling climate change. To climate alarmists like AOC, such language is approximately the equivalent of killing their puppy.

So, as is her wont, Ocasio-Cortez shot back, saying, “I will be d-mned if the same politicians who refused to act are going to try to come back today and say we need a middle-of-the-road approach to save our lives! That is too much for me.” Setting aside the fact that this week AOC claimed her predictions about the Earth’s imminent demise were just dry humor, but now is back to “save our lives,” this was her first direct shot at Biden.

Thus far almost all of the Democratic hopefuls have at least genuflected to the ideas and ideals of the new socialist wing of the party. Today Biden gave a strong indication that this is not his game plan. Asked about Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks, Biden said, “You’ve never heard me say, ‘middle of the road, I’ve been middle of the road’ on the environment. Tell her to check the statements that I made, and look at my record … I don’t think she was talking about me.”

Let’s be clear, Biden saying, “I don’t think she was talking about me” when everyone knows she was exactly talking about him is as about as dismissive as a political diss can get. Biden is saying to AOC, “You want to have this fight, go for it.” He is throwing the ball back in her court, almost goading her to be more explicit in her attacks on him.

If that wasn’t enough, Biden went on to say, “This idea that I haven’t done anything, take a look at the record. That’s what I’d say. I’m sure she will get the time to look at it.” Oof. This is Uncle Joe at Thanksgiving smiling as he rhetorically shivs his socialist niece over pumpkin pie. “I’m sure she will get around to finding out the facts” is the harshest of stuff, and a clear message from Biden.

Yesterday, Politico reported that Democrats are coveting an Ocasio-Cortez endorsement, currently likely to go to Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. If today’s remarks are any indication, Biden is not lining up with hat in hand for this particular endorsement. In fact, AOC is not particularly popular outside of deep blue enclaves, and while her eventual support may or may not matter in a general election, being at arm’s length from her in the primary is a winning play for Biden.

While every other candidate seems to be jockeying to be the most woke, the most suspicious of capitalism, and the most willing to hand the keys of the government to the far-left wing of the Democratic Party, Biden is at home in the center. And he knows that is exactly where the vast majority of Democrats exist as well.

Both Biden and Ocasio-Cortez sent strong messages. They are not, at least for now, on the same team. While AOC may be right that wildly progressive proposals like the Green New Deal are the future of the Democratic Party, Biden’s massive lead in the polls is compelling evidence that he is correct that it is not the party’s present.

Let the games begin. How this fight turns out nobody can quite know. Except for one thing: it will be helpful and enjoyable for Republicans.

Will Joe Biden’s Black Support Squash ‘Identity Politics’ In 2020?,"In South Carolina, the latest Post and Courier-Change Research poll cements Joe Biden’s status as front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. The former veep leads Sen. Bernie Sanders by 46 to 15 percent, with Sen. Kamala Harris following at 10 percent.

Biden’s success in the Palmetto State (and beyond), fueled to a large degree by African-American Democrats, threatens to tilt the party away from the far-left progressivism the establishment media had assumed will dominate the 2020 primary campaign.

At the outset, consider how significant Biden’s black support is in South Carolina:

https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/1127934501378772998

As Dan McLaughlin noted at National Review, “[South Carolina’s] Democratic-primary electorate was 43 percent white and 55 percent black in 2008, 35 percent white and 61 percent black in 2016. By 2016, black women alone (37 percent of the primary voters) outnumbered all white voters in the South Carolina primary.”

Biden’s current coalition reflects the “upstairs/downstairs” schism in his party between the wealthier, whiter, college-educated elites and the poorer, more diverse, less-credentialed rank-and-file. While most of the 2020 Democrats are fighting over the “upstairs” group, Crazy Uncle Joe is cleaning up with the “downstairs” group, which probably constitutes the largest bloc of Democrats.

Contrary to the conventional wisdom, Biden is not relying on Democrats remaining the party of Barack Obama. The coalition the former president assembled was different. Obama relied on “upstairs” demographics including the college-educated, woke progressives, and younger voters. Biden’s “downstairs” coalition skews much more to older voters.

What Biden shares with Obama is goodwill with black voters. The reflexive reaction would be to assume Biden merely inherited black support from the first black president. The reality is likely more complicated than that.

A recent New York Times story on black voters in South Carolina captures some of the ideological debate existing even within this demographic (some of it generational). But in addition to Biden’s association with Obama, black voters historically have been at least as pragmatic as ideological. (Even the far left recognizes this.)

As one voter told the NYT: “Trump casts a shadow of uncertainty, while Joe Biden is security.” In primaries, black Democrats also have tended to favor “safer” choices like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. It is often forgotten that Hillary polled well against Obama with black voters in the 2008 cycle until he beat her in the very pale state of Iowa and almost won the similarly pasty state of New Hampshire.

Biden’s current lead in Iowa is only a few points; his low double-digit lead in New Hampshire remains narrower than in South Carolina. But if Biden wins either of those early contests, his current black support would make him tough to beat.

McLaughlin again has sobering numbers. By next March 17, five weeks after New Hampshire, “64 percent of the delegates will have been chosen. Some 93 percent of those delegates will be selected by primaries, not caucuses; 46 percent of the delegates through March 17 will be chosen by states likely to have majority-nonwhite electorates, and another 22.6 percent by states where white voters are likely to be below 70 percent. This is not Bernie Country. If he hasn’t shown overwhelming strength in the first two primaries, he’s going to find himself swimming against the tide.”

Indeed, since Biden’s entry in the race, things have gotten worse for Bernie. Even a glance at the current Real Clear Politics national poll average for the Democratic nomination shows Biden rocketing while Sanders slumps. However, Bernie’s decline is not primarily due to black voters (with whom he’s doing better than in 2016, though that is a low bar). Rather, whites without college degrees, who were a mainstay of Bernie’s support in 2016, are moving over to Biden.

As a result, Bernie has become more of an “upstairs” candidate at a time when the “upstairs” pool of voters is split among the rest of the candidates not named Biden. So far, Bernie’s appeal “upstairs” has a ceiling because the old-school socialist has declined to wallow in the wokest forms of identity politics.

To beat Biden, someone will have to attract a critical mass of not only the Democrats’ “upstairs” pool, but also the party’s nonwhite voters, particularly blacks (other nonwhite demographics tend to be smaller and more heterogeneous politically). To date, Sanders seems unlikely to accomplish the second part.

Harris conceivably could rebuild the Obama coalition, but has come off as a pure “upstairs” candidate. She may need to win or finish strong in Iowa or New Hampshire to convince nonwhite voters she is a safe choice who can win. Biden’s remaining rivals—particularly Pete Buttigieg—fare so poorly with nonwhites to date that they seem every bit the longshots the top lines of the polls suggest.

Given this landscape, the field is left hoping Crazy Uncle Joe blows himself up, which has not happened so far, in part because his staff is trying to give him the scripted campaign of a vice-president. Even assuming Biden does let a few gaffes fly along the trail, one lesson of President Trump’s success may be that ordinary voters care about gaffes much less than journalists do.

Another lesson of 2016 may be that the front-runner sometimes remains the front-runner. Biden is the best-known of the field and he is not polling like Jeb Bush. Identity politics is increasingly popular within the Democratic Party, but the fact that the field has overwhelmingly pitched itself to the “upstairs” faction makes it less likely any of Biden’s rivals can assemble the coalition needed to beat him.

Why His Support For The 1994 Crime Bill Won’t Hurt Joe Biden — Yet,"Yesterday, President Trump took to Twitter to deride Joe Biden for his work on the 1994 Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act. Trump insinuated that Biden’s support of the bill, which imposed steep sentencing guidelines and some of Biden’s presidential opponents have criticized, would keep black voters from supporting him.

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1133139717069910017

It’s hard to understand the president’s exact political motivation here. Maybe he thinks the crime bill is a serious stumbling block for Biden in the primary and wants to elevate it as an issue, playing political adviser to Biden’s opponents, as it were. Maybe he thinks he can force Biden to double down on his support of the crime bill, and alienate the social justice wing of the party in a general election. Maybe he’s just stirring the pot.

Whatever he’s doing, the crime bill is not going to take Biden down. Not yet, anyway.

The reason Biden is safe on this front is generational. Basically, if you are more than 40 years old, you might think the bill was draconian, but you can remember how bad the crime crisis was in 1994. If you are younger than 40, and have no such recollection, it may very well seem like a needless and reactionary measure. Most of the electorate is older than 40. They have a context for Biden’s choice that makes it seem, even if one disagrees with it, entirely understandable.

Pollster Frank Luntz weighed in on this question in response to me on Twitter today.

In 1994, violent crime had hit a 30-year high. A tougher approach was demanded by leaders across the board, regardless of political affiliation. 👉🏻 https://t.co/WFZ3ANMohR https://t.co/zO225BLhhH — Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) May 28, 2019

And he’s right. In 1993, for example, there were more than 2,400 murders in New York City. Last year there were 289. It is impossible to explain to a 30-year-old what 1993 New York City was like — don’t get me wrong, I still loved it, and moved there — but it was often legitimately frightening. This was a pattern seen all across the country. And the voters were demanding solutions.

There is widespread disagreement about how effective the crime bill and New York City’s “broken windows” policing methods were in the staggering crime rate drop that followed their enforcement. I won’t litigate that here, except to say that whatever role they played, violent crime dropped dramatically. The important point is that whether they worked or not, people understand why they were adopted, and they had broad public and political support across demographic boundaries.

This will be Biden’s play: “It was a crisis,” “The public demanded action,” “It had broad support, including among black politicians.” For the vast majority of voters of all ages, this makes sense and makes his support of the bill into something of a nothingburger. In terms of the Democratic primary, this line of attack seems unlikely to leave much of a mark. But the general election is a different story.

If, as may have been Trump’s hope, Biden has to double down on his defense of the bill, it will anger parts of the far-left Democratic base. I think Trump is either wrong, or trying to be edgy about whom those voters are. It’s not black voters that the crime bill is likely to influence, it is white progressives, who make up the vast majority of far-left New Progressives. But this can still work in Trump’s favor. Frankly, it’s reminiscent of what happened to Hillary Clinton, who could not bring along enough Sanders voters to beat Trump.

Trump’s tweet is his most powerful direct intervention into the Democratic primary to date. It is a reality show challenge. How will each contestant deal with it? Will a desperate single-digit long shot take up the president’s critique and call Biden unfit? Or will one of them try to appeal to the center by getting Biden’s back? Bernie Sanders also voted for the bill as a member of Congress, so how does that affect the game?

One of the more telling moments of the 2016 election was when Bill Clinton, apparently against his advisors’ wishes, engaged a young Sanders supporter in a diner in New Mexico who criticized his administration. At one point, Bubba said, “If you never have to make a decision, then you can go back to the past and cherry pick everything[for a narrative] that is blatantly false.” It was an awkward moment for the Hillary Clinton campaign that wished to divorce itself to some degree from Bill’s legacy.

But what if that was a mistake by Hillary’s team? What if it was the same mistake Al Gore made? What if lots and lots of people, including Democrats who aren’t on CNN or Twitter, still believe Clinton was a good president? Then Biden might be making a very shrewd choice to defend the 1990s Democratic Party in the primary.

But for some progressives it might be a bridge too far. And that is why Trump wants this to be an issue.

Why Joe Biden’s Moderate Abortion Stance Will Help Him,"There is one central bet that underlies Joe Biden’s candidacy for the presidency. What he is wagering is that the majority of Democratic voters are far more moderate politically than Twitter and television talking heads would have us believe. Amazingly, he is the only major candidate pushing his chips over this platform, while the others compete to outwoke each other. This week, Biden further solidified his position as the race’s sole moderate, this time on the abortion issue.

Progressives were outraged when Biden announced that he still supports the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortion. No other major candidate supports the law, which Hillary Clinton removed from the Democratic Platform in 2016. Immediately pundits began pondering whether this position will estrange Biden from the Democratic base, which for some reason they think is hyper-progressive in general, and especially regarding abortion.

But the numbers don’t actually back up this assessment. According to a Marist poll reported on by National Review back in February, reaction to New York state’s extreme “abortion until birth” law and attempts to pass such a law in Virginia pushed many Democrats into the pro-life camp.

According the poll, the “most striking data shows that the shift in public opinion on abortion is being driven primarily by Democrats, especially younger ones. In January, only 20 percent of all Democrats self-identified as pro-life; the new poll found that percentage has jumped to 34 percent.”

We have to look at this with a couple of reservations, as it’s only one poll, and the terms “pro-life” and “pro-choice” contain a multitude of attitudes and positions. But it does seem to indicate that a large number of Democrats share Biden’s positions that there should be reasonable limits on abortions. In fact, it is very likely that most Democratic voters share his moderate (at least for a Democrat) views on the issue.

But beyond the number crunching there is something else unique about Biden’s approach to abortion. In her 2014 book “Pro,” Katha Pollitt posits that abortion, far from being a tragedy that must sadly be allowed at times, is rather a “social good” to be celebrated. Pollitt writes, “It is an essential option for women—not just ones in dramatic, terrible, body-and-soul-destroying situations, but all women—and thus benefits society as a whole.”

This has become the dominant position among progressives, and one many in the media seem to believe is widely shared among Democratic voters, but is it? A poll of New Yorkers (a solidly blue state) taken after the state passed its abortion law found that 75 percent opposed abortion after 20 weeks. But why? That question gets to the heart of the abortion debate and of Biden’s strategy on the issue.

Presumably, so many people oppose abortion after 20 weeks because they know it means that a viable human being is being destroyed. It is a line, albeit a blurry one; after all, what exactly changes between 19 and 20 weeks, that allows those who believe in limited access to abortion to rationalize their support for something they know on some level is wrong?

Joe Biden is gambling that this is still the position of most Democrats, not Pollitt’s celebratory view of the practice. And he is almost certainly right. Furthermore, far-left progressives who share Pollitt’s view are probably unlikely to be Biden supporters anyway, since they tend to have more progressive views on other issues, as well.

Joe Biden is running a safe campaign—a luxury that being the frontrunner affords him. He is offering to take America home, back to a place before the discord and yelling and Twitter rants. This moderate, or compromising, position on abortion is of a piece with this overall approach. He is your parents’ Democrat and he’s not shy about it. This is why he is more “safe, legal, and rare,” than “shout your abortion.”

The great mystery of the 2020 Democratic primary is why Biden is all alone in the moderate lane. Perhaps politicians and the media simply became mesmerized by flashy progressive figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and forgot that she and her ilk did absolutely nothing to flip the House of Representatives—that work was done by moderates in swing districts who appeal to exactly the same voters as Biden.

On abortion, and on other issues, Biden is derided as being “middle of the road Joe.” But there’s something to remember about the middle of the road: It’s where most of the voters are.

Biden’s Reversal On Taxpayer-Sponsored Abortions Puts Blood In Water,"Former vice president Joe Biden has been campaigning with the confidence of a man who currently holds a 16.8 percent lead in the Real Clear Politics average of polls for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has mostly avoided venues where he might have a hostile audience — like the California Democratic Convention last week where John Hickenlooper was booed for criticizing socialism and praising pragmatism — and tried to avoid being entangled in questions of impeachment or the details of his proposals on health care.

His lead is built on three elements. One is name recognition. The second is his status as the stand-in for President Barack Obama, whom he served for eight years and whose presidency is now viewed as a lost golden age by despairing Democrats who are still coming to grips with the fact that Donald Trump is president of the United States. The third is the belief that Biden’s moderation compared to his competition in the primaries and his ability to connect with the working-class voters who helped elect Trump makes him the Democrat most likely to beat Trump in 2020.

But the problem with the latter is that while Biden would like to act as if the nomination is in the bag in order to concentrate on winning back Trump defectors, the Democratic primary race’s tone and issues are still being set by the party’s left-wing base. In a party increasingly intolerant of any deviations from leftist orthodoxy on any number of topics, that means even frontrunners dare not try to defy the activists who have a disproportionate say in determining the nomination.

Length of Career a Liability as Democrats Get Extreme

Given that Biden has been a reliable lefty for most of his career, that ought not be too much of a problem. But the length of that career — dating back a staggering 47 years ago to when he was first elected to the U.S. Senate from Delaware — has provided Biden an equally staggering amount of baggage from various stands and controversies he has dealt with over the course of five decades.

The includes his alleged responsibility for abusing Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings, his role in passing the 1995 crime bill that is blamed for incarcerating a disproportionate number of African Americans, and his opposition to forced busing to integrate schools. The latest piece of his legacy to jump up and bite him is his support for the Hyde Amendment.

That measure, named for the late Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and which forbids federal funding for abortions, has been on the books since 1976. Biden has always supported it. That was consistent with his longstanding efforts to represent the views of moderate and conservative Democrats who may have made their peace with the Roe v. Wade decision but didn’t want to be compelled to pay for abortions.

But the days of being able to reach out to that key constituency are over for Biden. Faced with a tremendous backlash after he recently reaffirmed his support for Hyde, Biden backed down this week and said he no longer supported the measure.

It was an act of sheer political expediency that showed Biden and his handlers know they cannot allow him to be vulnerable on issues on which the base will tolerate no dissent. Abortion is probably the one issue that motivates that base more than any other. That means the difficult balancing act that moderate Catholic Democrats have been forced into, during which they state they will not impose their personal support for life on others, is probably no longer viable.

The pro-abortion lobby’s dominance within the Democratic Party is nothing new. But the passage of more restrictive abortion laws in some conservative states as well as the adoption of measures in liberal states that allow children born after an unsuccessful abortion to be killed has fired up the left in way that eclipses their past efforts.

Without full and enthusiastic support for abortion, no Democratic nominee next year can hope to win the votes of the liberal activists and women — especially minority women — who will have an outsized say in determining the outcomes in early primary states. Biden might have preferred to retain some ambiguity about his pro-choice stance in order to appeal to socially conservative general election voters who like Democrats’ message on entitlements and economics. But he knew the only way to get to the general election was to cut his losses and reverse himself on Hyde. Will that be enough to satisfy the left?

Joe Biden’s Flip-Flop Puts Blood in the Water

The problem with Biden’s decision is that it was so blatantly political in nature that it still leaves his opponents plenty of room to outflank him on the left on abortion. Although his campaign has gone smoothly until now, its handling of Hyde was a mess. This should have been done before, or at least have been shown as the result of a process. But his abrupt and awkward decision to “evolve” on federal funding for abortion makes it clear that he was only doing it because he feared sticking to the position he had held for many years.

While a Sister Souljah moment in which he can show his independence from the party base would be the best thing he could do to wrong-foot Trump next year, Biden clearly feels it isn’t possible yet. Given the swiftness of his decision to succumb to the left-wing mob, it may never come.

The problem here is not just that this reminded political veterans of the Biden whose previous attempts to run for president were amateurish flops. It’s that this won’t be the last time Biden will feel he has no choice but to run harder to the left to fend off his Democratic rivals.

Just as important is that this demonstration of weakness will only embolden other Democrats to hit him harder on other points of vulnerability, such as Anita Hill and the crime bill. He’s already repented of his past “sins” on those points, but that doesn’t mean anyone on the left will let him forget them.

With eight months to go until the first votes are cast in Iowa, Biden would prefer to think about how he can run out the clock on his left-wing rivals. But in addition to demonstrating the kind of weakness that will already encourage his opponents to start banging away at his record, Biden has also just handed Republicans another cudgel with which to attack him if he does eventually succeed in securing the nomination.

Biden needs to confront Trump as a confident moderate, even if his moderation is only credible in comparison to his left-wing Democratic rivals. But a weak Biden who is afraid to cross those angry and ideological Democrats who don’t like the idea of nominating a compromise is a man who just began to exude fear.

Unless he steadies himself, it won’t be just other Democrats who will smell the uncertainty on him. Biden’s flip-flopping will provide Trump with exactly the kind of target that will give him a chance to defeat the Democratic frontrunner.

Don’t Assume Biden’s Abortion Flip-Flop Will End His Campaign,"Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, abandoning a position he held for decades, now supports taxpayer-funded abortion. Moreover, as flip-flops go, this one was executed almost as clumsily as could be imagined, given the sensitivity of the issue. But Biden’s flip does not mean his campaign is about to flop, as the conventional wisdom suggests.

The immediately accepted line on Biden’s newfound opposition to the Hyde Amendment (language included in spending bills to ban taxpayer-funded abortion) was well-stated by Jonathan S. Tobin here at The Federalist: “[W]hile Biden would like to act as if the nomination is in the bag in order to concentrate on winning back Trump defectors, the Democratic primary race’s tone and issues are still being set by the party’s left-wing base. In a party increasingly intolerant of any deviations from leftist orthodoxy on any number of topics, that means even frontrunners dare not try to defy the activists who have a disproportionate say in determining the nomination.”

In addition, Biden’s switch is said to undermine two of the pillars of his candidacy. What good is Biden’s experience if he distances himself from it? (This is a point I argued even before Biden entered the race.) And what value is Biden’s “authenticity” if he flips on a long-held position on one of the most important moral issues of our time?

But however morally objectionable Biden’s flip-flop is, there is a political case to be made for it. Granted, the Hyde Amendment is popular in a general election. Yet pro-life voters were never going to pull the lever for the already pro-choice Biden in November 2020.

Conversely, Democrats have not cared about their leadership making even larger flips to support abortion since the days of Ted Kennedy and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. To the contrary, people generally approve when a candidate flips in their direction; the left’s continuing attacks are the tell that something more is at play.

Biden will not be the general election candidate if he does not win the primary. Opposing the Hyde Amendment is popular with Democrats (although the margin varies from poll to poll). As Josh Krashuaar observes: “this was the worst possible issue for Biden to break with the base of his party,” adding that “[u]nlike other policy priorities on the Left—from the Green New Deal to government-run health insurance—support for abortion rights is a bedrock principle for most Democrats, liberal and moderate alike.”

From this perspective, Biden’s flip reflects the left’s weakness as much as its strength. Biden is not offering the left a single-payer “Medicare for all” plan. He is not offering them Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s version of the Green New Deal, caring precisely enough about the environment to cut-and-paste together a cut-rate proposal from special interest groups.

As a general election candidate, Biden would have to offer the left something to unify his party. What he is offering them is only something every Democratic nominee since Bill Clinton has offered them (and neither Clinton nor Barack Obama fought for once in office). He is offering them something that Planned Parenthood Federation of America and NARAL Pro-Choice America are not pushing to get from a Democrat-controlled House, where the proposal has little support.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is likely to allow a vote on the issue only if she is sure it would lose. The last thing Pelosi wants is for Democrats to be seen shutting down the government over something as unpopular as taxpayer-funded abortion. It is simply not the hill on which Democrats want to abort themselves.

The intensity of the response to Biden’s flip is due in part to the intensity of the emotions on both sides of the issue. But the response also says something about the desire to impose a particular narrative on the Democratic primaries.

Before Biden entered the race, there was a significant effort on the left and its friendly media to scare him out of the race. The conventional wisdom was that Biden would collapse upon entry. Although his support has dropped a few points under sustained attacks, he remains in the lead and roughly five points ahead of when he entered.

Accordingly, the conventional wisdom shifted to grudgingly accepting Biden was not going away, but predicting and hoping he might destroy himself. The coverage and commentary regarding Biden’s abortion flip (and the kerfuffle about his staff plagiarizing policy positions) represents an attempt to will this new conventional wisdom into reality.

The “Crazy Uncle Joe destroys himself” narrative would please left-wing activists for whom Biden’s success is a crushing reminder of the limits of their influence. It is also a narrative that pleases the right, who would much prefer Democrats repeat the colossal blunder of 1972 by nominating a more radical candidate to run against President Trump.

Having largely proven the conventional wisdom wrong so far, no one should be shocked if Biden resists the pressure to comprehensively capitulate to the left and destroy his own campaign.

Biden Was More Than ‘Civil’ With Segregationists. He Was An Ally,"Presidential hopeful Joe Biden got himself into trouble this week defending his relationship with pro-segregationist senators James O. Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia at New York fundraiser. “At least there was some civility,” the former vice president explained. “We got things done. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done.”

Biden was attempting to liken contemporary Republicans to 1970s-era Southern racist Democrats while also highlighting his history of bipartisan compromise. Although his comments were a political miscalculation, nowhere was the former vice president “waxing nostalgic” nor “fondly” remembering either of those lawmakers in his speech, despite the contentions of progressives, presidential candidates, and some in the media.

Then again, it’s fair to point out that the historic record shows Biden was far more than merely “civil” with segregationists. His early interactions can be more accurately described as obsequious. Biden hadn’t negotiated with political rivals to push bipartisan policy. He had worked with members of his own party—run by men who placed him in positions of power—on issues they agreed on.

Judging from the Senate transcripts and interviews of the time, it’s clear that Biden was an all-star opportunist. After watching the former Delaware senator shed 50 years of positions in the past few years, this should come as no surprise.

In 1973, Democratic Party leadership was teeming with unsavory Southern senators. If a freshman like Biden—who in a 1974 Time magazine profile admitted “to being compulsively ambitious”—wanted a plum committee position, he would be compelled to approach someone like J. William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, a segregationist and anti-Semite who would later become a mentor to the Clintons. (Bill awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993 and Hillary still had her name on a shared fellowship in 2016—although no one seemed to mind very much).

And if Biden wanted to be on the judiciary committee, he would have to get along with Eastland, the “Voice of the White South,” who was chair and president pro tempore of the Senate. The stories about their chummy relationship aren’t new; Biden has been repeating them for decades.

“Eastland was particularly anxious to mentor young members,” J. Lee Annis notes in his book, “Big Jim Eastland: The Godfather of Mississippi.” “One favorite over the last term was Joseph Biden, who then was best known for having lost his wife and young daughter in an automobile accident.”

Eastland took an interest in Biden because the young senator shared his position on busing, one of the most contentious racial policy fights of the early 1970s. It was during this time that busing had turned working-class, union-heavy white areas like South Boston—the kind of district that launched Biden’s political career—into “war zones.” At the time there was “intense public disapproval of busing,” according to The New York Times. A 1974 Gallup poll, for example, only 15 percent of whites favored the policy, and 75 percent were against.

Biden, according to Annis, showed Eastland “considerable deference” towards the Mississippi senator not because he was the key to freshman’s political ambitions but also an ally in the busing fight. Biden admits as much years later in his own 2008 book, “Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics.” Eastland wasn’t just a powerful senator, Biden points out, but ran the committee “that handled all crime legislation, a committee on which I badly wanted to serve.” Until very recently, of course, Biden took great pride in being a tough-on-crime Democrat.

“I started by asking him questions. He was proud of his standing as the longest-serving senator and of his reputation as a keeper of the institutional flame,” Biden goes on to write, “I think he was flattered by the deference I showed him, and his answers to my questions often surprised me.” (Italics mine.)

All that deference would pay off. Eastland and Fulbright assigned Biden seats on both the judicial committee and, although he had absolutely no related experience, on the foreign relations committee. This afforded Biden a head start in his Senate career; a position that many other senators, perhaps less inclined to suck up to segregationists, were not given.

Eastland and Biden had hit it off so well, in fact, the elder senator offered to come to Delaware to help the freshman senator get reelected. “I’ll campaign for ya or against ya, Joe. Whichever way you think helps you the most.”

Now, it’s also true that the debate over busing was more complicated than revisionists suggest. Biden argued that the policy was often ham-fisted and ineffective. He framed his opposition as an effort to stop a failed program, rather than one meant to stop the integration of schools.

But, by any standard, Biden was not on the liberal side of the issue. In fact the senator was still fighting against busing four years after Eastman had already left the Senate. And he was still pretending to be a civil rights hero.

“Let me tell you one little thing,” Biden lectured a professor in a 1981 about the constitutionality of busing. “Joe Biden used to be a county councilman. Joe Biden ran in the year 1972 at 29 years of age against an extremely popular fellow, a two-term senator who everybody said was going to be a walk. This was before all the changes and trends that occurred.

“Joe Biden was a lawyer who did work for the black community, represented the Black Panthers at the time they were burning down my city, was a criminal defense lawyer, and the proponent of public housing in the county that election. And, guess what? I won.

“I went out to those same counties, those same neighborhoods, and I said: ‘I want to put a public housing project in your neighborhood.’ It is a matter of record. I am not exaggerating.”

Well, Joe was exaggerating.

Biden might have been at the tail end of a decade of fighting busing, and he was getting increasingly touchy about his position as American attitudes began to change. “When I marched in the civil rights movement” is, in fact, something Biden often told crowds before the lie caught up to him during his disastrous 1987 run for the presidency.

“It really is a hard, hard thing,” Biden joked another time. “In law school I was considered a raging liberal. As a lawyer, I’m considered, gee, I must be wacky — who’d represent a member of the Black Panthers?”

There’s no record of Biden ever having marched with civil rights leaders nor of having defended Black Panthers as they were “burning down” Wilmington in 1968 (the event he seems to be referencing), much less having to defend his association with the radical group during his first senatorial campaign. Nor do we know that Biden was a particularly zealous advocate of “public housing,” although it was a plank of the Democratic Party’s platform in Delaware at the time.

Joe’s self-aggrandizement, false modesty, and exaggerations were often deployed in the third person, as if his adulation was aimed at some mysterious hero. Reading through the Senate transcripts of Biden during the 1970s and 1980s is both immensely entertaining and an important reminder that the upper chamber has always been something of a circus. It’s also useful in once again confirming that Biden is perpetually and shamelessly revising his own biography—which is allegedly the central case for this presidency.

For example, Biden didn’t just eulogize Strom Thurmond, the one-time Dixiecrat candidate and later Republican. “Biden had developed a genuine fondness for Thurmond,” recalls Nadine Cohodas in “Strom Thurmond & the Politics of Southern Change.” “The young Democrat appreciated Thurmond’s political skill—he realized he was sitting next to a living piece of history– and he respected the straight way he could deal with one another. When Biden became Judiciary’s senior Democrat, he had promised Thurmond he would never do anything to undercut him. Thurmond had always reciprocated.”

Should Biden be judged harshly because he worked with, and sometimes befriended and was mentored, by politicians that are by today’s standards objectionable? It’s a fair question to ask about a (comparatively) moderate Democrat whose experience is probably one of his most appealing characteristics. At this point, at least, his history has not seemed to hurt his African-American support, even if the reparation crowd wants him out.

Whatever the case, it’s difficult to feel much sympathy for his plight. In 2012, it was Biden who would tell a crowd of African Americans that the presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney—who, as far as we know, had shown not any deference to segregationists—was going to “put you all back in chains.” It was an ugly smear.

We can assume that Biden understood the power of this kind of slur, since he had once been compared to the segregationist George Wallace during a Senate hearing. “We will have to judge five years from now whether or not Joe Biden was, as one of the witnesses said, a George Wallace or similar to George Wallace or Joe Biden is a racist,” Joe Biden said of Joe Biden in 1981. “I have stand on that. I will be judged later.”

Well, Biden was a member of the right party for the past 45 years. Journalists had little interest in this chapter of Biden’s past when he was running for the Senate against Republicans, or when he was the vice presidential nominee against the media-approved presidential candidate. Now, though, when facing favored progressive candidates, maybe that judgement he was talking about in 1981 will finally be rendered.

Biden Team Gripes To Press After Segregationist Gaffe,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is on defense this week after touting his friendly relationships with former segregationist senators as examples of his “civility.” Biden name-dropped former Sens. James Eastland (D-Miss.) and Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.) at a Tuesday fundraiser as evidence of the former vice president’s ability to work successfully with others.

“At least there was some civility,” Biden said. “We got things done. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished.”

Biden’s remarks faced immediate backlash, and Democratic presidential rivals seized on the comments, putting the Biden campaign on defense.

First to attack the current Democratic front-runner was Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who called on Biden to apologize for using relationships with segregationist senators as evidence of “civility.” A unusually defiant Biden however, fought back.

“Apologize for what?” Biden told a reporter on Wednesday. “There’s not a racist bone in my body. I’ve been involved in civil rights my whole career. Period. Period. Period.”

Others joined Booker in piling on calls for Biden to apologize, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).

“It’s 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of ‘civility’ typified by James Eastland. Eastland though my multiracial family should be illegal & that whites were entitled to ‘the pursuit of dead n*ggers,’” de Blasio posted on Twitter along with a picture of his black wife.

“To coddle the reputations of segregationists…is misinformed and wrong,” Harris told reporters on the Hill.

“If you ignore racism and if you don’t address issues of race with racists, then everything is fine, right?” Cortez told Politico. “That’s how you work with segregationists: By not confronting the racism and their institutionalization of second-class citizenship and a lack of fully recognizing African Americans.”

Other prominent Democrats came to Biden’s defense, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and high-ranking members of the Congressional Black Caucus.

“He has lived his life, he considers certain things a resource that he has worked across the aisle, that’s what he was saying,” Pelosi said to reporters at her weekly press briefing Thursday, reported Fox News.

U.S. Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), the House Democratic whip and highest-ranking African-American in Congress, also came to Biden’s defense.

“I don’t see anything different in what Biden said to what we all do over here,” Clyburn told reporters, according to The New York Times. “He didn’t say anything more than I would say to describe my work with Strom Thurmond and a few others.”

U.S. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus said that she hopes people will move on. “I certainly wish that he hasn’t have said it,” Bass told CNN. “I think there’s a lot of other examples of where he has worked in a bipartisan fashion, but I would like to see us move on from there.”

Reps. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), both members of the Congressional Black Caucus, also declined to join calls for Biden to apologize, reported CNN.

“I haven’t seen anything from Joe Biden that suggests at this moment that he should apologize,” Jeffries said. He serves as a member of the House Democratic leadership team.

Since his remarks, Biden’s record on civil rights has come under further scrutiny. While Biden has refused to apologize, he did attempt to refine his remarks at a Maryland fundraiser on Wednesday when speaking about his time served in the Senate, according to Politico.

“We had to put up with the likes of, like Jim Eastland and Hermy Talmadge and all those segregationists and all of that… We in fact detested what they stood for in terms of segregation and all the rest,” Biden told donors, Politico reported. “We restored the Voting Rights Act, we did it, and over time we extended it by 25 years not just five years.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/21/biden-team-gripes-press-segregationist-gaffe/,2019-06-21
"Biden's Dixiecrat Comments Freak Out The Left, But Not Many Dem Voters","Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, criticizing the lack of civility in our current politics, spoke during a recent fundraiser about working with two unapologetically segregationist Dixiecrat senators: James Eastland and Herman Talmadge.

“I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland,” Biden said, according the pool report. “He never called me ‘boy,’ he always called me ‘son.’” He also called Talmadge “one of the meanest guys,” before adding: “At least there was some civility. We got things done.”

Biden further stated: “We didn’t agree on much of anything. But today, you look at the other side, and you’re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don’t talk to each other anymore.”

The backlash to these comments from the left has already begun, from rival presidential candidates Bill de Blasio and Cory Booker, to almost-presidential candidate Sherrod Brown, to commentators like Jamil Smith and Jamelle Bouie.

Enlisting the white moderate’s help in suppression, whether through direct action or other forms of complicity, is an essential weapon of white supremacy. Eastland was trying to kill us, and Biden talks about him like he was his goddamned buddy. Well, because that is what he was. — Jamil Smith جميل كريم (@JamilSmith) June 19, 2019

This backlash will probably grow in breadth and intensity, but it has as much to do with the state of the Democratic Party—as identified by Biden—as it does with opposition to segregationists. There are at least four additional reasons for the hostile reactions.

The first, most obvious reason to attack Biden’s comments about working with Dixiecrats is opportunism. Biden is not defending Jim Crow. His critics do not think he is a closet segregationist. If anything, Biden is analogizing today’s Republican politicians to yesterday’s segregationists, which is something Democrats do as a matter of routine.

But Biden is the current front-runner for his party’s presidential nomination, largely on the strength of his appeal to black voters. Accordingly, he has been attacked for his past opposition to forced busing as a remedy for school segregation in the 1970s (it was not wildly popular with black families either). It follows that he will be attacked for noting he worked with segregationists to advance his agenda.

Second, the left does not particularly want Biden reminding people that the Democrats were the party of segregation as recently as within his lifetime (and the lifetimes of many voters). As much as the left enjoys throwing the race card indiscriminately, it would prefer to avoid those specifics.

Democrats have worked hard to whitewash their racist history. When this history comes up, the left shifts to a lazy narrative about the GOP becoming filled with racists following the passage of the Civil Rights Acts as part the “Southern Strategy.” The story of the political realignment of the South is much more complex, but the left can succeed with it if they keep the narrative shallow. Biden allowing for fraught complexities on an issue as sensitive as civil rights does not aid the left.

Third, while Biden is implicitly comparing Republicans to segregationists, he is not doing it harshly enough for the left. By suggesting that if he could work with Eastland and Talmadge, he could also work with Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, he is implying—correctly—that McConnell is nowhere near as toxic. This suggestion is unacceptable to the left.

Fourth, and perhaps most important, attacking Biden as a segregationist sympathizer allows the left to dodge the substance of what he actually said. In addition to criticizing the “you’re the enemy” attitude of our current politics, Biden added: “I know the new New Left tells me that I’m ― this is old-fashioned. Well guess what? If we can’t reach a consensus in our system, what happens? It encourages and demands the abuse of power by a president. That’s what it does.”

The new New Left understandably does not like being attacked in this way, particularly while Biden is leading in the polls. The new New Left have abandoned Rev. Martin Luther King Jr’s frame that the American experiment is great and black Americans want to fully participate in it. Instead, the left is embracing an identity politics rooted in the idea that America is irredeemably founded in white supremacy and plunder and thus must be torn down in favor of some revolutionary replacement.

Politics is often called the art of compromise, but identarianism politicizes All The Things and renders every disagreement a personal attack. Ironically, Biden is critiquing the reasoning by which President Obama tried to use his “phone and pen” to unconstitutionally make immigration policies Congress rejected.

None of this is a defense of Biden as a politician. After all, Biden is implying today’s GOP is not much different from the Dixiecrats. And he was far more explicit in telling black Americans in 2012 that Republican presidential ticket Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan were “going to put y’all back in chains.”

But black Americans may understand Biden’s latest point better than his critics do. This year, black Democrats in Virginia apparently had a more mature (or resigned) attitude when top Democratic officials turned out to have blackface photos in their pasts. They were less likely to call for resignations than political elites and woke pundits. It is a more practical approach than trendy identitarianism.

This more practical perspective may be why House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn is defending Biden, stating that his past work with Sen. Strom Thurmond was “similar to Biden working with Talmadge.” Indeed, five more members of the Congressional Black Caucus have jumped to his defense, noting that Biden’s remarks are being taken out of context and this call for decency is needed now more than ever.

Best Tweets Of The Second Democratic Primary Debate,"The second night of the first round of Democratic debates was more raucous than the first as the heavy-hitting candidates near the top of the polls gathered with a few oddballs to hash out the issues of the day. Some candidates were blasts from the past, others a hint of the future, and a few provoked millions across America to ask “Who the heck is that?”

We collected the best takes and one-liners from Twitter to sum up the evening.

another night, another ten person debate. this is the future UCF fans want. — Mina Kimes (@minakimes) June 28, 2019



Part One: It Begins

At center-stage were the two frontrunners, septuagenarians Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.

Instead of holding a policy debate tonight NBC should put a bowl of lukewarm soup between Bernie and Biden and have them argue whether to send it back or not — Adam Blickstein (@AdamBlickstein) June 27, 2019



Sanders took the first question, about the cost of all the spending he proposed.

Sanders goes right to health care as a human right. Single-payer. He was asked about taxes. — Stuart Rothenberg (@StuPolitics) June 28, 2019

“Yes, [the middle class] will pay more in taxes…” – @BernieSanders — Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) June 28, 2019

“The sea was angry that day, my friends, like an old man trying to sell America on socialized medicine.” — Mark Hemingway (@Heminator) June 28, 2019



Biden was next asked about his comments to a room of rich donors, in which he said that “nothing would change” if he were elected.

Biden gave us word salad sprinkled with Trump bashing, yes? — Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) June 28, 2019

I’m sure I just watched Biden say something but I can’t for the life of me remember what it was — Noah Smith (@Noahpinion) June 28, 2019

Senator Kamala Harris started in with her plans, while attacking the current administration.

First Biden and then Sen. Harris say the economy isn’t working, which is not a very widely held belief right now. — Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) June 28, 2019

Senator Harris criticized the $1.5T tax cut under the TCJA. Her tax credit costs $3T. — Nicole Kaeding (@NKaeding) June 28, 2019



The candidates continued with individualized questions in descending order of recognizably.

John Hickenlooper of Colorado:

— Jason Howerton (@jason_howerton) June 28, 2019



Kirsten Gillibrand of New York:

Ah, Gillibrand, the Manhattan top-firm lawyer for the tobacco companies, is denouncing the greed of America’s rich. — Jim Geraghty (@jimgeraghty) June 28, 2019



Michael Bennet of … also Colorado?

Before they could go much further, Swalwell decided to take a swing at the biggest guy in the yard on the first day, telling Biden he was too old to be president.

Swalwell was sent back by Skynet to win the election, but his disguise as a human candidate isn’t very convincing. Even tho his dig at Old Man Biden is pretty good. — Daniel McCarthy (@ToryAnarchist) June 28, 2019

HOLY CRAP. That dig at Biden. Wth I love Swalwell now. — Kassy Dillon (@KassyDillon) June 28, 2019



Chaos ensued, and not for the last time. Biden pointedly refused to “pass the torch,” while Bernie, the oldest men on stage, defended his fellow representative of the Silent Generation. Everyone yelled for a while.

SEVERAL PEOPLE ARE TYPING — Ivan Plis (@ivanplis) June 28, 2019



Harris jumped in with a totally spontaneous and not pre-written zinger.

Back on track, Harris reminded the audience that everything is bad.

Kamala Harris says she’s unsure how Trump is measuring the health of the economy. Surprised she’s unclear that it’s GDP, job growth, wage growth, labor force participation, etc. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) June 28, 2019



Part Two: Fixing Obamacare

Next, the candidates discussed how bad the health-care situation is in America and wonder why no one had tried to fix it yet. The night’s first show-of-hands question: who would outlaw private insurance. There were a few, including Harris, in her second or third flip-flop on the question.

Kamala: Abolish private insurance! Kamala: Oh wait no, don’t abolish private insurance.

Kamala: WAIT YES ABOLISH PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE!#DemDebate2

Bernie yelled glowingly about our neighbor to the north.

The health-care debate went on for a while, with most candidates agreeing that Obamacare was good, but also that it didn’t work and everyone was poor and dying. One more hand-raising exercise confirmed that all ten would allow illegal immigrants to get health care paid for by American taxpayers.

Is this real life? NBC just got Joe Biden and every single other Democrat on the stage to say they want to give taxpayer-funded free health care to illegal immigrants. — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) June 28, 2019



Part Three: Open Borders

On immigration, all of the candidates opposed the president’s current policies, and all agreed that they would decriminalize illegal entry to the United States and not deport anyone unless he committed some other, more serious crime.

After a brief diversion into tariffs—they’re against ’em—there was a break for some commercials from all those evil corporations.

Part Four: Elder Abuse

The debate had begun as a melee, but Kamala Harris wanted a duel with the man at the top of the polls: Diamond Joe Biden. Gone was the lovable caricature from Onion articles; Harris painted Biden as the second coming of Jefferson Davis.

Harris going after Biden. LOL YES. — Melissa Mackenzie (@MelissaTweets) June 28, 2019

Biden reeled, but was not unprepared, contrasting his fight for the little guy as a public defender with Harris’s long career of putting poor people in jail as a prosecutor.

After Harris goes after Biden, Biden returns the favor: “I was a public defender – I didn’t become a prosecutor” — Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) June 28, 2019

WOW. Biden just straight up hit Kamala for being a COP. Holy crap. Also called her out for not knowing education is a local policy area. — Liz Mair (@LizMair) June 28, 2019



His defense was a little shaky:

Harris now demanding Biden answer very directly for his past record, but God forbid anyone try to get her to do the same… — Elizabeth Nolan Brown (@ENBrown) June 28, 2019



But he stopped the bleeding.

“I’m the best lawyer, I’m a prosecutor.” “No I’m the best lawyer, I’m a public defender.”

How about you’re all members of an elite entitled group that is wildly overrepresented in our so-called republic?

Part Five: Final Thoughts

Then, they turned to guns, starting with Swalwell, who has made firearm confiscation his single issue, while still remaining incoherent on the point.

Accusing Biden Of Racism Betrays The Term’s Flaccidity,"So it turns out that former vice president and current presidential contender Joe Biden is a racist. Or he used to be a racist. Or he isn’t and never was a racist, but the way he speaks about race is racist. Or something.

His offense stems from having worked with segregationist Democrats back in the 1970s, but oddly, it isn’t the working with segregationist Democrats that is the racist part; it is how he described it, including referencing the term “boy.”

These kinds of allegations of racism, led by Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, stemming from what Biden’s detractors might describe as tone deafness is nothing new. These kinds of attacks have been leveled against Republicans for decades now. Usually these Republicans are accused of dog whistling, which is to say, saying something racist that only racists understand as racist, although obviously those calling out the dog whistle hear it, too — generally much more loudly than anyone else.

What is new is for this policing of speech about race to take aim at a major Democratic figure. The motivation here is obvious. Lets be clear, as Biden’s old boss used to say, there would be no accusations of anything had Biden not run for president or if he didn’t lead in the polls. We know this because it was ignored both times he ran for vice president. Certain of his opponents see an opportunity to ding him here, and they are taking it

At the same time, they are being very careful about it. He’s not really being accused of dog whistling, because that requires intent. Nobody, at least thus far, is arguing that Biden is saying intentionally racist things to attract voters.

But in a way this is even worse than how progressive purveyors of critical race theory attack Republicans. The attack on Biden, one that presumably is intended to imply he is not qualified to be president, is based solely on the fact that he is not using the specific modern language that the left demands.

This is a critical and crucial point. The message is that if you don’t speak exactly as progressives demand, you are crossing a line, even if the meaning of what you are saying is something they approve of and agree with. This happened again on Friday when Booker tweeted an attack on Biden for remarks about Treyvon Martin that mentioned his “hoodie,” which became a symbol of the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of his killing.

This isn’t about a hoodie. It’s about a culture that sees a problem with a kid wearing a hoodie in the first place. Our nominee needs to have the language to talk about race in a far more constructive way. https://t.co/c2BFSSOHro — Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) June 28, 2019

Surely, Booker agrees with what Biden is saying. The problem is how he said it. But this is a game with no rules, a law with no guidelines. Apparently anything that rings a bit tinny to the ear, especially the ear of a person of color, can be outright condemned with no rational explanation other than “I didn’t like the way it sounded.”

A good rule of thumb is that anytime anyone says to you, “I’m not calling you a racist, but…” they are absolutely, 100 percent calling you a racist. For what is a racist, other than someone who is engaging in racism? So if Biden’s phraseology — even without any racist intent, because progressives argue intent is irrelevant — is, shall we say, an embodiment of systemic societal racism, then Biden is engaging in racism and is a racist.

Even the shallowest dive into this scandal shows that it is simply nonsense, and not just nonsense, but nonsense of a kind that can damage reputations based on capricious notions of wrong speak. The deeper dive is worse, because it betrays the fact that progressives have conflated innocent remarks with burning crosses, the result being that burning crosses gains a glimmer of respectability.

We cannot fight the real and powerful forces of racism in this manner anymore than a fire department can fight big, deadly fires if all their energy is spent snuffing out safe fireplaces and charcoal grills.

Politically, it’s not clear what, if any, effect this is all having. Thus far, Biden has survived the slings and arrows slung at him without losing much of his lead, or support. It is possible that attacks on him have stunted his campaign’s growth and staved off the sense of inevitability, but it’s too early to really tell that.

One major risk associated with this kind of attack is that non-progressive white Democrats will see themselves in Biden. If Biden can be accused of racism for such inoffensive speech, then what chance do they have? The white Brooklyn wokester knows she can never be “really” racist because she knows she is racist in the way all white people are. That doesn’t fly over so well in Kansas or Indiana.

Stepping back from politics, to the extent that is even possible is 2019: this is a bad trend for our society. And it carries potentially devastating consequences. One is that good, decent people like Biden get smeared, but arguably worse is that white Americans, and just white Americans, become numb to accusations of racism that have merit and need to be addressed.

Whether or not this hurts Biden, or helps Booker and Harris, it is a bad way to think about race and racism, and promises to do far more harm than good.

Why Joe Biden’s Constant Apologies May Not Be Enough To Win,"Once again, former vice president Joe Biden is very, very sorry. Since he declared his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination earlier this year, Biden has spent the majority of his time on the campaign trail apologizing.

He has tried to make amends for his habit of touching women in ways that made many uncomfortable. He’s done countless mea culpas for his role in Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ confirmation hearings, in which Anita Hill blamed Biden for what she considered rough treatment.

He’s apologized for his role in shepherding the 1994 Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act to passage because most liberals and African-Americans believe mass incarceration of criminals devastated their communities. And lately he’s been making the rounds among African-American leaders accounting for his comments in which he noted that some Senate segregationists were not only civil but people with whom more enlightened creatures like himself could do business.

The question is, why haven’t these issues dented his still considerable lead in the polls over the other 25 members of the Democratic primary field? If not, does this prove either that these issues are not as important as many on the left—and on the right who fear that Biden would be a more difficult Democrat for President Donald Trump to defeat in November 2020—think?

Will Biden Sink or Swim, and Does Apologizing Help?

Are his various apologies—some of which seemed to be based in genuine regret about past decisions and others that he clearly believes are responses to charges that are unfair or completely unfounded—going to be enough to secure the Democratic nomination? Or will the accumulated weight of accusations, all of which seem to buttress the conviction that Biden is a man of the past, ultimately sink him in a race in which more ideologically left voters will presumably predominate?

The early indications seem favorable for Biden. Despite the heavy fire directed at him by rivals like Cory Booker, who sought to make a meal out of Biden’s confession that he had a decent working relationship with open racists like Sens. James Eastland and Herman Talmadge, the frontrunner’s lead in the polls is undiminished.

Although this latest story gave liberals one more reason not to vote for Biden, he still holds an impressive double-digit lead on the field. His 32.1 percent in the Real Clear Politics average of polls is nearly double that of his nearest competitor, Bernie Sanders, who registers only 16.5 percent support among Democrats polled. Just as important, Biden is maintaining strong support among African-American voters. That’s particularly true in South Carolina, an early primary state where the black community will largely decide victory.

Biden is benefiting from African-Americans’ abiding affection for his former boss, President Barack Obama. Being Obama’s vice president seems to have given Biden a pass for the sort of statements that might sink other Democrats. Moreover, Biden’s mainstream appeal—a product of the same sort of behavior that causes left-wingers to view him with disdain—has fueled the perception that he is the sort of Democrat needed to beat Trump.

Biden Needs More Than to Avoid Disaster

This is very good news for a Biden campaign that is rolling in money, 100 percent name recognition, and the sense that all he has to do is to avoid disaster to sail through the first stages of the campaign before beginning to roll up the sort of pluralities that will cause most of the two dozen Democrats running for president to drop out.

Indeed, the willingness of a candidate like Booker to attack Biden about being soft on segregationists was the idea that unless the former vice president is substantially discredited before the votes start being counted next year, it will be too late to stop him. That Booker was forced to back down to some extent within days of his demand that Biden apologize for what he said about working with segregationists illustrates that the issue gained him little traction.

But Biden faces two problems that cast a shadow on the optimism his supporters feel.

The first is that although nothing Biden has done in the past nor said recently has affected his standing in the polls, with several months left to go until the first primaries, Biden has yet to go more than a week or two without some negative story or gaffe putting him on his heels. Biden’s history as a national candidate in the past was largely characterized by mistakes and an inability to avoid mistakes. The pattern has repeated in his latest try for the presidency.

Just because none of the problems he has encountered so far have proved serious, let alone fatal, doesn’t mean that the accumulated negativity hasn’t chipped away at the notion that he can’t be stopped. Should Biden stumble in any of the upcoming Democratic debates, the damage may be substantial if for no other reason than voters are already anticipating that Biden’s penchant for ill-considered statements will finally provide his opponents the ammunition they need to erase his lead in the polls.

Biden’s Primary Problems

The other big problem facing Biden are the rules the Democrats have set for the primaries.

The inordinately large field of contenders—many of whom have no real chance of winning the nomination—would seem to give the frontrunner a tremendous advantage. Particularly on the left, as Sanders and Elizabeth Warren compete for the same activist constituency, or among the minority candidates like Booker and Kamala Harris, many are making it easy for Biden because their numbers preclude any one of them from gaining enough support to catch him.

But provided that enough of them stay on their feet by the time the primaries actually begin, the rules that apportion delegates proportionately will preclude Biden from rolling up delegate totals that could end the contest before it really begins, much as Donald Trump did among Republicans in 2016 without winning a majority in any of the early states.

That is why the steady drumbeat of negative stories in the liberal media about Biden and his past—such as The New York Times’ feature published on Wednesday, which sought to prove that the former vice president had a lot in common with segregationists when opposing forced busing plans or sponsoring law and order crime bills during his time in the Senate—could be a huge problem.

Unless Biden can wrap up the nomination early, he is eventually going to have to face off against whichever of his more liberal competitors can survive the first primaries. While Biden may be the choice of the same party establishment that imposed Hillary Clinton on the Democrats in 2016, the same polls that are so encouraging for him also reveal that the total strength of the more liberal candidates eclipses his numbers.

The resentment of the activist wing of the party that looks to figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for inspiration against Biden should not be underestimated. And the more the liberal press concentrates on Biden’s record, the harder it will be for him to sweep aside left-wing competitors once the field is winnowed down.

For now, Biden’s apologies and the memory of his loyalty to Obama have sufficed to build and maintain an impressive lead. But unless the mistakes stop, especially in the upcoming debates, the easy path to the nomination he is envisioning may prove far steeper than it appears to be today.

Kamala Harris Has A Bigger Problem Than Forced Busing,"In the viral moment of the first Democratic presidential debates, Sen. Kamala Harris attacked former vice president Joe Biden over his opposition to forced busing to integrate public schools. The Harris campaign is now waffling on the issue. Over time, we may look back on that as a moment revealing Harris’s underlying weakness as a candidate.

Immediately after the debate, while clips rolled of Harris touting how she personally benefited from busing, Harris surged in the polls and Biden sagged a bit. It is less clear that Harris successfully cracked Biden’s appeal with black voters, which is likely key to the success of both candidates.

In live dial-tests during the debate, Stanley Greenberg found Biden’s favorability with black voters increased 18 percent as a result of perceived attacks on the Obama-Biden legacy. The ABC News/Washington Post poll indicates Biden scoring with 41 percent of black voters and Harris only 11 percent.

In the latest YouGov poll, black voters are split 36-13 between Biden and Harris. On the other hand, the Quinnipiac poll has Biden narrowly leading Harris 31 to 27 percent with black voters, while CNN found a 25 to 19 percent split with nonwhite respondents. Reuters/Ispos found Biden’s black support was cut in half. The question will take time to settle.

Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, Harris is having trouble with her position on busing. At first, Harris leaned into her debate position: “Listen, the schools of America are as segregated if not more segregated today than they were when I was in elementary school. And we need to put every effort including busing into play to desegregate the schools.”

By last Wednesday, Harris reversed her emphasis. When asked whether she supports federally mandated busing, she replied: “I believe that any tool that is in the toolbox should be considered by a school district.” The Biden campaign wasted no time pouncing on the shift, with Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield tweeting: “It’s disappointing that Senator Harris chose to distort Vice President Biden’s position on busing — particularly now that she is tying herself in knots trying not to answer the very question she posed to him!”

Why the waffle? Perhaps Harris looked at historical polling indicating just how unpopular busing was. Famously, in a 1973 Gallup poll, only 9 percent of blacks and 4 percent of whites chose busing as the preferred solution for integrating public schools. In fairness, when polling busing alone, the National Opinion Research Center found consistently stronger support for the idea among blacks and whites, though the trend tended to improve as busing died as a live political issue.

Ian Sams, Harris’s national press secretary, has made two attempts to clean up for the senator. Sams argued “Harris absolutely believes the federal government was right to step in in the 60s/70s. But surely we can all agree 2019 is not 1975.” This line does not square with Harris asserting that schools are more segregated today than in the 1970s.

Sams also pointed to Biden’s claims that busing is racist. The problem with this line is that racial quotas are not popular and implying Biden is himself a racist is a problem, given that Harris denied it in post-debate interviews. To be sure, Harris probably enjoyed denying it in the sense of not asking people to not think of an elephant. The former prosecutor knows the value of making objectionable statements when the bell cannot be unrung.

But the approach has its limits. Harris correctly understood that you have to beat the front-runner if you want to be the front-runner. Yet if you come at the front-runner, you had best not miss.

Harris benefited from her attack because Biden was not sharp enough to press her on the issue (or believed he would suffer from appearing too aggressive himself). That lack of sharpness—real or perceived—may ultimately help Harris or hurt Biden more than the substance of the issue.

Harris was also aided by debate moderators caught off-guard, or too inclined to see Biden hurt, to follow up on the issue. She is further helped by the belated follow-up occurring during the Independence Day holiday weekend, when few casual viewers will notice. In sum, it was a successful attack, but one that could have backfired in a highly damaging way in the moment. Am element of luck was involved.

Harris climbing out on limbs is part of an underlying pattern of high-risk publicity-seeking. For example, during the confirmation hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, she raised her profile by asking the nominee: “Have you discussed the Mueller investigation with anyone at Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Marc Kasowitz, President Trump’s personal lawyer? Be sure about your answer, sir.”

Harris grilled Kavanaugh about this for at least five minutes. It was as dramatic and as empty as Geraldo Rivera opening Al Capone’s vault; if Harris had any evidence of Kavanaugh talking to Trump’s lawyers, she never produced it.

Similarly, Harris garnered headlines during a CNN town hall for declaring she would abolish private health insurance as part of her support for the Medicare-for-all plan proposed by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. She backtracked the next day.

During the first round of debates, she raised her hand to a question asking whether her health care policy would “abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan.” She later claimed she misinterpreted the question, claiming the Sanders plan allows for supplemental insurance. Such insurance does not exist, as even The New York Times reports.

The holiday weekend is providing cover to Harris’s latest waffle, but her rivals are beginning to notice. Lis Smith, the communications advisor to Pete Buttigieg, tweeted: “The story of the 2020 Democratic primary shouldn’t be how individual candidates used debates to deep-six rivals and push litmus test policies they’re gonna disavow once they get a poll back.”

If the debate exchange on busing damaged Biden more from creating the perception he has lost a step, it may damage Harris by highlighting that she tends to bluff and folds when called. She has not been called often, but if she were the nominee, you could bet on President Trump doing so. That is a bigger problem for Harris (and Democratic voters) than her position on busing.

Biden: ‘Sometimes Even George Wallace Is Right’,"How many Republican candidates could survive a 2020 political race if they had once said, “sometimes even George Wallace is right about some things?” I’d venture to say none.

In his email newsletter, CNN’s Chris Cillizza ranks the five big campaign stories to keep an eye on. Coming in at No. 1 this week is whether presidential hopeful Joe Biden can turn over a “new leaf.” The former vice president, Cillizza explained, “sought to put a rough few weeks, which began with what was interpreted as praise for segregationist senators, behind him.”

Were Biden’s comments about the relative civility of segregationists interpreted as praise of segregationists—as in, still up for debate—or was it just unadorned praise? Whatever the case, reporters now have a catalog of historical evidence showing Biden extolling segregationists, defending segregationists, eulogizing segregationists, working with segregationists on shared interests, being mentored by segregationists, and sucking up to segregationists to secure coveted committee seats as a freshman senator—appointments that he was given over more experienced colleagues.

What more do journalists need to see to make a declarative statement about Biden’s history? I mean, other than finding an “R” next to his name.

What about Biden telling a witness “sometimes even George Wallace is right” during a Senate committee hearing in 1981?

No, Biden wasn’t arguing that Wallace — the notorious four-term Democrat governor of Alabama and three-time segregationist presidential candidate who, in 1963, had famously said, “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever” — was a good guy, as he did of his “closest friend,” Strom Thurmond. By the time Biden was bringing up Wallace, in fact, the Alabama governor had asked for forgiveness. Biden was arguing that Wallace’s argument about criminal justice, rehabilitation, and the death penalty—positions that are now abhorrent to progressives—had been prophetic.

“Let us take the death penalty,” Biden explained. “Everybody wants the death penalty now. We are going to hang everybody. Do you know why they want the death penalty? Because stupid sociologists and guys like people who sit up here in my job for years kept telling them: ‘We know how to rehabilitate.’ They do not have the slightest idea how to rehabilitate. Our entire criminal justice system is premised on the point that you sentence someone based upon the amount of time it will take to rehabilitate them.

“So the American people,” he went on, “because they are basically good, like most people in my opinion are, went along and said: ‘We’ll buy that.’ And they bought it for 20 years. And it does not work. It flat out does not work. So, what are the liberals, but Joe Biden and a few others like me, saying? And I get killed by my liberal constituency for saying it. I say: ‘Hey, let’s forget about rehabilitation. We do not know how to do it.’ Say it. Boom. Tell them. Because if you don’t, you know what is going to happen.”

(None of the above, incidentally, had anything to do with the topic of the Senate hearing Biden was charged with running, which was the constitutionality of busing.)

Casting himself as a rebellious Democrat, Biden argued that Americans were going to get so frustrated with the “liberal sociologists and politicians” that they would turn to Thurmond’s view of “hang them all,” not because Americans were bad people, but because urban liberal policies had failed them.

So maybe Biden wasn’t always wrong.

Then again, the future vice president also argued that our criminal justice problems only existed because the American people were “not very innovative.” This assertion was made with United States on the cusp of a technological and economic revolution that benefited every strata of society and changed the world of information and commerce forever. So there’s also that.

Does Biden believe rehabilitation is overrated? Who are we kidding? Biden believes whatever he needs to believe to win—then and now. He will drop decades-long positions if they offer the slightest threat to his campaign, without any intellectual or moral explanation.

We know this because, despite his insistence at the time, there was nothing particularly courageous about being a law-and-order senator from Delaware in 1981. In that year, 66 percent of Americans supported the death penalty. By the time Biden was pushing the 1994 crime bill, that number had climbed to 80 percent. Biden was adopting popular positions in a nation sick of rampant criminality.

Things have changed, though, and Biden has already apologized for his part in passing the 1994 crime bill. “It was a big mistake that was made,” he explained. “We were told by the experts that ‘Crack, you never go back,’ that the two were somehow fundamentally different. It’s not. But it’s trapped an entire generation.”

You’ll notice that here Biden drops his customary habit of taking personal credit for policy achievements, even ones that he was only tangentially involved in during the Obama administration, and instead lays the blame on the collective. Policies that Biden sponsored, helped write, and campaigned on for decades, are now — well, mistakes were made.

Joe “lock those SOBs up” Biden contends that he was part of a group fooled by pointy-headed experts and “Crack is Wack” slogans. You might notice this was the very same rationalization he used in his Wallace-was-right lecture to make the contradictory point about crime in 1981. Experts misled us.

That’s all debatable. Maybe Biden was just doing what he had to do in 1970s Washington. Maybe Biden was right about busing and crime, and needed some unsavory allies to stop bad policy. Maybe he buddied up with James O. Eastland and J. William Fulbright for the long-term good, and maybe it was worth it. Maybe Wallace had a point. Maybe it’s all just ancient history.

But that brings us back to the central argument of the Biden campaign: if his experience in Washington is the most compelling reason for his candidacy, why does he spend so much time apologizing and walking back positions, policy choices, and statements? These are not all inconsequential, long-forgotten fights, either. We’re talking about some of the biggest debates of the past 50 years. War. Abortion. Integration of schools. Crime.

Does Biden deserve a pass simply because he said these things a long time ago? If not, perhaps someone at the next debate can ask him if he still believes Wallace was right.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/09/biden-sometimes-even-george-wallace-is-right/,2019-07-09
Joe Biden: We Must Protect And Build On Obamacare,"Joe Biden released the healthcare plan he would put into place if elected president and, like much else in his campaign, it revolves around the continued pursuit of the Obama administration’s goals.

“The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a historic achievement,” Biden’s campaign tweeted. “20 million Americans gained coverage. Over 100 million with pre-existing conditions finally got protection. We can’t tear it down.”

Biden’s proposed plan is to protect and build on Obamacare.

The Affordable Care Act was a historic achievement. 20 million Americans gained coverage. Over 100 million with pre-existing conditions finally got protection. We can’t tear it down. So today, I’m releasing my plan to Protect & Build on Obamacare: https://t.co/RIhlOcOWK8 pic.twitter.com/laDUcIhRjM — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 15, 2019

In his video, Biden provides a relatively moderate outlook on healthcare, saying he cannot believe that Democrats are running on a “Medicare for All” plan as that would get rid of Obamacare.

“I’m surprised that so many Democrats are running on getting rid of the Affordable Care Act,” Biden said.

In the video, Biden showcases the moment in the first round of the Democratic debates when Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders raised their hands saying they would eliminate private health insurance if elected president.

“Obamacare is failing,” said Grace-Marie Turner, founder and president of the Galen Institute, a research organization that promotes free-market ideas for health reform. “The fact that so few Democrats are standing up and cheering for it shows it simply didn’t work.”

A simple run-down of Biden’s plan:

Giving American’s a public health insurance option, like Medicare

Obamacare was designed to give American’s a government-issued healthcare “option.” However, Obamacare was essentially forced down the throats of Americans via mandatory enrollment fees, which fined people for not having healthcare, making enrollment less of an “option” than it was originally spelled out to be. While Biden’s plan promises that Americans will be able to keep their existing private health insurance if they please, Obama made that same claim in 2009. However, the only way to reduce premium costs under the ACA was to reduce the number of doctors in an insurer’s network. This resulted in people losing their doctors. Federal government overhaul to expand Medicare, ignoring states’ rights

On Biden’s campaign website, he proposes “expanding coverage to low-income Americans,” which sounds like the moral way to justify healthcare expansion. However, that title is completely misleading to what Biden’s actual proposal is interested in doing—turning healthcare into a federal government overhaul and ignoring states’ rights. Conservative-leaning states such as Texas, Tennessee, and Mississippi are among the 14 states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion. Under the Biden Plan, the federal government would bypass a state’s right to choose whether or not to adopt healthcare expansion. This healthcare proposal is just another example of how the Democratic nominees are working tirelessly to undermine states’ rights and American citizens’ ability to chose. Lack of competition is driving up prices, so let’s eliminate all competition

The Biden plan says that healthcare in its current form is too expensive and hard to navigate. Yet, the current system we live under is the system Biden is a proponent of protecting and expanding. Biden’s plan mentions that a lack of competition, especially in the market of prescription drugs, is driving up prices. Instead of following basic economic principles, which would suggest that in order to drive down costs, open the free market to allow more competition and allow the lowest prices to prevail (also known as capitalism) Biden has suggested that the federal government and expansion of the ACA will magically get rid of the high expenses of healthcare.”There is no way that private plans can compete with a public plan that has unlimited access to taxpayers’ dollars,” Turner said. Biden’s plan will repeal the existing law explicitly barring Medicare from negotiating lower prices with drug corporations

This is also known as reforming Obamacare. So while Biden is running on a platform of “protecting and building on Obamacare,” there are aspects of Obamacare that are failing, with Biden refusing to admit it. Instead, Biden is covering up these failures with “proposals” which are really just reforms to the existing government healthcare plan.”The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that government would not be able to do as good a job as private companies,” said Turner. “While this sounds good as a slogan, this is not a good way to actually lower drug prices.” Allowing consumers to buy prescription drugs from other countries

Also known as drug importation. “It’s been an idea that politicians have been proposing for several decades,” Turner says. She adds that there is no way to regulate the supply of imported drugs and this policy would bypass the FDA. By ignoring FDA standards, this leaves American citizen’s susceptible to drugs that are dangerous to their health. This policy opens up the market so anybody can send drugs into America. Repealing the Hyde Amendment and codifying Roe v. Wade

Biden wants to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which bars taxpayers from paying directly for abortions. This would give more federal funding to Planned Parenthood. Not to mention, Biden’s plan intends to codify Roe v. Wade into law.

“A Medicare-for-All proposal goes too far,” said Turner. “[Biden] does not believe that Americans should be forced to lose their healthcare, but the public option would quickly lead to that same result. It’s a shorter path to the same place.”

3 Reasons Joe Biden’s Health Care Plan Is Merely Socialism Lite,"On Monday morning, former vice president Joe Biden released the health care plan for his 2020 presidential campaign. The plan comes ahead of a single-payer health plan speech by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) scheduled for Wednesday.

Biden’s plan includes several noteworthy omissions. For instance, it does not include any reference to health coverage for foreign citizens illegally present in the United States. That exclusion seems rather surprising, given both Democrats’ embrace of health benefits for those unlawfully present in last month’s debate, and Biden’s repeated references to the issue.

Campaign staff told Politico that they would allow illegal immigrants to purchase Obamacare exchange coverage without access to federal subsidies, but Biden’s website contains not a word about that concept—an implicit admission that using taxpayer dollars to subsidize health care for those unlawfully present holds less popular appeal than liberal Democrats first thought.

Biden said later on Monday that illegally present foreign citizens should have access to “public health clinics if they’re sick,” but not health insurance. He also claimed that last month’s debate format did not give him enough time to explain his position.

Overall, however, Biden’s plan includes many similarities to Sanders’. While both Sanders and Biden want to draw contrasts on health care—Sanders to attack Biden as beholden to corporate interests, and Biden to attack Sanders for wanting to demolish Obamacare—their plans contain far more similarities than differences.

Losing Coverage

Sanders’ bill would, as the American people have gradually learned this year, make private insurance “unlawful,” taking coverage away from approximately 300 million Americans. Biden’s plan specifically attacks single payer on this count, for “starting from scratch and getting rid of private insurance.”

In comments before AARP on Monday afternoon, Biden went so far as to bring up Obamacare’s foremost broken promise to highlight the distinction between his plan and Sanders’. Biden, like Obama before him, pledged that “If you like your health care plan, your employer-based plan, you can keep it. If in fact you like private insurance, you can keep it.” For Americans who spent 2013 on the planet Mars, Obama’s infamous pledge using those exact same words became the Lie of the Year, according to PolitiFact.

As with Obamacare, Biden’s promise will echo hollow. By creating a government-run “public option” like Sanders’, the Biden plan would also take away health coverage for millions of Americans. As I have previously explained, a government-run plan would sabotage private insurance, using access to Treasury dollars and other in-built structural advantages.

In 2009, the Lewin Group concluded that a government-run health plan, available to all individuals and paying doctors and hospitals at Medicare rates (i.e., less than private insurance), would lead to 119.1 million individuals losing employer coverage:

More Spending

Like Sanders’, Biden’s plan would also increase federal spending, on several levels. First, he would allow individuals living in states that have not expanded Medicaid to join the government-run health plan for free. Note that this proposal lets Medicaid-eligible individuals enroll in the government-run plan only—showing a bias in favor of government-run coverage, as opposed to privately run exchange plans or other types of insurance.

Biden would also expand the Obamacare subsidy regime, in three ways. He would:

Reduce the maximum amount individuals would pay in premiums from 9.86% of income to no more than 8.5% of income, with federal subsidies making up the difference. Repeal Obamacare’s income cap on subsidies, so that families with incomes of more than four times the poverty level ($103,000 for a family of four in 2019) can qualify for subsidies. To lower deductibles and co-payments, link insurance subsidies to a richer “gold” plan, one that covers 80% of an average enrollee’s health costs in a given year, rather than the “silver” plan under current law.

All three of these recommendations come from the liberal Urban Institute’s Healthy America plan, issued last year. However, they all come with a big price tag. Consider the following excerpt from Biden’s plan:

Take a family of four with an income of $110,000 per year. If they currently get insurance on the individual marketplace [i.e., Exchange], because their premium will now be capped at 8.5% of their income, under the Biden Plan they will save an estimated $750 per month on insurance alone. That’s cutting their premiums almost in half. [Emphasis original.]

That’s also making coverage “affordable” for families through unaffordable levels of federal spending. By its own estimates, Biden’s plan will give a family with an income of $110,000 annually—which is approximately double the national median household income—$9,000 per year in federal insurance subsidies. Some families with that level of income may not even pay $9,000 annually in federal income taxes, depending upon their financial situation, yet they will receive sizable amounts of taxpayer-funded largesse.

Biden’s staff estimates the plan will cost “only” $750 billion in the coming decade—on top of the estimated $1.6 trillion-plus the federal government will already spend on Obamacare subsidies. But if many individuals end up losing their private coverage to go on to this newly expanded program, costs will soar exponentially.

Price Controls and Regulations

The drug price section of the Biden plan includes the usual leftist tropes about “prescription drug corporations…profiteering off of the pocketbooks of sick individuals.” It proposes typical liberal “solutions” in the form of price controls, whether importing price-controlled pharmaceuticals from overseas, or allowing “an evaluation by…independent board members” (i.e., bureaucrats) to determine prices.

Ironically, Biden’s plan implicitly acknowledges Obamacare’s flaws. In talking about prescription drug pricing, Biden omits any discussion of the “rock-solid deal” that the Obama administration cut with Big Pharma, so that pharmaceutical companies would run ads supporting Obamacare.

Likewise, Biden’s plan notes that “the concentration of market power in the hands of a few corporations is occurring throughout our health care system, and this lack of competition is driving up prices for consumers.” Yet it fails to note the cause of much of this consolidation: Obamacare encouraged hospitals to gobble up physician practices, and each other, to obtain clout in negotiations with insurers. Typically, after acknowledging government’s failures, Biden, like Sanders, prescribes yet more government as the solution.

In the leadup to debate on “repeal-and-replace” legislation several years ago, conservative Republicans said they did not want any replacement to become “Obamacare Lite.” Just as history often repeats itself, Democrats seem ready to embark on a similar intra-party debate. That’s because, no matter how much Biden wants to draw distinctions between his proposals and single payer, his plan looks suspiciously like “SandersCare Lite.”

Biden’s Health Care Plan Demonstrates His Extremism On Abortion,"This week, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden unveiled his health care plan, which attempts to build on the Affordable Care Act. The most notable detail is that it will expand Medicaid and include a taxpayer-sponsored, or “public option,” insurance plan available to everyone.

Most of the subsequent coverage and commentary has focused on the fact Biden is differing from some other candidates by not supporting a “Medicare For All” plan. Indeed, in recent days, Biden has received sharp criticism from Bernie Sanders and other presidential candidates.

Receiving less attention are the plan’s policies dealing with sanctity of life issues. Most of the positions are boilerplate ones we might expect from Democratic presidential candidates. For example, oe Biden supports both federal funding for Planned Parenthood and codifying Roe v. Wade into federal law. In his health-care plan, he also reaffirmed his newfound opposition to the Hyde Amendment, which limits the ability of federal taxpayer dollars to pay for elective abortions.

However, what is unique and what should concern pro-life voters is that, according to his plan, Biden wants the U.S. Justice Department to stop a variety of incremental pro-life laws. These include parental involvement laws, clinic regulations, and waiting periods.

It is by no means clear what a Biden-led Justice Department could actually do about these particular pro-life laws. State-level waiting periods, parental involvement laws, and clinic regulations have all been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the aftermath of both the Roe v. Wade and the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decisions.

That said, Biden is now on the record opposing another set of incremental pro-life laws that enjoy very broad public support. Indeed, five separate Gallup polls taken since 1992 all show that more than 69 percent of Americans support parental involvement laws. Similarly, four polls taken by Gallup since 1992 all find that more than two-thirds of Americans support a law requiring women seeking abortions to wait 24 hours before having the procedure done.

Overall, it seems that Biden and his campaign team may be overreacting to Biden’s performance in the first presidential debate. Since his exchange with Kamala Harris, Biden’s campaign has made a concerted effort to rehabilitate his standing with liberal voters.

These extreme positions on abortion may offer some short-term benefit to Biden during the primaries. However, a body of polling data shows that they will almost certainly cost him during the general election.

Indeed, should Biden receive the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, President Trump and other Republicans should make Biden’s opposition to nearly all incremental pro-life laws—including clinic regulations, waiting periods, and parental involvement laws—a key issue in the 2020 election.

Cory Booker Labels Joe Biden The ‘Architect Of Mass Incarceration’,"U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Cory Booker (D-N.J.) went after rival 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden Wednesday, labeling the former vice president as the “architect of mass incarceration.”

“For a guy who helped to be an architect of mass incarceration, this is an inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country,” Booker told reporters on the sidelines of the 110th annual NAACP convention, as reported by the Washington Examiner.

Booker was referring to Biden’s recent proposal on criminal justice reform released Tuesday that seeks to distance the former Delaware senator from his role in crafting the 1994 crime bill, which he sponsored as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many have since blamed that bill for contributing to the exceptionally high incarceration rates in the United States, particularly among minorities.

Biden pushed back on Booker’s comments Wednesday afternoon, arguing in an official campaign statement that most incarcerated people are serving time for state and local crimes, not federal crimes. The Biden campaign also went on offense, arguing that Booker cracked down hard on crime as mayor of Newark, New Jersey.

“At his inauguration as Mayor of Newark in 2006, Booker promised a zero tolerance policy for minor infractions,” the statement reads, “which is exactly the kind of policy that enmeshed many undeserving people in a criminal justice system that cast a huge shadow over their subsequent lives.”

The plan Biden revealed this week is a sharp reversal from what the tough-on-crime, Delaware Democrat so heavily pushed for in the ’90s. His proposal calls for the elimination of the death penalty, the decriminalization of marijuana, and the ending of incarceration over drug use.

Booker, however, who has made criminal justice reform the centerpiece of his campaign, has pushed back against Biden’s change of platform, saying it’s too little too late.

“We have 5% of the global population but 25% of the world’s prison population,” Booker said to reporters, according to the Examiner. “For him not to have a more comprehensive, bold plan to deal with this is unacceptable to me, especially because he is partly responsible for the crisis that we have.”

Booker’s plan includes an offer of clemency on his first day in office to more than 17,000 people incarcerated for nonviolent drug crimes and would cut mandatory minimum sentences for such crimes in half. Under Booker’s proposal, detailed in a March bill titled the “First Step Act,” the longest mandatory minimum sentence for a nonviolent drug crime would be 10 years instead of 20 years, as the law currently stands.

Many people, including the media and other Democrats, have scrutinized Biden’s record on race issues throughout the campaign. That scrutiny ramped up in June when the candidate shot himself in the foot by touting his relationships with segregationist senators as examples of his “civility.” While Biden worked to backtrack his comments, a closer examination of Biden’s history in the senate revealed Biden to be more than civil, but rather an ally to segregationists in the Senate.

At last month’s first set of Democratic debates in Miami, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) went after Biden for his opposition to busing, a policy used to integrate schools.

“Vice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist,” Harris said standing right next to Biden in the center of the stage. “I also believe — and it’s personal, and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. It was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.”

Biden, Booker, and Harris will each share the same debate stage on the second night of next week’s debates in Detroit, moderated by CNN.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/24/cory-booker-labels-joe-biden-architect-mass-incarceration/,2019-07-24
Joe Biden Poised To Strike In Next Week’s Debates,"Former Vice President Joe Biden declared Wednesday he is not going “to be as polite” at the second round of Democratic debates held next week in Detroit.

“I’m not going to be as polite this time,” Biden said before taking aim at 2020 rival California Sen. Kamala Harris, who attacked Biden over race at the first set of debates in Miami last month. “Because this is the same person who asked me to come to California and nominate her in her convention.”

The comments came during a Detroit fundraiser, as reported by The Detroit News.

Of the 20 candidates who participated in the debates last month, Biden saw his poll numbers slip the most, while Harris saw the largest jump in support, nearly doubling in the polls.

Harris performed strongly in Miami, going after the former Delaware senator for touting his friendly relationships with segregationist senators as examples of “civility.” The California Democrat also highlighted Biden’s previous opposition to busing, a policy used in the mid-20th century to integrate schools.

“Vice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist,” Harris said standing right next to Biden in the center of the stage. “I also believe — and it’s personal, and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. It was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.”

Biden’s pledge Wednesday to go on the offensive next week is in keeping with the aggressive tone he has set in recent days, trading barbs in the press with another 2020 candidate, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who labeled Biden at the 110th NAACP convention as the “architect of mass incarceration,”

“For a guy who helped to be an architect of mass incarceration, this is an inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country,” Booker told reporters at the convention, criticizing Biden’s recent plan on criminal justice reform. “We have 5% of the global population but 25% of the world’s prison population. … For him not to have a more comprehensive, bold plan to deal with this is unacceptable to me, especially because he is partly responsible for the crisis that we have.”

Biden’s proposal released this week features a sharp reversal from what the tough-on-crime Democrat supported during his time in the Senate. While he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden played a key role in crafting the 1994 crime bill, which many have blamed for the exceptionally high incarceration rates in the United States, particularly among minorities.

Biden’s new plan, however, includes a different approach to reform with a focus on rehabilitation over incarceration. Biden is now calling for the decriminalization of marijuana, the elimination of the death penalty, and the end of incarceration over drug use.

The former vice president responded to Booker’s attacks by turning attention to the New Jersey Democrat’s record as mayor of Newark, criticizing his police department for targeting minorities and arguing that the problem was so bad that the Obama administration had to step in.

“His police department was stopping and frisking people, mostly African American men,” Biden told reporters at the NAACP convention, according to the Washington Post. “We took action against them; the Justice Department took action against them, held the police department accountable.”

Shortly after, the Biden campaign released a statement affirming an aggressive defense of the former vice president’s record on race, while criticizing Booker’s past executive leadership.

“At his inauguration as Mayor of Newark in 2006, Booker promised a zero-tolerance policy for minor infractions,” the statement reads. “Which is exactly the kind of policy that enmeshed many undeserving people in a criminal justice system that cast a huge shadow over their subsequent lives.”

Throughout the campaign, Biden’s record on race issues has come under increased scrutiny. While Biden worked to backtrack his comments related to his cozy relationships with segregationist senators, a closer examination of his past conducted by The Federalist’s David Harsanyi revealed Biden to be more than civil with segregationists, but rather he was an ally.

Biden, Booker, and Harris will each share the debate stage again during the second night of debates next week.

Biden remains the 25-candidate field’s front-runner with an average level of support of nearly 29%, more than a 13-point lead ahead of any other candidate in the race, according to RealClearPolitics’ latest aggregate of polls.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/25/joe-biden-poised-to-strike-in-next-weeks-debates/,2019-07-25
8 Top Highlights From Night Two Of The Second Round Of Dem Debates,"Ten out of the 25 major candidates seeking the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination took to the stage of the famous Fox Theatre in Detroit, Michigan last night to make their case to voters for why they’re the best person to challenge President Donald Trump next fall.

The debate, hosted by CNN and moderated by the same panel as last night’s event featuring the network’s Jake Tapper, Dana Bash, and Don Lemon, stayed largely focused on policy, with candidates digging into the details of their complex plans. Here are the highlights from night two.

Harris And Biden Spar Over Health Care

In the most anticipated match-up of the night, former vice president Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) engaged in several heated exchanges Wednesday over race and health care after the California senator blasted the former senator from Delaware on busing in the first set of debates held in June.

Early on, as the candidates discussed health care for nearly the first full hour of the debate, a flustered Harris took heat from all around the stage over the costs of her health care plan, which she unveiled Monday. Biden was Harris’ main critic after jokingly asking the senator to “go easy on me, kid,” as they met on stage at the start of the evening.

Biden blasted Harris’ plan to socialize medicine through a Medicare for All proposal similar to Sen. Bernie Sanders’s as unrealistic.

“This is the single most important issue facing the public,” the former vice president said. “And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward, you can’t beat President Trump with double talk on this plan.”

Biden argued that Harris’ plan is prohibitively expensive, costing taxpayers $3 trillion over ten years, and would knock people off private insurance. Harris argued that her plan provides insurance to everyone in America while Biden’s plan, which builds on the existing Affordable Care Act popularly known as “Obamacare,” still leaves 10 million Americans uninsured.

“Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to health care. Your plan, by contrast, leaves out almost 10 million Americans,” Harris said.

When responding, Biden echoed the infamous line pushing the Affordable Care Act on the 2008 campaign trail, telling voters that if they liked their plan they could keep their plan. That line was listed as PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year in 2013.

“If they like their insurance, they should be able to keep it,” Biden promised, again.

Harris and Booker Tag-Team Biden On Race

In another highly anticipated moment of the night, senators Harris and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) went after Biden over his record on civil rights, with Harris reiterating her attacks on the former vice president’s previous opposition to racially driven busing while in the Senate and Booker going after Biden’s role in crafting the 1994 Crime Bill.

Booker, who labeled Biden the “architect of mass incarceration” last week, said Biden’s recent plan on criminal justice is too little too late after creating laws in the Senate that lead to the exceptionally high rates of incarceration in the United States today.

“Mr. Vice President has said that, since the 1970s, every major crime bill – every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it,” Booker said. “And this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire and you claimed responsibility for those laws. And you can’t just now come out with a plan to put out that fire.”

Biden hit back, turning attention to Booker’s time as mayor of Newark, New Jersey where the police department engaged in stop-and-frisk, resulting in a high number of African-Americans incarcerated.

“You had 75 percent of those stops reviewed as illegal,” Biden chastised. “You found yourself in a situation where three times as many African-American kids were caught in that chain and caught up.”

Moments later, Harris also chimed into the attacks against Biden on race, following up on a landmark moment in their first match-up in June about forcibly busing children of one race into schools predominantly enrolled with children of another race.

“Had those segregationists their way, I would not be a member of the United States Senate, Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate, and Barack Obama would not have been in the position to nominate him to the title he now holds,” Harris said.

Biden came out aggressive and turned the attention to his opponent’s record, noting that Harris presided over some of the most segregated school districts in the country as California’s attorney general, in addition to presiding over police departments abusing their power.

“When Senator Harris was attorney general for eight years in the state of California, there were two of the most segregated school districts in the country, in Los Angeles and in San Francisco,” Biden said. “Secondly, she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there that in fact was abusing people’s right.”

Gabbard Calls Harris a Bad Cop

Tulsi Gabbard’s shining moment of the night came when the Hawaii representative also went after Harris’ time as California’s attorney general.

“Senator Harris says she’s proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she’ll be a prosecutor president but I’m deeply concerned about this record,” Gabbard said. “She put over 15 hundred people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.”

Gabbard also criticized Harris for holding convicts in the state prison system for extended periods of time beyond necessary. Harris responded by saying she created a model criminal justice system for the rest of the country. Gabbard countered.

“The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these people’s lives, you did not,” Gabbard said. “In the case of those who were on death row, innocent people, you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so.”

Gillibrand Calls Biden a Sexist

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) attacked Biden on the sexes when asked a question about penalizing companies that don’t fix alleged inequalities among men and women in the workplace.

“I want to address Vice President Biden directly,” Gillibrand said, bringing up an op-ed Biden wrote on women participating in the labor force outside the home.

“He believed that women working outside the home would, quote, ‘create the deterioration of family.’ He also said that women who were working outside the home were, quote, ‘avoiding responsibility.’” Gillibrand charged.

Biden shrugged off the attack. “That was a long time ago,” he said.

Gillibrand Pledges to ‘Clorox’ the Oval Office

Speaking of women in the home, Gillibrand, an avid feminist who has built her campaign on the Me Too movement, promised to clean on her first day in office.

“So the first thing that I’m going to do when I’m president is I’m going to Clorox the Oval Office,” Gillibrand promised.

The comment came when moderator Dana Bash asked Gillibrand how the Green New Deal, which Gillibrand cosponsors, is a realistic proposal.

Gillibrand then followed her energetic desire to clean with a promise that the second thing she would do in office if elected would be sign back onto the Paris Global Climate Accords and combat climate change.

Harris Attacks Biden On Hyde Amendment

Harris took another jab at the former vice president Wednesday night over his previous support for the Hyde Amendment, which is primarily known for barring federal taxpayer funds from providing abortions.

After Gillibrand calls Biden a sexist for penning an op-ed suggesting women ought to stay at home, Harris scolded Biden for flip-flopping on supporting the Hyde Amendment, opposing it now as he runs for president.

“I mean, talk about now running for president, you change your position on the Hyde Amendment, vice president, where you made a decision for years to withhold resources to poor women to have access to reproductive health care and including women who were the victims of rape and incest,” Harris said. “Do you now say that you have evolved and you regret that?”

Biden said the bill had his support with the condition that private entities could step in and assist in providing abortion services.

Andrew Yang: I’m An Asian Who Likes Math

Andrew Yang, a tech entrepreneur without political experience, opened the night with self-depreciating humor while arguing for a universal basic income.

“We need to do the opposite of much of what we’re doing right now, and the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math,” Yang said. “So let me share the math. A thousand dollars a month for every adult would be $461 million every month, right here in Detroit alone.”

Hecklers Heckle

Hecklers in the auditorium interrupted at several points of the night, causing candidates to stop speaking until the disrupters were removed from the auditorium.

Members of the audience were shouting “fire Pantaleo,” the New York police officer who was not charged in the killing of Eric Garner. The case involving the police officer ended up as a debate topic of the night, with multiple candidates on stage arguing that Mayor Bill de Blasio, another presidential candidate, should have fired the officer.

Top Tweets Of Night Two Of The Second Round Of Democratic Debates,"Did you have enough of the Democratic debates on Tuesday, when the first ten candidates had their battle royal? (Or in Sanders’s case, the battle proletarian?) Was the thought of another three hours watching ten people boast about how much of your life they want to control just too much to bear?

Fear not: we’ve collected the best tweets about the round two of the Democratic debate from Detroit. You can feel like you really watched it without the discomfort of having to have actually done so.

CNN started, as they did last night, with an NFL-style intro segment.

Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones, But Obamacare Can’t Fix Them

The first topic again tonight was healthcare. Kamala Harris has been all over the map about what she says she would do to Americans’ health insurance, and the candidates took the opportunity to pile on her from every direction. She did not handle it well.

Kirsten Gillibrand jumped in briefly.

But Tulsi Gabbard really stole the show.

Harris first emphasizes Sebelius’ love of her plan, which Gabbard criticizes as crony capitalism since Sebelius has financial interests in it, and then Harris says Sebelius merely endorsed it, didn’t write it. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) August 1, 2019

Bennet tried to talk them back into the mainstream, but no one was interested in that.

Michael Bennet on keeping private insurance: “This has nothing to do with Republican talking points. It has everything to do with having faith in the American public that they can make their own choice for their families.” #DemDebate — S.E. Cupp (@secupp) August 1, 2019

Coming To America

They moved next to immigration, with Julian Castro of Texas getting the first chance to answer. After over-enunciating some place names, he tried Harris’s Jedi mind trick on the question of open borders.

“Open borders is a right-wing talking point,” Julian Castro says when asked to respond to criticism from… Obama’s DHS Sec. Jeh Johnson. — Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) August 1, 2019

Joe Biden ain’t no groundhog, Mister Mayor. — Jim Geraghty (@jimgeraghty) August 1, 2019

I am really surprised that everyone but Biden on the stage appears to be good with bashing Obama on what his administration didn’t do. Polling suggests that Obama remains VERY popular among Democrats. — Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) August 1, 2019

The moderators asked Gillibrand to join in, but she wasn’t paying attention.

Lock ‘Em Up

The next topic was crime, and who was the softest on it. According to the more progressive candidates, crime in America has one cause: Joe Biden.

Joe Biden just said prisoners should be given access to resources when they step out of jail, like Pell grants, but Biden’s 1994 crime bill literally took away Pell grants from felons. — Lee Fang (@lhfang) August 1, 2019

Booker tried to make the point, but Biden replied with the gritty details of Booker’s two terms as mayor of Newark.

Joe Biden just wiped the floor with Bookers shitty job as Mayor #DemDebate — Armani Salado (@historyofarmani) August 1, 2019

Booker had a clever rejoinder, but didn’t refute any of what Biden actually said.

Also, Biden’s three points against Booker on policing in Newark were all 100% accurate, but Booker somehow made it all go away with “You’re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don’t even know the flavor” — Jim Geraghty (@jimgeraghty) August 1, 2019

Inexplicably, they now returned to last debate’s kerfuffle over the fifty-year-old fight about busing.

WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT BUSING AGAIN — Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) August 1, 2019

Kamala Harris wasn’t gaining enough traction so she went back to Joe Biden being racist. #DemDebate — Christopher Bedford (@CBedfordDC) August 1, 2019

Kamala Harris just said she would’ve been on the other side of the aisle from Joe Biden in the 70s…so, a Republican? — Andrea Ruth (@AndreaNRuth) August 1, 2019

Kamala Harris says if she’d been in the Senate while Biden was there then she would have supported federally mandated busing (but at this present time presumably she does not?) — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) August 1, 2019

Back to crime, Andrew Yang chimed in with the dollars and cents.

OK, it sounds like Yang will offer me more than $1,000 if I stay out of jail. — James Taranto (@jamestaranto) August 1, 2019

Meanwhile, Biden riposted with some extremely factual attacks on Harris’s tenure as attorney general of California.

Gabbard joined the attack and was even more effective. See for yourself!

Head For The Hills

By now, Harris and Biden began to fade into the background. For Harris it was not embarrassment—she is incapable of such—but perhaps out of feeling wounded by the onslaught of logic against her nonsensical platform.

For Biden, the reason was simpler: it was past his bedtime. The other candidates took advantage, and pushed their weird ideas onto the crowd.

Joe Biden’s Turn Left Will Cost Him The Nomination,"A new Monmouth poll out yesterday showed Joe Biden in third place at 19 percent, a point behind Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both at 20 percent. It is the first poll that has shown him as anything but a strong frontrunner.

Now, the poll had a small sample size and large margin of error. It may well be an outlier. A CNN poll just last week had Biden doubling the numbers of both far-left senators. But it is nonetheless telling.

Biden lost support among moderate and conservative Democrats, who switched their allegiance to the more overtly socialist septuagenarians. A likely explanation for this shift is that those moderates don’t see Biden as substantially different from Warren and Sanders anymore, because thus far he has basically presented himself as a progressive.

Not only has Biden apologized for half the things he achieved in his decades-long career, he has embraced ideas that 1990’s Joe Biden, or even 2008’s Barack Obama, would have derided as absurd. One clear example is one of the most telling and talked about moments of the Democratic primary debates thus far.

During one of the Democratic police line-ups, all of the candidates were asked if they support government-provided, cost-free health care for illegal immigrants. All of the candidates rushed to raise their hands, except for Biden, who bent his elbow, half raised his hand and put a finger up, as if to say, “Yes, but…” It was a bad mistake emblematic of the errors in his candidacy thus far.

The strong move for Biden in that moment would have been to keep his palms planted on the podium, and, as the only dissenter, to talk about how Democrats need real ideas that Americans support, not leftist fantasies about giving people here illegally benefits that citizens don’t even get. Such a move would have been a service not just to his candidacy, but to the entire Democratic Party.

Democratic voters in Texas, Ohio, and Indiana, are not the same as Democratic voters in New York, California, and Massachusetts. Biden all along has had the chance to be the guy saying “This is isn’t about privilege theory, its not about transgender people having abortions, its about jobs and wars and the opioid crisis.”

So why hasn’t he done that? The simplest and most likely reason is that he and his team took moderate voters for granted. It’s kind of easy to see why, since no other major Democrat running, even ones like Beto O’Rourke who could have, chose to challenge Biden in the moderate lane. So it was wide open. It belonged to him, or so it seemed.

Operating under that assumption it made some sense to shift to the left, if he could hold that moderate base and chip away some farther left support from everyone else Biden could build a bigger lead, maybe even approach 50 percent in polling and look like an unstoppable machine. But it does not appear that this strategy has been working.

Even setting aside the new poll as an outlier, Biden has not made inroads among progressive voters. He has, up until now, held a steady flatline of support as the fates of those below him ebb and flow. But now, even worse, it seems the moderates might be walking out of his tent, and it makes sense why.

If Biden is not the realist who will speak truth to leftist power in the party, then what makes him a better choice for moderates than Warren and Sanders, who do draw a lot water in far-left circles? If he’s going to mirror them, then why not just vote for them?

President Trump has often been criticized for playing too strongly to his base. But the base matters, as Biden is finding out. American voters are loyal not to people, but to policies and ideas. When Biden abandoned the policies and ideas he has fought for his whole career, he turned his back on his base. And it seems that chicken is coming home to roost.

Trump understands that politics is transactional. Most moderate Republicans roll their eyes at Trump’s more direct and obvious red meat appeals to his base, but will still vote for him over Democrats who make Vladimir Lenin look like William F. Buckley. And had Biden stuck to actual moderation, he would have maintained his huge advantage among moderates, and still have won the votes of deeper leftists in a potential general election.

Is it possible for Biden to pivot back to the center? Maybe, but it won’t be easy. The progressive Kool-Aid leaves stains that don’t come out. And we may have reached the point where Biden is losing more moderate Democrats than his candidacy can afford.

The Pundit’s Guide To Handicapping The Democratic Nomination,"“2016 really is the deepest GOP field in a very, very long time. In fact, it isn’t even close.” — Sean Trende, RealClearPolitics, Jan. 29, 2015

Five U.S. senators, a former cabinet secretary, a visionary tech entrepreneur, a polyglot mayor-soldier-intellectual, and a crusading former congressman will be on the stage for the third Democratic presidential debate, hosted by ABC on September 12 in Houston. Add to that a former vice president.

Is the Democratic field as strong as it appears? Or is it as weak as the Republican field of 2016 when an outsider thundered onstage and wiped all Republicans away? A fair estimation leads me to think the latter.

A few insufficiently confused friends have asked me to take look at the car crash that is the 2020 race for the Democratic nomination and assess each candidate’s prospects. Fortunately, I’m a resident of Washington, where a pundit’s imprecise predictions do not limit his employment potential.

So, with the disclaimer that previous results are no guarantee of future performance, we begin, examining the silver-tongued politician who hailed Barack Obama as “the first mainstream African-American who is clean and bright and articulate,” that roiling cauldron of political enthusiasm, the presumed Democratic front-runner until he isn’t.

Joe Biden

Occasionally, I’m asked, “Who would be the best Democrat to run against Donald Trump?” It would be a young Joe Biden. Unfortunately for Democrats, that’s not the Joe Biden they have. Instead, the Democrat leading the polls is the Biden we’ve seen wandering around the campaign trail like an escapee from a retirement home, lecherously exploiting gender gaps, and stumbling painfully through debates.

Does Biden lack the clarity of thought and expression he used to have? Yes, and he wasn’t gifted with remarkable abilities in those areas in his best days. In the unforgiving sport of politics, voters will wonder if the trauma of brain surgery and two aneurisms in his mid-40s are now contributing to Biden’s debilities. Biden’s problem is not just his age; it is his health. Time and the stress of a political campaign do not make these problems better, as voters will unavoidably observe.

What a consultant never wants to hear about his candidate is what David Axelrod has said about Biden: “This may be the best he can do.” Pity dooms candidates. When voters like a candidate and determine it is cruel to ask him to bear a burden beyond his abilities, they retire him out of kindness. It will be Biden’s strongest supporters who give him a gold watch, thank him for his service, and put him on the train to Delaware.

Biden’s supporters note Trump also says things that are not true and confuses the facts. There is, however, a difference: Our president distorts events willfully because it is useful, not accidentally because he is unaware.

Biden’s roller-coaster poll numbers are instructive: He sinks during debates when voters see him and rises between debates when voters don’t. When your best campaign is no campaign, Houston, you have a problem.

Recently, even between debates, Biden has been getting too much exposure: The latest Monmouth poll shows Biden sinking to a national tie with Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, nine points behind Warren with liberals (45 percent of Democratic primary voters), losing his “small edge in the early states,” surrendering “His even larger lead in the later states,” and in fourth place at 6 percent with voters under age 50. Joe Biden is running a one-man negative campaign against Joe Biden. Unless someone stops him from campaigning, there is no telling how low he will go.

Biden’s campaign team has gotten the message: They are keeping him away from the campaign trail, ducking routine events, and playing “hide-the-candidate.” Remarkably, Biden’s campaign has replaced its candidate and his unscripted media events with a TV ad, more than five months before Iowa. It is a smart short-term move by Team Biden and may hold up his poll numbers temporarily.

Unfortunately for candidates who melt in the campaign sun, in presidential contests, TV ads become less effective closer to the election. Increasingly, voters see candidates directly, through the burning-hot lens of the omnipresent news media and the intense magnifying glass of social media. In short, Biden can run and hide, but not to election day.

In my experience, enthusiasm gaps like Biden’s engender upsets. Biden could be 10 percent to 15 percent ahead of Warren or Sanders and still lose to either in Iowa. I suspect that, before Iowa votes, it should be obvious he is not going to make it.

The decision he will face, available to him only before Iowa, is whether to drop out and preserve his place in history, or add an unnecessary last chapter of failure and embarrassment to a long book filled with success and affection. I’d expect to see a chorus of Biden’s supporters urging him to drop out before Iowa has its say.

Friends ask, “If Biden’s that weak, what is holding up his polling numbers?” It is not Biden’s name recognition or stature as former vice president. It is the lack of an electable alternative. Biden’s unenthusiastic supporters do not yet have anywhere to go.

Biden voters are trapped at a dull Biden speech, balloons deflating, campaign signs on the floor, and the only door out of the room leads to the rest of the Democratic field, where each and every candidate is making his or her best effort to become unelectable. That fittingly brings us to the revolutionary curmudgeon of Democratic politics, Russian honeymooner, millionaire author, and member of the 1 percent.

Bernie Sanders

Bernie Sanders’ problem is that in politics, as in the bedroom, it is difficult to lose one’s virginity a second time. In 2016, Sanders was a bright, distinctive voice for change, the only populist, revolutionary alternative to Hillary Clinton.

Bernie didn’t win the nomination, but he succeeded. He converted the Democratic Party to his public display of socialism. Bernie’s 2016 run paved the path for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Squad to become the inspirational soul of the Democratic Party. He opened the door so every Democratic candidate could raise his hand for wacky, leftist ideas like free government-run health care, even for illegal aliens.

Now, Bernie’s work is done. He blazed the trail that normalized socialism throughout the Democratic firmament. Bernie has nothing more to contribute: When every candidate is Bernie Sanders, simply younger, more charismatic, and slightly less disagreeable, why do Democrats need the original?

That leads us to the real frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, the Harvard Law professor for the working man, Bernie Sanders 2.0.

Elizabeth Warren

We’ve all seen the horror movie where the Monster returns from the grave. It always comes back stronger, angrier, and more resilient. Scarred and furious, the Monster is much tougher to stop the second time. Nothing is stronger than a candidate who has lost, learned, and grown, a candidate who has taken a beating and renewed herself.

That’s the big news: Pocahontas is back, drawing the largest crowds of any Democrat, although everyone thought she was dead and buried. Her counterfeit Indian heritage, all 1/1000th percent of it, is now built into her stock price.

As Peter Theil noted, she is the most dangerous candidate on the Democratic side because she has the clearest lecture on the economy. Unlike Democratic candidates who stand for everything and nothing, Warren knows exactly what her campaign is about and, native heritage aside, who she really is.

She is the most dangerous candidate on the Democratic side because she has the clearest lecture on the economy.

If Sanders is yesterday’s revolutionary-populist, Warren is tomorrow’s. Polling cements Warren as the candidate with the broadest support across the Democratic Party, college-professors and working class, men and women, left and farther left. Other than Sanders, who has been promoted to socialist emeritus, Warren is the only candidate who is an unambiguous populist, not just a lefty, European-style socialist. Only Warren is harnessing the working-class revolutionary passion that helped Sanders nearly beat Hillary Clinton.

And Warren has used that passion to build an organization. She has a top-notch ground game and social media effort, both amplified by the clearest message of any Democratic candidate: “The big and powerful are screwing the average American and I’m running to protect them.”

Warren has marshaled that populist resentment to support the most detailed and comprehensive mechanism to wage the class struggle since Karl Marx wrote “Das Kapital.” No matter the problem, Warren “has a plan for that.” Her plans even have T-shirts.

Does Warren’s enraged, radical socialism limit her in a general election? It does, thankfully. Reparations for slavery, the end of private health insurance, free health care for illegal aliens, hard-hearted demonization of employers, the elimination of sex distinctions, potential decriminalization of prostitution, a legislative wish for everything—Warren’s presidential campaign has breached the levees.

Does Warren’s enraged, radical socialism limit her in a general election? It does, thankfully.

Amazingly enough, the former Harvard professor doesn’t look as nutty as she is when standing next to a Democratic field determined to outbid her. Compared to the Squad, even Warren, on occasion, looks like a centrist.

So, in Democratic primaries and caucuses, Warren’s algorithm is powerful: angry populist + angry socialist + angry woman = Democratic nomination. Currently, in the Real Clear Politics polling average in New Hampshire, Warren trails Biden by 6 percent and Sanders by 4 percent. If Warren wins Iowa, takes a head of steam into New Hampshire, and edges out Sanders in the Granite State, it won’t matter if Sanders stays in the race. His votes will belong to her.

The open question for Warren remains electability. Has she tacked so far left to win the nomination that she loses it? Do Democratic voters fear she can’t do the one thing they want most: defeat Trump in a general election? I suspect not, because of the candidate she is running against: Trump polarizes voters and consistently underperforms in surveys, so Warren should always tie or lead Trump in surveys, just like everybody else.

Warren also has a distinction no other Democrat can boast: She has been the object of Trump’s affection at a level no other contender has attained. Pocahontas can pick a fight with Trump at any moment and guarantee a stream of valentines from the President’s Twitter feed.

When you can jump at will into the ring with the champ, you are the number one contender. And that is where we leave Warren as we turn to the rest of the Democratic field, including the Cheshire Cat of the 2020 race.

Kamala Harris

Kamala Harris has a big smile and very little behind it. In sheer charisma, Harris is the candidate most like Obama in the 2020 field, but without a millimeter of Obama’s depth.

Obama withstood shots like Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s “God d-mn America!” and didn’t buckle. Obama appeased both Democratic centrists and leftists without appearing compromising, weak, or hypocritical. The same cannot be said for Harris, who gave Biden a good shot in the first debate and then displayed a glass jaw. On her feet, without the aid of prepared remarks, she seems unable to give as good as she gets or handle second-order debate.

On her feet, without the aid of prepared remarks, Harris seems unable to give as good as she gets or handle second-order debate.

Candidates with depth don’t attack an opponent for holding the same position they do on busing, as Harris did. Serious candidates don’t attack the same Medicare for All bill they have sponsored, although Harris did that as well. More importantly, Harris has tied herself into a knot running away from her prosecutorial record in California.

Instead of owning it and demonstrating strength, e.g., “Darn right, I was a tough prosecutor. If you commit a crime, if you victimize the weakest among us, and especially if you target disadvantaged African-American victims, I’m going to come after you, regardless of whether you are black, white, or purple.”

No, Harris tried to pretend she had been something she was not, while her record mysteriously disappeared from the government of California’s website. As I’ve said of Harris, when you’ve locked up more black Americans than George Wallace, it’s hard to be the greatest civil rights advocate in American history. And when you float around like a butterfly on issues and process your record through a blender, you raise doubts you can lead the nation.

So, what becomes of Harris? Not much, I suspect. If Biden collapses in Iowa and staggers through New Hampshire without dropping out, his black support is still likely to crumble by South Carolina. Black backing clings to Biden lightly, only because Obama chose him as vice president. Pointedly, as we all know, he does not have Obama’s support today.

When you float around like a butterfly on issues and process your record through a blender, you raise doubts you can lead the nation.

If Biden begins to dissolve, black Democratic leaders in Congress and the professionally aggrieved black-victimhood industry will abandon ship to preserve their fading power. They will start attaching themselves to other candidates like remoras.

The black vote is more likely to solidify around whoever is developing momentum than a weak candidate like Harris. If she has not hooked up the jumper cables to her campaign and given it a boost before she gets to California, she will likely find her support waning in her home state. Then, having demonstrated the lack of character that would make her a superb vice-president, she can start practicing going to funerals, while other candidates extend their embarrassment, including this next candidate.

Julian Castro

Castro is filling the now-obligatory Hispanic candidate slot. Occasionally in his first two debates, we’ve seen glimmers he can grow beyond it. Unfortunately, the more successful he becomes in establishing himself as the “Hispanic” candidate, the more he limits his opportunity to expand his identity. He’ll go nowhere until he resolves this conflict.

Castro once had his brother, an identical twin, secretly take his place on a parade float. Well, until we ascertain whether it is Julian or Joaquin Castro who is running, we can turn to a Democrat with an even fuzzier identity.

Corey Booker

Even in this pitiably weak field, Cory Booker seems unable to distinguish himself. Physically, there is a cartoonish, Muppet-like quality to the New Jersey senator that makes it difficult to take him seriously: He displays large, unblinking eyes on a monochromatic, featureless head.

Booker’s lightweight appearance accurately reflects a deeper problem: Booker is afraid to say anything unpopular. Booker’s campaign is featureless. He has the courage to say whatever Democratic voters want to hear, turning his message into forgettable background noise, the indistinguishable hum of tires on the campaign bus to nowhere.

Appropriately enough, that allows us to roll on to another candidate going nowhere and getting there quickly, the Lancelot of 2020.

Beto O’Rourke

Beto’s support seems to follow the inverse square law: The fewer his supporters, the more intensely they embrace their candidate. Beto’s fans see their candidate as a romantic figure, bringing purity to politics. For them, he is a true believer with the infectious power to make them believe.

As much as I love campaigns built on idealism, there is little room in today’s angry Democratic politics for romantic figures, a knight on a white horse, like Beto. Problematically, there is also nowhere else for such candidates to go: When Beto went negative at the end of his race against Ted Cruz, it eroded his purity. The problem with riding white horses is that you can’t get a speck of mud on them.

Even in King Arthur’s day, the romance of the Round Table did not last long. Neither, I suspect, will O’Rourke. But we still have all the excitement Minnesota can offer in another candidate.

Amy Klobuchar

Some pets we allow in our homes to become part of the family and play with the children. Others, we don’t. We keep the guard dog outside, where he is useful, knowing he might scare the children, growl at visitors, or bite grandma if we ever let him in. Right now, voters are keeping Amy Klobuchar outside the house, chained to a stake.

Given the choice, we would like our president to lead with both strength and compassion. Yes, Trump was chosen because of his bite: Republicans wanted to chew up the Washington establishment. Democrats, who want to preserve and expand that establishment, want a tough but friendlier companion.

Right now, Democrats can’t imagine petting Klobuchar—she’s a biter. If warmth inhabited Klobuchar, she could have contended for Biden’s “tough-moderate” lane, once the former veep vacated it. She hasn’t been able to find that kind-heartedness. Until then, we can take off our ties, move to higher ground, and consider a friendlier animal, already housebroken.

Andrew Yang

A portion of the Democratic Party does not value work and would, if given a choice, end it. They see work as something we are required to do, not as an indispensable element of our nobility, moral growth, and self-worth. Andrew Yang represents that perspective.

He believes machines will soon replace man and tells us that when our current desires are met by robotic engines, we will reach the end of history. He tells us we must prepare for a world where man has nothing more to want or produce, so we must grab $1,000 a month from the government and surrender to a life without work.

But that is not the human story. Man’s history of ambition and desire, and our insatiable hunger for meaning, tell us we will never stop searching for something better. If our work is mechanized or computerized, the inventive American mind will find more products to make, better services to provide, and new frontiers to imagine. Americans will never run out of work: We will create it.

Yang’s youthful and optimistic campaign lends politics an attractive simplicity. But imagining a world without work and offering $1,000 for breathing is the immature expression of an adolescent. I hope Yang ripens and puts on a tie, like the last candidate on the list.

Pete Buttigieg

The South Bend mayor may be last on our list, but he is not last with the oddsmakers. Buttigieg has not yet caught on beyond his base, but he is a polyglot, polymath, soldier, Christian, big-thinker who plays the piano. He’s gay in a party that celebrates tolerance. More importantly, he represents something new in an aging Democratic Party that only aims to return to what it was before Trump’s day.

If Buttigieg can become the candidate who represents something different than what Democrats were before Trump, he could evolve into a transformational candidate. Mayor Pete could lead his party into the future. With his public embrace of his faith, small-town values, and patriotic military service, he is one of the few Democrats with crossover potential. Buttigieg could contend for centrist votes Biden will abdicate.

With his public embrace of his faith, small-town values, and patriotic military service, he is one of the few Democrats with crossover potential.

However, these are angry times. After eight years of George W. Bush, our country was hungry for a cool, intellectual candidate of the future, who spoke of hope and change and hit jump shots. Democrats have no appetite for that today.

Now, even in the Democratic primary, cool Obama is routinely administered a whacking. Our country wants fire and brimstone. I suspect Buttigieg, despite his many gifts, is not angry enough for this moment and this election will not bring his day.

I hope he remains who he is and plays out his hand authentically. It would say something good about America if he gained the Democratic nomination. I would not bet my house on him, but if I were betting your house, perhaps. Buttigieg is one great speech away from getting the ride that makes him a 2024 contender.

Now you’ve got your 2020 Democratic Debate Playbook. If you worry that these 10 fine examples of Democratic political pulchritude may come into your TV room for only one night of riveting deliberation, good news: A billionaire, eco-activist coal investor and the first Hindu Hawaiian Samoan American to run for president are only a couple of polls away from also making the stage. If so, they’ll split the field into two stimulating nights of debating.

Biden Forgets What Year It Is

Biden Mistakes Libya For Syria At G7 Summit

President Joe Biden mixed up Syria for Libya three times at the G7 Summit in England during June 13 remarks on Russian aggression in the Middle East where humanitarian aid is needed.

“In Libya, we should be opening up the passes to be able to go through and provide, provide food assistance and economic assist— I mean, vital assistance to a population that’s in real trouble,” Biden said, going on to charge Russia with violations of international norms in Syria, and then again referenced Libya.

“As long as they’re there without the ability to bring about some order in the region, you can’t do that very well without providing for the basic economic needs of people,” Biden said. “So I’m hopeful that we can find an accommodation where we can save the lives of people in, for example, in Libya.”

Biden Gets Corrected At G7 Summit After Insisting On Introduction Of South Africa President

Biden was corrected by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the G7 Summit in England on June 13 when Biden interrupted the host leader to demand he introduce the president of South Africa, who had just been introduced.

“And the president of South Africa,” Biden cut into Johnson’s roundtable remarks.

“And the president of South Africa, as I said earlier on,” Johnson dismissed.

“Oh, you did,” a frail Biden said at the table while others laughed.

“I did, I certainly did,” Johnson finished.

Biden Confuses Titles Of World Leaders

President Joe Biden confused the titles of South Korean President Moon Jae-in on May 21, 2021, a day after the U.S. president referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “President Netanyahu.”

Biden made the remark about the South Korean president, calling the president “prime minister” while presenting a Medal of Honor to a 94-year-old Korean War veteran.

“The people in the Republic of Korea haven’t forgotten, as evidenced by the fact that the prime minister of Korea is here for this ceremony,” Biden said, according to the New York Post.

Biden confused Netanyahu’s title the day before in remarks celebrating the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

Biden Can’t Remember Who His Secretary of Defense Is

Biden appeared to forget who his secretary of defense was during a White House event promoting two female generals on International Women’s Day, March 8.

During an Oct. 25 online event, Biden appeared to confuse President Trump with former President George W. Bush.

“This is the most consequential election in a long, long, long time. And the character of the country in my view is literally on the ballot,” Biden said. “What kind of country are we going to be? Four more years of George, uh, George, uh… Going to find ourselves in a position where if Trump gets elected, we’re going to be in a different world.”

Biden Says 200 Million Have Died from COVID-19

During a Sept. 20 campaign speech in Philadelphia, the former vice president wrongly claimed 200 million had succumbed to the novel Wuhan coronavirus, apparently mistaking “million” for “thousand.”

“If Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19 which are well beyond, what they should be, it’s estimated that 200 million people have died probably by the time I finish this talk,” Biden said.

At the time of the address, nearly 200,000 Americans had fallen from the virus and almost one million have passed away worldwide.

Biden Confuses Basic Facts on Portland Shooting

On Sept. 2., Biden misconstrued the facts of a recent shooting in Portland when an Antifa demonstrator shot and killed a member of a pro-Trump caravan parading through the city.

“I think what happened in Portland, where a, one of the Trump guys riding along in vans inciting response, shooting rubber bullets I guess, or paintballs, apparently there was someone shot by someone in the crowd, with a bullet, killed,” Biden said.

The one deadly shooting came from a man who identified as “100% Antifa” and was later killed in a police shootout with police on Sept. 3., in the process of being arrested.

Biden Misuses ‘Woke’

Biden doesn’t appear to understand the understand the word “woke,” the popular phrase characterizing one’s devoted commitment to social justice that has come to define the current political moment.

“Everybody’s been woked,” Biden said during a July 8 interview with ABC News, equivocating the term with an awakening. “Well guess what? The rest of the working-class people in America have been awakened.”

Biden Claims He Is ‘Constantly Tested’ for Cognitive Decline

Biden claimed he is “constantly tested” for cognitive decline amid growing concerns over his health and age when questioned about it during a June 30 press conference.

“Some have speculated that you are subject to some degree of cognitive decline,” one Fox News reporter said. “I’m 65. I don’t have the word recollection that I used to have. I forget my train of though from time to time. You got 12 years on me, sir. Have you been tested for some degree of cognitive decline?”

“I’ve been tested, and I’m constantly tested,” Biden asserted.

The Biden campaign however, declined Federalist requests for test results.

The “thing” Biden was referring to of course, is the Declaration of Independence.

Here is the full line that Biden forgot:

“I got started out at an HBCU, Delaware State. Now I don’t want to hear anything negative about Delaware State here. They’re my folks,” Biden said during a South Carolina town hall.

Biden Refers to Stop & Shop Strike as ‘Rite Aid Strike’

During a Sept. 17 speech at an AFL-CIO event in Philadelphia, Biden spoke about his April visit to Boston to address the Stop & Shop workers strike after contract negotiations broke down, prompting 30,000 workers to walk off their jobs for 11 days. Biden, however, called it the “Rite Aid strike.”

“When I went up to the — there was the Rite Aid strike. I looked out in that parking lot when I was talking with the folks, and I was walking a picket line up in Boston,” Biden said, according to the Boston Herald.

Rite Aid was founded in Biden’s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania.

‘Make Sure You Have the Record Player On at Night’

Responding to a question about his opposition to reparations for slavery during the third Democratic primary debate in September, Biden pivoted to discussing gaps in education and encouraged teachers and parents to “have the record player on at night.”

“They don’t — they don’t know quite what to do,” Biden said, referring to parents not knowing how to raise their children and then offered some advice. “Play the radio, make sure the television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night. … Make sure that kids hear words.”

Biden Confuses Iraq and Afghanistan

Biden appeared to mix up Iraq and Afghanistan in September’s Democratic debate when talking about his opposition to President Barack Obama’s decision to send an additional 40,000 troops to Afghanistan in 2009.

“The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counterinsurgency, meaning that we’re going to put that country together,” Biden said. “It will not be put together. It’s three different countries. Pakistan owns the three counties — the three provinces in the east. They’re not any part of — the Haqqanis run it.”

Biden’s answer was confusing not only because he used the terms “country,” “county,” and “provinces” interchangeably, but because he was confusing the situation in Afghanistan with Iraq.

Steve Saideman, an expert on Afghanistan at Carleton University, told Vox he found Biden’s answer baffling.

“When talking about Afghanistan and reaching an agreement, I have never heard anyone refer to three regions,” Saideman said. “While federalism will probably play a role, the numbers there are around 30 or so for all of the provinces, not three.”

“Biden might have confused Afghanistan with Iraq,” Saideman added.

In the 2000s, Biden proposed splitting up Iraq into three regions divided among the Sunnis, Shias, and the Kurdish.

Biden Says It’s ‘Absolutely Mindless’ Magazines with Multiple Rounds Have Not Been Banned

Speaking to reporters at a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Biden criticized Trump following another mass shooting in Texas that occurred over Labor Day weekend 2019, killing seven people. Biden called it “absolutely mindless” that firearm magazines with more than one round have not been banned.

“The idea that we don’t have elimination of assault type weapons, magazines that can hold multiple bullets in them, it’s absolutely mindless,” Biden said, going on to argue that such a ban would not violate the Second Amendment.

Biden says it's ""absolutely mindless"" we haven't banned ""magazines that can hold multiple bullets in them,"" bc it would not violate the 2A.

Biden Makes Up War Story

On Aug. 29, the Washington Post exposed Biden for fabricating a war story told repeatedly over the course of his tenure as vice president and on the 2020 campaign trail. On the stump, Biden often recounts a trip he made to Afghanistan while serving as vice president, frequently shifting the details of the trip, which the Post reported were demonstrably false. According to the Post, Biden visited the Middle Eastern country in 2008 when he was a senator, not vice president, and got nearly every other major detail of the trip wrong several times.

Biden doubled-down on the story however, rejecting the claims by the Washington Post and standing by his statements regarding the fabricated trip.

‘I’m Not Going Nuts’

Biden forgot which building he was speaking in during a stop at Dartmouth College on Aug. 24, in New Hampshire.

Biden Says He Was Vice President During Parkland Massacre

On Aug. 10, Biden claimed he was still vice president during the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which happened on Feb. 14, 2018. Biden, however, had been out of office for more than a year at that point.

“Those kids in Parkland came up to see me when I was vice president,” Biden told reporters in Iowa, according to Bloomberg News.

A campaign official told Bloomberg that Biden meant to refer to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, which occurred in December 2012 and killed 26 people, 20 of whom were children between the ages of 6 and 7.

‘There Are at Least Three’ Genders

A Turning Point USA field staffer confronted Biden in Iowa on Aug. 9, asking him, “How many genders are there?”

“There are at least three,” Biden said, trying to appease the liberal wing of the Democratic Party that has been pushing society to abandon two-gender biology.

The staffer pressed Biden on the question. “What are they?” she inquired.

“Don’t play games with me, kid,” Biden said before grabbing the young staffer’s arm to explain his previous support for gay marriage. “By the way, the first one to come out for marriage was me.”

‘Poor Kids Are Just as Bright as White Kids’

The former vice president said he misspoke when he told the Asian and Latino Coalition in Des Moines, Iowa, on Aug. 8 that “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.”

“We should challenge students in these schools to have advanced placement programs in these schools,” Biden said. “We have this notion that if you’re poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.”

As the audience reluctantly began to applaud during the silence, Biden tried to fix his remarks. “Wealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids — no, I really mean it,” Biden said.

‘We Believe in Truth over Facts.’

Biden adopted freshman New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s philosophy on disregarding facts in the name of feelings on Aug. 8 at the opening day of the Iowa State Fair.

“We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction. We choose truth over facts,” Biden told the receptive crowd at the Des Moines Register Political Soapbox.

Joe Biden: “we choose truth over facts” The crowd cheerspic.twitter.com/QLqXa8Qmm2 — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) August 8, 2019

Biden’s new ideas regarding facts are in line with the beliefs of Ocasio-Cortez, who has been on record saying facts don’t matter as long as people are morally right.

“There’s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right,” the New York congresswoman said on CBS’ “60 Minutes” with Anderson Cooper in January.

Biden Misses Locations of Back-to-Back Shootings, Refers to Michigan and Houston

At a California fundraiser on Aug. 4, Biden offered sympathy for victims of back-to-back shootings that occurred earlier in the month. He referred to the shootings that occurred in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, as “tragic events in Houston today and also in Michigan the day before.”

He delivered the remarks at a San Diego fundraiser to a gathering of 75 attendees. San Diego Union-Tribune reporter Lyndsay Winkley, who was a pool reporter for the event, confirmed the mishap.

‘Joe 30330’

During CNN’s prime time presidential debate on July 31, Biden directed voters to “go to Joe 30330,” in what sounded like an attempt to plug his own campaign website during his closing statement, leaving viewers confused.

“This is the United States of America. When we’ve acted together, we have never, never, never been unable to overcome whatever the problem was,” Biden said. “If you agree with me, go to Joe 30330 and help me in this fight.”

When asked the next day what he would have done differently in the debate, Biden addressed the gaffe.

“Instead of saying ‘Joe’ I would have said ‘text,’” Biden told reporters in Detroit. “I was so focused on making the case for Joe, I said ‘Joe,’ and I gave the number. It was text so, you know, I would have changed that.”

Biden Touts Relationships with Segregationist Senators as Examples of Civility

In June, Biden touted his friendly relationships with segregationist senators during his time in the senate as examples of his “civility” and ability to work with others.

“At least there was some civility,” Biden told donors at a fundraiser. “We got things done. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished.”

Biden specifically referenced Sens. James Eastland, D-Miss., and Herman Talmadge, D-Ga., to supporters.

The remarks drew immediate backlash from several Democratic rivals who seized on the comments to attack Biden, putting the former senator from Delaware on defense to protect his record on civil rights.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., used the comments to go after Biden on race during the Miami debate in what became one of the hallmark moments of the night.

“Vice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist,” Harris said, standing right next to him. “I also believe — and it’s personal, and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. It was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.”

Harris’ support doubled in post-debate polls while Biden’s sank. Biden, however, comfortably maintained his front-runner status in the race.

Biden Tells Paraplegic State Senator To Stand Up

At a fall 2008 campaign rally in Missouri, Biden told state Sen. Chuck Graham to stand up for the entire audience. Graham, however, is paralyzed from a car accident and sits in a wheelchair.

“I’m told Chuck Graham, state senator, is here. Stand up, Chuck, let ’em see you,” Biden said before realizing Graham was confined to a chair. “Oh, God love you. What am I talking about? I’ll tell you what, you’re making everybody else stand up, though, pal.”

Biden then urged the audience to “stand up for Chuck.”

Biden Calls Obama First Mainstream African American Who Is ‘Articulate’ and ‘Clean’

On the same day Biden filed official paperwork for his 2008 presidential campaign, he raised eyebrows when he called then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., the first mainstream African American that is “articulate” and “clean.”

“You got the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,” Biden told The New York Observer. “I mean, that’s a storybook.”

Biden immediately apologized for his remarks. “I deeply regret any offense my remark in the New York Observer might have caused anyone. That was not my intent and I expressed that to Sen. Obama,” Biden said in a statement, later telling reporters that his comments were being taken out of context.

‘You Can’t Go to a 7-11 or Dunkin’ Donuts Unless You Have an Indian Accent’

In the summer of 2006, then-Sen. Biden of Delaware remarked about the growing Indian population in the state on C-SPAN’s “Road to the White House,” when speaking with an Indian supporter.

“In Delaware, the largest growth of population is Indian Americans, moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin’ Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent,” Biden said. “I’m not joking.”

A Biden spokesperson told the Associated Press that “the point Senator Biden was making is that there has been a vibrant Indian-American community in Delaware for decades.”

Joe Biden Isn’t Even Close To A Moderate,"If you’ve been watching the coverage of the 2020 Democratic primary, the mainstream media would have you believe former vice president Joe Biden is a moderate in the race. That is simply not the case. In fact, it’s the exact opposite.

Although Biden stated to reporters back in April that “I’m an Obama-Biden Democrat, man. And I’m proud of it,” he’s moved far left of the Obama era and continues to do so on several key issues pertaining to everyday Americans. Biden’s progressive lurch to the left comes as he tries to keep in line with his fellow 2020 competitors, most notably Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

Biden Endorsed the Green New Deal

During CNN’s seven-hour climate change town hall last week, Biden endorsed the idea of the Green New Deal, the $93 trillion proposal that aims to eliminate the use of all fossil fuels, ban “combustion-engine vehicles” and air travel, and claims to guarantee every American a job, even those who are “unable or unwilling to work.” When asked if the Green New Deal went too far, Biden gave an unequivocal “no,” even implying that the deal does not go “far enough” with specifics. Biden’s support for banning all fossil fuels isn’t new, as he backed the very same concept during July’s Democratic debate.

Fossil fuels represent the lifeblood of the American economy, and outright banning them would result in millions of Americans out of work and unemployed, particularly in the Rust Belt states in the Midwest. Biden’s stance on fossil fuel elimination puts him at odds with the blue-collar workers the media claims he represents, pushing him into a difficult position if he were to become the nominee to take on President Trump in 2020.

Biden Favors Radical Gun Control

Biden’s leftward drift also applies to gun control, where at a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the former vice president said, “The idea that we don’t have elimination of assault-type weapons, magazines that can hold multiple bullets in them — it’s absolutely mindless. It’s no violation of the Second Amendment,” when asked about the recent mass shooting in Midland and Odessa, Texas.

Banning firearms that have “magazines that hold multiple bullets in them” would outlaw the vast majority of firearms in America, virtually throwing the Second Amendment under the bus and taking away the constitutional rights of millions of law-abiding Americans. Biden’s stance on gun control matches that of his fellow 2020 candidates who have called for similar proposals for gun confiscation and banning of certain firearms, demonstrating his ever-continuing shift to the left on key issues and moving him further away from centrist voters.

Biden Supports Taxpayer Funding of Abortion

Another area in which the former vice president has moved to the left is on abortion. Back in June, when asked whether he supported the Hyde Amendment, Biden flip-flopped on the issue, at first opposing it, then supporting it, and then ultimately opposing it again. The Hyde Amendment, which bars federal taxpayer money from funding abortions, became a hot-topic question among 2020 Democrats back in June. Biden buckled under the pressure of the progressive wing of the party.

Taxpayer funding of abortions is not something most Americans support, however. A Marist University poll showed that 54 percent of Americans oppose any taxpayer funding for abortions, compared to 39 percent who support it. Biden’s leftward swing and flip-flop on the abortion issue demonstrates his out-of-touch mentality towards the majority of Americans, leaving him on shaky ground concerning an issue that will surely play heavily in the 2020 primary and general election.

Biden Wants Taxpayers to Pay Illegal Entrants’ Health Care

Even on immigration, Biden’s “moderate” masquerade falls apart on health care for illegal U.S. entrants. Back in May, when a reporter asked him about his stance, Biden replied, “I think that anyone who is in a situation where they’re in need of health care, regardless of whether they are documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they are cared for.”

This was a position Biden later reaffirmed during the June Democratic debate, when the candidates were asked to raise their hands if they supported providing health care for illegal immigrants. All the candidates on stage, including Biden, raised their hands.

Supporting health care for illegal immigrants may not necessarily hurt Biden in the primary against his fellow Democrats, but if he becomes the nominee, don’t think for a second that President Trump won’t use it as a club to beat Biden over the head in the general election. That’s especially when many American citizens are having difficulty affording health care, in large part thanks to the catastrophe of Obamacare, which Biden played a role in implementing.

Biden’s phony moderate shtick will only hold up for so long, as true moderate and centrist voters will begin to see his tendencies to move far left with the rest of the party on key issues. Heading into 2020, the media will continue trying to portray Biden as the level-headed moderate the Democrats need to beat Trump in the general election. Yet his continuous swing to the left will only alienate him from the very voters he’ll need to win over in 2020, only increasing Trump’s chances of reelection to a second term.

Joe Biden Tried To Get Russia Into Iraq War With Promises Of Oil Profits,"Joe Biden “talks the talk” about his disdain for Russia, but he has yet to “walk the walk” with a hardball stance. Not only did Russia interfere in the 2016 election, under Biden’s watch, but it turns out Biden tried to buy Russia’s support of the Iraq War by promising Vladimir Putin oil money.

Before the United States’ 2003 invasion of Iraq, as senator Biden had a talk with Putin in hopes of gaining Russia’s support. At a 2004 event held at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, Biden told listeners that he had met with Putin while trying to get other nations to back the invasion, the Washington Free Beacon reported today from the event transcript.

“What if, in fact, President Bush would agree that the first proceeds coming from Iraqi oil would pay off the roughly $12 billion owed by direct hard currency that the Russians needed? And what about the contracts that we had if in fact we would agree to work in consortium with the Russians?” Biden said he asked Putin.

Later in his speech, Biden referenced this type of interaction with Putin as “creative diplomacy.”

In 2019, during an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, however, Biden was singing a different tune about Russia. Biden called Putin a dictator and criticized President Trump for working with Russia in ways Biden had attempted himself.

“He’s embracing thugs, he’s embracing Kim Jung-Un who’s a thug. He’s embracing Putin who’s a flat dictator,” Biden said to Cuomo.

On foreign policy, Biden says President Trump is dissing allies and “embracing thugs.” “If he wins reelection, I promise you there will be no NATO in 4 years or 5 years.” https://t.co/tDM9CsVNv8 pic.twitter.com/BPUnmtNKXI — CNN (@CNN) July 5, 2019

The much-discussed Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections took place when Biden was vice president. Yet during an interview with CNN, Biden insisted Russian interference would never happen under his watch.

“You think that would have happened on my watch or Barack’s watch? You can’t answer that, but I promise you it wouldn’t have, and it didn’t,” Biden said.

Biden also now says he regrets voting for the Iraq War. He also claimed that immediately after voting for the war, he regretted it. However, nine months after he voted to invade Iraq, Biden said he stood by his vote.

“Nine months ago, I voted with my colleagues to give the president of the United States of America the authority to use force and I would vote that way again today,” Biden said during a July 2003 speech. “It was the right vote then and would be a correct vote today.”

Biden has a record of working with Putin (which he now claims is wrong), voting for a war (which he now claims he regrets), and not stopping Russian interference (which he now claims wasn’t his fault). With this record, it is unclear what Biden’s foreign policy would look like if he were elected president.

Here Are The Best Tweets From The Third Democratic Primary Debate,"Last night in Houston, the Democrats crammed twenty pounds of malarkey into a ten-pound sack when they reduce the field by hook or by crook and got us down to just one debate of ten presidential candidates. Some had dropped out, others were squeezed out, but those who remained came to Texas to offer their ideas about what ails this country. For three interminable hours.

Maybe you were wrapped up in a ballgame or just fell asleep halfway through the debate. Not to worry! We’ve got the best tweets of the night to bring you up to speed.

Part 1: Where’s Tulsi?

The moderators were led by Clinton White House official journalist George Stephanopoulos, and opening statements began with the usual banalities.

Klobuchar: “I don’t want to be the President for half of America, I want to be the President for ALL of America.” #DemDebate — S.E. Cupp (@secupp) September 13, 2019



Robert O’Rourke—remember him?—took it up a notch by accusing the President of mass murder. But at least he didn’t use any foul language.

Beto had better drop an f-bomb in his opening statement if he ever wants to get above 3% in the polls. #DemDebate — Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) September 13, 2019



Andrew Yang proposed, instead, a novel tactic: vote-buying?

Silicom Valley reinventing bribing voters is amazing https://t.co/cSimzaDrZW — Noah Rudnick (@rudnicknoah) September 12, 2019

Yang is now the Joker in the Batman (1989), throwing free money from the platform — Matthew Continetti (@continetti) September 13, 2019

Laughing at Yang’s gimmick is the best thing that will happen tonight. — Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) September 13, 2019

Unaccetpable that Andrew Yang failed to give Nick Saban credit for his idea to give 10 select familys 120k per year — PFTCommenter (@PFTCommenter) September 13, 2019



Bernie sounded like he needed some of that “free” healthcare he’s always going on about.

Does Medicare for All cover throat lozenges? — Jim Antle (@jimantle) September 13, 2019

Bernie kind of sounds like a guy who just smoked a full pack of cigs for the first time — Neoliberal 🌐 (@ne0liberal) September 13, 2019



Biden, more so than earlier debates, seemed awake and crisp.

Joe Biden’s opening is vintage, on-game Biden. First I’ve seen him this race. #DemDebate — Christopher Bedford (@CBedfordDC) September 13, 2019



Kamala Harris began, as usual, with a falsehood.

Kamala Harris says Donald Trump is definitely watching the debate. He is on CSPAN right now, in Baltimore giving a speech. Ouch, already one lie. — David Rutz (@DavidRutz) September 13, 2019



But sadly, there was no one there to call her on it.

Tulsi’s candidacy has much more of a point than does Booker’s or Beto’s. It would be better were she up there. — Tim Carney (@TPCarney) September 13, 2019



Part 2: If You Like Your Doctor…

For a change, this debate started with a frank discussion of the budget deficit. No, wait, just kidding, it was healthcare again.

May we never not start one of these with an extended health care debate — Katherine Miller (@katherinemiller) September 13, 2019



As in previous debates, the discussion pitted those who want a state monopoly on healthcare against those who only want to take over part of the system.

Biden on Warren: ““The senator she’s says for Bernie. Well I’m for Barack.” — Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) September 13, 2019

wonder why biden is so interested in curing alzheimers — Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) September 13, 2019



Biden came loaded for bear.

Biden had a lot of coffee. — Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) September 13, 2019

Biden is killing it. This is the best he’s been. — Kassy Dillon (@KassyDillon) September 13, 2019

Biden is twisting the knife into Warren and Sanders about the fact that their plans to pay for Medicare For All is not going to get remotely close to paying for it. His problem is that voters don’t care how things are going to get paid for, which is why Warren won’t admit it.

— Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) September 13, 2019



But rather than wink at the next step in the obviously incremental approach to socialized medicine, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders demanded it all, now, now, now!

Warren starts off with a big lie — that she’ll pay for $32 trillion by taxing the rich, while middle class will pay less. The phony wonk strikes again! — Philip Klein (@philipaklein) September 13, 2019

If Elizabeth Warren would answer the question about the tax implications of her health plan, she wouldn’t be asked it over and over. — Josh Barro (@jbarro) September 13, 2019



Bernie owned up to the raw socialism of his plans, but Warren squirmed around to avoid it.

Warren: “I’ve never actually met anyone who likes their health insurance company.” That’s a good line — in a primary. But millions of people love their insurance and want to keep it, as future GOP ads will I’m sure point out. #DemDebate — S.E. Cupp (@secupp) September 13, 2019

“People will have access to all of their doctors.” Gee, never heard that one before, amirite @BarackObama.

I like my health insurance better than the DMV or Post Office. https://t.co/ydtEgHs3eZ — Karol Markowicz (@karol) September 13, 2019



The debate was centered among the ancient trio at first.

Gotta say this: Bernie, with his endless shouting, reminds me of my boyhood and of a relative I was always afraid they’d make me sit next to at the Passover Seder. — Clyde Haberman (@ClydeHaberman) September 13, 2019



But the kids table soon piped up. Harris rolled out the umpteenth version of her answer on the private insurance question.

Harris continues to be all over on the map on health care. — Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) September 13, 2019

Kamala Harris just drips with insincerity. She’s like a Family Guy caricature of a politician. — James Hasson (@JamesHasson20) September 13, 2019



Julian Castro distorted Biden’s position, then accused the old fellow of being off his rocker.

“Are you forgetting?” Blatant insinuating dementia to Biden from Castro. — Damon Linker (@DamonLinker) September 13, 2019

Castro: I watched my grandmother’s diabetes getting worse and worse on Medicare. Hence, Medicare for All.

— Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 13, 2019

Wow. I could be wrong, but Castro saying he is fulfilling Obama’s legacy and Biden isn’t feels like a bridge a thousand miles too far. — James Oliphant (@jamesoliphant) September 13, 2019



Yang got edgy, but didn’t really have a point.

Yang says he’s Asian so he knows a lot of doctors. As a fellow Asian, I can say this is, in fact, accurate af. — Siraj Hashmi (@SirajAHashmi) September 13, 2019



Part 1619: Woker Than Thou

O’Rourke went extreme on the crime question, but his audience might not have been the voters.

O’Rourke running for president of the New York Times editorial board. — Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) September 13, 2019

Beto just secured his job as a New York Times columnist after he loses. Watch out, they don’t pay very well. — David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) September 13, 2019



The moderators made up for Tulsi Gabbard’s absence by asking Harris about all the poor people she put in jail.

“I’m glad you asked me this question” is never true. — Richard M. Nixon (@dick_nixon) September 13, 2019

The moderator just got applause, damn. — Nick 🐋 (@TossupReport) September 13, 2019

Harris: I used to be the kind of politician who would betray any principal and say anything to get elected. But I’ve stopped doing that, trust me. — Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) September 13, 2019

Kamala Harris is making a special announcement tonight where she will randomly pick 10 families across America and incarcerate them. — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) September 13, 2019

Harris says there have been “distortions” of her record but didn’t actually give any examples. — Scott Shackford [Blue Checkmark] (@SShackford) September 13, 2019



Amy Klobuchar got a similar question, but everyone was too busy posting memes to listen.

Amy Klobuchar: I tried to nail Kirby Puckett’s ass to the wall! (No, really, she did.)https://t.co/sN98hjt70p

Part .30-06: Bobby’s Coming For Your Guns

The discussion moved, as it must, to guns. As usual, the candidates sparred over a minor point. Some wanted to seize all of them, some only wanted to confiscate some.

Biden suggested using legislation. Harris had other ideas.

Biden: “We have a Constitution!”

Harris: *laughs*

— Joe Bishop-Henchman 💸🚆📖⚖️ (@jbhenchman) September 13, 2019

Of course, Harris doesn’t address the question whether she has the constitutional authority, which was Biden’s point — Rich Lowry (@RichLowry) September 13, 2019

O’Rourke skipped over that ol’ Constitution too in announcing that he’d confiscate everybody’s semi-automatic rifles—but just the ones designed to kill people.

Part ∞: Potpourri

Halfway through, and it was already going on too long. After scarcely mentioning him in the first two rounds, everyone seemed to realize that a Democrat might want to claim Barack Obama’s legacy as his own.

Biden: “I stand with Barack Obama all 8 years…good, bad, and indifferent” — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) September 13, 2019



Other retired politicians were conspicuous in their absence from the debate chatter.

On trade protection, the candidates were all offered the opportunity to say how they would repeal Trump’s tariffs as soon as they got to the White House. Amazingly, NONE of them said they would do so.

“I like these tariffs, not those yucky Trump tariffs.”- Democrats, pretty much — Karol Markowicz (@karol) September 13, 2019

Klobuchar: I don’t like the tariffs that affect my constituents, the other ones are fine tho — Neoliberal 🌐 (@ne0liberal) September 13, 2019

I kept watching. Kamala Harris shouldn’t have made a “little dude” joke to Stephanopoulos like that. He clearly didn’t like it and that was just weird and awkward. — Brandon Darby (@brandondarby) September 13, 2019

Here Are The Highlights From The Third Democratic Presidential Debate,"The top ten candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination squared off Thursday night at Texas Southern University, a public historically black college in Houston, Texas.

Here are the highlights.

Julian Castro Takes A Dig At Joe Biden’s Age After Mischaracterizing Biden’s Statements

Former secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro took a shot at former vice president Joe Biden’s age as the two sparred over Biden’s comments on health care. When touting his plan for health care early in the evening, Biden, 76, said under his plan people would be able to choose government-run health insurance if they lose their existing coverage.

“If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance – from your employer, you automatically can buy into this. You don’t have – no pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in.”

Castro however, claimed that Biden said consumers would be forced to buy into Medicare.

“The difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that your require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt in. They would automatically be enrolled,” Castro said.

Biden challenged Castro’s statement on stage.

“They do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in,” Biden repeated.

“You just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just two minutes ago that they would have to buy in,” Castro said, mischaracterizing Biden’s statements and taking a jab at Biden’s recent forgetfulness on the campaign trail.

Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I mean, I can’t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you’re saying they don’t have to buy in. You’re forgetting that.

Klobuchar Tries to Sow Unity On Stage

As Castro and Biden went after each other, with Castro launching jabs at the former vice president, the moderators began to bring in other candidates who were unable to speak because of the shouting match ensuing on stage.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg chimed to say the shouting alienates Americans from engaging in the political process.

“This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,” Buttigieg said. “This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington, scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that — my plan, your plan. Look, we all have different visions for what is better…”

Castro clapped back.

“Yeah, that’s called the Democratic primary election, Pete. That’s called an election… This is what we’re here for.”

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar interrupted, borrowing a famous line from former President Abraham Lincoln (and the Bible). “Yes, but a house — a house divided cannot stand. And that is not how we’re going to win this.”

Biden Reminisces about Record Players

Yet the 76-year-old front-runner did show his age at the prime-time event. When answering a question on how Americans can repair the legacy of slavery, Biden said part of the solution would be for children to listen to the record player.

“They don’t — they don’t know quite what to do,” Biden said referring to parents not knowing how to raise their kids. “Play the radio, make sure the television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the — the — make sure that kids hear words.”

Health Care Dominates The Discussion

As with previous debates, health care dominated as the primary topic of debate for the first portion of the evening.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were once again put on defense as the farthest left candidates on stage, defending their signature health care plans from other candidates on stage whose proposals were no doubt still leftist but slightly less so.

Biden, who has tried hard to frame himself as the sensible moderate in the race, slammed the two senators’ proposals as unaffordable, labeling Sanders a “socialist” on stage.

“I know that the senator says she’s for Bernie, well, I’m for Barack,” Biden said. “How are we going to pay for it?

“If you notice, nobody’s yet said how much it’s going to cost the taxpayer,” Biden said on stage, throwing his arms open. “My friend from Vermont thinks that the employer’s going to give you back if you negotiated as a union all these years, got a cut in wages because you got insurance. They’re going to give back that money to the employee? … for a socialist, you’ve got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.”

Both senators dismissed the criticisms launched at them over the costs of their plans and stuck to their message that overall health-care costs would decline for consumers under a single-payer plan through higher taxes for the rich.

“How do we pay for it? We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more,” Warren said. “And middle-class families are going to pay less. That’s how this is going to work.”

But when pressed by the moderators on whether Warren would raise middle class taxes to pay for her health plan, Warren dodged the question.

Other candidates lobbed criticisms of Sanders’ and Warren’s proposals. Klobuchar called Sanders’ plan a “bad idea” and Buttigieg said it was wrong to strip choice from consumers.

“I trust the American people to make the right choice for them… Why don’t you?” Buttigieg inquired.

Cory Booker: A Documentary Film About My First Run For Mayor Lost An Oscar To ‘March of the Dagnab Penguins’

At the end of the night, the moderators asked the candidates to share their largest setbacks. Booker shared the time he lost his first major run for public office running for mayor of Newark in 2002.

Booker shared a brief story that the campaign was fraught with dirty tactics from his political opponents but was captured on the documentary film “Street Fight” that was nominated for an Oscar.

The New Jersey senator then complained that the documentary lost the Academy Award for best documentary feature film to “March of the Dagnab Penguins.” The actual title of the film, “March of the Penguins,” was a 2005 film narrated by Morgan Freeman.

Buttigieg Shares His Story Coming Out

In his closing statement, Buttigieg shared his story of coming out gay as an example of resilience.

“At a certain point, when it came to professional setbacks, I had to wonder whether just acknowledging who I was, was going to be the ultimate career ending professional setback,” Buttigieg said. “I came back from deployment and realized that you only get to live one life and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer, so I just came out.”

Pete Buttigieg: ""I came back from the deployment and realized that you only get to live one life and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer, so I just came out."" https://t.co/INdRXlIwFs #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/QXEgmjcm8d — ABC News (@ABC) September 13, 2019

Kamala Harris Compares Donald Trump to The Wizard Of Oz

When criticizing the president on trade, California Sen. Kamala Harris likened Donald Trump to the Wizard of Oz.

“The bottom line is this: Donald Trump, in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in ‘The Wizard of Oz,’ you know, when you pull back that curtain, it’s a really small dude?”

“Okay,” ABC moderator George Stephanopoulos said to an audience breaking out in laughter. “I’m not even going to take the bait Senator Harris.”

“Oh, George, that wasn’t about you!” Harris assured Stephanopoulos, who is famously short.

"Castro Attacks Biden: 'I'm Fulfilling the Legacy Of Obama, And You're Not'","During the third round of Democratic debates, former secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro attacked Joe Biden and Biden’s health care plan.

Castro began with a monologue on the differences between his plan and Biden’s. The most important differentiation he makes is his claim that Biden’s plan would leave 10 million people uncovered.

That’s a big difference, because Barack Obama’s vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.

“They do not have to buy in,” Biden said.

“You just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just two minutes ago that they would have to buy in,” Castro said.

“Do not have to buy in if you can’t afford it,” Biden said.

“You said they would have to buy in,” Castro said.

“Your grandmother would not have to buy in. If she qualifies for Medicaid, she would automatically be enrolled,” Biden said.

“Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I mean, I can’t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you’re saying they don’t have to buy in. You’re forgetting that,” Castro said.

Castro ended their spat by saying, “I’m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you’re not.”

To which Biden responded, “That’ll be a surprise to him.”

Julián Castro goes after Joe Biden on health care: ""I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not."" ""That'll be a surprise to him,"" Biden responds. https://t.co/INdRXlIwFs #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/irXrw34EEs — ABC News (@ABC) September 13, 2019

In the transcript of the Democratic debates, Biden did say “you can automatically buy into this.” However, it seems that was another one of Biden’s trademark gaffes. Biden’s message of whether people are automatically enrolled or must opt in to expanded Obamacare was unclear.

Biden said:

The option I’m proposing is Medicare for all — Medicare for choice. If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance — from your employer, you automatically can buy into this. You don’t have — no pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered, period.

While on face value Biden said that you can “buy into” Obamacare, he also said, “you get covered, period,” and you can “automatically buy into this.” It’s very difficult to have the government automatically enroll you in something while simultaneously giving you the option to join a program.

ABC’s own Jonathan Karl admits that Castro was wrong on the substance of his attack against Biden.

On ABC, @jonkarl says that based on the transcript, Julian Castro was “flatly wrong” on the *substance* of his controversial swipe at Biden’s age. That’s a double-whammy. — Guy Benson (@guypbenson) September 13, 2019

Castro is polling at 1 percent, even lower than individuals who did not make the cut for the debate stage. (Such as Tulsi Gabbard.)

Candidates who have gone on the offense previously, such as Kamala Harris attacking Joe Biden or Tulsi Gabbard attacking Kamala Harris, saw a clear uptick in their polling numbers.

As a candidate who barely made it onto the debate stage, Castro was clearly looking for an offensive moment that would boost his poll numbers. Unfortunately for Castro, the move made Biden look sympathetic because the attack was baseless and took a slight jab at Biden’s age.

Is Hysteria Over Whistleblower A Distraction From Biden’s Ukraine Policy?,"President Trump has come under fire for a whistleblower complaint that alleges the president repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky to work with Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to investigate the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in a July phone call. Much of the coverage of the whistleblower complaint has focused upon Trump’s potential impropriety. Some Democrats, such as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), have hysterically claimed that impeachment may be the only answer to Trump’s refusal to make the complaint and phone call transcript public.

This framing leaves out a few key pieces of information that, if included, would paint a vastly different picture. For instance, buried halfway through this CNN article is the fact that the complaint, filed with the intelligence inspector general, was deemed by the administration to have failed to meet the reporting requirements of the intelligence whistleblower law.

Why? Because the complaint was based on hearsay. According to an official briefed on the matter, the whistleblower “didn’t have direct knowledge of the communications.” Instead, the information in the complaint apparently came from “learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work.” This fact is why, despite the inspector general signing off the complaint as “urgent and credible,” the director of national intelligence did not forward the complaint to Congress.

Furthermore, much of the discussion of the whistleblower complaint has centered on amplifying and condemning Trump’s behavior without much mention of what Joe Biden’s son was doing in Ukraine. There’s a pervasive attitude among those in the media and on the left that if Trump improperly requested an investigation into Biden’s son Hunter, the impropriety of the request somehow makes the potential behavior of Hunter Biden and his father acceptable. This reaction is incoherent and bizarre.

In an ep-ed on Saturday, Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer provided a lengthy walkthrough of Hunter’s activity in Ukraine and his father’s potential role in shielding him from an investigation by the Ukrainian government.

In April 2014, Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, which had been struggling to adopt a more transparent model of operation after the removal of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych. It’s worth noting that Hunter had no experience within the energy sector, but was paid as much as $50,000 per month for his work at Burisma. His presence on the board was seen as a way for the company to legitimize its Western pivot. As the New York Times reported:

Their [Hunter Biden and others’] support allowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans at a time when Ukraine was especially dependent on aid and strategic backing from the United States and its allies, according to people who worked in Ukraine at the time.

At the time Hunter joined the board, his father was overseeing the White House’s Ukraine policy, and Burisma was embroiled in controversy. The British government had put a temporary freeze on the London accounts of Burisma’s owner, which was later lifted due to “lack of cooperation from the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor who preceded Mr. Shokin.” Additionally and more importantly, the Ukrainian government was launching its own investigation into potential corruption at the company.

In early 2016, then-Vice President Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, Ukraine’s controversial prosecutor general who was overseeing the investigation into Burisma. Biden had made firing Shokin part of his anti-corruption crusade, a move even back in 2015 the New York Times had expressed some skepticism over, given Hunter’s role at Burisma.

In a 2018 speech, Joe Biden confirmed his pressure campaign, which involved withholding U.S. loans from the Ukraine if Shokin was not fired: “I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b—-. He got fired.” Later interviews with half-dozen senior Ukrainian officials reveal the pressure campaign spanned months.

Shokin was fired in March 2016. The investigation into Burisma was dropped six months later. The case was later reopened in 2018 with a new prosecutor. In written answers to Hill contributor John Solomon, former prosecutor Shokin acknowledged he had developed “specific plans” for the Burisma investigation, “include[ing] interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.”

It would be hard for then-Vice President Biden to not have known about Hunter’s role at Burisma or about Shokin’s role in the investigation when he had the prosecutor fired. Not only was Hunter’s new position reported by the New York Times in 2014, Biden’s office even went on record in 2015 after being questioned about Hunter’s ties, the New York Times reporting that “Kate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman for the vice president, said Hunter Biden’s business dealings had no impact on his father’s policy positions in connection with Ukraine.”

It also doesn’t help that, according to an interview in July with The New Yorker, Hunter admitted to discussing his Burisma involvement briefly with his father once, making Joe Biden’s recent vehement denial to ever having it discussed it that much odder.

On Sunday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” expressing that he would support an investigation of Joe Biden if evidence were to reveal that the 2020 Democratic rival had improperly interfered in a Ukrainian investigation in order to shield his son from potential charges. “I do think if Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,” Pompeo said.

Given the incessant calls for impeaching Trump since his election, it seems many on the left are banking on the hope that the public and media will focus on Trump’s impropriety rather than on the possibility that Biden used his diplomatic position to shield his son from investigation. As Politico points out, ginning up hysteria against Trump may end up backfiring on Biden, who will be forced to relitigate an issue that only hurt his image during the Obama years.

As the New York Times editorial board wrote in 2015, “It should be plain to Hunter Biden that any connection with a Ukrainian oligarch damages his father’s efforts to help Ukraine. This is not a board he should be sitting on.”

Best-case scenario, it’s just bad imaging that Joe Biden had the prosecutor investigating his son’s company fired. Worst case scenario, Biden leveraged his position as vice president in grossly unseemly ways. In either case, to pretend that such relationships aren’t worthy of investigation because Trump suggested they were is a farce. It’s worth getting to the bottom of the whistleblower’s hearsay that prompted Trump’s requests.

If done “correctly,” the left’s hysteria about the phone call will conveniently shield Joe Biden from inevitable criticism regarding his past Ukraine policy, should he win the nomination. But if not, the call may just revive ethical questions regarding Joe Biden’s role in U.S.-Ukraine relations, concerns he likely had long hoped to put to rest.

Burisma Timeline Just Leads To More Questions About Hunter Biden,"As more information trickles into the mainstream press regarding Burisma, the natural gas company Hunter Biden worked for, the latest refrain has become “the Ukrainian prosecutor Vice President Joe Biden wanted fired was not investigating Biden’s son” when he was investigating Burisma.

But this misses the very point of the allegations being lodged at Joe and Hunter Biden. Just because Hunter wasn’t at Burisma at the time of the alleged corruption does not mean that Hunter could not have played a role in shielding the company from later allegations. He was receiving over $50,000 per month to sit on Burisma’s board, despite zero experience in the industry.

Last week, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) revealed that Mykola Zlochevsky, the Ukrainian gas tycoon at the center of the Hunter Biden debacle, was being investigated only for activity spanning from 2010 to 2012, when he was the minister of ecology. Zlochevsky founded Burisma in 2002 and later went on to work in the Ukrainian government. It is alleged that when he was minister of ecology, special permits were issued “for the use of mineral resources to enterprises founded by Burisma Limited.”

Several journalists have seized on this timeline as exculpatory of any wrongdoing from the Bidens, given Hunter did not join the board of Burisma until mid-2014. For instance, Jonathan Landay of Reuters tweeted out proudly, “Changes to the board of Burisma Limited, which are currently the object of international attention, took place only in May 2014, and therefore are not and NEVER were the subject of (the anti-corruption bureau’s) investigation,’ the bureau’s statement said. (My capitalization).”

But what these journalists seem to be missing is that the basis for accusations of corruption was not merely that Joe Biden got the prosecutor fired to shield his son’s behavior at Burisma from prosecution. Indeed, the timeline presented by NABU makes that allegation impossible to square away. But the allegation that has been routinely hinted at is the possibility that Zlochevsky hired Hunter Biden after the allegations surfaced in order to evade charges in the hopes that Hunter might use his influence to persuade his dad to push for the firing of the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.

Still, there’s another possibility, one that doesn’t involve persuasion from Hunter but more a tacit understanding with Joe Biden. Hunter Biden was collecting upwards of $50,000 per month for his role at Burisma with zero prior experience in the energy sector. It’s not out of the realm to wonder whether (1) Joe Biden knew the details of his son’s latest gig and salary and (2) whether Joe regarded the last name “Biden” as an important part of his son securing that role.

As The New York Times reported, Hunter’s presence on the board was seen in the Ukraine as a way to cement the company’s Western pivot: “Their [Hunter Biden and others’] support allowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans at a time when Ukraine was especially dependent on aid and strategic backing from the United States and its allies, according to people who worked in Ukraine at the time.”

Thus, as journalists begin parroting the timeline as “proof” that Joe Biden’s role in pressuring Ukrain to fire Shokin was entirely divorced from Hunter’s role at Burisma, consider the possibility that Hunter’s role could have been more about shielding Burisma as a whole from allegations.

While journalists feign consternation and disgust at the fact that President Trump would dare to express an interest in investigating these matters, remember that there are questions that deserve to be answered here. Indeed, the timeline isn’t exculpatory. And celebrating it as such is just more evidence of the media moving goalposts.

"According To Hunter Biden, Joe Biden Lied About Ukraine","Last week in Des Moines, Iowa, Joe Biden told a reporter that he never discussed his son’s overseas business dealings, but Hunter Biden tells a different story.

On July 8, The New Yorker reported:

In December 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: ‘Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’’

Yet on Sept. 21, not two months after The New Yorker story published, Biden told reporters at the Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa something different, reported USA Today.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Biden said. “Here’s what I know: Trump should be investigated.”

A newly released photo also seems to contradict Biden’s story. In the photo below of the time he was vice president, Joe Biden is seen golfing with his son, Hunter Biden, and an executive board member of the Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma Holdings. Burisma is the company that paid Hunter Biden $50,000 per month to sit on its board while Joe Biden oversaw Ukraine policy for the Obama administration.

Fox News reported the man furthest to the left in the photo below is Devon Archer, who served on the Burisma executive board with Hunter Biden.

🚨BOMBSHELL 🚨

According to Fox News, the photo was taken at the Hamptons in August 2014, just four months after Hunter Biden and Archer joined the Burisma executive board.

In 2018, Biden publicly celebrated pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was looking into corruption within Burisma, using U.S. aid as leverage:

I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b-tch. (Laughter.) He got fired.

Biden Calls For Trump Impeachment Despite His Crooked Ukraine Record,"Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden has endorsed impeaching President Trump over a phone call with Ukraine’s president discussing investigating potential corruption involving Biden and his son while Biden was vice president.

“Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation, and committed impeachable acts,” Biden said. “To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached.”

“We believe Americans should decide American elections, period. But Donald Trump will do anything to get reelected, including violating the most basic forms of democracy,” Biden said. “It’s stunning, and it’s dangerous because it directly threatens our democracy. This is not hyperbole, it’s a fact. No president in American history has ever dared to engage in such unimaginable behavior.”

The former vice president continued, “With his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself by obstructing justice, refusing to comply with a congressional inquiry. He’s already convicted himself.”

While Biden predicated his impeachment rhetoric on the recent Ukraine debacle, he immediately revealed his true motives, reminding voters that Democrats have maintained their “punishment in search of a crime” strategy since losing the 2016 election. He said, “We have to remember that impeachment isn’t only about what the president’s done. It’s about the threat the president poses to the nation if allowed to remain in office.”

Although Biden didn’t call for impeachment as quickly as other Democrats have, other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates were quick to endorse the inquiry in lieu of a fair fight on the electoral field.

I look forward to seeing Donald Trump impeached as soon as possible. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 29, 2019

Donald Trump has shown us he is lawless, and last week he gave us even more evidence that he is not fit for office. He must be impeached. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 30, 2019

Donald Trump is now openly calling for foreign governments to interfere in our elections from the White House Lawn.

He must be impeached. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 3, 2019

The answer is clear. pic.twitter.com/TOzSU5avlc — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) September 28, 2019

These impeachment calls come after a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was thrust into public view thanks to media-manufactured hysteria over a whistleblower complaint. Later, it was revealed that not only did the whistleblower lack firsthand knowledge of the conversation, but the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) had secretly altered the form whistleblowers must fill out to eliminate a certification they have direct, firsthand knowledge of alleged misconduct, as Sean David reported here at The Federalist.

Further, The New York Times reported that the anti-Trump complainant had presented his allegations to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., prior to filing the complaint with the ICIG. Byron York also reports the whistleblower has professional ties to a 2020 Democratic candidate for president.

During Biden’s push for impeachment, he also said, “One thing about this president is absolutely clear, and I don’t think anyone can contradict this: He has seen no limits to his power regardless of what the Constitution says. He believes the entire United States government can be corrupted into furthering his personal political needs. He’s even willing to hold Congress and congressionally appropriated aid to a foreign nation hostage to his personal political demands.”

Biden’s comments on Trump’s interest in his personal political demands are ironic, especially with regard to Ukraine, since Biden’s Ukraine record isn’t clean. During Biden’s stint as vice president, he pressured the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor investigating his son Hunter’s company, which he later bragged about. Despite his complete lack of relevant experience, Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian national gas company Burisma in 2014, a role for which he was paid $50,000 per month.

Despite his support for impeachment, Biden doesn’t seem to believe congressional efforts to impeach Trump will be successful, saying after endorsing the inquiry, “He has another year in office.”

Biden said that just like any other bully he’s ever known, Trump’s actions reveal “he’s a coward, he’s afraid. He’s afraid about just how badly I will beat him next November.” If that’s going to happen, though, then why is Biden supporting impeachment instead?",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/09/joe-biden-calls-for-trump-impeachment-despite-crooked-ukraine-record/,2019-10-09
ABC News Interview Didn’t Help Hunter Biden’s Credibility At All,"The fourth Democratic primary debate offered yet another opportunity for former vice president Joe Biden to dodge questions about his son Hunter’s shady business activities. While his father was running the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy, Hunter was serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, earning up to $50,000 per month despite zero experience in the energy sector.

In Tuesday night’s debate, when Anderson Cooper questioned Biden about the impropriety of this dynamic, Biden just repeated some variation of the refrain, “My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong.”

Biden’s awkward sidestep coincides with the release of Hunter’s first interview since his Ukraine dealings became a topic of public discussion. This past weekend, Hunter Biden sat down with Amy Robach of ABC News to answer questions related to accusations that he leveraged his father’s political clout to close international business deals and assume lucrative board positions abroad.

This Didn’t Help Hunter’s Credibility At All

While the interview offered Hunter Biden a chance to put the corruption accusations to rest in a more intimate setting, the face-to-face interaction ended up exposing that Hunter Biden has a genuine likeability and credibility problem. In short, the interview was a trainwreck.

The exchange between Robach and Biden came across as an awkward nod to the barrage of criticisms Hunter and his father have received over the past month. Indeed, it’s quite obvious that the purpose of the interview, conducted with a forced casualness in Hunter’s dimly lit kitchen, was to somehow ingratiate Hunter Biden to those skeptical of his integrity or personal character. By this metric, the interview was an abysmal failure.

It’s not that Hunter Biden emerged from the interview an entirely amoral figure. He offered a welcomed candidness in his answers, and it’s abundantly clear he loves his father. But after watching the published portions of the interview, there is little question that Hunter is comfortable with (at minimum) the crony capitalism that catapulted him to financial success, and he’s pretty bitter, approaching insolent, if you ask him about it.

Thus Hunter’s defense isn’t likeable or credible, and this shortcoming could pose serious problems for Joe Biden if the corruption accusations ever catch traction in the mainstream press. If Hunter carries himself publicly as he did in this interview, people will neither like him nor trust him—and that may spell trouble for Joe.

How Dare You Question Me about Using My Dad’s Position

By all accounts, this interview was a “softball” interview. The questions were probing, but admittedly predictable—there were virtually no surprises in Robach’s interrogation, making Hunter’s snide retorts that much more uncomfortable. Every time Hunter snapped at Robach, I couldn’t help but ask myself, “Did he really not see that question coming?”

While Hunter’s initial posture seemed relaxed, he became increasingly agitated as Robach asked him pointed questions relating to his foreign business dealings. Robach quizzed Hunter on his board position at Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company that was being investigated by Ukraine’s general prosecutor when his father, then vice president, pressured the Ukrainian government to have the general prosecutor fired.

When Robach pointed out that Hunter had no experience in the natural gas sector or in Ukraine more generally, Biden snapped, “No, but I think that I had as much knowledge as anybody else that was on the board — if not more.” At another point, Robach quipped, “You were paid $50K per month for your position?” and Biden shot back, “Look, I’m a private citizen. One thing that I don’t have to do is sit here and open my kimono as it relates to how much money I make or make or did or didn’t.”

Hunter’s inability to contain his frustration became strikingly obvious. When Robach asked why he chose not to renew his board position at Burisma this past April, his response masked a sort of sarcastic condescension. “I think it’s pretty obvious why.” Robach, to her credit, remained unfazed. “This is your opportunity to say why.”

I’m Sorry This Looks Bad to Stupid People

Hunter failed to rise to the occasion when given the opportunity to appear composed and diplomatic. Robach’s invitation to explain his decision wasn’t confrontational in the slightest, but Hunter responded with crude indignation. “Well this is what becomes a distraction. Because I have to sit here and answer these questions. And so that’s why I’ve committed that I won’t serve on any boards or I won’t work directly for any foreign entities when my dad becomes president.” He’s staying away from foreign board positions because he’s being questioned about it, not necessarily because he sees the practice as indecorous.

In fact, Hunter says he does not regret being on the board of Burisma; instead, he regrets not anticipating that Donald Trump or Rudy Guiliani would be chasing “conspiracy” theories about his employment that he claims have been “completely debunked by everyone.” Later in the interview, he emphatically expresses no regret for allowing his Chinese business partner (and alleged “friend”) to shake hands with then-vice president Joe Biden when Hunter joined his father on a diplomatic trip to China in 2013.

His framing is damning because it shows he doesn’t reject what is at best crony capitalism—he just rejects the fact that it might be noticed and inferred to be corruption. Had this interview been exculpating, it would have resulted in Biden condemning both.

Not Giving Straight Answers

Hunter isn’t exactly honest in the interview, either. In relation to the 2013 China deal, Hunter remained mute about how private equity investments operate after Robach quizzed him about any potential financial gain he might have experienced. “Have you received any money from that [private equity] business dealing?” He responded that he hasn’t received “one cent” from the investment, but that answer is a misleading one, given Hunter still retains a stake in the firm, meaning future profits are possible. As noted in Wall Street Journal:

Hunter Biden owns 10% of the private-equity firm and the statement said he committed to invest $420,000 to acquire the stake. The statement said the younger Mr. Biden hadn’t received compensation for serving on the board of the China venture and hasn’t received any return on his investment. The statement didn’t address how Hunter Biden intends to treat his 10% stake in the Shanghai-registered firm, which has invested mostly in China and is primarily owned by some of the country’s largest financial firms.

The one genuine moment of connection in the interview was when Hunter discussed his history with addiction. It was a raw and rare moment that audiences don’t often see in politics. For his openness and courage in that moment, Hunter should be saluted. But it was probably the only portion of the interview where Hunter did not come across as disingenuous.

There were other glimmers of honesty that might have endeared audiences to Hunter, but the statements still revolved on the behavior of Trump and others, rather than on Hunter’s, showcasing his inability to assume any sort of professional responsibility.

I Respect Any Political Position that Helps Me Make Moolah

He concedes that his business activities indicated “poor judgement,” but on the basis that they “gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to [his] father.” He asserts, “That’s where I made the mistake, so I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.”

Hunter is entirely unrepentant, and he wants audiences to know it. Instead of the interview serving as the basis of Hunter Biden’s redemption tour, it painted a portrait of a discourteous man. There were moments that you almost felt sorry for him because it was quite obvious this interview, in all its pedestrian questioning, was dramatically over his head.

At the end, Hunter Biden began to tear up when discussing the office of the presidency, one he claims he had been taught to respect. I found that sentiment frankly hard to believe, given all of the business dealings he managed to shore up while his father was nestled in the executive branch—and without one ounce of regret.

The vast majority of his responses were cheap attempts to dismiss people’s very real concerns about corruption in Washington. Instead of validating those concerns and attempting to address them, Hunter feigned incredulity and then accused Trump of ginning them up. Indeed, if this unlikeable figure is at the center of the Ukraine probe, it may very well be a problem for Joe.

Joe Biden Used The Term ‘Lynching’ To Describe Impeachment In 1998,"Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden, who criticized President Donald Trump’s use of the term “lynching” to describe the impeachment inquiry currently unfolding in the House of Representatives, used the term himself when he was a Delaware senator in 1998.

“Even if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar, that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense,” Biden told CNN during the Bill Clinton impeachment proceedings.

The comments, first uncovered by the network’s KFILE, showcase a double-standard from Democrats, who were quick to attack the president for invoking the term to describe the current impeachment process underway in the House.

“Impeachment is not ‘lynching,’ it is part of our Constitution,” Biden tweeted Tuesday. “Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It’s despicable.”

Impeachment is not ""lynching,"" it is part of our Constitution. Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable. https://t.co/QcC25vhNeb — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 22, 2019

According to CNN, the Biden campaign at first refused to comment before issuing an apology on Twitter Tuesday night.

“This wasn’t the right word to use and I’m sorry about that,” Biden wrote. “Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily.”

On Tuesday morning, Trump used the term on Twitter to describe impeachment proceedings being levied against him.

“So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here – a lynching. But we will WIN!” the president tweeted.

According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, “lynch” is a synonym for “hang”: “to put to death (as by hanging) by mob action without legal approval or permission.” People of all races and nationalities have been killed by hanging, although of course in the United States it has most prominently been used as an act of terrorism against African Americans, largely half a century ago.

Biden was also not the only Democrat to use this word to describe the Clinton impeachment proceedings. According to the Washington Post, at least five House Democrats used the term to brand the Republican effort to remove President Clinton in the 1990s, including New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, who still serves in Congress and is now the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee overseeing critical steps of the impeachment process.

A series of polls following last week’s fourth Democratic primary debate have comfortably landed Biden back on top of the still-crowded Democratic field as the frontrunner. Biden now leads the pack with nearly 29 percent support, according to Real Clear Politics’ latest aggregate of polls, with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren beginning to trail behind with only 23 percent. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders comes behind in a distant third place at little more than 16 percent support.

Biden has taken repeated criticism for his record on race issues, with California Sen. Kamala Harris slamming the former vice president for his opposition to busing students according to their race and touting his friendly relationships with segregationist senators as examples of his civility at the first Democratic primary debate in Miami in June.

“Vice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist,” Harris said standing next to Biden. “I also believe — and it’s personal and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. It was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.”

Hunter Biden Was Hired To Run Interference For A Corrupt Romanian,"In 2016, Romanian real estate tycoon Gabriel “Puiu” Popoviciu, who was accused of orchestrating a corrupt land deal, hired Hunter Biden to “advise” him as he aimed to dodge federal prosecution. At the same time, Hunter’s father Joe Biden was claiming to be pushing Romania to clean up political corruption.

NBC News reported Hunter Biden may have simply been used as a prop while Popoviciu was evading prosecution. This is the third questionable relationship between a foreign government, the Obama administration, and the former vice president’s son.

First it was Hunter Biden sitting on the board of a Ukrainian oil company, which he was not qualified to sit on, making some $80,000 per month. Meanwhile, Joe Biden claimed to be fighting corruption in Ukraine by firing the prosecutor who was prosecuting the company on whose board Hunter Biden sat.

Hunter Biden’s potentially very lucrative investments in China have also been scrutinized recently. When given the opportunity to vindicate himself during an exclusive ABC interview this month, Hunter Biden vowed to divest himself from his monetary investments in China and claimed he would not serve on the board of any other foreign entity, like he did in Ukraine, because that appears corrupt.

“Well, this is what becomes a distraction. Because I have to sit here and answer these questions. And so that’s why I’ve committed that I won’t serve on any boards or I won’t work directly for any foreign entities when my dad becomes president,” Hunter Biden said.

Now, the younger Biden has been accused of working and profiting in a third country — Romania — where his father was working to end corruption.

While it is likely Joe Biden will call his poor judgement and alleged corruption a hoax created by the Trump administration, his fellow 2020 candidates frontrunners, namely Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, may try to criticize him as they push what they call anti-corruption plans.

After the allegations against the Biden family garnered national attention, Joe Biden’s polling numbers slipped from approximately 37 percent to his current stature at 27.2 percent. Warren is trailing behind Biden by approximately 5 points, coming in at 21.8 percent.

Joe Biden Claims He Started Out At A Historically Black College. He Didn’t,"2020 Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden claimed Saturday to have began his long career at Delaware State University, a historically black college in his home state, as opposed to the University of Delaware where he actually went to school.

“I got started out at an HBCU, Delaware State. Now I don’t want to hear anything negative about Delaware State here. They’re my folks,” Biden said during a South Carolina town hall.

https://twitter.com/TCPigott/status/1188208476583026688?s=20

While Biden’s comments make it unclear what the former vice president was exactly referring to during Saturday’s town hall, it is likely Biden was claiming to have gone to school there given his own history of exaggerating his record on civil rights and his summer of gaffes. He’s also been criticized for his age and poor memory.

The confusing mix-up occurred while Biden was touting his education plan to voters in the early primary state as the campaign begins to downplay expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire pivoting its focus on South Carolina and Nevada.

Real Clear Politics’ latest aggregate of polls shows Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren now leading Biden in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to cast votes in the Democratic primary while Biden maintains a firm grip on his frontrunner status in the following two states.

Biden’s campaign has been struggling in recent weeks to keep a strong hold on its first-place position as Warren briefly eclipsed Biden in national polls earlier this month to provide Biden unwanted company at the top of the pack. Warren’s poll numbers have since slipped but remains Biden’s most competitive threat in the primary given her strength in the early voting states and fundraising numbers outraising Biden by nearly $10 million in the third quarter. Biden was also out-raised by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/28/joe-biden-claims-he-started-out-at-a-historically-black-college-he-didnt/,2019-10-28
Biden's New Super PAC Is Run By A Foreign Government Agent,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has a brand new Super PAC in his corner, and it’s being run by a registered foreign agent for the government of Azerbaijan. Larry Rasky, a lobbyist who previously worked as a top campaign operative for Biden, is listed as the treasurer of the PAC, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

“A former Joe Biden aide has filed paperwork to form a super PAC, called Unite the Country, that is set to boost the former vice president with millions of dollars in spending in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary,” Politico reported on Tuesday.

Records filed with the Department of Justice show that Rasky is also a registered foreign agent lobbying on behalf of the government of Azerbaijan. The records, which were filed pursuant to the Foreign Agent Registration Act, show that Rasky was hired by the Azerbaijani government on April 23, 2019. Federal documents signed by Rasky show that he reports directly to Elin Suleymanov, Azerbaijan’s ambassador to the United States.

“[The government of Azerbaijan] will pay RASKY a minimum monthly non-refundable fee (the ‘Monthly Fee’) for the Services provided of $15,000 per month, plus a 5% administrative fee as described below,” Rasky’s contract with the foreign government states. “The Monthly Fees totaling $94,500 shall be paid in two equal installments. The initial payment of $47,250 is due upon the signing of this agreement. The second payment of $47,250 is due on July 15, 2019.”

Rasky changed the name of the PAC from “For The People” to “Unite the Country” on Monday, according to FEC filings. The filings do not state which country Rasky intends to unite on Biden’s behalf.

Politico reported in August that Rasky also explored going into business with Hunter Biden and James Biden, the former vice president’s younger brother. At one point, Rasky planned to provide a million dollars towards the Bidens’ purchase of Paradigm Global Advisors, a hedge fund.

“James and Hunter brought in Larry Rasky, a lobbyist and longtime Biden adviser, who at one point, according to court records, was going to provide $1 million in financing,” Politico reported. “Rasky did not respond to a request for comment.”

Biden’s campaign has been dogged by allegations that he corruptly used his influence as vice president to steer lucrative foreign business contracts to his son Hunter. At a 2018 event organized by the Council on Foreign Relations, Joe Biden — who was tasked by then-President Barack Obama to lead the U.S. government’s efforts in Ukraine — bragged about threatening to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee if the Ukrainian government refused to fire a prosecutor who was reportedly investigating a gas company that paid Hunter Biden millions of dollars to sit on its board.

“I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars,” Biden said. “I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours.”

“I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours,’” Biden recalled. “If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b-tch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.”

After Shokin was fired, he was replaced by Yuri Lutsenko, who also has been dogged by allegations of corruption. The Obama administration never demanded Lutsenko’s ouster, despite worries that Lutsenko was similarly corrupt and untrustworthy.

In recent congressional testimony, George Kent, a State Department official who works on the agency’s Ukraine portfolio, contradicted claims that the Obama administration was merely following the lead of the so-called international community in demanding the firing of Shokin. As The Federalist previously reported, Kent told lawmakers the Obama administration spearheaded the efforts to have Shokin removed from his position as the top federal prosecutor in Ukraine. Kent said the international community — namely the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Western nations within the European Union — were deferential to U.S. directives on the matter.

The news that Biden’s Super PAC is run by the agent of a foreign government will likely complicate the former vice president’s efforts blunt the narrative that his government duties are for sale.

Azerbaijan is not the only foreign entity that Rasky has recently represented. He and his firm also lobbied on behalf of a Bangladeshi political party through January of 2019.

“Rasky Partners will engage in message development, outreach to influencers, media monitoring, media relations, strategic counsel and research,” the filing declared. Rasky’s firm received more than $86,000 from that contract, federal records show.

A previous firm run by Rasky also represented foreign officials in Japan, Hungary, Congo, and Serbia.

On Wednesday, Rasky told The Federalist that, notwithstanding the previous contract with Azerbaijan filed with DOJ, his firm had terminated its relationship with Azerbaijan effective August 27, 2019. Rasky’s attorney formally filed the termination notice with DOJ the same day.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/29/the-head-of-joe-bidens-new-super-pac-is-a-foreign-government-agent/,2019-10-29
Joe Biden Repeatedly Asked Agencies To Do What Son's Clients Wanted,"News of Hunter Biden profiting from his father’s political activity is becoming an endless saga that has yet to genuinely interest our media who claim “democracy dies in darkness.” The latest set of coincidences, uncovered by Alana Goodman of The Washington Examiner, reveal more unseemly connections between Hunter’s business adventures and his father’s political maneuvers. Whether it be China, Ukraine, or China again, we have heard this pattern before.

While serving as senator of Delaware, Joe Biden reached out discreetly to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to discuss matters his son Hunter Biden’s firm was then lobbying for, according to government records Goodman gathered.

The latest revelations further buttress accusations that Joe Biden’s work as senator and vice president frequently converged with and assisted Hunter Biden’s business interests. Whether it be getting the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating his son’s company fired or meeting one of his son’s business partners while on a diplomatic trip to China in 2013, Joe Biden’s political activities in relation to his son Hunter have continued to garner scrutiny.

In 2002, while his father was a senator, Hunter founded the lobbying firm Oldaker, Biden & Belair, which lobbied on the Hill. When his father announced his candidacy for president in 2008, Hunter opted to leave the firm, claiming it was to reduce concerns about conflicts of interest.

While Hunter was still at the firm, in late February 2007, then-Sen. Joe Biden reached out to DHS, expressing concern over the department’s proposed chemical security regulations. The regulations were in accordance with Section 550 of the DHS Appropriations Act of 2007, which called for chemical facilities to submit detailed “site security plans” for DHS approval. Part of these plans were expected to include specifics related to training and credentialing employees.

Biden’s call seems like an eerie coincidence. Two months prior to that phone call, the Industrial Safety Training Council had enlisted Hunter Biden’s firm to lobby DHS precisely on Section 550. The Industrial Safety Training Council is a 501(c)3 that offers safety training services to employees of chemical plants. In the midst of debates over regulations stemming from Section 550, ISTC launched significant lobbying efforts to encourage the expansion of background checks under the new regulation regime.

Hunter was not registered as an individual lobbyist on behalf of ISTC, but he did serve as a senior partner at his namesake firm Oldaker, Biden & Belair, which only boasted three partners at the time. According to Goodman, from early 2007 to the end of 2008, his firm earned a total of $200,000 from ISTC in return for its lobbying efforts.

While we don’t know the source of Joe Biden’s concern over Section 550 and whether his “concern” was the one ISTC shared, it is worth noting this repeated crossover between Hunter Biden’s business and his father’s political stratagems. At some point, coincidences stop being merely a product of a chance. In the case of Hunter and Joe Biden, the coincidences continue to pile up.

Joe Biden’s use of his political power for his son’s business dealings didn’t stop there. At one point, Hunter’s firm was lobbying on behalf of SEARCH, a national nonprofit devoted to information-sharing between states in the criminal justice and public safety realm. SEARCH was interested in expanding the federal government’s fingerprint screening system and hired Hunter’s firm to lobby on behalf of this issue.

During that very time, Joe Biden sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales expressing a desire to unpack this very topic. In his letter, then-Sen. Joe Biden asked to meet with DOJ to explore the benefits of the expanding the federal government’s fingerprint system.

“I write to request your assistance in implementing an expanded background check system for our nation’s volunteer organizations,” Joe Biden’s letter says. “If we can work together to expand the number of volunteer organizations that have access to fast, accurate, and inexpensive fingerprint background checks, we will make significant and important strides in our ongoing effort to protect kids across our country.”

The letter is dated January 31, 2007, 12 days after SEARCH put forth its own resolution, expressing support for recommendations previously made by the attorney general, recommendations which included the “integration of the State criminal history repository system in ways that will allow the return of all criminal history record information maintained by the States on the search subject through a single fingerprint check.” In short, Biden reached out to Gonzalez within days of SEARCH penning its resolution. A fun coincidence, indeed.

It doesn’t stop there. Later, in early 2008, Joe Biden introduced legislation titled the “Child Protection Improvements Act,” which, among other things, ensured that the FBI’s fingerprint background check system would be available for organizations that serve youths. Surprise, surprise. As Goodman reports, Hunter’s firm began lobbying on behalf of SEARCH in favor of the bill. SEARCH compensated Hunter’s firm with a payment of $93,000 in 2008 for its lobbying efforts.

As presidential candidate, Joe Biden waves off accusations of “bad optics” related to his son’s business dealings. Yet it’s worth asking, when do the coincidences become simply untenable? There’s an undeniable, repeated, and unseemly parallel between Joe Biden’s political activity and Hunter Biden’s business interest.

When Joe was running our Ukraine policy, Hunter landed at Burisma. When Joe was the linchpin of our China policy, Hunter was busy shoring up investors in Beijing. At its best, the relationship between Joe Biden and his son represents simply the worst of crony capitalism. At its worst, it’s good, ol’ fashioned corruption. Neither seems particularly desirable, and both indicate bad character.

Emails Reveal Burisma Consulting Firm Leveraged Hunter Biden To Get State Dept. Meetings,"Finally, U.S. Senators are waking up to the possibility that 2020 Democratic contender Joe Biden may have knowingly permitted his son Hunter to “sell” access to the U.S. State Department while Joe was serving as Vice President. The line between crony capitalism and outright corruption is a thin one, but when it comes to assessing the legitimacy of Trump’s interest in ending Ukrainian corruption, it’s worth determining the veracity of corruption allegations, of which Hunter Biden represents a not insignificant part.

On Wednesday, U.S. Senators Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Wednesday inquiring about the manner in which the consulting firm Blue Star Strategies, hired by the infamous Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, might have utilized Hunter Biden’s role on the Burisma board to “possibly influence State Department matters,” according to a press release from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.

The letter to Pompeo was prompted by a series of State Department emails released via FOIA and published by reporter John Solomon, revealing that Burisma’s consulting firm had in fact mentioned Hunter Biden when seeking a meeting with the State Department to discuss corruption allegations against the company. A State Department email from February 2016 specifically cited Hunter Biden’s involvement with Burisma when discussing the possibility of setting up a meeting with Burisma’s consulting firm. According to the email, the consulting firm made the State Department aware that Hunter was one of their client’s employees.

Per our conversation, Karen Tramontano of Blue Star Strategies requested a meeting to discuss with [Under Secretary] Novelli [U.S. Government] remarks alleging Burisma (Ukrainian energy company) of corruption. She noted that two high profile U.S. citizens are affiliated with the company (including Hunter Biden as a board member). Tramontano would like to talk with U/S Novelli about getting a better understanding of how the U.S. came to the determination that the company is corrupt. According to Tramontano, there is no evidence of corruption, has been no hearing or process, and evidence to the contrary has not been considered. Would appreciate any background you may be able to provide on this issue and suggested TPs for U/S Novelli’s meeting.

Emails also indicate that Hunter Biden and his fellow Burisma board member Devin Archer scheduled meetings with high-ranking members of the U.S. State Department at the time that Burisma was under investigation for corruption by the Ukrainian government. According to Johnson and Grassley’s letter, “In May 2015, Hunter Biden asked to meet then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken to ‘get [his] advice on a couple of things’ and again for lunch on July 22, 2015. On March 2, 2016, just one day after Tramontano was scheduled to meet with Under Secretary Novelli about Burisma, Devon Archer was scheduled to meet with Secretary of State John Kerry.”

Biden Blinken Meeting by JohnSolomon on Scribd

And apparently, there were some who were deeply concerned about Hunter Biden’s involvement with Burisma. Chris Heinz, former business partner to Hunter and step-son to then-Secretary of State John Kerry, wrote to the State Department expressing his consternation at Hunter’s involvement with Burisma in May of 2014, a month after Hunter joined Burisma’s board. Heinz’s spokesman was quoted as saying that Heinz “strongly warned Mr. Archer that working with Burisma was unacceptable” and that “[t]he lack of judgment in this matter was a major catalyst for Mr. Heinz ending his business relationships with Mr. Archer and Mr. Biden.”

Grassley and Johnson’s letter seeks “all State Department records relating to Hunter Biden, Devon Archer, Christopher Heinz, and Karen Tramontano,” as well as “all State Department records relating to Burisma Holdings, Rosemont Seneca Partners, Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC, Rosemont Capital, and Blue Star Strategies.” The letter also seeks to determine if any of the meetings cited to—including the one between Tramontano and Novelli, the one between Devin Archer and Secretary Kerry, the one between Hunter Biden and Anthony Blinken—ever took place.

Finally, the letter notes that emails indicated that the U.S. had already determined Burisma to be “corrupt” and ask that this determination be explained, if true. Grassley and Johnson end by quizzing the State Department as to whether the they bothered to request “the Office of the Legal Adviser or the Office of Inspector General [to] review potential concerns and conflicts of interest related to Hunter Biden’s work for Burisma while Vice President Biden reportedly acted as the United States’ top official in Ukraine.” If the State Department had not, the letter demands that the State Department explain.

Johnson and Grassley’s letter reveals how the State Department was well aware of Hunter’s board position at Burisma, as were others on the periphery, suggesting any theory that Joe did not know of his son’s role is likely false. Additionally, we now know the consulting firm hired by Burisma attempted to leverage Hunter’s role with Burisma in order to land a coveted meeting with the U.S. State Department. The latest emails also demonstrate that Hunter and Archer were both scheduling meetings with high-ranking officials in the State Department. If they discussed Burisma during those potential meetings, it would be a heavy indication that Burisma had hired Hunter to gain access to the nucleus of U.S. foreign policy and to exert their influence on it.

Despite the obvious leveraging, it is unclear how greatly Hunter’s involvement with the company ultimately influenced the State Department’s willingness to meet with Blue Star and whether the meeting between Tramanto of Blue Star and Under Secretary Novelli ever took place. However, answering such questions is critical for determining the extent to which, if at all, Hunter Biden may have sold access to the U.S. State Department. In light of these revelations, Hunter Biden’s salary of $50,000 per month at Burisma suddenly seems to make much more sense.

Given the tenor of the final questions posed by Grassley and Johnson, it is entirely possible that the State Department turned a blind eye to the conflict of interest that erupted between Hunter and Joe. The American people deserve to know if Joe Biden put the State Department up for sale while serving as Vice President from 2008 to 2016, and Grassley and Johnson’s letter is the first step in making such a determination.

"If Biden Wasn’t Impeached Over Quid Pro Quo, Trump Shouldn’t Be Either","The Latin phrase quid pro quo means “this for that.” Whereas these ten letters have become “dirty words” in the left’s lexicon, the phrase is the very foundation of a market economy, in which people trade goods and services based on the valuations buyers and sellers place on them.

Governments behave similarly. The United States values having a democratically elected government sans corruption on Russia’s doorstep. Ukraine values U.S. aid. A mutually beneficial exchange takes place when Ukraine values American aid more than corruption and the United States values a corruption-reduced Ukraine more than the dollars it must part with to secure it. This is all part and parcel of strategic efforts to secure U.S. interests abroad.

The seminal issue in play in the Ukraine controversy is whether this exchange served the public interest of the United States broadly defined, the private interest of President Trump in attempting to submarine the candidacy of Joe Biden, or some combination of the two. While the motives of the two parties will never be known with certainty, the case for impeachment on the merits is decidedly weak.

To put it succinctly, if Biden remained in office given his public pronouncements regarding the quid pro quo, transitivity argues that Trump should as well. That is, at least until the 2020 election, when the court of public opinion weighs in at the ballot box.

The Economics of Exchange

In a market economy, consumers allocate their scarce dollars to purchase goods and services to maximize their utility or satisfaction. Businesses produce the goods and services that consumers desire by securing inputs that generate more in revenues than they impose in costs.

When I purchase a car for $30,000, we may infer that I value the car more than I value the $30,000. Symmetrically, when the dealership sells me the car for $30,000, we may infer that it values my $30,000 more than the car that it sold me.

Sending U.S. aid abroad to elicit desired legal, business, and social behavior from foreign governments is really no different. The only question on the table insofar as Ukraine is concerned is whether the underlying motivation for the exchange was private or public interest?

Just as the managers of a corporation are agents of the shareowners, elected government officials are agents for the citizenry. As such, they are expected to carry out their duties that serve the best interests of the country—the so-called public interest. When elected officials serve their private interests instead, they are no longer good stewards of the public trust. In such circumstances, they may be removed from office by another branch of government or via free elections.

Blurring the Lines Between Private and Public Interest

When as vice president Biden publicly proclaimed on video that he was withholding U.S. aid to Ukraine until the prosecutor investigating his son’s company was fired, was he acting in the private interest of his family or in the public interest of the United States? Unfortunately, the two are not mutually exclusive.

It is not inconceivable that the Obama administration harbored legitimate concerns about the Ukrainian prosecutor. The question is whether the Bidens benefitted personally from the dismissal of this prosecutor as a direct product or merely as a byproduct of the quid pro quo?

Blurring these lines is not benign. To maintain the public trust, elected officials must not only avoid impropriety, they must also avoid the appearance of impropriety. At least on this latter score, Biden failed.

Likewise, President Trump, acting as an agent for the American people, has a legitimate interest in securing a corruption-free Ukraine. He could have stated in no uncertain terms to Ukranian President Zelensky that U.S. aid is contingent on eliminating corruption in their government and that means identifying and prosecuting any and all individuals regardless of party affiliation that are complicit in the corruption.

This statement would have cast a wide enough net to include the Bidens without identifying them specifically by name. The fact that Trump singled out Hunter Biden in the discussion blurred the lines between the public and the private interest, but only because Joe Biden is a potential presidential rival for Trump.

This is a non-issue if Joe Biden were merely a private citizen whose son was involved in questionable business dealings in Ukraine. Joe Biden does not warrant a free pass merely because he is running for president, nor does the president have license to invoke the power of the federal government to take out a political rival.

Nuance Needed, But Not Part of the Package

A more nuanced Trump would have found a way to motivate Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden as part of a larger corruption-eradication effort. Words do matter, and Trump is not as careful as he needs to be in parsing his.

This is unfortunate, but perhaps understandable. Trump did not work his way up to the presidency by winning a series of down-ballot elections. If he had, the rough edges that continually trip him up would have been smoothed over or he would have failed to advance. Nor did he work his way up to the presidency by climbing the corporate ladder and developing the diplomacy that is the sine qua non for such an ascent.

Trump’s path to the presidency was as unconventional as the man who occupies it. Working for change agents is never easy, precisely because they see the world differently, characteristically before the rest of the pack, and their relentless pursuit of the endgame invariably ruffles feathers along the way. To wit, for all of his creative genius, Steve Jobs would never have been anyone’s choice for boss of the year.

If Trump were more diplomatic he would unquestionably have less trouble with Congress, not to mention his cabinet. Unlike his predecessor, Trump is the antithesis of nuanced. He uses criticism as a form of political blood-doping; it energizes him.

Paradoxically, this may well explain why he is president. In electing Trump, the American people voted for the anti-politician in hopes of charting a different course for the country. It is perhaps not reasonable to ask Trump to be more artful in his discourse when he was voted into office precisely because he is not.

With both Biden and Trump, the lines were blurred between the private and the public interest. If nothing else, both men bear some culpability for failing to recognize that they were probably not the best choice to deliver the non-corruption message given the personal skin each had in the game. They failed to avoid the appearance of impropriety.

Transitivity of ‘High Crimes and Misdemeanors’

There is ongoing debate as to whether Trump tied U.S. aid to the investigation of the Bidens, or to the eradication of corruption in the Ukraine more generally. This issue will not be resolved anytime soon, if ever. The transcripts of the phone calls with President Zelensky and the testimony before Congress will amount to little more than a political Rorschach test.

To impose a higher standard on Trump than Biden cannot be justified, particularly when Biden aspires to the office Trump now holds.

Biden tied U.S. aid to the dismissal of his son’s prosecutor, as video clearly attests. Did the U.S. have a vested interest in the dismissal of the Ukrainian prosecutor that transcends his investigation into the business dealings of Mr. Biden’s son?

Did Trump and Biden put personal interest above public interest? We will probably never have definitive answers to that question. What we do know is that Biden was not investigated, impeached, nor forced to resign for his actions. Is it principled for Trump to be impeached or forced to resign when the weight of the evidence supporting a personal interest quid pro quo is arguably stronger for Biden than it is for Trump?

Transitivity argues that if Biden remained in office despite a stronger signal of a personal interest quid pro quo, then Trump should as well in light of the decisively weaker signal of such impropriety. To impose a higher standard on Trump than Biden cannot be justified, particularly when Biden aspires to the office Trump now holds.

This is not to suggest that Democrats will not attempt to apply a different standard to Trump, because they already have. Nonetheless, this is one of those gambles in which Democrats win big or lose big.

If the Ukrainian affair bears no more fruit than their claims of Russian collusion, the Democrats will not retake the presidency or the Senate and risk losing the House in the process. House Speaker Pelosi is in for the fight of her political life, but this is an old story that the veteran, crafty politician should know well. If you go after the king, you had better not miss. That said, Pelosi’s party looks increasingly like the gang who couldn’t shoot straight.

Americans Aren’t Stupid

The issue on the table is not whether the president committed “high crimes and misdemeanors” however ill-defined these terms may be. The real question is whether behavior that has already been found not to constitute “high crimes and misdemeanors” for one candidate can still be found to constitute “high crimes and misdemeanors” for another candidate.

The American people are not stupid. In fact, they tend to exhibit uncommon wisdom and foresight at the presidential ballot box. If the past is prologue, Trump is well on his way to a second term while Biden won’t even be able to find his way to his own party’s nomination.

If there is a silver lining in all of this, it is that Congress is investigating prospective corruption rather than passing intrusive and economy-killing legislation. Had the 2016 presidential election been decided differently, corruption would be standard operating procedure.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/15/if-joe-biden-wasnt-impeached-over-a-ukraine-quid-quo-pro-trump-shouldnt-be-either/,2019-11-15

The field was slightly smaller this time as we said good bye to Robert O’Rourke and Julian Castro, leaving just (!) ten contenders on the stage. Facing them were four MSNBC moderators—all of them female, in an attempt to distract from their parent network’s MeToo problems.

We began with a question sure to spark conversation: impeachment. Long story short: they’re all for it.

Oh great, an impeachment question to begin from Maddow. An issue the entire candidates agree on — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) November 21, 2019

Elizabeth Warren tried to make it more interesting by criticizing an old bipartisan habit.

Warren smartly uses the Sondland testimony to make a larger argument about government corruption, and selling off ambassadorships. I suspect that Warren’s core general election message would be about corruption, and she’s good at making that case. — Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) November 21, 2019

Tom Steyer tried not to look disappointed, as did others.

I was just about to send like 44 bitcoins to @ewarren’s campaign but now that I know she won’t reward me with the honor of becoming a DELEGATE TO MADAGASCAR…no ma’am, deal’s off. — Berny Belvedere (@bernybelvedere) November 21, 2019

The rest struggled to say something interesting about a topic that everyone in the room thought the same thing about.

The Taxman

Next, Warren brought out her favorite unconstitutional idea: the federal wealth tax. She got a little confused about the numbers, but the point was clear: you got it, she wants it.

Warren is now taking a 2 cent tax on $50 ***billion*** when she means $50 ***million***. I believe she has made this mistake before. — JERRY DUNLEAVY (@JerryDunleavy) November 21, 2019

Cory Booker questioned the concept.

Fixing That Awful Obamacare

The debate then shifted, as all Democratic debates must, to the subject of health care. Obamacare? Old and busted. The new hotness is FULL SOCIALISM.

Harris jumped in, not so much to defend Clinton, but for revenge over the time Tulsi killed her campaign back in August.

Mayor Pete

Buttigieg had been rising in the polls, leading many pundits to assume he would come under attack by the other candidates. Yet they were strangely reticent, so he was forced to attack himself.

Lock Him Up?

Rachel Maddow asked the candidates whether their supporters should chant “Lock him up” about the president the way Trump did about Hillary in 2016. Their answer: no, but really yeah.

They talked about child care—and how the government should pay for it.

Foreign policy came up as time wound down.

"‘Ok, Boomer’ Or ‘Ok, Biden’?: Joe Biden’s ‘No Malarkey’ Bus Tour Alienates Young Voters","2020 Democratic hopeful Joe Biden began an eight-day bus tour across Iowa, his campaign is calling it the “No Malarkey” bus tour. The term “no malarkey” is British slang for “no nonsense.”

Young voters have recently coined the term “Ok, boomer,” mocking the Baby Boomer generation for their “old folk” lingo and political ideology. Biden’s “No Malarkey” bus tour is no exception to the “Ok, boomer” mockery. In fact, it has us wondering if the phrase should actually be “Ok, Biden.”

But, the oddly named bus tour is just the most recent example of how Biden is alienating himself from young voters.

A new Emerson Poll shows Biden has the lowest support of top-tier candidates among voters under 50. Bernie Sanders received 37 percent of the support, Elizabeth Warren received 22 percent, and Biden falls far behind at 15 percent.

Another study from Politico finds only 10 percent of Biden’s base is aged 18-29. Meanwhile, other candidates have much more support among young people. 35 percent of Sanders supporters are aged 18-29, and Warren’s young base holds above at 15 percent.

In Iowa, Biden only garnered 5 percent of support among those younger than 45. It’s no question, Biden has a massive problem with young people.

When asked if they would vote for Biden in the general election, University of Georgia students said they weren’t interested in Biden’s candidacy. They showed overwhelming support for Warren and Sanders.

“I feel torn between that honestly. Ugh, I don’t know, there’s just been so much drama going on with the Ukraine, Burisma. For a while there, I thought he would be a good choice, but I just don’t think I could do that. I just really want Elizabeth Warren,” said Olivia, a junior at University of Georgia.

While young people don’t vote in massive troves comparative to older generations, every vote matters in such a contentious Democratic primary. Especially in Iowa, where Biden has low support compared to his national polling average.

His bus tour hasn’t done him any favors in generating new support among young voters. In fact, it may be doing the exact opposite. During a stop, Biden admitted Trump followed through on his campaign promises to help rural voters.

“Look at the promise that was made. Look what’s happening now. Iowa is growing, Iowa’s moving,” Biden said.

Biden admits that President Trump has kept his promises: “Look what’s happening now. Iowa is growing. Iowa is moving.” pic.twitter.com/etNhwNqnS9 — Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) December 2, 2019

Biden’s “no malarkey” tour may have more appeal to his baby boomer equals, but it is not an especially bright idea when Biden is polling at 5 percent among young Iowans. This really makes young Democratic voters roll their eyes and say, “Ok, Biden.”

Could Joe Biden Harness The Catholic Vote In 2020?,"Historically, the Catholic vote has been a decisive swing demographic in elections—one that former Vice President Joe Biden could use to his advantage on the road to 2020, if he is careful in playing his Catholic card.

It’s tempting to underestimate Biden’s ties to the Catholic Church; after all, it’s not something very many people are talking about. But Biden grew up in the Catholic church, and thus belongs to a group of millions of Americans who claim to share similar religious beliefs. According to Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Catholics, which comprise about 20 percent of the U.S. population, are “arguably the largest group of swing voters in the country.”

In the past two presidential elections, the majority of Catholics voted for the winning party. CNN’s exit polls found that in 2012, 50 percent of Catholics voted Democratic, 48 percent voted Republican, and 2 percent declined to answer. That number would change in 2016 where 46 percent of Catholics voted Democratic, 50 percent voted Republican, and 4 percent chose not to disclose their vote.

Almost every other religious group is either decidedly Republican or decidedly Democratic. Jewish voters, for instance, have solidly voted blue in the past two presidential elections. The Protestant demographic, by contrast, voted almost entirely red. But with the Catholic vote, often small margins make large differences—and the margins are closer than ever before. In the last four midterm elections, the vote has flip-flopped between parties.

It’s a lot of numbers to pay attention to, but take a look.

The Pew Research Center found that in 2006, 55 percent of Catholics voted for Democratic candidates and 44 percent voted Republican. Four years later, the elections of 2010 saw 44 percent of Catholics vote Democratic and 55 percent vote Republican. Then in 2014, 45 percent voted blue and 54 percent voted red. Most recently, 50 percent of Catholics voted Democratic and 49 percent voted Republican in 2018.

So the numbers show that many Catholics in America switch how they vote. Since 2006, the Catholic vote has flipped between parties, helping decide outcomes every time voters go to the polls.

Each year brought different talking points and different candidates to Catholic voters of all different walks of life, socio-economic status, race, and geographic location. Despite all those variables, the Catholic margin continued to be a close one. Thus Biden needs Catholics’ vote, both on the road to the nomination and, if he gets it, in the general election. And getting that vote might be be more complicated than composing a handful of tweets.

December 1 marked a date of conflict for the Catholic Church. Last month, the Vatican held a synod (a theological counsel gathering of clergy) in Rome, discussing the future tone of parts of the church. Liberal trends in Catholicism have created a division, the tension of which has been building up for the past year and a half.

The tension comes from three main issues: sexual morality, women’s ordination as ministers, and priestly celibacy. A second synod, which began on Sunday, is now confronting the issues and clarifying the direction the church has decided to take.

Where the Vatican would remain constant with its current positions on the topics, a contingent of the church would like to see change in the name of inclusivity. But change to doctrine built on thousands of years of tradition and concrete biblical teachings doesn’t come easy—or without conflict.

The pope has received pressure from the Brazilian church and the church in Germany to create the changes they want. While it’s unlikely these two meetings will definitively change the stance of the church on any of these issues, the Catholic Church is continuing to feel the pull of division.

In response to the pressure, Pope Francis seems undaunted, but very aware of the tension. “I am not afraid of schisms,” the pontiff has said.

Dr. Matthew Schmalz, a professor of Religious Studies at College of the Holy Cross and the founder of the Journal of Global Catholicism, believes that the source of the conflict is a clash between differing interpretations of Catholic teachings working in tandem with social pressures.

“There’s a portion of the Catholic church that has re-claimed progressivism. They’re pushing back against traditional beliefs…and that creates division,” Schmalz said.

He isn’t sure that the average Catholic voter will be directly influenced by the events happening in Rome, but does believe that Biden offers Catholics a familiar face. But in an attempt to appeal to a wider Democratic audience, Biden has already taken a step away from that image with his stance on certain issues like the Hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortions. Biden used to support that amendment, but recently switched to opposing it.

If Biden continues to follow a more leftist stance with the Catholic Church’s doctrine—like what is being proposed in Rome—he may continue to distance himself from the familiarity he brings to the table. That being said, Schmalz is confident about Biden’s appeal to Catholics against Trump.

“He’s center left on many issues, for sure. But with the Catholic working class, he’s a more familiar face than Trump is,” Schmalz said. Schmalz said he believes less than two-thirds of Catholics will be inclined to vote for Biden in 2020 if he wins the nomination, even though Biden’s political actions contradict church teaching about issues such as abortion and homosexual behavior.

As events in the Vatican unfold, it’s important to note this isn’t the first time a Catholic divide has influenced American politics. Tim Busch, writing for Fortune Magazine, suggests a conservative-liberal divide on similar topics contributed to Trump’s Catholic support back in 2016, specifically on issues like abortion and sex.

“Many Catholics… wonder whether in making civil society more inclusive [for identity politics groups], there is paradoxically less space for traditional forms of religious expression,” Busch said.

Right now, that question of inclusivity has been the height of the conversation in the Vatican, in Brazil, and in Germany. The question of 2020—as far as Catholic voters are concerned—is whether the church’s position of church , and if it does, whether it intensifies the paradox Busch identified. That’s something that Biden has to figure out as well.

In October of this past year, when he was denied communion at a Catholic worship service over his stance on taxpayer-funded abortions, Biden attempted to reassure Catholic voters that he still believes what he won’t act on when he has political power: “I’m a practicing Catholic,” Biden said, “I practice my faith, but I’ve never let my religious beliefs, which I accept based on church doctrine … impose on other people.”

Biden would do well to be intentional about church doctrine going forward into 2020 and to keep his ear low to the ground.

Biden Fat Shames Iowa Voter Who Says Hunter’s Ukraine Work Is Disqualifying,"During a town hall in Iowa on Thursday, 2020 Democratic hopeful and Former Vice President Joe Biden took a jab at a voter’s weight. The voter expressed concerns over Biden’s age and his son’s controversial relationships in Ukraine. Biden snapped back in a critical and confrontational manner.

“We all know Trump has been messing around in Ukraine… but, you on the other hand, sent your son over there. He not only worked for a gas company, but he had no experience in … You’re selling access to the President just like [Trump] is,” said the Iowa man.

“You’re a damn liar man,” Biden responded.

“I saw it on the TV,” the voter said.

“You see it on TV? No, I know you do. By the way, that’s why I’m not sedentary, I get up,” Biden said.

Biden proceeded to challenge the man to a push-up competition.

“Let’s run; Let’s do whatever you want to do,” Biden said.

A whole lot going on in this video, including Biden appearing to make multiple veiled jabs at the Iowa voter's weight https://t.co/T087FFgoMf — Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) December 5, 2019

Toward the end of their spat, Biden addressed the man saying, “Look, fat…” Audience members gasped and look at each other.

Biden told the Iowa voters that, “No one has said my son did anything wrong.”

In fact, reports that show Hunter Biden received compensation for his work at a Ukrainian oil company that far exceeds what a regular board member makes. Another report found emails which revealed the oil company’s consulting firm leveraged Hunter Biden to get a meeting with the U.S. State Department. This all took place while Biden was the Vice President of the United States.

Hunter has denied any wrong doing, but admitted to “poor judgment” in taking a paid position in a Ukrainian gas company.

Despite the mainstream media pushing the idea that problems with Ukraine started and ended with Donald Trump, the narrative is clearly not resonating with middle Americans. Iowa voters are concerned about Biden fostering a corrupt work environment during his time as Vice President. Based on the information out there, they are completely justified in their speculation.

Biden should be prepared to answer questions over reports about his son. Next time, in a polite and non-confrontational way if he hopes to win over the voters he desperately needs to clinch the 2020 nomination.

The Tax Increase Biden’s Plan ‘Forgot’ To Mention Affects His Pocketbook,"The details of Joe Biden’s tax plan emerged on Thursday—“emerged” because the campaign has yet to release a plan on its website. Instead, Bloomberg News obtained and published details of the tax proposal.

Most news coverage of the plan has to date focused on two issues. First, Biden’s plan proposes raising a relatively modest amount of revenue—“only” $3.2 trillion over a decade, compared to $20-30 trillion for the likes of Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT). As an additional point of comparison, the 2017 tax cut, which Biden called “the dumbest thing in the world,” reduced revenues by $1.46 trillion over 10 years—less than half the fiscal impact of Biden’s tax increase. (Biden has said he wants to repeal those tax cuts, most of which are not included in his $3.2 trillion tax increase proposal.)

Second, stories have centered around the fact that Biden’s proposed revenue raisers would hit corporations and the affluent, while sparing the middle class. But few if any stories on Biden’s tax plan have mentioned one tax he has not proposed increasing—the one he failed to pay himself.

The List of Tax Increases

The Bloomberg story listed ten tax increases included in Biden’s $3.2 trillion plan:

Taxing capital gains as ordinary income for individuals making more than $1 million ($800 billion revenue increase over ten years); Increasing the corporate income tax rate back up to 28% ($730 billion); Ending the “stepped-up basis” of taxation, under which the cost basis of inherited property (e.g., stocks, real estate, etc.) for determining capital gains tax liability is the value of the property at the time of the inheritance, rather than the value of the property when the deceased individual purchased the asset ($440 billion); Imposing a 15% minimum tax on all corporations with net income over $100 million, but who paid no federal income taxes ($400 billion); Doubling the rate of tax on profits generated overseas to 21% ($340 billion); Limiting the value of deductions for the wealthy to 28%, a proposal included in several Obama administration budgets ($310 billion); Raising the top rate of tax back up to 39.6% ($90 billion); Imposing sanctions on countries that “facilitate illegal corporate tax avoidance” ($200 billion); Eliminating real estate tax loopholes ($70 billion); and Ending fossil fuel subsidies ($40 billion).

Among that list of revenue raises, Biden did not incorporate a proposal submitted by the Obama administration in its budgets. That proposal, which would have raised taxes by an estimated $271.7 billion as of February 2016, attempted to end the practice of individuals funneling their profits through S corporations, to avoid paying self-employment taxes on their earnings.

The omission might come because, as previously reported, Biden and his wife used this loophole Obama wanted to close. In taking more than $13 million in book and speech earnings as income from their corporation, rather than wages, Joe and Jill Biden avoided paying as much as $500,000 in taxes—taxes used to fund Obamacare and Medicare. Experts interviewed by the Wall Street Journal over the summer called the maneuver “pretty aggressive” and a “pretty cut and dried” abuse of the system, because the Bidens’ speech and book income clearly came from their own intellectual property, rather than as a result of a corporate creation (e.g., profits from a restaurant, a car business, etc.).

Colluding Reporters?

As noted above, Bloomberg News broke the story of Biden’s tax plan. Its story mentioned not a word about how Biden’s plan omitted the Obama proposal on self-employment taxes, or Biden’s history of questionable tax maneuvers. The silence comes as Bloomberg said it would not conduct investigative reporting into declared candidate, and Bloomberg News owner, Michael Bloomberg’s rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination—but would continue to investigate President Trump.

At some point, reporters should stop colluding with each other to avoid investigations into Joe Biden’s sordid tax history. And they should start asking why a candidate who has campaigned on preserving and building upon Obamacare didn’t want to pay the taxes that fund it.

"How Joe Biden Gets Away With Calling A Voter A Fat, Dumb, Liar","Everyone was buzzing last week about Joe Biden’s confrontation with a voter in Iowa who had the temerity to ask about son Hunter’s extremely lucrative job on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma—a job Hunter Biden received one month after his father was named the Obama administration’s “point person” on Ukraine.

Biden, obviously, did not take well to the suggestion he had enabled corruption by his son. As a general rule, I’d like to see more bare-knuckles between politicians and voters in campaign settings, but the real revelation here is that Joe Biden is totally, utterly unprepared to answer obvious difficult questions he’s going to have to answer in a presidential campaign.

Biden’s latest excuse is blaming his aides for not warning him that his son’s Burisma job was a problem, even though at least one aide says he raised the issue with him directly. Plus, calling an ordinary voter a “damn liar” and other ad hominem insults for raising the very real issue of his son’s corruption is… something.

Yet much of the political Twitterati responded with praise because Biden was “feisty.” In fact, here’s how CNN National Political Reporter Maeve Reston covered the exchange:

In a human moment defending his son, Biden showed the authenticity, emotion and readiness for a fight that appeals to so many Democrats as they look for someone who can take on Trump … Thursday afternoon’s exchange could benefit Biden at a time when Democrats say toughness is one of their most coveted assets in their battle against Trump …. It could help Biden allay the doubts of Democratic voters who have continually complained in interviews that the former vice president is too soft-spoken … Though most political consultants would counsel their candidates not to personally attack voters as Biden did Thursday, he at least looked like he wouldn’t shy away from the fight.

That seems to be a charitable take on what happened, to put it mildly. On Friday, the day after the confrontation, even the 77 year-old Biden said he shouldn’t have challenged the out-of-shape voter to a push-up contest. Online, people were having a field day about one part of the heated conversation where the former vice-president appears to call the man “fat.”

Tellingly, one of Biden’s more brazen insults directed at the voter in Iowa produced almost no reaction: Biden challenged the voter to an IQ test. This is an old obsession with him. When he first ran for president in 1987, he told a new Hampshire voter “I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect … I’d be delighted to sit down and compare my IQ to yours if you’d like.”

Underwhelming Biden

Perhaps this wouldn’t have largely have escaped notice if Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Mayor Pete Buttigieg decided to employ a similar insult. She’s a Harvard prof and he’s a Rhodes scholar, so maybe people would consider it unforgivably patronizing if they lorded their credentials over a normal voter.

But I think it’s fair to say Biden’s intellectual reputation is such that most people would think publicly offering to take an IQ test would be inadvisable. Yet he seems to skate whenever he says outrageous things that question his competence, such as when he plays into racial stereotypes or encourages people to brandish shotguns. It gets laughed off as Uncle Joe’s monkeyshines or whatever.

Biden obviously has exceptional retail political skills, and it’s true that not everyone who is bright and capable comes off in a wonky fashion that everybody recognizes as smart. But setting aside his talent for campaigning, Biden’s entire career as a politician is marked by a series of ethical lapses and terrible judgments.

Years ago, I did a survey of his political career and the results were underwhelming. Biden supported for the SALT II treaty, which in retrospect looks like a misplaced sop to the Soviets. Thanks to his egregious and unfair grandstanding on the judiciary committee in the 1980s, it’s arguable that no single figure did as much to turn the Supreme Court nominations process into the goat rodeo it is today, and he unintentionally galvanized support to turn the conservative legal movement into the formidable force it is today.

In his six-terms in the Senate, Biden drafted and passed one bill, the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which is now singled out by criminal justice reform activists as the poster child for what not to do legislatively. (Another major part of Biden’s law, the Violence Against Women Act, was partially struck down by SCOTUS.)

While Biden was vice president, one of his aides wrote a scathing memoir for the administration’s failures hold Wall Street accountable after 2008, called The Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins. It directly fingers Biden as part of the problem.

Then there was the time Biden publicly bet his vice presidency on negotiating a Status of Forces Agreement for U.S. troops to remain in Iraq. Suffice to say, Biden failed to do this, and most people agree this failure immediately paved the way for the Islamic State’s rise to power in the Middle East, where at one point the barbarous death cult controlled a de facto nation the size of Joe’s native state of Pennsylvania.

Yet in 2012 The Atlantic actually ran the article “Joe Biden: The Most Influential Vice President in History?” that specifically singled out Biden for his dominant role in the Obama administration’s role in reining in Wall Street and crafting foreign policy.

On the flip side, what are his actual accomplishments? Try and name them. Here’s CNN’s attempt to do a timeline of key events in his life, for what it’s worth. He was in the Senate and White House for 44 years straight. (Note that we haven’t discussed his repeated and inexcusable plagiarism in law school, as well as during his first presidential campaign.)

What It Means to be ‘Smart’

That brings us back to the IQ test. At what point would you say Biden’s actual discernment, the kind of thing you would attribute to intelligence, is bad? Again, none of this is to say Biden is necessarily dumb. As Biden is fond of reminding people, he went to law school on an academic scholarship, and plenty of demonstrably smart people, especially those inhabiting D.C., can be and are often very wrong about political judgments.

But we should also ask ourselves what it means to be “smart” in a political context. A couple of months ago, I was at a party where Pascal Emmanuel Gobry started discoursing, as French intellectuals are wont to do, about how D.C. was essentially held hostage by a cartel of 140 IQs who run This Town.

Now, these people are pretty smart, and many people would say that’s the problem. When you have that kind of intelligence and you’re close to power you’re frankly dangerous, absent some kind of worldview that discourages the worst technocratic utopian impulses and constantly reminds you of how selfish and flawed human nature is. You’re smart enough to dream up and implement a lot of answers to big problems but not smart enough to come up with many actual solutions to what are at root very complicated problems requiring a lot of collective sacrifices to fix. Or, worse, you fail to recognize that some basic problems of governance are tied to the problems of human nature—and you can’t fix that.

But Gobry’s ultimate point about the problem with D.C.’s leadership was that in the 21st century the people who really get stuff done and shift paradigms tend to have radically different emotional and intellectual frameworks that often exist outside of what we conventionally see as “smart.” In the business world this is widely recognized and discussed—Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, et al. are a bunch of weirdos and we admire them for it, even when their behavior might be a problem. Ironically for our purposes, Musk’s tweets have gotten him in legal trouble, and no one has diminished Jobs’ genius even though he might be dead because of his misplaced and decidedly unscientific faith in alternative medicine.

In politics, such unorthodox behavior is a liability—or at least it was until Donald Trump came along. D.C.’s cognoscenti are naturally losing their minds because they can’t wrap their heads around the fact that Trump’s eccentricities might mean he’s capable of insights that are beyond them. That last point is key, because it causes establishment D.C, to uncharitably see anyone who recognizes Trump’s insights as valuable on some level as also being stupid or in the sway of some “cult.”

Now I’m emphatically not saying Trump is self-evidently a genius just because his discourse operates far outside what passes for acceptable in D.C. Ironically, he seems to exhibit the same kind of weird intellectual insecurity that Biden does, constantly saying things such as “throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart” and “I have all the best words” etc. (Although I confess I did find it amusing that when Hillary Clinton accused him at a presidential debate of not paying any federal income tax and he responded “That makes me smart,” because it was, for once, a metacommentary on him being smart.)

But for all of Trump’s foibles and mistakes, unlike Biden the man has an actual track record, both in his business and political career, of at key moments having really good and wildly counterintuitive instincts. Maybe a lot of it didn’t result in super-substantial achievements, and it must be said, Trump’s success owes a lot to inherited wealth.

But he certainly has at times run rings around the establishment in New York and DC, has buildings all over the world with his name on them, and got himself elected leader of the free world. His presidency, even with impeachment proceedings and lots of erratic behavior, has been a success on several fronts for Republican voters and the country generally—two confirmed SCOTUS justices, widespread deregulation, and 3.5 percent unemployment with positive economic indicators across the board.

That’s not nothing, and a contrast to Biden. Is there a figure in America with Biden’s level of name recognition who , again, would stump the average citizen if asked to name something he had specifically accomplished? (No piggybacking on Obama’s accomplishments.)

Hypocrisy

But Biden’s lengthy and lackluster-bordering-on-disastrous political career isn’t an issue for him or an indictment of his intelligence, according to the people who run D.C. That’s because he’s been wrong in all the ways that support the hubristic notions of a bunch of people with 140 IQs and Ivy League degrees.

Meanwhile, Trump demonstrably confounds the same well-credentialed, intellectually inbred people who expect to dominate the nation’s capital. To date, there have still been next to no attempts to understand the guy, or what voters saw in him, beyond a lot of self-reinforcing jokes about Drumpf being a stable genius.

The end result of all this, if I understand it right, is that a former six-term senator and vice-president told an Iowa voter he is too dumb to demand answers about the gross corruption of his drug-addled son that he obviously enabled. It’s hard to imagine a better metaphor for how politicians are patronizing and entitled.

As for the relatively sedate reaction to this exchange, no matter how much popular discontent ordinary voters express, the orders have gone out. We must not under any circumstances let them labor under the delusion they might have better ideas than those currently running the country, especially when such a delusion might get in the way of all the money people are making off of politics or otherwise cause any upheaval in Washington.

Perhaps it’s understandable that people have concerns about Trump’s destabilizing outbursts, but it’s also true that Trump’s presidency has illuminated lots of hypocritical ways that D.C. pretends that erratic behavior, bad judgment, and corruption is acceptable or even savvy, so long as it preserves the status quo or otherwise serves entrenched interests. In contrast to the way Trump’s insults are treated, it’s otherwise hard to explain how Biden gets a pass on calling a reasonable Iowa voter a fat, unintelligent, liar.’

Joe Biden May Pledge To Serving One Term,"Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden is reportedly telling supporters and advisers he would be a one-term president if elected to the White House next fall, according to a new Politico report.

Biden, 77, would be 82-years-old at the time of re-election in 2024 making the former vice president the first president elected in his 80s if successful.

Several advisers told Politico that it was “virtually inconceivable” Biden would seek re-election after a first term, and Biden himself has been pursuing a strategy of quietly indicating he would decline to run for re-election.

Biden advisers said they fear a public pledge would damage Biden’s political capital and make him a lame-duck president. One advisor, however, argued the pledge could also be a boon to younger voters worried about another eight years of generational stasis.

Doubts about Biden’s age have dogged the Democratic frontrunner throughout the campaign as the candidate has made a series of slip-ups raising questions about Biden’s sharpness and ability to take on President Donald Trump next fall, let alone command the Oval Office.

Several other candidates in the race are also well into their 70s. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is the oldest major candidate at 78-years-old, followed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg at 77 who is a few months older than Biden. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is 70.

No other candidate has brought on the skepticism of age quite like Biden, whose series of campaign gaffes have repeatedly shown his age on the trail and raised concerns about his fitness for office.

From forgetting California Senator Kamala Harris on the debate stage last month, to mixing up states several times, to recommending families gather around their “record player” at the Democratic debate in September, Biden’s age has become an issue in the race.

One advisor speaking to Politico defended Biden, saying he would be a good transition figure, needed to stop Trump from getting a second term while allowing for the following election to be one for the next generation of Democrats.

“I’d love to have an election this year for the next generation of leaders, but if I have to wait four years [in order to] to get rid of Trump, I’m willing to do it,” the advisor told Politico.

Biden denied Politico’s reporting, and said he had no plans to be a one-term president.

"IRS Goes After Hunter Biden For Over $112,000 In Unpaid Taxes","The IRS placed a tax lien on Hunter Biden, and his ex-wife Kathleen Biden, for a whopping $112,805 in unpaid taxes, according to a report from the Daily Caller. Washington D.C. also placed a tax lien against Hunter Biden and his ex-wife for $48,929 in unpaid income taxes.

Both of the tax liens were filed to collect taxes dating back to 2015. Shortly before 2015, Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, for which is was paid more than $700,000.

In 2013, Biden began working for the board of BHR Partners, a Chinese private equity firm. According to the New York Times, in October 2017, Hunter Biden bought 10 percent of BHR Partners stock, investing approximately $420,000. According to George Mesires, Hunter Biden’s lawyer, Hunter Biden has not been compensated for his position or received returns on his investment.

“He has not been compensated for being on the board of directors, nor has he received any return on his investment to date,” Mesires said.

Hunter Biden’s 2017 investment seems like a poor decision in lieu of how much debt he is in. During their divorce in 2016, Kathleen Biden said their family faced a disturbing amount of debts, including, “maxed-out credit card debt, double mortgages on both real properties they own, and tax debt of at least $313,970.”

Kathleen Biden also complained that Hunter Biden was spending excess money on his own interests, leaving his family with no means to pay back their debt or bills.

So while Hunter Biden knew he was in tax debt in 2016, he invested more than his debt in an overseas company. Hunter Biden also announced that he would resign from the board of BHR Partners by the end of October, however, according to the Daily Caller, as of December 29, Hunter Biden is still a listed board member.

While Democrats pass laws and jump through hoops to access President Donald Trump’s tax records, they are unable to hold former Vice President Joe Biden’s son accountable. Hunter Biden is evading U.S. taxation by investing in foreign companies, leaving his family to deal with the consequences of his poor decisions.

"Joe Biden Assisted Terrorist Soleimani, Warned Against Killing Bin Laden","As vice president, Joe Biden made foreign political decisions that helped terrorist leader Quasem Soleimani form an Iranian-friendly government in Iraq. Biden also warned President Barack Obama against raiding, and inevitably killing, Osama bin Laden in 2011. The record shows that Biden made foreign policy decisions that cut in favor of international terrorists.

According to a 2013 New Yorker profile, Biden played a pivotal role in pushing the United States out of Iraq and handing over power to Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism. According to the profile, Biden called the pro-American Iraqi politician Ayad Allawi to ask he stop trying to form a government. This left space for Soleimani to ensure an Iranian-backed politician took control of the Iraqi government.

After the U.S. military killed Soleimani, Biden released a statement claiming Soleimani’s death was a “hugely escalatory move in an already dangerous region.”

“President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox, and he owes the American people an explanation of the strategy and plan to keep safe our troops and embassy personnel,” Biden said.

My statement on the killing of Qassem Soleimani. pic.twitter.com/4Q9tlLAYFB — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 3, 2020

Soleimani’s rise to power in the Middle East was aided by the Obama administration’s disastrous “Iran Nuclear Deal,” as well as Biden’s assistance for Soleimani’s Iranian power in Iraq, Syria, and other Middle Eastern countries.

This is not the only example of Biden’s horrible decision making in the Middle East. In 2011, Obama assembled a team in the White House Situation Room to make a final decision on whether to launch a raid against what intelligence believed was Osama bin Laden.

“Mr. President, my suggestion is, don’t go,” Biden said as he recounted the bin Laden raid. The raid was incredibly successful and led to the death of bin Laden, the al-Quaeda leader and mastermind behind 9/11. Biden touted his record against the bid Laden raid, then, in 2015 flip-flopped his stance and said he advised Obama to “go with his gut.”

On CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Biden contradicted himself on the moment he told Obama not to act on the bin Laden raid. Instead, he changed the narrative, claiming he told Obama to take more precautionary steps.

“In order to give the president the leeway he needed, I said, ‘Mr. President, there’s one more thing we can do.’ … One more pass to see if it was bin Laden. I said, ‘You should do that, and there’d still be time to have the raid, but that’s what I would do,” Biden said.

He continued by claiming he privately told Obama to follow his instincts.

In 2012, Obama undercut Biden’s shifting story during a presidential debate against Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Obama made it clear Biden had opposed the bin Laden raid.

“Even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did,” Obama said to Romney.

Biden’s foreign policy plans seem to cut in favor of terrorists, whether it be leaving room for Soleimani to influence power in Iraq, or leaving bin Laden alive. It’s clear Biden’s compass on foreign policy is flawed and he is attempting to conceal his poor judgment.

"Heading Into The Next Debate, Biden Keeps Chugging Along","If anything has defined the Democratic primary for president over the past six months, it has been how little change has occurred among the frontrunners’ poll numbers. According to Real Clear Politics, going into July of last year Joe Biden was at 32 percent, Bernie Sanders at 16 percent, Warren, 11 percent, and Buttigieg 8 percent. Today, Biden is at 30 percent, Sanders at 20 percent, Warren, 14 percent and Buttigieg still at 8 percent.

This is not to say that nothing has changed along the way. There have been spikes and hiccups. Kamala Harris had a boomlet in July, peaking at 15 percent in the middle of that month, likewise Warren surged, almost tying Biden by early October at 26 percent. Buttigieg has had some flashy polls results in Iowa and New Hampshire, but has failed to turn that into a national uptick.

Basically, we are where we started if you swap out Beto O’Rourke’s failed campaign with Mike Bloomberg’s failing campaign, both of which have existed in the mid-single digits. And while experts and pundits alike will wag their fingers and say national polls don’t matter, the lack of significant change since summer is startling.

The biggest takeaway is Joe Biden’s staying power. While he has not been able to get higher than his 30-35 percent range, he has been the wire-to-wire leader in the polls. He is actually pretty close to where Donald Trump was this time in 2016. At that time, Trump was still not viewed as inevitable, just as Biden isn’t, but his victory in New Hampshire stabilized his campaign and by March he had shot up over 40 percent.

Back in the halcyon days of the most diverse set of candidates ever all raising their hands to support free health care for illegal immigrants and fawning over the Green New Deal Biden seemed like an out of step old man in Democratic Party. He was like the guy on the wrong side of 45 trying to dance with young women at the hot new club, a little awkward, didn’t quite seem to belong, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has murmured that she and Uncle Joe don’t belong in the same party.

But if the poll numbers haven’t moved much since July, the general attitude of the Democratic primary has by drifting to the center. It is difficult exactly to pinpoint where this started, but Warren’s dropoff after trying to explain that she would basically pay for Medicare for All with a bag of magic beans is somewhere around the turning point.

The party’s shift to the center, or at least away from outright crazy progressive nonsense, has set Biden up nicely. His basic message has always been a return to normalcy after the tumultuous time of Trump. He’s not running on big policy ideas but on safe choices and mild rhetoric. This is a lane that Buttigieg has tried to butt into as well, but in some sense, both his age and the historic nature of being the first openly gay candidate are at odds with his thirst to be seen as the moderate.

Going into Thursday night’s debate the leading progressive candidates, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren will have to try to push this primary a bit back to the left. AOC’s proclamation that the Democratic Party has a tent that is too big might point the way, at least for Sanders who she has endorsed. Meanwhile Warren needs to steady herself after a tough couple of months that have her on the ropes.

But still in the middle of the stage will be Vice President Biden, with his sparkly white smile, and grandfatherly attitude assuring us that, “No, I mean it, I really do.” And so far it’s been good enough. Watching the Biden campaign is like watching a basketball team play really effective half court, pick-and-roll offense, technically sound, you can appreciate it, but it doesn’t get you out of your seat like a slam dunk on a fast break.

And that, that sense of enthusiasm, is the big difference between Trump in July of 2016 and Biden today. Where as Trump was filling stadiums, Biden is facing a Tik Tok campaign of teenagers begging the Democratic Party not to make them vote for him.

I’ve written in the past about the difference between cult of personality presidents and manager presidents. I roughly define the former as those who normal people might have a picture of on their wall. Both Obama and Trump were cult of personality candidates and presidents, people placed their hopes and dreams in them. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were managers; they were not beloved.

If Joe Biden becomes the 46th president of the United States there won’t be a lot of posters of him in people’s houses. In no small sense this is what he is running on. Can slow and steady win the race for Biden? Will Warren and Sanders risk left flank attacks to push the primary back into progressive fairyland? Is it time for the knives to come out regarding Hunter Biden and Ukraine?

It doesn’t feel like it, and while anything can happen in a debate (just ask Robot Rubio), no clear path to knock Biden off his perch seems visible at the moment. Assuming he doesn’t make any major flubs he has a very good chance to maintain his lead and try to construct the air of inevitability.

"If Bernie Sanders Doesn’t Win Iowa, Joe Biden Will Be The Nominee","For all the noise and drama of the 2020 Democratic primary—all the talk of a “diverse” field of candidates and the rise of the party’s progressive wing—it might turn out that the old white guy wins the whole thing easily. The old white guy in this case is Joe Biden, not Bernie Sanders, who needs to win the upcoming Iowa caucuses, and probably the New Hampshire primary, to stave off an inevitable Biden nomination.

A pair of polls released Monday made the stakes clear heading into Iowa, now less than three weeks away. A Monmouth University poll confirmed that the Democratic field has narrowed to four frontrunners: Biden, Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Biden leads the pack with 24% and Sanders follows with 18%. Both candidates gained five points compared to Monmouth’s November poll, while both Warren and Buttigieg lost support.

Meanwhile, a Washington Post-Ipsos poll found Biden is by far the most favored candidate among black Americans, whose support plays a significant role in the Democratic nomination. A whopping 48% of such respondents say they support Biden, while just 20% support Sanders, and no other candidate had double-digit support.

All this reflects the Real Clear Politics poll average, which currently shows Biden with a nearly ten-point lead, and confirms what’s been apparent for months now, ever since Warren’s support began a precipitous decline in October: if Biden can win Iowa and New Hampshire, the nominating contest might well be over before ballots are even cast in Nevada and South Carolina at the end of February. And given Biden’s support among black voters, a strong performance in South Carolina would all but cinch the nomination before Super Tuesday, with donors and voters alike flocking to Biden’s camp.

A Biden Nomination Could Split the Democratic Party

In this scenario, the Democratic primary season might prove rather dull for the political press. There would be no race for delegates, no big reveals or reversals on Super Tuesday, and no contested convention this summer.

But there might be a far bigger story: the crack-up of the Democratic Party. It’s no secret that the candidacies of Sanders and Warren represent the ascendency of the far-left in the Democratic coalition, even as Biden and, to a lesser extent, Buttigieg, represent the less extreme Obama wing of the party, which includes most of the Wall Street donor class. These two factions have been on a collision course for years, and if the media hadn’t been so obsessed with the GOP crack-up in 2016, we might have heard more about it before now.

But a Biden sweep of the primaries could expose this division as a far deeper and uncrossable chasm than anyone has yet realized. Already, there are signs of widening divide. In a recent fawning profile of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezin New York magazine, the celebrity congresswoman said the Congressional Progressive Caucus should start kicking out Democrats who are insufficiently leftist, adding that the same goes for the entire party: “Democrats can be too big of a tent.”

Asked in the same profile about the prospect of being a lawmaker during a Biden presidency, she replied (with a groan), “Oh God. In any other country, Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party, but in America, we are.”

But for how long? Progressives were enraged at how Sanders was treated in 2016—the Democratic National Convention featured more and larger protests of Hillary Clinton and the DNC than any Trump protests at the GOP convention. If Sanders is shunted aside again for an establishment candidate, how will the party’s left wing react?

If recent months are any guide, they won’t react well, and might not be above intentionally hurting their own party—and their nominee’s chances in the general election—if they think it will help them wrest control from the establishment.

Just last week, AOC defended her decision not to pay dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, instead saying she would funnel money directly to Democratic candidates, including some who are trying to unseat Democratic incumbents. That matters because AOC is the Democrats’ top fundraiser in the House, surpassing even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, raking in more than $1.4 million between July 1 and September 30.

All of this points to a reckoning in the Democratic Party that might come to a head in the next two months. AOC and the other true-believing progressive Democrats think the strength of their party lies in doubling down on leftism and identity politics—and purging their ranks. They are certainly wrong about that, but it might not stop them from destroying their own party.

Joe Biden Used To Be Right About Government Child Care,"Should the federal government fund child care for working parents at the expense of families who provide the primary care for their children? Every Democratic candidate for president thinks so.

The discussion at this last debate was markedly different than when Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was still present, however. Last July, Gillibrand criticized Joe Biden’s past opposition to a child care tax credit, citing a 1981 op-ed he authored as the sole Senate vote opposing an expansion of the credit, which extended even to high-income earners. The headline most ruffled Gillibrand’s feathers: “Congress Is Subsidizing Deterioration Of Family.”

Gillibrand accused Biden of opposing working women, so of course his stance on subsidized child care has fully evolved, despite her mischaracterization of his argument. It’s a shame, though, because his opposition to funding child care for parents who don’t have the financial need for two incomes was principled, and his defense was insightful.

It’s worth revisiting Biden’s arguments for fairness in our fiscal policy and for caution in the underlying social policy. Both still apply to the debate today.

Government Shouldn’t Favor Day Care over Parent Care

Our democratic culture is rabidly relativistic about valuations of many things: art, beauty, dress, physical appearance, personal identity, lifestyle choice — and whether a mother works or stays home, breastfeeds or uses formula, delivers naturally or opts for the epidural. The realm of childrearing is no exception to this cultural discourse — despite, unfortunately, the ironically bipolar form of dogmatism that mothers today still endure about ther choices they might make. Ever try to order a glass of wine or a grande latte while eight-months pregnant? Save yourself the insufferable lectures from strangers.

In most of these areas, liberalized societies desperately need to regain a shared understanding of truth. That said, thanks to modern innovations ranging from streamlined freelancing opportunities to online marketplaces, there are dozens of ways for families to organize how they earn income, parent, and engage in other forms of caretaking. Likewise, there are as many ways to be a good mother as there are mothers.

So why should the heavy hand of government tip the scales in favor of day care? Biden made this case in 1981 as a simple matter of fairness, stating, “I do not believe it fair to ask a family of marginal income, choosing to provide the primary care for their children, to subsidize an upper income family’s day care.”

As a mother who chooses to stay home, snatching chunks of time to work whenever they come to me during the day, I consider myself extremely blessed. At the same time, I fully share Biden’s sentiment, and I can only imagine how much stronger a family of more modest means who chooses to provide the primary care for their children might share it.

Families can organize their own affairs, whether that’s having a full-time stay-at-home mom or dad, a work-from-home mom, or both parents working outside the home. Studies have shown most women actually want to be home with their children, so why would we penalize this choice in favor of someone else’s?

Biden Is Adopting Policies He Once Condemned

Biden also made a radically unpopular argument that was apparently unpopular even in 1981: Families have the responsibility to care for their own, but our society largely neglects these bonds in favor of pursuing more things.

“The day-care centers and nursing homes blossoming across the American landscape are monuments to our growing unwillingness to accept personal responsibility for those to whom we own the most — our children, our parents and our grandparents,” Biden wrote. “I do not believe that the federal government should be a party to a system which encourages couples to place their children in day-care centers in order to acquire material possessions that go far beyond any family basic necessities.”

Biden made a strong case to see child care tax credits as a social policy that shapes society’s choices and values. When modern families are fortunate enough to have the basic material comfort needed to raise children through one parent’s income, they then have to make a choice about how to provide care for their children. This is and should be a personal choice families make.

But Biden recognized that America had fallen victim to a pervasive materialism and that those in power too often prey upon this impulse through a form of amoral capitalism that holds GDP above all else, even at the sake of the natural bonds and duties of family.

Biden refused to endorse a policy that would incentivize the distortions of materialism while eroding our most basic social fabric. He saw his colleagues using tax credits to nudge mothers who might otherwise stay home with their children back into the market — to keep earning, so they could keep buying, so the cogs could keep turning, so the machine could keep rolling. All masked, of course, in the cry of women’s liberation.

Sadly, that was the Biden of the ’80s. Biden 2020 sounds like a caricature of what he once decried. When announcing his $8,000 tax credit for anyone to use toward child care, Biden told the crowd, “It would put 720 million women back in the workforce. It would increase the GDP — to sound like a wonk here — by about eight-tenths of 1 percent. It would grow the economy.” Biden has officially succumbed to woke capitalism.

Good Policy Doesn’t Hurt Families

All of that said, this doesn’t mean the government should do nothing. Instead of having an $8,000 tax credit that gives a boost only to families using day care, why not structure the assistance so parents can best decide how to spend the money — a solution that truly liberates a woman’s choice?

One practical solution would be allowing all women to spend more time with their babies and children, rather than encouraging the opposite. There is a political appetite for a paid family leave proposal that wouldn’t raise taxes, increase the debt, or adversely affect women’s wages or employment. The only proposal that fits this bill is the Cassidy-Sinema plan, a budget-neutral, bipartisan plan to allow parents to pay for their own leave.

Under the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, parents receive up to a $2,000 child tax credit (CTC) for each child. The Cassidy-Sinema plan would allow parents to front-load this credit to receive up to $5,000 upon the birth or adoption of a child. The CTC would then be adjusted to $1,500 annually for the next 10 years. For families facing that sudden increase in costs with the arrival of a baby, or who don’t have employer-provided paid leave, this money would be a welcome relief, affording mothers and fathers that necessary period of bonding with their baby.

According to a Pew study, in 2016, 50 percent of Americans who took family leave had to use savings set aside for another purpose to cover their lost wages due to child care expenses; 37 percent took on debt, and 41 percent had to cut their leave time short.

Parents could also choose to use the front-loaded tax credit in other ways that might benefit their family more, especially if their employers already provide leave. Note that parents are doing the choosing, not the government. Families often encounter unexpected costs associated with childbirth, infant care, maternal care, and, should they choose to go back to work, child care. The Cassidy-Sinema plan would provide a no-strings-attached boost that would help working parents and stay-at-home moms all the same.

Since it seems the Democrats have formed a party line on this issue, it’s up to Republicans to develop creative solutions that treat all families fairly. It’s comic, but this time, Republicans’ guiding light won’t be Thomas Jefferson or Ronald Reagan. It will be Joe Biden.

Joe Biden Claims His Son Got Burisma Job Because He's 'A Very Bright Guy',"During an interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie, former Vice President Joe Biden said his son Hunter Biden was asked to be a board member of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma because he is “a very bright guy.”

“Do you think it was wrong for [Hunter] to take that position knowing that it was really because that company wanted access to you?” Guthrie asked.

“Well that’s not true. You’re saying things you do not know what you’re talking about,” Biden responded.

Biden claimed his son got asked to be a board member of Burisma because he was a bright guy, not because his last name was Biden.

Joe Biden on why his son Hunter — who had no experience in Ukraine or in the energy sector — got an $80,000-per-month board seat with Burisma as father Biden was running US policy in Ukraine: ""Cause he's a very bright guy."" pic.twitter.com/2jOFbZQsre — Aaron Maté (@aaronjmate) February 3, 2020

In 2014, during his father’s time as vice president, Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company. He was paid upwards of $50,000 per month, a shockingly high salary for Hunter Biden’s non-existent experience in the energy sector.

In 2018, Joe Biden bragged about withholding aid from Ukraine until they fired their top prosecutor. At the time, this top prosecutor was investigating Burisma, the very company Hunter Biden was a board member of.

The Bidens’ perceived misconduct is at the heart of the Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump. In July 2019, Trump allegedly withheld Ukrainian military aid in hopes their government would launch an investigation into the Biden’s over potential malpractice in their previous dealings.

Since the inception of the impeachment trial, more allegations of misconduct against Hunter Biden have been discovered. The IRS went after Hunter Biden for evading income taxes up to $112,000. It was discovered his payout of $50,000 per month was far above comparable board positions and Hunter Biden also ran interference for a corrupt Romanian business tycoon.

In Monday’s “Today Show” interview, Joe Biden argued his son did nothing wrong and that it was merely the appearance of impropriety that was drawing media attention.

“No one’s found anything wrong with [Hunter’s] dealing with Ukraine, except they say it sets a bad image,” Biden said.

Hunter Biden was overly compensated for a position he was under qualified solely because of his last name. He evaded taxes and displayed a pattern of working with corrupt actors. For Joe Biden to negate these facts when running interference for his son is preposterous.

A winning argument for Joe Biden as he continues on the 2020 campaign trail is centered around admitting his son held the Burisma board position because of his last name. Joe Biden can claim his son did nothing wrong when working on the board, however, to insert the argument that Hunter Biden received his Burisma board position because he was “a very bright guy,” will not go far with primary voters who watch the questionable practices and patterns of Hunter Biden from afar.

"Sens. Grassley, Johnson Request Hunter Biden Travel Records","Two top Republican senators requested Hunter Biden’s official travel records Wednesday from the Secret Service in the latest move of their ongoing investigation into Biden’s conflicts of interest.

Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who leads the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, penned a letter to the Secret Service to learn whether Biden “used government-sponsored travel to help conduct private business” stemming from his work with overseas nations.

The committees, the senators wrote, is “reviewing potential conflicts of interest posed by the business activities of Hunter Biden and his associates during the Obama administration, particularly with respect to his business activities in Ukraine and China.”

In 2013, Biden flew aboard Air-Force Two with his father Vice President Joe Biden to China and arranged meetings with Chinese businessmen. Soon after, a series of transactions followed that benefited Hunter Biden’s firm, BHR. Hunter Biden also served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, raking in upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry while his father dictated U.S. policy towards Ukraine as vice president.

A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals just how much Biden was being showered in excess compensation. According to Reuters, Burisma reported $400 million in revenues in 2018, while Exxon Mobil reported earnings of $20.8 billion. Board members for Exxon Mobil, however, earned little more than half what Biden was bringing in from Burisma.

Grassley and Johnson have requested the Secret Service to:

1. Please describe the protective detail that Hunter Biden received while his father was Vice President. 2. Please provide a list of all dates and locations of travel, international and domestic, for Hunter Biden while he received a protective detail. In your response, please note whether his travel was on Air Force One or Two, or other government aircraft, as applicable and whether additional family members were present for each trip.

The letter comes on the same day President Donald Trump was acquitted on both impeachment counts passed by the House in December charging Trump with “abuse of power” and “obstruction of Congress.”

House Democrats accused Trump of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate corruption related to the Biden family in exchange for nearly $400 million in withheld military aid in an alleged quid pro quo. The aid, however, was ultimately released to the eastern European nation by the congressionally mandated deadline without a single investigation in Ukraine that the president allegedly demanded.

The Senate voted to acquit Trump on the “abuse of power” charge 52-48 and “obstruction of Congress,” 53-47. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney was the only Republican to cross party lines and vote to convict Trump on abuse of power. Democrats needed 67 votes, a two-thirds majority, to remove Trump from office.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/06/sens-grassley-johnson-request-hunter-biden-travel-records/,2020-02-06
Why Joe Biden’s Collapse In Iowa Means Trouble For Democrats,"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire — Of all the Democratic caucusgoers I spoke with in Iowa last week, not one told me his or her first choice was Joe Biden. Now I know why: there were never that many Biden supporters in Iowa to begin with.

All of the caucus results might not be in yet, but we know enough to say with confidence that Biden’s campaign in Iowa collapsed. Despite leading in many state polls over the past year, he finished a distant fourth, barely clearing the 15 percent threshold for viability and, with 86 percent of precincts reporting as of this writing, earning 10,000 fewer votes statewide than Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who came in third.

The media, which still relies far too much on polls, wasn’t expecting this. But I have a feeling it didn’t shock many Iowa Democrats. As Jay Cost noted on Twitter, Biden peaked at 28.5 percent in the RealClearPolitics poll average in Iowa, but “the more voters saw of him, the less they liked.”

The big story out of Iowa, then, isn’t necessarily the broken app or the utter incompetence of the Iowa State Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee (although those are important stories that will likely take on more significance as the cycle goes on). The big story is that Biden, the presumptive Democratic frontrunner right up until Monday night, might not survive past South Carolina, which has now become his firewall.

By all accounts, Biden was betting big on Iowa, having eschewed much effort or expense in New Hampshire, where the candidates are now campaigning but Biden has a far smaller presence than his rivals. Since the new year, Biden’s paltry media buys and infrequent campaign events in New Hampshire this week indicate he assumed he didn’t need to win the first presidential primary—or that he couldn’t win it.

Here in Manchester, there are scant signs of the Biden campaign—few yard signs, infrequent ads, and almost no events anywhere in the state ahead of the primary apart from a few get-out-the-vote speeches and a CNN town hall earlier this week. (By contrast, the Buttigieg campaign appears to be in high gear, with a steady stream of volunteers coming and going from a field office downtown.)

Beyond New Hampshire, Biden now faces a tough battle in the Nevada caucus later this month, which Sen. Bernie Sanders is favored to win with strong Hispanic support. That leaves Biden with the possible scenario that he goes into South Carolina with zero victories, and maybe not even strong showings, in the first three states—itself a sobering reminder that Biden has never won a presidential primary.

All of that means Pete Buttigieg, who as of this writing appears to have won Iowa by a razor-thin margin, is the Democratic Party establishment’s last, best hope to prevent Sanders from winning the nomination and possibly leading the party to a 1972 George McGovern-style defeat.

Democrats ‘Have Got To Wake Up’

That in turn should greatly worry moderate and centrist Democrats, because so far there’s no sign that Buttigieg, despite his strong showing in Iowa, can put together a coalition of Democratic voters that can win a general election. Specifically, the former South Bend mayor has failed to gather much support from black Americans even as the Trump campaign makes its own appeal to these voters.

Indeed, President Trump’s State of the Union speech Tuesday night seemed tailored to appeal to black and Hispanic voters, touting record-low levels of minority unemployment, job growth, wage growth, and highlighting policies like school choice that would disproportionately advantage black Americans—a point Trump drove home by including fourth-grader Janiyah Davis and her mother among White House special guests to the speech.

Black Americans might traditionally vote Democrat, but they lean more conservative on social issues than their white counterparts in the Democratic Party, as do Hispanics. What’s more, as the Democratic Party moves further to the left—a move driven almost entirely by white leftists—the tension between the party’s woke whites and conservative-minded minorities will become more pronounced, leaving an opening for a GOP appeal.

This isn’t just wishful thinking from the Trump campaign. After the State of the Union, CNN’s Van Jones warned his fellow commentators that Trump’s appeal to black voters just might work. “We’ve got to wake up, folks. There’s a whole bubble thing that goes on—‘well he said s-hole nations therefore all black people are going to hate him forever.’ That ain’t necessarily so,” Jones said. “What you’re going to see him do is say, you may not like my rhetoric but look at my results, look at my record, to black people. If he narrow-casts that, it’s going to be effective.”

WAKE UP, folks. The #IowaCaucus was a debacle, followed by a strong #SOTU speech laying out Trump's strategy to win – which includes going for Black voters. This was a warning shot from the Trump campaign to liberals, and we need to take this VERY seriously in order to win. @CNN pic.twitter.com/bgBFms9jtN — Van Jones (@VanJones68) February 5, 2020

Jones is right, and Trump doesn’t even have to peel off that many minority voters to disrupt the Democratic coalition. Democrats might do that themselves before the general election. It might be enough for Biden simply to get knocked out of the running, which could keep black voters from turning out in significant numbers. With a nominee like Buttigieg, that’s a real possibility, especially if his campaign can’t figure out how to draw more minority support.

As the Democratic presidential campaigns fan out across New Hampshire this week, that should weigh heavy on the minds of Democratic Party leaders, especially given that Sanders leads in the latest New Hampshire poll, which also shows Biden losing support. Having won the popular vote in Iowa (if not the delegate count), a New Hampshire win for Sanders would give his campaign tremendous momentum going into Nevada and South Carolina, and drastically increase the likelihood of a contested convention in Milwaukee come July.

Joe Biden Calls New Hampshire Woman ‘A Lying Dog-Faced Pony Soldier’,"In the days leading up to the New Hampshire primary, 2020 candidate Joe Biden hosted a town hall in Hampton where he insulted a supporter for asking him a tough question. A New Hampshire woman in the audience asked Biden how he planned to turn his campaign around after a poor performance in the Iowa Caucuses.

“You’re arguably the candidate with the greatest advantage in this race. You’ve been the vice president, you weren’t burdened down by the impeachment trials, so how do you explain the performance in Iowa? And why should the voters believe that you can win the national election?” the woman asked.

Biden asked the woman if she’s ever been to a caucus before. When she replied yes, Biden insulted her and called her a liar.

“No you haven’t. You’re a lying dog-face pony solider,” Biden said.

Biden used this line in previous speeches. He claims “lying dog-face pony solider” is a line from a John Wayne movie. The line is from a movie titled “She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,” but the actual quote is “the dog faced soldiers.” It is also said by the narrator, not by Wayne.

After a New Hampshire voter asks @JoeBiden why they should trust he can turn his campaign around, he asks if she’s ever been to a caucus before; when she says yes, Biden snaps: ""No you haven’t. You’re a lying dog-faced pony soldier."" pic.twitter.com/3uxOAu0Ues — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) February 9, 2020

Biden performed poorly in Iowa given his initial frontrunner status. He came in fourth place behind former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Biden received 15.8 percent of the vote in Iowa and received only six delegates. Meanwhile, the relatively unknown Buttigieg swept Biden with 13 delegates.

The New Hampshire primary takes place on Tuesday, February 11. Biden is poised to take fourth or fifth place. According to RealClear Politics’ latest aggregation, Biden is polling in fifth place behind Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Biden is polling at 11 percent, meanwhile Buttigieg and Sanders are sweeping past him at 28 and 21 percent respectively.

As implied by the New Hampshire resident’s question, early state primaries are calling Biden’s viability for the national election into question.

New Hampshire Dems Are Worried About Beating Trump. They Should Be.,"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire — It would be easy to mistake the feverish activity in New Hampshire over the past week for excitement. The state has been abuzz with Democratic presidential campaign events, armies of canvassers knocking on doors, curious voters from neighboring states coming to get a look at the candidates, and here in Manchester, swarms of reporters and camera crews.

But when you talk to voters, the overarching feeling isn’t excitement or optimism, but anxiety. Having gotten a close look at the candidates, Granite State Democrats are worried none of them can beat Trump.

They have good reason to worry. Between his powerful State of the Union address, the impeachment acquittal, rising approval ratings, and the Democratic debacle in Iowa, last week was arguably the best of Trump’s presidency. The economy is strong, approval of the Republican Party is the highest it’s been since 2005, and the two Democratic frontrunners are a 78-year-old avowed socialist and a gay 38-year-old former mayor of a small midwestern city.

All of this has not escaped the notice of New Hampshire primary voters, who go to the polls tomorrow in the first presidential primary election of 2020. That’s one reason so many of them I spoke to just days before the election were still undecided.

At an Elizabeth Warren campaign stop in Derry last week, I spoke with three New Hampshire women, Mary Bishop, her sister Nancy, and their friend Sue Dickinson. They were so shocked and disturbed by Trump’s election in 2016 that they decided to get involved and see as many candidates as possible this year, and they’ve seen them all. “The important thing is to pick the person who can beat Trump,” says Nancy. “It isn’t clear yet who that is.”

This was typical of what I heard again and again from voters. Whether it was concern over Bernie Sanders’ radical views, worries about Pete Buttigieg’s youth and inexperience, or misgivings about Joe Biden’s general baggage and lack of energy, everyone had qualms—even about their top choices.

It’s not just New Hampshire Democrats who feel this way. I spoke with three friends, retirees living in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, who traveled to New Hampshire together for a kind of candidate-scouting trip. I ask them how they feel about the Democratic field in general, after having seen all the candidates in person. There’s a pause as they glance at one another. Then one of them, Jonathan Hayes, a retired executive from Southport, Connecticut, says, “We’re nervous.”

“We haven’t seen anyone who can beat Trump,” says his friend John Stockton, a retired attorney from Harrison, New York. What about Mayor Pete? “He’s bloodless,” says Hayes. What about Joe Biden? “He’s not even here, he’s got no signs, no presence,” says Stockton. The third friend, Henry Van Kohorn from Princeton, New Jersey, nods silently in agreement. None of the candidates, says Hayes, has the kind of “rockstar” energy Obama had, and that concerns them.

Despite Media Enthusiasm, the Democratic Field Is Weak

It wasn’t supposed to be this way. The 2020 Democratic presidential field was supposed to be the most talented, diverse, and accomplished group of candidates we’d ever seen. For more than a year the media assured us that it was, even as the candidates’ manifest weaknesses became more apparent. Many of those who seemed so promising early on—Beto O’Rourke, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker—dropped out one by one before Iowa, victims of their own awkward leftward lurches and woke pandering.

And then came Iowa, where the putative frontrunner, Biden, simply collapsed. Biden came in a distant fourth, earning barely 15 percent of the vote in a caucus with lower than expected turnout. It was confirmation of what should have been obvious from the beginning: Biden is a terrible candidate who might not make it through the primaries.

Despite leading in most polls over the last year—probably as result of name recognition more than anything else—Biden has displayed a remarkable lack of energy on the campaign trail and a growing penchant for gaffes and lashing out at voters. (On Sunday, he called a woman who asked a tough question about Iowa a “lying, dog-faced pony soldier.”)

Complaints about Biden seem to be ubiquitous among voters in both Iowa and New Hampshire. One self-described working-class man I spoke to said he couldn’t believe it when Biden told a roomful of people the economy is only working for the top 1 percent, not the working class.

Another man, a Sierra Club volunteer I spoke to in Manchester, said his wife voted for Biden by absentee ballot because she’ll be out of town for Tuesday’s primary, but she immediately regretted her vote when the Iowa results came in. A 23-year-old black woman told me she won’t vote for Biden because of his treatment of Anita Hill in 1991, and that she doesn’t believe his apology.

No wonder I didn’t meet a single Biden supporter in Iowa aside from one poorly attended campaign stop.

As Biden fell, Buttigieg surged, basically fighting Sanders to a draw in Iowa (Buttigieg narrowly edged out Sanders in the delegate count while Sanders beat Buttigieg in the popular vote). His unexpectedly good showing brought a polling and fundraising boost. On Friday, Buttigieg said his campaign had raised more than $4 million in as many days, and his polls numbers have been rising, with one New Hampshire poll showing him in within the margin of error versus Sanders.

Buttigieg is now styling himself as the reasonable alternative to leftists like Sanders and Warren in an attempt to fill the moderate lane that once seemed to have room only for Biden. Indeed, Biden’s candidacy forced out a slew of actual moderates like former Maryland Rep. John Delany, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, all of whom failed to gain traction in Biden’s shadow.

The irony is that Buttigieg is no moderate. On nearly every issue, from health care to abortion to immigration, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is far to the left of both Biden and Barack Obama. He also wants to abolish the Electoral College and, unlike the farther-left Sanders, pack the Supreme Court. But of course the media won’t cover Buttigieg as anything but a moderate, as if citing religion to justify late-term abortions of disabled children somehow fits that description.

For now, Buttigieg might be able to hide his radicalism behind meaningless verbiage (see below) but in a general election it would become increasingly difficult to pass himself off as a moderate, especially among more socially conservative black voters.

Indeed, his unpopularity with black voters might be Buttigieg’s biggest liability as the Democratic nominee. As a Politico report noted recently, Buttigieg has spent millions over the past six weeks advertising in South Carolina, where a majority of Democrats are black, but has failed to increase his poll numbers there, hovering at 2 percent support among black voters—about the same as his support among black Democrats nationally.

Bernie Sanders Is Haunting The Democratic Primary

Buttigieg’s momentum notwithstanding, the most likely headline to emerge from the New Hampshire primary is a Sanders win. The Vermont senator won the 2016 primary here by 22 points and has consistently led in polls (RealClearPolitics polling average shows Sanders with a 4.8-point lead in the state).

In that case, the Sanders campaign will claim back-to-back victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, setting up for a strong showing in Nevada, where the Democratic electorate is heavily working class and Hispanic, and tends to be influenced by the results of Iowa and New Hampshire.

More so than any other Democratic contender, Sanders has worked hard on Hispanic outreach, which might play a decisive role as the primary season drags on. In Iowa, his campaign was sending out Spanish-language literature to Hispanic voters as early as last July, and while Sanders was stuck in Washington for the impeachment trial, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was stumping for him in Iowa. Mitch Henry, the former political director for the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and a Democratic precinct chair in Des Moines, told me political engagement among Iowa’s Hispanic population has exploded.

“It’s all because of Sanders’ outreach,” he says. “And when you have someone like AOC advocating, that just draws people in like nothing else.”

If Sanders pulls off a win in both New Hampshire and Nevada, he’ll be the undisputed frontrunner heading into South Carolina, where Biden will more or less have to win, and win decisively, to keep raising money and stay in the race.

This of course scares the daylights out of Democratic Party leaders, whose feelings about a Sanders nomination were best summed up by longtime Democratic strategist James Carville last week, first in a rant on MSNBC that went viral and then a follow-up interview with Vox.

WATCH: James Carville has some thoughts about what is happening in Iowa, and across the country, for Democrats. pic.twitter.com/W9KuEeFvcO — MSNBC (@MSNBC) February 5, 2020

“We have candidates on the debate stage talking about open borders and decriminalizing illegal immigration,” Carville told Vox. “They’re talking about doing away with nuclear energy and fracking. You’ve got Bernie Sanders talking about letting criminals and terrorists vote from jail cells. It doesn’t matter what you think about any of that, or if there are good arguments — talking about that is not how you win a national election. It’s not how you become a majoritarian party.”

Later, Carville called Sanders an “ideologue” who’s “never been a Democrat.” Democrat or not, Sanders is poised to become the frontrunner in a still-crowded primary field. Usually, a winnowing takes place after Iowa, but the ensuing chaos and days-long wait to get a final vote tally from the Iowa Democratic Party ensured that no one, not even Andrew Yang, who got only 1 percent, dropped out before New Hampshire.

So who will save the Democrats from Sanders? Billionaire Mike Bloomberg would like Democratic voters to know he’s waiting in the wings. The day after Iowa, encouraged by the muddled results, he announced he was doubling his ad spending in Super Tuesday states, having already spent north of $300 million, and doubling his campaign staff to 2,000. In an ironic twist, it could be that in its desperation to avoid a Sanders nomination, the Democratic National Committee turns to a Wall Street billionaire with no natural constituency who only decided to run for president three months ago because he wasn’t impressed with the field.

New Hampshire Democrats won’t get to weigh in on Bloomberg, not yet anyway. They’ve got enough to consider as it is. To hear them tell it, the fate of the country rests on their decision here Tuesday. They feel like they have to get it right, they have to pick the candidate who can beat Trump. With the hours to primary day ticking down, many of them still don’t know who that might be.

Joe Biden Has Still Only Won A Single County That Flipped To Trump,"Former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential hopes took another hit Tuesday night with a worse than anticipated performance in New Hampshire, even after the campaign worked to downplay expectations.

As of Wednesday morning with 96 percent of precincts reporting, Biden came in a distant fifth place finish with just more than 8 percent of the total vote. Biden performed so poorly in New Hampshire, that the former vice president didn’t even emerge from the primary with a single delegate moving on to Nevada and South Carolina.

For a candidate who has pinned his message on electability with the best chances to win in November, Biden hasn’t been doing much winning. Even worse for the 77-year-old candidate, Biden has been losing in the areas he needs to win the most.

Biden did not come close to even being a top three finisher in any of the three New Hampshire counties that flipped to President Donald Trump in 2016. In Iowa, Biden captured only a single county that did so but only by a mere two points. In Buchanan County located just west of Cedar Rapids, Biden narrowly won the county with 31 percent of the vote while former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg came in with 29 percent.

Biden’s campaign braced for another beating following an abysmal fourth-place finish in Iowa. During Friday’s debate in Manchester, Biden kicked off the primetime event by conceding four days before the contest.

“I took a hit in Iowa, and I’ll probably take a hit here,” Biden said on stage.

As voters went to the polls on Tuesday, Biden fled to South Carolina and skipped an entire day of Granite State campaigning.

Now as the contest moves to Nevada and South Carolina in the run-up to Super Tuesday looming large on Mar. 3, Biden must reassure voters he is the best person for the Democratic Party to pit against Trump this fall without much evidence to the contrary.

Meanwhile, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is making a claim to frontrunner status coming off New Hampshire in a second straight win. While Buttigieg won the delegate count in Iowa by a razor-thin margin, Sanders decidedly won the popular vote by more than 6,000 and has eclipsed Biden as the frontrunner in Real Clear Politics’ latest aggregate of national polls.

In New Hampshire, Sanders narrowly swept all three counties that flipped to Trump as of Wednesday morning, though still only 94 percent of precincts are reporting in state’s southern Hillsborough County with Sanders maintaining a mere one percent lead over Buttigieg. In the state’s western Sullivan County, Sanders leads Buttigieg by two percent with 88 percent of precincts reporting.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/12/after-two-primary-states-joe-biden-only-won-a-single-county-that-flipped-to-trump/,2020-02-12
Joe Biden Says He's A Democratic Candidate For The U.S. Senate,"In his latest slip-up, former Vice President Joe Biden said Monday that he was a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate and told voters to support the other Biden in the race if they didn’t like him.

Biden of course, is running for president, and there is no other Biden in the race.

“My name is Joe Biden. I’m a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over, if you like what you see help out, if not, vote for the other Biden,” the former vice president said at the South Carolina Democratic Party’s First in the South Dinner.

Of course, the only other Biden who has been widely in the news is no candidate for anything, and certainly no candidate for president. Though Biden served as a senator from Delaware for more than 30 years before being sworn in as vice president in 2009.

Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden attracted widespread media scrutiny for his questionable business dealings with overseas nations at the heart of the recent impeachment trial against President Donald Trump. Democrats charged Trump with holding nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine in exchange for our eastern European ally launching investigations into the Biden family’s shady dealings with a Ukrainian energy company with a reputation for its corruption.

While his father dictated U.S. policy towards Ukraine, Hunter Biden served on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma earning more than $50,000 a month despite having no prior experience in the industry. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals that the former vice president’s son was being showered in excess compensation by Ukrainian executives.

Joe Biden’s latest gaffe in South Carolina comes just days before the critical southern primary that will likely decide the fate of Biden’s presidential campaign on Saturday. After losing the first three contests by wide margins, Biden is depending on South Carolina to be his “firewall” to reclaim his frontrunner status that has since been lost to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders who has so far swept the first few contests.

According to Real Clear Politics’ latest aggregate of polls, Biden still holds a first-place lead with nearly 27 percent support in the Palmetto State. Sanders is still behind with almost 22 percent followed by billionaire Tom Steyer who has nearly 15 percent and former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg with nearly 10 percent.

A Biden Win In South Carolina Still Might Not Save Sinking His Campaign,"Former Vice President Joe Biden has hinged the fate of his campaign on a blow-out win in South Carolina Saturday after losing his frontrunner status with three straight losses in the first Democratic primaries.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on the other hand, as emerged as the one to beat, now barreling towards the Democratic presidential nomination after having comfortably clinched the popular vote in Iowa, captured a first place finish in New Hampshire, and securing Nevada by 26 points.

Biden didn’t just lose the first three states, he lost by huge margins. In Iowa, the former vice president came in a distant fourth, and in New Hampshire, Biden did worse placing fifth, leaving the Granite State without a single delegate. In Nevada, Biden only took little more than 20 percent of the vote for second place, while Sanders won the western contest with nearly 47 percent, almost half the entire vote.

The Biden campaign has been in freefall since Iowa, downplaying expectations in the early states while building up its hopes for a revival in South Carolina branding the palmetto state as the candidate’s “firewall.”

On the day of the New Hampshire primary, Biden even flew to South Carolina as people were still casting their votes and addressed his supporters in New England from a livestream. During Tuesday night’s Charleston debate, Biden refused to even consider the possibility of losing first place in the upcoming primary on Saturday.

“I will win South Carolina,” Biden promised.

After all, everything things seem to indicate Biden might be actually pull out his first win of the race.

According to Real Clear Politics’ latest aggregate of South Carolina polls, Biden currently holds a comfortable lead over he rest of the field with more than 30 percent support followed by Sanders coming in next with almost 23 percent. Billionaire businessman Tom Steyer is in third with 15 percent and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is at 9.

On Wednesday, Biden officially secured the most coveted endorsement a Democrat can capture in the southern state from Congressman James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat and highest-ranking African-American in the House of Representatives.

Biden’s support in South Carolina appears almost rock solid having maintained a frontrunner status there since jumping into the crowded contest last spring, hence why the campaign has latched onto the first southern primary as its bail out card. Of the 30 polls conducted in the state since last year, Biden has only ever lost in one completed earlier this month where Biden tied with Sanders for first place.

A win in South Carolina however, might be too little too late. Biden is the only candidate in the race whose candidacy depends so heavily on the southern contest. Other Democratic rivals have divided more time and resources to the Super Tuesday states slated to vote just three days later on March 3. To date, the Biden campaign has not even spent any advertising money in a single Super Tuesday primary or caucus state, remaining laser-focused on pulling out a strong win in South Carolina.

Since losing big in Iowa, the Biden campaign has taken hit after hit by fading into the background at subsequent debates and poor performances in Nevada and New Hampshire.

Biden may have a good week with South Carolina with a strong debate performance Tuesday night coupled with his first win of the cycle, but Biden may have lost too much ground elsewhere that one win could make up for.

His nationwide frontrunner status is certainly gone. According to Real Clear Politics’ latest aggregate of polls, Sanders now leads the field in nationwide surveys with more than 29 percent support, while the rest of the candidates fall behind. Biden, who led in the national polls all last year is now hanging on to second place with 18 percent support. According to the Real Clear aggregate in the Super Tuesday states where there is credible polling, Biden isn’t leading anywhere. His best bet is Texas and North Carolina, where Biden only polls barely a few points behind Sanders though former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg looms large in North Carolina in a close third while flooding the airwaves with ad spending compared to Biden’s absence.

Even if Biden were to eek out a win in South Carolina, another storyline that the campaign might have to combat is by just how much Biden actually won. In order for Biden’s win to be particularly effective at this point given the candidate’s intense focus, Biden needs to land a knock-out victory with a wide margin. Polling suggests it’s likely to happen, but voters are unpredictable.

A failure to capture South Carolina with a blow-out comparable to Sanders’ victory in Nevada could result in less momentum moving into the subsequent stages of the primary and less resources coming in to maintain a competitive campaign. According to the latest filings with the Federal Election Commission, Biden only has about $7 million in his campaign war-chest to compete in a nationwide race.

Biden’s fortunes in a South Carolina win therefore might not be enough to resurrect a flailing campaign short on cash and sinking in the polls. It might keep Biden in the race long enough to pick off delegates for a contested convention in July, but it likely won’t sow enough doubts about Biden’s rivals to sweep the following states for a guaranteed nomination in Milwaukee.

Joe Biden Might Win South Carolina But He’s Losing The Future,"COLUMBIA, South Carolina — On the north side of town there’s a rundown gas station dedicated to President Barack Obama. It’s just like any other gas station except it’s Obama-branded, like if Obama were a gas station-convenience store chain and not a former U.S. president.

The gas price sign next to the highway features a faded Obama campaign logo and a weather-beaten portrait of Obama, circa 2008. His name and logo are emblazoned on every gas pump and over the entryway. Inside, it reeks of cigarette smoke and old food and the cashiers are behind a plexiglass barrier. Were it not for the Obama shirts and Obama-era knick-knacks for sale, you’d think you were in any old ramshackle gas station in South Carolina.

There’s something vaguely dystopian about the place, like it’s from an alternate history of America where gas stations were branded after the president but something went horribly wrong—which, for Obama-era Democrats, it kind of did.

As if all this symbolism weren’t obvious enough, right across the street from the Obama gas station former vice president Joe Biden made a last-minute campaign stop Friday afternoon at a barbershop—an excellently named place called Toliver’s Mane Event—where he met behind closed doors with a few black community leaders and then came outside to the news cameras and railed against Bernie Sanders and the National Rifle Association.

Biden is poised to do very well in the primary today. He’s surging in recent polls and his challengers, including Sanders, are ill-suited to South Carolina, largely because they don’t have much appeal to black voters, who make up the majority of the Democratic electorate here.

The locals who came to meet Biden at Toliver’s were mostly older black people, and the ones I spoke with told me they’re voting for Biden and so is almost everyone they know. Biden will almost certainly win South Carolina, and might even win by a large-enough margin to revive his dying campaign and stagger all the way to April, maybe even to the Democratic convention in July.

But even an overwhelming victory for Biden in South Carolina can’t mask what has become obvious by now: Biden is not the future of the Democratic Party. That in turn means something perhaps less obvious: neither was Obama.

‘Joe Isn’t The Answer, But He’s The Bridge to the Answer’

A Biden ad playing on YouTube states plainly what Biden’s been implying for more than a year now: “Others want to destroy Obama’s legacy. Biden wants to build on it.”

The ad is about Obamacare in particular, but the line about legacy should be understood in a broader sense. Four Februarys ago, Obama and Biden probably thought their legacy was secure, that a Hillary Clinton administration would be more or less a continuation of the Obama era. Biden likely never dreamed he would have to mount a presidential campaign based on resurrecting Obama’s legacy, or that he would face such stiff opposition to that legacy from within his own party.

Yet there he was on Friday, looking old and frail in a blue suit and wind-tossed white hair, being introduced by Michael Toliver, the barbershop owner. “If Joe Biden is good enough for Barack Obama and good enough for House Majority Whip James Clyburn, then he’s good enough to earn our vote,” said Toliver, proclaiming what Biden’s campaign would probably rather leave implied, that Biden is popular among black voters largely because he served under Obama.

Some of those gathered outside the barbershop on Friday said that’s exactly why they trust Biden—that, and Clyburn’s endorsement. Ronald Blackwell, owner of the food truck R.B. Top Chef, which was parked outside Toliver’s, told me it was a “no brainer” for him to support Biden once Clyburn endorsed him. “I trust Clyburn. He’s helped me out in the past, and he comes to my church sometimes,” he said.

Blackwell and Toliver and the others are not the least bit interested in Bernie Sanders’s revolution, even if a growing—and much younger—swath of the Democratic Party clearly is. They’re mystified by it, just as they’re mystified that Trump is president. They want things to go back to the way they were before, and Biden’s call for a return to normalcy, to the Obama era, is a call they’re ready to answer without hesitation.

One comment did stand out, though. Damon Young, 46, owns the barbershop right next to Toliver’s, where he apprenticed for many years before opening his own place. I asked Young why he supports Biden, and he paused before saying, “Joe isn’t the answer, but he’s the bridge to the answer. Especially if he can get some good younger people around him.”

It was a cautious expression of hope. Maybe we can get Joe back in there, maybe he’ll be the bridge back to before all this craziness. Maybe he can hand things off to younger folks who don’t want this socialist revolution.

Maybe. It called to mind what Blackwell, the food truck owner, told me when I asked him about the Obama gas station. He said a few years back it was known for having lucky lottery tickets. The numbers kept hitting there, so people started driving across town to play the lotto at Obama station.

“It was pretty good for a while,” he said, “but then it stopped and some places over by the freeway started hitting, so people went there instead.”

Biden’s Big Night Won’t Be Enough To Solve Democrats’ Sanders Problem,"With a sweep of the south and key victories in Minnesota and Massachusetts, the media narrative today will be all about how Joe Biden is the comeback kid, back from the dead, risen like a Phoenix from the ashes. That sort of thing.

It’s the kind of story the media loves. They love it so much it doesn’t matter whether it’s true, or whether the media was writing Biden off less than a week ago. The surprise comeback, vindicated frontrunner narrative is going to be pushed so hard by the mainstream press and the Democratic establishment in the coming days, you’ll think Biden’s nomination is pretty much a done deal.

What the headlines and the narrative won’t tell you is what any casual survey of the Democratic primary map plainly shows: Super Tuesday didn’t solve the Democratic Party’s Bernie Sanders problem.

Yes, Biden had a good night, but so did Sanders. He won Colorado, Vermont, and Utah, as well as the biggest prize of the night, California, and basically fought Biden to a draw in Texas. He also earned enough votes to pick up delegates in every state Biden won—and he did all this with Sen. Elizabeth Warren siphoning off voters who would otherwise have voted for him, while Biden benefited immensely from the eleventh-hour consolidation of the moderate vote and the endorsements of Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, and Beto O’Rourke.

Indeed, Tuesday was the best possible outcome for Biden. Not only did his moderate rivals drop out of the race and rally to his banner at the last second, the primary calendar played in his favor, with a cluster of more diverse southern states all going on the same day.

For Sanders, all of these factors had the opposite effect, compounded by a distorted media narrative. Absent the expectations that had been set from the first three nominating contests in February in which Sanders overperformed, Tuesday would have been hailed as a great night for the Sanders campaign. His victory in California alone is game-changing, to say nothing of his strong performance in Texas.

As the smoke of Super Tuesday clears, Biden and Sanders are locked in a battle for delegates, and at this point it’s very unlikely either will have a majority going into the Democratic National Convention in July.

What’s more, the list of upcoming primary states is more white, less diverse, and therefore more favorable to Sanders. Next week, Sanders will most likely win Washington and Michigan, which have more than 200 delegates between them. Then on March 17 comes Illinois, Ohio, and Florida, the latter of which boasts 219 delegates.

If Mike Bloomberg stays in the race until then—which he might, if only for pride’s sake, having just spent a half-billion dollars to win American Samoa—that will likely change the outcome in Florida, and not in Biden’s favor. Come March 18, we could well be reading headlines about how everyone underestimated Sanders after Super Tuesday, how in fact he’s been the frontrunner all along, he’s the comeback kid, Phoenix rising from the ashes, and so on. The media are predictable like that.

All of this isn’t to deny that Biden had a big night. He won states he hardly visited, states where he spent almost nothing on TV ads, states where he had almost no ground game or field offices. It was by all accounts an impressive showing, and yes, something of a comeback.

But let’s not kid ourselves that the driving force behind Biden’s Super Tuesday resurgence was the consolidation of the moderate vote just in the nick of time. Who knows whether this eleventh-hour clearing of the field was simply blind luck or the secret machinations of the Democratic Party determined to stop Sanders at any cost, but the effect was to deliver a significant number of delegates to Biden in Minnesota, Massachusetts, Virginia, and elsewhere.

Above all, Super Tuesday has clarified the race, finally, and revealed it for what it has been this entire time: an attempt by progressives to overthrow the establishment and transform the Democratic Party into a European-style democratic socialist party. That effort is not dead, not by a long shot. The Sanders wing of the party on Tuesday showed that it cannot be muscled aside, certainly not by Biden and the also-rans, and certainly not before the convention in July.

Therein lies the danger for the Democrats. Nothing about Tuesday’s results suggests any change in the fundamental problem facing the party. It is divided, almost down the middle, between moderates who will do anything to stop Sanders and leftists who will support no one but Sanders. No amount of narrative-shaping by the media or chest-thumping by Biden will change that.

What I Got Wrong About Mike Bloomberg,"Mike Bloomberg’s risky and wildly expensive run for the White House skidded badly off the rails with Tuesday’s election results. The night started badly for him in Virginia, where he had spent lots of time and upwards of $100 million, then came in at less than 10 percent of the vote.

The night turned a little better for Bloomberg as it wore on. He reached the 15 percent viability mark to obtain delegates in Colorado, Arkansas, and Tennessee, and is hovering right at that mark in delegate-rich California. But failure to reach viability in Texas and North Carolina is big problem for his prospects going forward.

I became bullish about Bloomberg’s run just after the Iowa debates. Nobody other than Bernie Sanders seemed to have much energy and Joe Biden, the big winner on Super Tuesday, seemed like a dead man walking. Biden’s poor showing in Nevada convinced me that Bloomberg had a good chance to wind up as the non-socialist one-on-one with Sanders. That will almost certainly now be Biden.

So what happened? The most important development was really just Biden getting his legs back under him. In the South Carolina debate he looked solid, and the polls quickly began to shift in his direction. It didn’t help Bloomberg that he was awful in the debates and his votes sank as Biden’s rose.

Bloomberg’s rise in the February polls was fairly remarkable, and things looked pretty good. It was obvious he was siphoning votes from Biden at a pretty decent clip, which had always been the plan. But at the end of the day, good old-fashioned politics beat out novelty and hundreds of millions of dollars, which is probably a good thing.

After South Carolina there was also a relatively unexpected coalescence of Democratic establishment support behind Biden. Most importantly, that was represented by Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dropping out and endorsing Biden. If Biden’s weakness was plank one of the Bloomberg strategy, plank two was a big, fractured field offering no clear winner. When those two planks collapsed, so did the raison d’etre of his candidacy.

But that isn’t to say Bloomberg didn’t have a big effect on the race. His impressive polling in February took steam away from Buttigieg and Klobuchar’s impressive performances in Iowa and New Hampshire. Instead of either receiving big bumps in the wake of those early contests, they stayed in a muddle with Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Bloomberg can still have an impact. Should he drop out, he is almost certain to throw his support and considerable resources behind Biden, who will need to continue winning convincingly against Sanders to avoid a contested Democratic National Convention. Bloomberg’s Super Tuesday stumble makes that path a lot easier.

In the end the pundits were right — most of then not named Dave Marcus, anyway — about Bloomberg’s crazy, mixed-up run for president. But in fairness, he does seem likely to come away with the third-most delegates and a third- or fourth-place finish in the popular vote when all is said and done. That’s not a small feat for a race that once boasted about 387 candidates.

Ultimately it looks like Bloomberg’s challenge woke Biden up. Now Biden’s job, whether he enters the convention with the delegates required to win or not, will be to soothe the Bernie Sanders voters who always seem to have something or other to cry foul about.

That won’t be easier, but Biden may well have an easier time seducing them than Hillary Clinton did. Thus far, at least, both Biden and Bernie have stayed in their lanes, and kind of passed each other in the night. That has to change now, and the gloves will come off, but Biden will have to be careful in how he approaches his criticism.

That disposition of Sanders voters will be the most important thing for Democrats if they want a Biden victory over President Trump in November. That wrangling between the former vice president and the current senator is now the dynamic to watch.

Hunter Biden Leveraged Family Name For UCLA Professorship,"Former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, touted his family name and political connections to pursue a major gig as a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles, according to emails reviewed by the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Hunter Biden was pursuing a job at the university to teach a course on drug policy and identified a list of possible guest speakers with close ties to his leading 2020 presidential candidate father.

“In 2019, Hunter Biden inquired about the possibility of teaching a course as UCLA School of Law, and he and school leaders held preliminary conversations about the possibility,” said the law school’s communications executive director Bill Kisliuk in an email to the Caller.

In the end however, Biden will not be teaching at the university after failing to provide the school with additional plans for the prospective class.

“Biden subsequently did not submit further materials for the proposed course, which is a required step when the school is considering adding a course,” Kisliuk told the Caller.

In October, Joe Biden made it sound like it was a done deal telling reporters his son was “gonna be teaching at law school next year.”

Hunter Biden moved to Los Angeles in 2018 but his whereabouts have remained a mystery.

Hunter Biden’s leveraging of his father’s political connections appear to be routine practice. While his father was the Obama administration’s point-man on Ukraine in 2014, Hunter Biden was hired to serve on the board of a Ukrainian energy company making at least $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry.

A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals just how much the former vice president’s son was being showered in excess compensation. Hunter Biden was paid at least twice the amount of board members at comparable corporations. At Exxon Mobil, a global energy company dwarfing Burisma in size and earnings, its board members only made little more than half of Hunter Biden’s reported payout.

Hunter Biden also served on the board of a trade coalition that sought additional aid to Ukraine from the United States while his father remained the key figure in the White House dictating policy towards the eastern European nation, according to Daily Caller reporting last month.

From 2012 to 2018, Hunter Biden was on the board of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC) which lobbied the U.S. government for increased Ukrainian spending and assistance.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/05/hunter-biden-leveraged-family-name-for-ucla-professorship/,2020-03-05
Media Suddenly Interested In Running Interference For Hunter Biden Again,"After weeks of ignoring the series of scandals surrounding former Vice President Joe Biden’s son that surfaced during President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, reporters are suddenly interested again as Biden reclaims his frontrunner status for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The focus on Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, which never received adequate media attention in the first place, tapered off throughout the president’s impeachment trial and became nearly absent by the time Senate proceedings got underway. In the same week Trump was acquitted, Joe Biden’s presidential hopes began to plummet following a poor performance in the Iowa caucuses. Biden’s chances of becoming the nominee only got worse throughout February with each state until the South Carolina primary on Saturday rescuing a sinking campaign.

Now that Biden is back on top in the wake of an extraordinary political comeback capturing 10 states on Super Tuesday, including several he never even campaigned in, many in the media are suddenly reminded that his son will likely remain an issue going forward.

While his father was dictating U.S. policy towards Ukraine at the Obama White House in 2014, Hunter Biden was hired on the board of a Ukraine energy company Burisma earning upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals just how much Biden was being showered in excess compensation where board members of comparable corporations made only fraction of Biden’s benefits.

Several questionable transactions with Chinese business leaders have also raised suspicions about Hunter Biden’s work overseas.

In 2013, Hunter Biden boarded Air Force Two with his vice president father on a trip to China and arranged meetings with Chinese businessmen. Soon after, a sequence of events followed to benefit Hunter Biden’s firm, BHR leading to its business license being approved in the east Asian nation and a joint acquisition of the Michigan motor company Henniges with a Chinese corporation marking “the biggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

Hunter Biden’s work abroad has drawn scrutiny from senators since 2017 when Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin opened up a probe into Biden’s conflicts of interest.

Some in the media however, appear to have forgotten about investigations into Hunter Biden’s conduct altogether, tying it exclusively to Republican efforts to defend Trump from impeachment or to a political effort launched by the GOP to derail Joe Biden’s campaign. Some have even characterized the ongoing Senate probe into Hunter Biden’s conflicts leveraging familial ties overseas as resurgent, making it seem as if the proceedings that began prior to Joe Biden’s entrance into the presidential race ever stopped after Biden’s apparent collapse.

“Senate GOP ramps up investigations as Biden surges,” read a headline in CNN on Wednesday, co-authored by network congressional correspondent Manu Raju. The headline was later replicated in a chyron displayed on the channel Thursday afternoon.

“Republicans Dive Back Into Hunter Biden Investigations, Saying Voters Deserve It,” fired off the Daily Beast.

“Mitt Romney tells reporters there’s ‘no question’ that the GOP’s resurrected investigation ‘looking into Burisma and Hunter Biden appears political, and I think people are tired of these kind of political investigation,” tweeted NBC reporter Geoff Bennett, emphasis ours.

Nothing has been “resurrected” however, of a continuous investigation that started well before Joe Biden’s run for president that never stopped after Trump’s exoneration or Biden’s February losses.

Of course, Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney also voted to convict Trump in what was purely a political stunt, so he can save the lecturing.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/06/media-suddenly-interested-in-running-interference-for-hunter-biden-again/,2020-03-06
"After Calling Joe Biden An Old Racist, Kamala Harris And Cory Booker Endorse Him For President","On Sunday, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“Joe Biden has served our country with dignity and we need him now more than ever. I will do everything in my power to help elect him the next President of the United States,” Harris tweeted.

In a video, Harris said she would be commemorating Bloody Sunday by walking across the Edmond Pettus Bridge in Alabama with Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., then pivoted to her endorsement of Biden.

“I believe in Joe. I really believe in him and I have known him for a long time. One of the things that we need right now is we need a leader who really does care about the people and who can therefore unify the people. And I believe Joe can do that,” Harris said.

On the very first Democratic debate stage, Harris insinuated Biden was a racist for opposing forced busing. A policy that is, and always has been, wildly unpopular.

“Vice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist,” Harris said. “I also believe — and it’s personal and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. It was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.”

Biden countered saying while Harris was working as a prosecutor, he was working as a public defender who fought for civil rights.

Harris is endorsing a man she saw as upholding racist politicians and policies just eight months ago. She is joined by Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who said Biden will reignite America’s spirit.

“The answer to hatred and division is to reignite our spirit of common purpose. Joe Biden won’t only win, he’ll show there’s more that unites us than divides us. He’ll restore honor to the Oval Office and tackle our most pressing challenges. That’s why I’m proud to endorse Joe,” Booker tweeted.

In the aftermath of the September debate, Booker told CNN he saw Biden’s age as a concern.

“There’s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,” Booker said.

"Joe Biden’s Campaign May Be Reinvigorated, But He Isn’t","An oft-repeated adage claims the left falls in love — with ideas and personalities, probably — and the right falls in line. In short, it’s often asserted that the right is more disciplined, hierarchical, and mechanical than the left.

Is it, though? After Super Tuesday, many such assumptions are under renewed scrutiny. For example, after Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg torched their millions, only a lunatic would claim money can buy everything in politics. Yes, that includes a few thousand dollars of Facebook ads, allegedly by someone sitting in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Likewise, the coalescing of the Democratic field behind Joe Biden just ahead of Super Tuesday, with the message discipline and precision of a Soviet Central Committee, is a testament to the fact that not those on the right but those on the left are mechanical in support of their candidates.

Compare it with the 2016 cycle, and you’d see there was simply no such elite establishment machinations on the right during elections. The right, for good or for bad, is comparatively freer and more welcoming to anti-establishment ideas and personalities. The left leaders, on the other hand, will form a Roman phalanx behind a lamppost if that lamppost is their candidate.

Consider the fact that there is still a formal Never Trump crew. There will unlikely ever be a formal Never Bernie or Never Biden. Collectivization is, after all, a left-wing ethos.

Is Joe Biden a Viable Candidate?

Biden’s win is portrayed as a return to normalcy. Call me a cynic, but I have my doubts.

First, Biden wasn’t under the harsh spotlight in the last month and a half. After the first debate, he was considered a lost cause and not taken seriously. On the debate stage, everyone avoided arguing with him, as you refuse to argue with your grandparent suffering from the first stages of Alzheimer’s. Things changed after South Carolina, with Biden practically coronated overnight. Unfortunately, now the eye of Sauron will be back on him.

His foreign policy misadventures, his gaffes, and his personal indiscretions will all come to the forefront again. Of all the septuagenarians running in the race — Biden, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, and formerly Bloomberg — Biden’s cognitive ability seems to be in the most visible decline. The man has trouble completing a whole paragraph, looks and sounds agitated when questioned, and is visibly exhausted compared to Sanders and Trump.

And the actual presidential campaign heat has not even started yet. Other than questions of severe cognitive decline, Biden’s son’s background and dealings will be under renewed scrutiny. Of course, the majority of the media will fall in line, and at least tacitly take sides, but that will not stop the oppo dumps. How Biden performs under pressure, with millions of dollars of ads dumped on his head, is yet to be seen.

That leaves out the people who are genuinely feeling depressed at this skullduggery, with the Democratic National Committee backing Biden covertly. Ben Sixsmith, a conservative columnist writing for The Spectator, said of the Sanders supporters:

I sympathize with them. They have been told for years that a party establishment which voted for the Iraq war and lost to Donald Trump is the only alternative to the Republicans, and now the abrupt ending of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar’s campaigns and immediate endorsement of Biden have shown that this establishment will move Heaven and Earth not to give them a chance. To some extent one can understand their pure hatred.

Three Types of Voters

Jason Brennan wrote in a phenomenal and controversial book that there are three types of voters. The first group are the Hobbits, who don’t understand or care and vote mostly based on instincts and emotions. The second group are the Hooligans, who have more knowledge of the process and tend to be extremely partisan. The third are the Vulcans, who are mostly the intelligent swing voters who can detach from the personality and rhetoric, and vote solely based on policies. They are the thinking ones who don’t care about charismatic candidates or establishment-pushed political lines.

A common sentiment evident on Twitter among hardcore Democrats is that many are what Brennan would name Hooligans, with the dejected acceptance of “vote blue, no matter who.” You can’t reason with them, as they have already decided for whom they will vote. But they are not everyone.

A huge chunk of voters are undecided, from the relatively socially conservative African Americans who rejected Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, to the foreign policy restrainers worried about going back to a Hillary Clinton-Biden foreign policy from a few years back. Biden has now gotten the endorsement of Susan Rice, Samantha Power, John Brennan, James Comey, and the Never Trumpers. Whether that will be a blessing or a curse remains to be seen.

The Breakdown of the Democratic Party

The reality remains that Biden is anachronistic in a party with two distinct factions that are neither liberal nor moderate. On one hand, the transgender-pandering, intersectional, feminist Warren stans are heartbroken that nobody liked their beloved KWEEN. The managerial class and high-achieving high-schoolers who most favored Warren realized painfully that woke, annoying, and condescending nerds are still woke, annoying, condescending nerds. Thus, she plummeted and dropped out. Where her faction will go is yet to be determined, and she has not yet made an endorsement.

On the other hand are the Trotskyist Berners, who are still being sold a lie that one grandad can reverse climate change, put bankers in jail, and make everything free including their stupid choices in higher education that have led to their meaningless, debt-ridden lives. Those two factions are out of place and out of sync but full of wrath for their establishment.

Yes, the liberals have an establishment. Much more than conservatives, given the left’s hold over academia and media and other institutions. And betrayed masses despise the priests in the temples when they see their gods bleeding.

To complicate matters, both these groups are filled with the educated, white, hyper-liberal middle class, made up of people who fail to comprehend that a significant majority of minority voters refuse to pander to woke transgender politics or turn full Trotskyist. It is the conservative-leaning minorities who voted for Biden compared to Sanders or Warren.

If they can vote for Biden, they can vote for Trump. Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party in the U.K. learned this lesson the hard way. It appears the lesson is being retaught to Sanders and grieving Warren groupies now. The game isn’t over. In fact, it is not even halftime yet.

Super Tuesday 2.0 Could Be The End For Bernie Sanders,"Former Vice President Joe Biden scored a new round of endorsements in the last 48 hours leading up to Super Tuesday 2.0, wherein 352 delegates are up for grabs in another one of the biggest days of the primary after last week’s nationwide contests.

Former 2020 rivals and Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California each threw their support behind Biden as the former vice president reclaimed his front-runner status last week, capturing first-place wins in 10 states carrying a majority of Super Tuesday delegates. Biden even won states in which he never campaigned, including Massachusetts, where the state’s own Sen. Elizabeth Warren placed third, forcing her out of the race and narrowing the field to a two-way match-up.

On Tuesday, Biden swept the south and added Minnesota and Maine to his column, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won his own state and placed first in California, Colorado, and Utah.

This week, Biden is poised to land a knockout blow to his last-standing serious competitor as six states — Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, and Washington — cast their ballots for the Democratic nominee. According to the latest polls, Biden is leading decidedly in each with a narrower race in Washington. In nationwide surveys, it’s not even close. For the first time this cycle, Biden leads with more than 50 percent support in RealClearPolitics’ aggregate of polls while Sanders is polling with little more than 35.

Biden’s recent endorsements in the hours running up to the next big primary day echo last week’s successful strategy of rolling out the endorsements as voters prepare to head for the polls, flexing Biden’s strength as the front-runner and showcasing his ability to bring the party back together after a turbulent primary. The survival of Sanders’ campaign hinges on whether he can see a path forward to land 1,991 of the 3,979 delegates in the race, but as the party unites behind Biden, who continues to capture states, Sanders’ 2020 mountain becomes steeper to climb.

Biden is now in the lead with 628 delegates to Sanders’ 545. A sweep of this week’s states, however, would widen the gap for Biden.

On Tuesday, all eyes will be on Michigan, the largest prize of this week’s primaries with 125 delegates up for grabs. Sanders narrowly defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Midwestern state in 2016, 49.8 percent to 48.3 percent. But now, Sanders trails Biden by more than 20 percent, according to RealClearPolitics’ latest aggregate of Michigan surveys. While it’s important to note that Sanders was behind Clinton in Michigan polls in the run-up to the 2016 primary, Clinton’s lead was not so decisive, and by no means did she have the same momentum as Biden has picked up in the last 10 days.

Biden will not land all 352 delegates in this week’s contests, and even if he did, it still wouldn’t land him the 1,991 required to fend off a contested convention in Milwaukee. Another round of blowout Biden wins, however, particularly in Michigan, where Sanders pulled off an upset four years ago and which flipped to Trump in the general, would cast further doubts about Sanders’ ability to clinch the nomination and propel Biden to the top of the ticket as the former vice president continues to surge.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/09/super-tuesday-2-0-could-be-the-end-for-bernie-sanders/,2020-03-09
"Trump Campaign Blasts Twitter, Demands Same Standards For Biden","The Trump campaign is demanding Twitter to apply its new standards for “manipulated media” to the Biden campaign after one of its videos was tagged as misleading while Team Biden freely shares false content.

In a letter to Twitter’s leadership on Monday, Trump campaign Chief Operation Officer Michael Glassner condemned the company for tagging one of its videos showing former Vice President Joe Biden saying, “We cannot win this re-election. Excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump,” as misinformation while the Biden campaign continues to publish similarly doctored content uncensored.

“Understandably, the Biden campaign has a strategic interest in intimidating social media companies into suppressing true and embarrassing video evidence of Joe Biden’s continued inability to communicate coherently – a sad truth that has been publicly noted by Democrats and media figures alike,” Glassner wrote.

The Trump campaign executive continued to accuse the company of employing a “Biden protection rule” to protect the former vice president.

“Still, it appears that many people employed by Big Tech corporations in Silicon Valley are assisting the Biden campaign by instituting a special ‘Biden protection rule’ that effectively censors and silences legitimate political speech Biden’s campaign and its supporters do not like,” said Glassner.

The Trump campaign pointed to a video published by the Biden campaign earlier this month as an example of a video that clearly violates Twitter’s new rules on edited content. In the video, Trump is shown characterizing the WuFlu (coronavirus) as a “hoax.”

We can't sit by and lose this country to Donald Trump. Today, we take it back — together. Go vote: https://t.co/Hy8C4n0lUk pic.twitter.com/0YgyJFr9YR — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) March 3, 2020

Glassner explains that the video prominently features two clips of Trump “spliced together to fabricate a quote and give viewers the false impression that he called the coronavirus a ‘hoax.’” But Trump said no such thing, and the claim has been debunked by left-leaning fact-checkers, prompting even Facebook to tag such characterizations of Trump’s remarks as fake news.

Glassner also criticized the Biden campaign’s usage of Trump’s remarks on the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. where Democrats and media elites have twisted Trump’s comments to call neo-Nazi’s “very fine people,” which is also false. Trump instead called those on both sides of the issue surrounding the removal of historic Confederate statues as “very fine people,” not white supremacists.

Lastly, the Trump campaign pointed out that the Biden team took Trump’s words out of context when declaring “the American dream is dead.” The second part of the sentence reads, “but if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.”

Twitter’s new policy, formally called the “Synthetic and Manipulated Media Policy,” says users “may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm.” The new rule went into effect on March 5 after former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg shared a video masking his opponents’ voices on the debate stage as crickets when asked if any had started a business.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/10/trump-campaign-blasts-twitter-demands-same-standards-for-biden/,2020-03-10
"Why Republicans, Independents Must Help Biden Defeat Sanders","Americans should unite behind President Donald Trump and help the GOP take back the House of Representatives this fall. Until then, every available voter should do his or her part to ensure Joe Biden is the Democratic Party nominee. Allowing even a chance of Sen. Bernie Sanders becoming president is too dangerous to risk.

Some Republicans figure Sanders would be an easier opponent in a general election against Trump and root for his nomination. They may be right. Yet history is filled with cautionary tales of underestimated candidates humbling their faux champions from across the aisle.

In 1980, Democrats laughed off Ronald Reagan as a lightweight B-list actor, then lost in a 40-state landslide. George H.W. Bush was thought to be unbeatable in the aftermath of the Gulf War, but lost to 46-year-old Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. And of course, in 2016, nearly everyone misjudged the appeal of a former real estate mogul and reality TV star named Donald J. Trump.

Putting Sanders in a position where he has even a chance of becoming president is too dire a prospect to play fast and loose. An unforeseen “black swan” event, like an economic collapse or a global pandemic, can turn a once-predictable race upside-down. Those who can still vote must prudently safeguard against any opportunity for Sanders to become president.

The 2020 Race Is Trump’s to Lose, but Expect a Hard Fight

It’s understandable that Republicans are confident Trump’s re-election this November will be a slam dunk. There are many reasons to be optimistic. The economy remains fundamentally strong. America isn’t fighting any major wars. National confidence is at a high not seen in years.

Unlike in 2016, this time Trump is running as an incumbent president with all the benefits. Trump will give his stump speeches in front of the official Seal of the President of the United States and land in swing states via Air Force One. In the last 100 years, only three incumbent presidents have lost their re-election bids. These are all positive signs. But it’s not a done deal.

Hillary Clinton was a historically unlikable candidate, but a flip of 45,000 votes in Pennsylvania, 23,000 votes in Wisconsin, and 11,000 votes in Michigan would have landed her the White House. Both Biden and Sanders have much more appeal to working-class voters living in Middle America, a segment of the population critical this November. Clinton’s campaign ignored her husband’s advice to take Trump’s support in the Rust Belt seriously. Neither Biden nor Sanders will repeat that mistake.

Democrats Voting for Biden Should Be Applauded

Now that the dust has settled after Super Tuesday, it’s clear Biden leads Sanders in the race for the Democratic nomination. Sanders’s online supporters like to claim shadowy, nebulous, all-powerful forces are thwarting the will of the people and “rigging” the election against their dear leader.

What is actually happening is real flesh-and-blood voters have chosen to repudiate Sanders and his extreme views. In the overall popular vote total, Biden leads Sanders by 50,000 votes, beating him fair and square.

Democratic primary voters have at least enough wherewithal to recognize Sanders is a threat to everything America stands for. Enough Democrats have shown the foresight and guts to stare down the Sanders anger-machine and use their ballots to proclaim: “No. We’re not going to let one of America’s major political parties be hijacked by a socialist. Not today.”

Before returning to their separate corners in the general election, instead of trying to prolong the race and give Sanders a chance to recover, Republicans and independents should help Biden supporters finish the job.

Introducing the ‘Biden Rule’

William F. Buckley Jr. advocated supporting “the rightwardmost viable candidate” for a given office. As long as Democratic Party presidential candidates include self-avowed socialists, Republican and independent voters should modify the Buckley Rule for the Biden Rule. For every open primary contest: “Vote for the most viable Democrat who will oppose socialism.”

Republicans and independents can seize the opportunity to help non-socialist Democrats put the final nail in the coffin of Sanders’s campaign. On Tuesday, March 10, they can vote for Biden in the open contests in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, and Washington, where 352 combined pledged delegates are up for grabs. Open primaries in Illinois on March 17 and Georgia on March 24 offer up another 260 total delegates.

The most recent projection from the stats gurus at FiveThirtyEight estimates Biden will end the Democratic presidential race a few hundred delegates over the 1,991 required to win the nomination — no superdelegates required. An even stronger showing by Biden in the states listed above can put the delegate count further out of the reach.

As tempting as it is for Republicans to “create chaos” in the Democratic primary, the real chaos scenario would be Sanders sitting behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office.

It’s About Protecting Our Fundamental Values

Against any reasonable, historical precedent, Biden is no “moderate” Democrat. He’s miles away from Harry Truman. He’s a far cry from the welfare-cutting, Third Way, New Democrat Bill Clinton was when he proclaimed, “The era of big government is over” (if wishing made it so…).

But at least Biden still believes in rewarding work. Biden still thinks America is a fundamentally good nation. If Trump loses, Biden would cause the least amount of damage to America’s bedrock institutions and values. Sanders would shake them to their core.

The choice of Biden versus Sanders is the difference between the U.K. Labour Party’s Tony Blair and Jeremy Corbyn. Men like Blair and Biden can be reasoned with. Revolutionaries like Corbyn and Sanders must be defeated at the ballot box at every opportunity.

In the realm of foreign policy, Biden’s beliefs are far and away preferable to Sanders’s penchant for blaming America for the ills of the world. Sanders proposes more than $1.2 trillion in drastic cuts to the U.S. military. This would hamper America’s ability to secure the frontiers of our sphere of influence. It would make the world a more dangerous place.

Imagine a President Sanders cozying up to far-left regimes across the globe, deploring America as inherently shameful, and slandering our founding documents from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Imagine the Democratic Party cowed into propping up the bankrupt morality of Sanders’s socialism and paying homage to leftist dictators such as Nicolas Maduro or Raul Castro. As The Federalist’s Emily Jashinsky and Madeline Osburn have shown, “radical” doesn’t begin to convey the nature of Sanders’s ideas.

When in Doubt: Do the Least Bad Thing

Republicans have a decent chance to hold the Senate in November and maintain their advantage in that chamber for the near future. Even if Trump hands the keys to the Oval Office to Biden in January 2021, Republicans can expect to reap the added boost that the party out of the White House typically receives. Since 1962, the sitting president’s party has lost an average of 23 House seats and three Senate seats in midterm elections.

Since 1968, Americans have shown they prefer a divided government — wherein one party holds the White House while the other party keeps them in check via Congress. Radical bills can be voted down. Leftist judges can be rejected. Just as the Newt Gingrich-controlled Congress forced President Clinton to triangulate to the center or even the right on many issues, Biden would be much easier to deal with than Sanders.

In a scenario where Trump loses, the GOP can work with Biden and mitigate the damage. Sanders, on the other hand, will be more likely to wield executive orders and the president’s reserved plenary foreign policy powers in ways detrimental to American interests and her allies.

If it must, America can batten down the hatches and weather through a Biden administration. A Sanders presidency, however, would pose a genuine threat to liberty. How long would the Free World remain free if a socialist were to occupy the White House? Americans who love their country can’t afford to find out.

A Pugnacious Joe Biden Pushes Through,"When I was a kid in Philly, the mayor was Frank Rizzo. Those who are not of my advanced age may not remember Rizzo, who was in equal parts loved and despised. He was tough as nails on crime, a former police commissioner, and a political boss famous for wearing a tux with a billy club tucked in the waistband. But he was also the best retail politician I ever saw.

At the annual Fourth of July celebration at the Rec Center or some such thing, Rizzo would make face with everyone, and somehow he knew them all. “Hey, Nancy, how’s the new job at the nursing home?” “Joe, you still trying to sell that car?” The man’s brain was a Rolodex of the citizenry of Philadelphia. Sometimes he’d get criticized, and then he could throw words with the best of them.

Joe Biden is a politician very much in this pugnacious Northeast mold. Over the last two weeks, arguably the best of his long political career, Fighting Joe has been on full display. On Tuesday in Michigan, just hours before his big win there, he had a telling interaction with a voter who accused him, fairly accurately, of promising to grab Americans’ guns.

Biden said the man was “full of sh-t,” stuck his finger in the guy’s face, seemed to threaten to take it outside, shushed his female aide who tried to stop the exchange, and in general just kind of acted like a bully. It’s not the first time Biden has insulted a voter one on one. He’s called them out and joked about understanding why a guy’s wife left him, and there will be more.

There is a flip side to this Chris Christie-esque desire to fight voters. In a different, less viral video, we can see Biden giving his American flag pin to a young child as his mother beams and explains who Biden is and how special the moment is. Whatever one thinks about Biden or his politics, this is a very real moment, just as real as his blowups.

It’s hard to say just how well Biden’s style will play outside of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. Biden is now racking up big wins against Bernie Sanders across the country, but his rise was fueled not just by his improvement as a candidate in recent weeks, but also by a national Democratic Party machine galvanizing behind him out of fear of socialist Sanders.

Now that we seem to have arrived at a Donald Trump versus Joe Biden general election, there are also questions about whether Biden has the stamina to keep up. There have been times when he almost seems in hiding, as if the campaign is doling out his energies carefully.

In a race against Trump, Biden will need to be dynamic, and that is not something he’s very good at. One on one retail politics can only take one so far in a national general election. And Trump will be ready and willing to poke at the inevitable gaffes that come when Biden chats with the everyman.

But Trump has some reason to worry. Biden’s huge win Michigan came in a state where Sanders squeaked out a victory in 2016. This might well show that, as many people believed then, the problem for Democrats’ presidential hopes in that year was that Hillary Clinton was a very weak candidate, as she was against Trump.

An early dispatching of Sanders by Biden, which for all intents and purposes could come as early as next week, would also make it easier for Democrats to bring Sanders supporters on board. Four years ago, the Sandernistas were still licking their wounds as they protested the Democratic National Convention. This year, they will have more time to get used to the idea of Biden.

He fights! That was the sometimes-serious, sometimes-mocking mantra about the Trump primary campaign in 2016. In that case, it meant that he fights for voters, not with voters, but in some sense the spirit is the same. Biden is not going to change. It’s a bit late for that, and after all he’s winning with a little help from his friends.

Insulting and threatening voters is a strange way to pursue the presidency, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t work.

"Joe Biden Is Ignorant And Dishonest About Guns, Just Like The Media","Set aside Joe Biden’s weirdly aggressive response to the Detroit auto plant worker who challenged him on gun control policy at a campaign stop yesterday—Biden tells the guy, “you’re full of sh-t,” calls him a “horse’s ass,” and later threatens to slap him in the face—and consider instead how the blue-check media exulted in it.

Instead of noting how Biden distorted his record, or that he was factually wrong on almost every particular about guns, pundits and reporters focused on the optics, on how great it was that Biden stood up to a random voter who dared to question him.

Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Epstein spun the exchange as Biden pushing back, and speculated that Biden supporters are “into it.” Jonathan Martin of The New York Times euphemized the exchange as an “earthy Biden encounter” that probably won’t hurt him with voters, which it probably won’t, at least not with Democratic primary voters.

But take a look at this exchange and then tell me the big takeaway here is what a good job Biden did dealing with a tough question about gun control.

This is insane. Beyond telling the guy he’s “full of shit” Biden gets in his face and then says something about “take this outside.” Mainstream media can’t run cover for this much longer. Anyone know who the man is? Would love to have him on the show. https://t.co/MwnUiEeGUJ — Dave Rubin (@RubinReport) March 10, 2020

Somehow, the media thought Biden did great. No one exemplified this fawning reaction better than The Atlantic’s David Frum, who thought it was “amazing that anybody thinks this video makes Biden look anything other than terrific. He shushes the aide who wants to lead him away—and then engages a hostile critic face to face, fact to fact. Impressive.”

One wonders what “facts” Frum thought he heard from Biden, who told the Detroit man the government “would take your AR-14s” (no such gun exists), and that AR-15s are “machine guns” (nope) that are “illegal” (they aren’t). After this string of false statements, Biden then blurts out, without context, “Do you need 100 rounds? Do you need 100 rounds?!”

By contrast, the auto plant worker’s remark that triggered the exchange was a straightforward statement of fact: “You are actively trying to diminish our Second Amendment rights and take away our guns.” Any plain reading of Biden’s proposed gun control policies—like banning AR-15s, the most popular gun in America—is consistent with that statement.

What’s more, the man accurately references comments Biden made at rally on March 2 while accepting the endorsement of Beto O’Rourke. Biden said, “I’m going to guarantee this is not the last you’ve seen of this guy,” referring to O’Rourke. “You’re going to take care of the gun problem with me. You’re going to be the one who leads this effort.”

How else can one interpret that except as an endorsement of gun confiscation? After all, it was O’Rourke who in a September debate boasted, “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.”

This is just a rundown of the “facts” in this brief encounter. There’s also the question of Biden’s horrible demeanor, first toward his aide—the young woman he angrily shushes like a child—and then his immediate Grampa Simpson-like irritability toward the auto plant worker.

So far from being “impressive” or making Biden look “terrific,” the incident both plays to fears about Biden’s mental sharpness and calls into question the sincerity of his lofty rhetoric about a return to decency and normalcy. If anything, Biden’s performance here was positively Trumpian, and not in a good way.

Biden’s Running a Big Risk Here

Again, this incident might not hurt him with Democratic primary voters, but Biden’s combination of belligerence and ignorance in this case is just the sort of thing that could be effectively used against him in the general election. Not only is gun confiscation deeply unpopular (just ask Barack Obama), but Biden’s response to pointed questions about his proposed gun policy was completely disingenuous and unconvincing.

Biden can wag his finger all he wants and insist he supports the Second Amendment, but no one will believe it if he then turns around and tells cheering crowds of Democrats that he’s going to put O’Rourke in charge of his AR-15 confiscation effort.

Maybe he’s just playing to his base, hoping hardcore Democrats don’t believe his empty rhetoric about supporting the Second Amendment. Maybe he’s counting on the media to indulge their narrow biases and laud him for standing up to a random gun nut, no matter how much he gets wrong or how cantankerously he comes off.

Problem is, ordinary Americans can watch the video and come to their own conclusions. Joe Biden supports the Second Amendment? What a bunch of malarkey.

Joe Biden Should Stop Threatening Voters Who Could Beat Him Up,"Former Vice President Joe Biden has long fantasized about beating up Donald Trump, but during the 2020 Democratic primary, he began challenging voters who challenged him. He called an Iowa farmer a “damn liar,” for example, then challenged him to an IQ test and a push-up contest.

At a campaign event at a factory in Michigan on Tuesday, a voter asked Biden a tough but fair question about how he hoped to get the votes of gun enthusiasts who are union members. What followed must be seen to be believed.

Biden tells the voter he’s full of “sh-t,” wags his finger in his face, and when the voter complains, he suggests that they go outside.

Many people have focused on the erroneous comments Biden frequently makes about guns. He falsely claims he has no desire to limit AR-15s (which he calls AR-14s) but he previously told Anderson Cooper he did.

‘To gun owners out there who say, well, a Biden Administration means they’re going to come for my guns,’ Cooper asks. ‘Bingo, you’re right if you have an ‘assault weapon,” which is his term for AR-15s.

Leaving aside the more significant problem of Biden’s position on the 2nd Amendment, Joe Biden’s candidacy is based around a media-enabled narrative that he is a decent man who will bring civility and normalcy back to Washington. He promises to bring unity to the country.

Such threatening behavior suggests he might not be the candidate to do that.

I’m not opposed to more physical fighting in politics, although I wish it were the bad politicians getting roughed up more than the voters. But I can’t get past the issue that Biden keeps picking on people who would most definitely destroy him in an actual fight.

If you watch that voter video above again, you see that the gun enthusiast guy is a strapping man with a very nice beard. He handles himself extremely well. He asks a legitimate question about gun rights and reacts calmly even when he gets told he’s “full of sh-t.” Biden gets more and more belligerent, downplaying that he just a week ago named Beto O’Rourke his gun czar. Here’s a video of O’Rourke saying, “H-ll, yes we are going to take your AR-15.”

The young bearded voter very calmly tells Biden that his physical intimidation is inappropriate, at which point Biden challenges to take him outside.

Never Trumpists such as David Frum and Ana Navarro praised Biden’s threat. “Kind of amazing that anybody thinks this video makes Biden look anything other than terrific,” Frum said. “I love it. This is exactly the Fighting Joe I want to see show-up and tell Trump he’s full of it,” Navarro said of Biden’s attack on a voter who is not Donald Trump.

But no one quite noticed that Biden for whatever reason keeps picking on people who could quite clearly obliterate him in a fight. It’s not even a testament to the voters he’s picking on, although in this case the voter appeared quite capable of a beat-down.

It’s that Joe Biden is 77 years old. He was never particularly known as a physically intimidating or capable person and he’s definitely not one now. He would be seriously injured in these fights he keeps seeking! We are quite clearly in an Izzy Mandelbaum situation.

If we’re going to bring back duels or whatever he’s going for here, he should probably challenge only other politicians, not voters, and he should start thinking much more strategically about who he could reasonably take on. At his age and with his physical situation, I’d stick to octogenarians with underlying health problems.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/11/joe-biden-should-probably-stop-threatening-voters-who-could-beat-him-up/,2020-03-11
Tom Cotton Launches New Ad Attacking Joe Biden On China In Ohio,"Arkansas Republican Rep. Tom Cotton’s Political Action Committee (PAC), the Republican Majority Fund, is airing a new attack ad about Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden in Ohio five days before the state’s primary on Tuesday.

The ad goes after the former vice president for being “weak on China,” where his scandal-ridden son, Hunter Biden, has conducted questionable business while Joe Biden voted to give the east Asian giant special trade status as a Delaware senator.

The ad begins by condemning China’s record on human rights and aggressive history of cyberwarfare.

“They run concentration camps. They forced the abortions of millions of babies. They brutally crack down on protesters. They hack America’s networks. They have stolen millions of our jobs,” a narrator says to dark images depicting Chinese abuses. “China is the greatest threat to our national security and our values. Career politician Joe Biden is weak on China.”

The new ad is part of a five-figure buy that will air in regions of the state hardest hit by manufacturing job losses. The ad will also play digitally in swing states across the country as part of Cotton’s effort to elect conservative veterans and aid in President Donald Trump’s re-election this fall.

“Throughout his career, almost every time he got the chance, Joe Biden took China’s side and American workers are still suffering for it,” Cotton told The Federalist. “Last year, Joe Biden claimed that China is ‘not competition for us’ and last month, he opposed President Trump’s travel ban on China as ‘xenophobic.’ Whatever the issue, Biden can be relied on to take China’s side.”

The attack ad targeting Biden on China in regions hollowed out by trade deals comes on the heels of Biden becoming the presumptive nominee after another series of major wins on Tuesday over his last standing rival in the race, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard remains in the race but has yet to capture a single state contest.

Biden’s wide victories in Mississippi, Idaho, Missouri, and Michigan have narrowed the path for Sanders to reach the 1,991 delegates required to clinch the nomination. Sanders’ loss in Michigan spells more trouble for the Vermont senator, who must prove he can capture critical Rust Belt states against Trump this fall.

Cotton’s Biden attack ad airing in Ohio might play to Sanders’s benefit in the state’s primaries next week as Sanders has targeted Biden on trade. It looks mathematically unlikely at this point that Sanders can overcome the delegate gap over Biden to win the nomination in Milwaukee. Biden currently leads Sanders with 838 delegates to Sanders’s 691.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/12/tom-cotton-launches-new-ad-attacking-joe-biden-on-china-in-ohio/,2020-03-12
Johnson To Press For Subpoena On Firms Linked To Hunter Biden,"Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson who serves as the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee said Thursday he plans to continue with a subpoena on a consulting firm tied to Hunter Biden and Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company.

Johnson had originally planned to subpoena Andrii Telizhenko, a consultant for the firm Blue Star Strategies contracted to do work with Burisma, but cancelled the committee vote scheduled for Wednesday after “discrepancies” in FBI briefings on Capitol Hill.

“There were discrepancies in what had been told in one briefing versus the next briefing, and then even greater discrepancies in staff notes,” Johnson wrote to members of the committee, according to The Hill.

Now Johnson is aiming to compel Blue Star Strategies to turn over records related to Burisma and bring forward the firm’s co-founders, Karen Tramontano and Sally Painter.

“This subpoena is in furtherance of the committee’s ongoing work to address the many unanswered questions about potential conflicts of interest and the extent to which representatives of Burisma – including officials at Blue Star – used individuals with close personal connections to high-level officials within the Obama administration to gain access to and potentially influence U.S. government agencies,” Johnson wrote in a letter to ranking Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan.

Johnson is seeking the consulting firm’s records related to Burisma going back to Jan. 1, 2013 to present. Biden joined Burisma’s board in April 2014, and according to the Daily Caller, connected Blue Star with the Ukrainian energy company in 2015 to combat corruption charges.

“The suggestion was made by both Democratic and Republican members of our committee that we should issue a subpoena directly to the source of the documents relevant to our work: Blue Star,” Johnson wrote to Peters.

The request for subpoenas came as part of a broad investigation into Biden’s perceived conflicts of interest conducting overseas business launched in 2017 by Johnson and Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa who serves as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

While his father, former Vice President Joe Biden, was dictating U.S. policy towards Ukraine in the Obama White House, Hunter Biden was hired on the board of Burisma earning upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals he was being showered in excess compensation when compared to the level of pay given to board members of even larger corporations. Hunter Biden also flew aboard Air Force Two on a trip with his father to China that was followed by a series of transactions that benefited Biden’s firm.

The Senate probe began to garner widespread media attention last fall after a transcript was released of President Donald Trump’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump mentioned Biden’s work in Ukraine that ultimately led to impeachment. On the day of Trump’s acquittal in the Senate, Grassley and Johnson issued demands for Secret Service travel records on Biden to determine whether Biden “used government-sponsored travel to help conduct private business” with nations abroad.

The two top Republican senators have also asked for records on Biden from a wide range of government agencies who appear to be cooperating with the senators’ requests. Last month, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden leaked to the press that the Treasury Department had been supplying the senators with documents showing “‘evidence’ of questionable origin,” in the form of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to Biden’s overseas work.

Grassley and Johnson responded by pointing out it was “strange that any senator would complain about Congress receiving responses to oversight requests in a timely manner.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/13/sen-johnson-to-move-forward-with-subpoena-on-firms-linked-to-hunter-biden/,2020-03-13
Best Tweets Of The First Biden-Sanders Democratic Primary Debate,"The last few weeks have felt like a lifetime, and not just because our kids are all home from school. Since the last debate, all but three of the Democratic candidates for President have dropped out: Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, and Tulsi Gabbard.

The DNC changed the debate rules to make sure it was an all-boys club this time, though, as Biden and Sanders squared off mano a liver-spotted mano. In case you missed it while out searching the earth for the last available bottle of Purel, we collected the best tweets of the debate so you won’t have missed a thing.

Politics in a Time of Corona

They started out throwing elbows, but not in the usual sense of the term.

The podiums were six feet apart.

Even the usual audience was missing, in accordance with CDC recommendations. Some people liked it.

Others didn’t.

This is already so awkward without an audience lololol — Lindsay Wigo (@LindsayWigo) March 16, 2020

As you might expect, the first questions dealt with the coronavirus outbreak sweeping the globe. Biden’s first reaction was not encouraging.

The rest of his answer was a bit confused.

Then he declared war on a microbe?

MODERATOR: And would you deploy the Space Force? BIDEN: Absolutely. — Alice from Queens in Vermont (@AliceFromQueens) March 16, 2020

The whole exchange lacked the poll-tested smoothness of prior contests.

the debate just isn’t the same without Mayor Pete saying “What we need in this nation is a moment…a moment of hope. “To GALVANIZE instead of POLARIZE. “FRIENDHOOD instead of ENEMYHOOD.” — The Gregory Brothers (@gregorybrothers) March 16, 2020

Sanders was asked whether China should be held responsible for concealing the spread of the virus until it was too late. Given the choice to condemn a communist nation or to not answer the question, well, you know how this will go.

Asked if China should face consequence for this crisis, Sanders says it is not time to be “punishing people.” — Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) March 16, 2020

What consequences should China face for their lies about coronavirus? Bernie: Trump sucks. — David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) March 16, 2020

Bernie is asked what consequences China should face, and says punish Trump instead. “China…is learning a lot from this crisis…the entire world is in this together…” — Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) March 16, 2020

He was next asked about our economic response and told some lies about Trump giving free money to banks.

Sanders is willing to blur the difference between a central bank operation to flood the market with liquidity and a bailout of bank shareholders. Biden avoids doing that. Again, the difference between a demagogue and a Democrat. #DemDebate #Cato2020 https://t.co/7KrBY5YFUy — Walter Olson (@walterolson) March 16, 2020

Biden suggested that bailouts are good, at times, but that our options are limited here.

“We’ve eaten a lot of our seed corn here” — Alexandra Petri (@petridishes) March 16, 2020

Biden: we need massive bailout but not a corporate bailout like the Obama-Biden admin did a decade ago. — Razor (@hale_razor) March 16, 2020

HALLELOO. Biden is defending the Wall Street bailout. I did not think this was possible in our current politics. Absent that bailout, the country would have been in much, much worse shape. — Jay Nordlinger (@jaynordlinger) March 16, 2020

Sanders followed Biden in becoming confused about which newfangled virus it was this time.

Did Bernie just call it the Ebola crisis, twice? — Will Upton 🇻🇦⚙️⏩ (@wupton) March 16, 2020

One called it Ebola, the other SARS. In the words of @JVLast, “I’m sure it’s fine.” — Michael Brendan Dougherty (@michaelbd) March 16, 2020

He quickly got back to his answer to the question—and every question.

Sanders is really convinced that the pandemic, like everything else, can be solved by redistributing wealth. — Robert Smith (@judgebobsmith) March 16, 2020

The coronavirus pandemic is exposing Sanders as a one-issue guy, whereas Biden has plans upon plans that at least sound good to middle of the road people. — Joe Cunningham (@JoePCunningham) March 16, 2020

Biden’s answers began to stray into the esoteric.

Then they both assured the American people that, like Paul’s grandfather in A Hard Day’s Night, they are very clean.

Other People’s Money

After all the virus talk, campaign finance came up. Biden noted that he had spent far less money than Sanders and was still beating him. Then he said we had to get money out of politics, for some reason.

“I didn’t have any money and I still won!” Biden tells Sanders who was making the case against big money in politics. — Amanda Carpenter (@amandacarpenter) March 16, 2020

CNN was waiting to pounce on this one, claiming that Sanders had also suggested changes to Social Security. It was kind of a dumb gotcha—Bernie has never tried to cut any program except for those related to America’s military strength and preparedness.

MODERATOR: Senator Sanders, in 1996 you called for changes to Social Security:

Should local cops be able to turn in illegal immigrant criminals to ICE? In the strongest terms of the night, both candidates said no.

Wuhan Virus Takes Center Stage In Biden-Sanders Debate,"The final two competitive Democratic presidential candidates went head-to-head Sunday night in their last match-up before another round of state primaries on Tuesday.

This week, Arizona, Illinois, Florida, and Ohio will cast their ballots for the Democratic nomination between frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden currently leads in the race to 1,991 delegates with 890 to Sanders’s 736.

Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard remains in the race but has yet to come close to capturing a first-place win in a single state and only has two delegates from the territory of her birth, the American Samoa.

Candidates Take Aim at Trump Over Wuhan Virus

The CNN moderators kicked off the night with several questions regarding the coronavirus pandemic closing schools and business across the country. The two candidates on stage also took the opportunity to slam the Trump administration as unprepared to handle the present crisis.

Biden spoke first and began his response with a cough.

Biden called the crisis “bigger than any one of us,” and laid out his plan to confront the epidemic, including nationwide drive-thru testing and temporary hospitals. Biden also warned that the current health-care infrastructure does not have the capacity to deal with the imminent caseload.

“The present system cannot handle the surge that is likely to come,” Biden said.

Sanders echoed Biden’s response, first going after the president before moving on to urge sick individuals to seek out medical care no matter the cost.

“Firstly, whether or not I’m president, we have to shut this president up right now,” charged Sanders, who accused the president of “blabbering” and “confusing the general public.”

Sanders proceeded to give credit for Trump declaring a national emergency and encouraged those sick to seek medical treatment no matter the cost, promising that it will be covered. “Do not worry about the cost right now, because we’re in the middle of a national emergency.”

While both knocked the Trump administration as leaving the nation woefully unequipped the confront the pandemic, senior contributor Kyle Sammin pointed out for The Federalist last week that Trump has been proactive in combatting its spread by implementing a Chinese travel ban early and working to manufacture medical supplies at home.

Biden Confuses Wuhan Coronavirus and Swine Flu

When touting his role in the Obama White House dealing with previous public health emergencies, Biden mixed up the novel Wuhan coronavirus with Swine Flu, calling the flu outbreak that occurred in 2009 “N1H15” instead of “H1N1.”

Biden And Sanders Debate ‘Medicare For All’

Sanders seized on the moment to tout his signature single-payer health-care plan, “Medicare for All.”

“We are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people. We’re spending so much money and yet we are not even prepared for this pandemic,” Sanders said. “In the midst of this epidemic, you have people in the pharmaceutical industry saying, wow, what an opportunity to make a fortune.”

Biden pushed back, pointing out that Italy, which is now on lockdown due to the outbreak and has death panels deciding which patients will receive care over others, already has the health care system Sanders envisions.

“With all due respect for Medicare for All, you have a single-payer health care system in Italy. It doesn’t work over there,” Biden said.

The former vice president went on to tout his own plan to combat the virus, in which the government comes in with a blank check to cover the costs of tests and treatment for any individual infected. Biden also said he would repeat the decisions that he made in the Obama administration to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus by convening experts in the White House situation room.

Sanders responded by arguing that a system under Medicare for All would leave the country more prepared to fight outbreaks of new diseases by encouraging sick individuals to visit a hospital at the onset of symptoms.

Biden disagreed, saying the spread of an outbreak in a national health crisis has nothing to do with whether people are insured and reiterated his plan for the government to pay all medical expenses incurred by infected people.

“This is a national health emergency. This isn’t a question of whether or not this is something that could be covered by insurance or anything else,” Biden said. “We out of the Treasury are going to pay for this. It’s a national emergency. That’s what my plan calls for.”

Biden Calls For Bailouts to Sanders’s Objections

To deal with the economic fall out from the Wuhan virus, Biden said he would push for a “major, major, major bailout package” to rescue major industries from collapse.

“We’re going to have to just level with the American people,” Biden said after claiming the current administration’s recent tax cut has gutted the federal government’s ability to release additional economic stimulus.

Joe Biden on the economy: ""What I would do is make it clear to the world and make it clear to the United States that we are going to have to have a major, major, major bailout package that we do not reward corporations, we reward individuals"" #DemDebate https://t.co/WhvffkfSes pic.twitter.com/BBfRhVS34Y — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) March 16, 2020

Sanders, who has been a vocal critic of the bailouts from the previous financial crisis in 2008, which always favor connected interests at the expense of taxpayers, savers, and small businesses, decried the idea of additional bailouts to rescue institutions on the brink of failure from the Wuhan plague.

“I said this to the secretary of the Treasury,” Sanders said of the 2008 bailouts. “You want a bailout? That’s fine. Have your friends pay for it. Not working people.”

Sen. Sanders voted against the Wall Street bank bailout. Biden, then VP, backed it. And a question about whether there should be a similar bailout for the economic effects of the deadly #coronavirus pandemic quickly devolved into their past positions https://t.co/pHtq4ngQ0L pic.twitter.com/i9ZC7ruTTk — POLITICO (@politico) March 16, 2020

“We can’t repeat what we did in 2008,” Sanders said. “We have got to do more than save the banks or the oil companies. Our job right now is to tell every working person in this country, no matter what your income is, you are not going to suffer as a result of this crisis of which you had no control.”

Candidates Discuss Their Own Health Precautions

Biden, 77, and Sanders, 78, both said they are taking extra steps to prevent themselves from contracting the virus that has been shown to be particularly deadly among older individuals, particularly those with heart and respiratory problems. Sanders suffered a heart attack as recently as last fall.

Both have cancelled campaign events and said they were washing their hands frequently while refusing to shake hands with others. At the beginning of the debate, the two greeted each other on stage with an elbow bump.

“I wash my hands God knows how many times a day with hot water and soap,” Biden said, adding that he is now holding virtual campaign events online. Sanders noted that his staff are working from home.

Biden Promises Female Running Mate

Biden pledged that if nominated, he would choose a woman to join him on the ticket.

“I commit that I will, in fact, pick a woman to be vice president,” Biden said. “There are a number of women qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president.”

Biden also promised to make his first Supreme Court nominee a nonwhite woman and added that he would take sex into consideration when making cabinet appointments.

Biden Should Take The Cognitive Test Trump Aced,"It’s becoming increasingly probable that former Vice President Joe Biden will be the Democratic Party nominee for president. At the same time, among Republicans anyway, speculation continues that, as for about 10 percent of Americans within his age range, Biden is impaired with dementia.

Biden’s Mental State a Subject of Broad Speculation

Here’s Roger Kimball writing at The Spectator’s U.S. edition:

Some people dismiss evidence of Biden’s incapacity as just a matter of ‘gaffes,’ little mental hiccups of no consequence. They aren’t ‘gaffes,’ i.e., simple mistakes. They are tokens of serious mental incapacity. Judge for yourself. Here’s Biden from a couple of weeks ago announcing that he is running for the US Senate (ah, the good old days).

Or how about his claim that ‘150 million’ Americans have been killed by guns since 2007? Or here he is trying to get his mind (and his mouth) around the Declaration of Independence: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident: all men and women are created, by the, you know the, you know the thing.’

Donald Trump Jr. went further:

From the Alzheimers association webpage ‘Aggressive or angry behaviors may occur in people with Alzheimer’s or other dementias,’ the president’s eldest son said Tuesday on Twitter in response to a video of Biden berating a Michigan man. ‘A 50 year career politician doesn’t snap back this way to a blue collar guy asking him a reasonable question given his parties stance on the issue.’

And Victor David Hansen, writing at National Review, observes:

The problem is that we have never before witnessed a major party’s likely candidate who so early in the race seems unable to meet the grueling demands of the spring, summer, and fall campaign trail, much less the anticipated duties of president — especially from the party who insisted so loudly that Trump was non compos mentis that it apparently prompted the president to take the Montreal Cognitive Assessment screening test, which he aced, but which a current Joe Biden might well not be able to ace if similarly accused of being mentally unfit and removable via the 25th Amendment.

Now, I don’t claim the expertise to assess to what degree Biden’s “gaffes” are a concern. What did raise concerns for me, however, was an incident back last summer: On June 5, 2019, NBC News reported that Biden continued to oppose federal funding for abortion. A day later, the word was out that, no, he did not believe this any longer.

Later that month, Vox provided the campaign’s explanation: With the proposed wide expansion of government provision of medical care, so many more women would be affected by the funding restriction that it was no longer acceptable (Vox wasn’t buying it). But The New York Times reported that Biden’s shift was due to pressure from allies and campaign staff, raising the question of the degree to which Biden is actually making his own decisions.

An Easy Way to Stop the Speculation

To take a step back, Trump did indeed “ace” the Montreal Cognitive Assessment screening test back in 2018. At the time, this produced triumphant reactions from some. Others declared this test would not pick up on nuances of mental decline or the bigger picture of whether Trump is fit to serve as president. The Montreal screening is hardly the sort of test that identifies how clever one is or how much wisdom one has, of the sort that might be handy in managing just about anything a president has to manage.

But the test (which is no longer easily available online for copyright reasons but is described in detail at VeryWellHealth and a partial image at The Guardian) is meant for a specific objective: screening people for dementia or mild cognitive impairment. It consists of tasks such as drawing a clock face, naming animals based on line drawings, reciting a set of numbers forward and backward, listing as many words as you can think of that start with the letter “f,” and similar questions, for a total of 30 points, with 26 points required to “pass” the screening, and a lower cutoff differentiating between mild cognitive impairment and dementia.

I have watched someone take this test. To a cognitively unimpaired person, the questions seem trivial. But the individual I watched take this screening could not answer questions that to an unimpaired person would seem obvious. These are not “trick questions.” It’s not an IQ test, nor is it designed to ferret out nuances. But if a person really is impaired, the test will identify it.

Tthis means that, yes, if Biden’s gaffes and his outbursts are just “Biden being Biden,” there should be an easy enough answer: Biden could take the screening test just as easily as Trump did, and just as easily pass it. Then everyone can just shut up about the issue — unless, that is, the claims of Republicans that he has been pushed into this election against his own best interest and that he’d be better off having stayed in retirement are well-founded.

But I’m not sure it matters to voters. Many of them, near as I can tell, simply see Biden as a placeholder for a generic moderate Democrat and are willing to cast their vote, even knowing his age alone creates a fair probability he won’t finish out his term, on the expectation that his vice president would be of roughly the same ideology.

Why did Biden defeat the ideologically similar Amy Klobuchar? Surely the voters (and poll-respondents) didn’t carefully evaluate their policy proposals; Biden had the name recognition the others lacked.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/18/biden-should-take-the-cognitive-test-trump-aced/,2020-03-18
"Despite Biden's Battle Wins, Sanders Is Winning The War For The Left","Perhaps the most significant item to come out of the March 15 Democratic presidential debate between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders was just how much the so-called moderate agreed with the radical.

Biden said he and Sanders agree that “health care should be a right.”

Contrary to the policy of the Obama administration, under which Biden loves to remind us he served, the former vice president said of those in the financial services industry who were bailed out, “I agree with Bernie, some of them should have gone to jail.”

According to Biden, he and Sanders, in fact, share many points of agreement:

“We both agree we have to deal with student debt.”

“We both agree we have to deal with education and access to education.”

“We both agree that we have a new Green Deal to deal with the existential threat that faces humanity.”

Biden concluded, “We disagree on the detail of how we do it,” but “we don’t disagree on the principle.” Sanders’s leftism is the brand on which Biden’s policy agenda and goals would be premised.

Sanders and Biden’s Common Vision

Accordingly, Biden said he would support the septuagenarian socialist Sanders were he the nominee. In response to a question from CNN’s Jake Tapper about how he would reach out to Sanders supporters when, contrary to his responses during the debate, “you do disagree on so many issues,” Biden stated:

He’s making it hard for me right now. I was trying to give him credit for some things. He won’t even take the credit for things he wants to do. … I want to make it clear that [if] Bernie as (sic) a nominee, I will not only support him, I will campaign for him … because the existential threat to the United States of America is Donald Trump.

Biden may have tried to wrap his hypothetical support for Sanders in a bow of Trump-hatred, but in his remarks two days later, following victories in the Florida, Illinois, and Arizona primary contests, Biden made his sentiments perfectly clear, saying, “Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” lauding Sanders for having “shifted the fundamental conversation in this country.”

This is to say nothing of Biden having served as the No. 2 person in the most radically leftist administration since President Lyndon B. Johnson. Nor is it to mention his unique role in poisoning the Supreme Court confirmation process, from “Borking” to the high-tech lynching of Justice Clarence Thomas. He now pledges to further undermine the highest court in the land by vowing to discriminate on the basis of race and sex for his first Supreme Court pick. This was a bridge too far even for Sanders.

Biden’s Leftward Lurch Is Obvious

Whether Biden is at heart a Sanders socialist or is merely pandering to keep the Democratic coalition together is really of secondary importance to the fact that the socialist wing of the party is so big, strong, and vocal that Biden clearly believes he must appeal to it.

That Biden has calibrated his positions and rhetoric to the Sanders wing of the Democratic Party is consistent with the thesis of my new book, “American Ingrate: Ilhan Omar and the Progressive-Islamist Takeover of the Democratic Party.” Omar is both a symbol of and critical player in the increasingly Sanders-dominated New Democratic Party, with their shared radical views on Jews and Israel, identity politics, and patriotism increasingly becoming mainstream Democratic positions.

Contrary to the notion that the Sanders-Omar wing is popular but politically impotent, I suggest that indicators such as the radically leftist positions of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment charade, and the party’s unwillingness to censure Omar by name and her antisemitic rhetoric specifically, indicate that wing is strong. The party is merely following the leftward slide of its electorate, led by disproportionately influential white elites.

The fact that the Democratic establishment apparatus apparently sprang into action, consolidating behind its generic candidate to halt Sanders’s march, is not so much a function of disagreements on “vision” — as reflected in Biden’s campaign — but fear that open radicalism could doom Democrats up and down the ticket. Why? Because the voting public writ large, and the older and more moderate voters who still make up a significant portion of the Democratic voting base, are not yet with him. Give it another decade, however, and the Sanders wing of the party is poised to inherit it.

Progressives Are Poised to Dominate Democrats

The single greatest piece of evidence for this claim can be found in the growth of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC). When then-Rep. Bernie Sanders founded the CPC just more than a generation ago, there was a total of six members. Pelosi was an early joiner, only departing in 2003 when she was elected minority leader. In today’s Congress, there are nearly 100 CPC members, including Omar, who serves as whip. The CPC now represents more than 40 percent of all House Democrats. It has enjoyed a 15-fold increase in membership in less than 30 years.

While the old Democratic establishment clings to power amid a progressive onslaught that struck closest to home when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., primaried longtime Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley, consider what just transpired in the Democratic primary for Illinois’ 3rd Congressional District.

Rep. Dan Lipinski had been a representative since 2005, when he succeeded his father, who had served since 1983. In the 2018 general election, Lipinski garnered 73 percent of the vote — and in 2020 lost to challenger Marie Newman. Newman was endorsed by a coterie of far-left politicians and activist groups, led by Sanders, several “squad” members, and their affiliated Justice Democrats PAC.

As the Wall Street Journal detailed in an op-ed, Lipinski paid a price for being one of the final anti-abortion members of the Democratic Party, no longer able to count on the “traditional working-class Democrats who … used to be a keystone in the party’s base.” The connection to Biden is that he, like Lipinski, opposed taxpayer-funded abortion — until the 2020 presidential campaign, when either by a change of heart after decades or a recognition of the political imperative to do so, Biden reversed his position on the Hyde Amendment.

The WSJ op-ed highlights exit polling from the diverse set of states that voted in the March 17 primaries in which Biden romped. The polling indicates the party’s shift in Sanders’ direction, noting:

Medicare for All registers 55% support to 33% oppose in Florida; 61% to 32% in Illinois; and 58% to 34% in Arizona. In President Obama’s old turf, Illinois, 43% say they want the nation’s next leader to be more liberal than Mr. Obama. Only 37% want a restoration of what Mr. Biden sometimes calls “our administration.”

Do not let the Democratic establishment fool you. It is increasingly Bernie Sanders’s party, just with superficially less radical frontmen.

Joe Biden Is Not The Leader We Need In A Post-Coronavirus World,"As much of the country goes into various stages of lockdown over the coronavirus, Joe Biden’s been keeping busy from his home studio in Delaware, making the rounds on cable news and holding forth in virtual news conferences about what the Trump administration should or should not be doing.

Without the ability to campaign—at a time when he otherwise would be campaigning hard—Biden’s in a tough spot. All he can do is appear on the shows and post clips online while President Trump holds daily news conferences with the medical experts leading the fight against the virus.

But Biden’s clips so far don’t inspire confidence. Maybe you’ve seen them. In a string of interviews this week on CNN, MSNBC, and ABC, Biden came across as even more befuddled and rambling than he was on the campaign trail, by turns interrupting himself, trailing off dejectedly, and coughing through interviews.

Biden was never a great candidate, but this is just dismal. As the likely Democratic nominee, the timing of this worldwide pandemic couldn’t be worse. His campaign has no momentum, he isn’t able to raise the funds he’ll need for the general election, and he hasn’t even dispatched his top Democratic rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has yet to drop out of the primary. Biden’s already paltry campaign organization is effectively frozen until, well, we don’t know when.

SUPERCUT! Biden Coughs, Acts Confused, Throughout ABC/CNN/MSNBC Interviews pic.twitter.com/GuSA1Fsxst — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) March 24, 2020

Biden’s basically been reduced to being a podcaster. You almost feel sorry for the guy. Almost.

Certainly, expectations for Biden among Democrats and the mainstream media, which were never all that high, have sunk to new lows. The Atlantic ran an unintentionally humorous piece this week with the plaintive headline, “Stay Alive, Joe Biden.” All the Democrats need from him now, the author argued, is his “corporeal presence.”

From the looks of it, that’s all they’re likely to get. To the extent Biden’s been able to inject himself into the national consciousness lately, it’s been with false attacks against the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus response. The fact-checker at the Washington Post, of all places, gave the Biden campaign “Four Pinocchios” earlier this month over deceptively edited footage that made Trump appear to call the coronavirus a “hoax” (he was actually calling the Democrats’ criticism of his handling of the crisis a hoax).

But the hits kept coming. WaPo’s fact-checker dinged the Biden campaign again this week over a claim that a top official at the Centers for Disease Control was “silenced” by the White House, which of course wasn’t remotely true. Politifact, a quasi-journalistic operation usually more than willing to carry water for Democrats, called Biden out Tuesday for falsely claiming the Trump administration rejected coronavirus test kits from the World Health Organization (the kits were never offered).

And of course, Biden opposed the travel restrictions on China that Trump wisely put in place in late January, calling it “hysterical xenophobia,” and was among the first to accuse Trump of racism for using the term “Chinese virus” in an effort to push back on Chinese Communist Party propaganda claiming the virus originated in the United States.

Biden Will Not Take On China After The Virus Is Defeated

Despite all this, Biden’s general confusion and dishonest attacks aren’t what should worry Democratic voters most right now about his candidacy. The more serious problem with Biden is that he’s the wrong person to lead America in a post-coronavirus world because he will never stand up to China or make the Chinese Communist Party pay a price for unleashing this plague upon the world.

Never in his long political career has Biden been willing to stand up to Beijing. He’s never so much as expressed hesitancy about the risks of free trade with China or the cost it might impose on American workers, but has been a consistent champion of greater economic integration with China.

As the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the 1990s, Biden pushed for China’s membership in the World Trade Organization, blocking measures that would have imposed human rights requirements in exchange for most-favored-nation status. As Barack Obama’s vice president, he worked for closer ties with China, praising Beijing as a “new partner” in 2012 as President Xi Jinping consolidated power. A short while later, as everyone now knows, his son Hunter Biden travel with him to Beijing and later joined the board of a Shanghai-based private equity firm.

And of course, throughout his years as vice president, China continued to build military outposts on contested islands in the Pacific, threaten its neighbors, and assert sovereignty over some of the busiest commercial shipping lanes in the world—all without hardly any pushback from Biden and Obama.

So no, a Biden White House would not make Beijing pay a price for covering up the coronavirus and endangering the entire world. Biden will not work to uncouple critical supply chains from China or bring back manufacturing jobs to American workers. He won’t seek damages from China under international law for unleashing a global catastrophe.

No, a President Biden would almost certainly seek a return to normalcy, which is the rationale for his entire campaign. What should be obvious by now, even to Biden, is that there’s not going to be a return to normalcy—and when it comes to China, there shouldn’t be.

Just don’t hold your breath waiting for Biden to say so from his next basement interview.

What On Earth Is Going On With Joe Biden,"Former Vice President Joe Biden continues his presidential campaign from Delaware in the era of the Wuhan coronavirus by conducting remote interviews from a home studio.

Biden however, whose candidacy has survived slip-ups seemingly every month on the trail still appears forgetful and frail from the comfort of his own home. While the pressures of on-the-ground campaigning are temporarily gone, the same Biden we’ve seen for much of the last year is not.

On Monday, Biden once again refreshed concerns about the Democratic frontrunner’s age and aptitude at 77 years old to win the White House in November, offering a nonsensical jumbled word salad on MSNBC with notes in his lap.

Here’s what Biden said:

Boy those very high numbers have to do at least several things. One, we have to depend on what the president’s going to do right now, and first of all he has to… tell… wait til the cases before anything happens. Look, the whole idea is, he’s got to get in place things that were shortages of.

Biden’s Monday clip comes just a week after Biden seemed to have thrown in the towel on being articulate as he has become the likely Democratic nominee.

During an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday, Biden trailed off and looked defeated after mixing up his words again prompting an awkward silence on air.

“We have never, never, never, failed to respond to a crisis as a people, and I tell you what, I’m so darn proud. Those poor people who have…” Biden said before realizing what he actually said. “Anyway…”

https://twitter.com/tristan_puig/status/1242549724911030272?s=20

Last week, Biden was also caught coughing while denying he had any symptoms of the Wuhan virus.

At one point on CNN, Jake Tapper directed Biden to cough into his arm as advised by public health officials.

“You know, you’re supposed to cough into your elbow… I learned that actually covering your White House,” Tapper said.

“Fortunately I’m alone in my home, but that’s okay,” Biden said.

In the last Democratic debate between Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who remains the final major competitor in the race, Biden also opened up with a cough to answer a question about the Wuhan virus.

So what is going on with Joe Biden?",https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/30/what-on-earth-is-going-on-with-joe-biden/,2020-03-30
Biden’s Presidental Run Is The 2020 Digital Version Of A 1920 Campaign,"As the global pandemic over the Wuhan coronavirus changes life as we know it, an old style of campaigning is making a comeback as presidential candidates have no choice but to run a nationwide campaign locally from their own home.

While voting was underway across six states on Super Tuesday 2.0, the remaining two Democratic presidential candidates cancelled large events in Ohio and Pennsylvania out of fears of spreading the virus. The decisions to cancel were followed shortly by a cascade of events altering the complete nature of the 2020 presidential race. Fifteen states postponed elections and the final two candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was forced to pursue voters exclusively through virtual means as gatherings of more than 10 people are either discouraged by CDC guidelines or outright prohibited by state and local governments.

As the likely Democratic nominee Biden has taken to the airwaves to criticize President Donald Trump. He’s conducted interview after interview on cable networks from his Delaware home, while holding press conferences of his own to counter the White House briefings. On Sunday, Biden launched a podcast titled “Here’s the Deal.”

Sanders on the other hand has been live-streaming his own talk show and hosting fireside chats from Burlington, Vermont.

The home-run operations have come to resemble modern versions of age-old campaigns from a century ago where candidates would seek the nation’s highest office from their own front porch.

The “front-porch campaign” refers to the strategy where candidates would hold rallies and gatherings at their own homes instead of themselves traveling to voters across the country seeking votes.

In an era of turbulence governed by an unconventional president, Biden is looking more like a candidate from a distant past than a contemporary game-changer running on a pledge to “Shake up Washington.”

Biden’s message of “No Malarkey” moderate pragmatism with a steady hand in the Oval Office echoes the “Return to Normalcy” motto of the last porch campaign employed exactly one hundred years ago by Ohio Sen. Warren G. Harding who ran from his home in Marion, Ohio. Although it should be noted Biden is no moderate like he claims.

While operating under an aura of uncertainty, The Democratic National Convention was officially postponed until August as the virus continues its sweep across the country into the summer. Whether major events will even be able to proceed until a proper treatment or vaccine is developed to combat the virus remains unknown leaving whether current campaign tactics will become a permanent fixture in this year’s race an open question.

Other presidents who ran successful front-porch campaigns include James A. Garfield in 1880, Benjamin Harrison in 1888, and William McKinley in 1896, all of whom happened to be from Ohio.

With nearly a month in so far, Biden has fared poorly under the new circumstances even as it initially played to his benefit in the primary against Sanders who thrived with the energy provided by massive audiences. By the time the virus escalated to a crisis, shifting the race into a purely online contest, Biden had already largely shored up the nomination and has since solidified a nearly insurmountable lead in the delegate count.

Biden however, has struggled to attract much attention in the digital space where the public focus has moved almost entirely to during the pandemic. His online videos are bland and boring, raking in dismal viewership with the low-grade quality of a local news program at best. When Biden began his press briefings on the virus last week to offer suggestions to the White House, no major network carried them live.

When the networks have given Biden airtime, he has only refreshed concerns about his age and aptitude appearing frail and forgetful in the comfort of his home in Wilmington.

Biden has also been coughing in live interviews while downplaying questions surrounding his health. Biden’s coughing has even earned admonishment from CNN’s Jake Tapper instructing the former vice president to cough into his arm in compliance with public health recommendations.

“You know, you’re supposed to cough into your elbow… I learned that actually covering your White House,” Tapper said.

“Fortunately I’m alone in my home, but that’s okay,” Biden replied.

If an exclusively online campaign does define the 2020 race, Trump will no doubt benefit given the president’s strengths in the digital realm and the perks that come with incumbency leading the nation through crisis.

Trump captivated voters in 2016 whose speeches were so entertaining on live television that networks drowned out Republican competitors to air them in real time.

Even in the last month, Trump has consistently addressed the nation through daily briefings and called into Fox News when not at the podium. The Trump campaign’s early investments in a digital operation will also bear significant returns if the president’s signature rallies are no longer an option.

While last century saw four past presidents thriving with front-porch campaigns, Biden’s early mishaps in the new contest showcase an even larger uphill battle for Democrats in a match-up between the former vice president’s living room and Trump’s White House.

Don’t Believe The Hype: It Was Bernie Sanders Who Beat Joe Biden,"At long last, Joe Biden is now the presumptive Democratic nominee. Sen. Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign Wednesday, ending what has turned out to be one of the strangest and most unpredictable presidential primary contests in modern history—one that essentially ground to a halt in mid-March because of the coronavirus.

Still, make no mistake: Sanders might have lost the battle for the Democratic nomination to Biden, but he won the war for the future of the Democratic Party. Since his insurgent challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016, and especially over the past year of campaigning, Sanders and his allies on the left have transformed the Democratic Party almost beyond recognition from what it was when Biden last served in elected office as Barack Obama’s vice president.

There’s no better evidence of this transformation than Biden himself. Once considered a moderate, Biden has gradually embraced almost every aspect of Sanders’s left-wing populist agenda—a $15-an-hour minimum wage, free college, tax hikes for the rich, and more power to workers. Just about the only Sanders idea he hasn’t endorsed is Medicare for All, but that one might well be around the corner.

Perhaps most telling was Biden’s embrace of the Green New Deal last summer, an obvious sop to the sensibilities of Sanders surrogates like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, who have made it pretty clear that the Green New Deal isn’t really about climate change but re-ordering the economy along socialist lines.

Biden has pitched himself as a return to normalcy, as if 2016 and Trump had never happened, and we can just go back to those halcyon days of Obama, when all was good and right in Washington.

But eliminating the use of fossil fuels is not a return to normalcy. In fact, Biden supports a slew of policies that Obama never did—policies that bear the indelible mark of Sanders-style socialism. On health care, Biden has endorsed a public option for Obamacare and taxpayer-funded health-care for illegal immigrants. Speaking of immigration, Biden supports a sharp increase in refugee admissions and citizenship for all illegal immigrants. The truth is that a Biden presidency would be anything but normal. At this point, it’s not too much to say that Biden will be the farthest-left Democrat ever nominated for president.

This Is Not The Joe Biden From Times Past

It’s hard to understand the outsized influence of Sanders on the Democratic Party, and on Biden, without looking at Biden’s outrageous flip-flopping. Facing a younger and more leftist field of primary challengers, Biden took stock of his political record and decided to chuck most of it out the window.

About a month after launching his campaign last April, Biden changed his mind about federal funding for abortion. For three decades, as both a U.S. senator and vice president, he had opposed repealing the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funding of abortions. But all it took was a phone call from Alyssa Milano and a stern talking-to from some woke campaign aides, and Biden caved.

He came around just in time. As Sanders made clear in February, there’s no room in the Democratic Party for pro-lifers—or anyone, apparently, who opposes taxpayer-funded abortions.

Biden’s got a habit of this. Take his views on China. Biden has long held soft views on China and encouraged closer ties with the communist state. As recently as last May, he scoffed at the idea that the United States should worry about China as a competitor. “China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,” he said at a campaign rally in Iowa. “China’s not our competitor.”

Fast forward a month, and Biden declares China a major threat. “We are in a competition with China. We need to get tough with China,” he said. “They are a serious challenge to us, and in some areas a real threat.” No surprise, he added that, “every single step that Donald Trump is taking is only exacerbating the challenge.”

Over at Vox, Matt Yglesias writes that “while Sanders himself will most likely support the ticket, if Biden loses, it will be seen as a semi-vindication of Sanders’s ideas about politics, and if he wins it will be a refutation of them.”

This analysis might sounds straightforward enough, but it badly underestimates how much Sanders’s leftist ideas have already been absorbed into the Biden campaign and the Democratic Party at large. At this point, defeating Biden means defeating those ideas, and by extension discrediting the leftward march of the Democratic Party—a march led not by Biden, but Sanders.

Media Treated Joe Biden's Accuser Differently Than Brett Kavanaugh's,"There are similarities in the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford and Tara Reade. Ford accuses Justice Brett Kavanaugh of pinning her to a bed, groping her over her clothes, and covering her mouth at a high school party in the early 1980s. Reade accuses Biden of forcibly penetrating her with his fingers when she worked for his Senate office in 1993.

The allegations are both decades old. Both are denied by the accused men. That does not render them false. It does, however, offer an instructive case study in media bias.

Reade’s allegation is against a Democrat, Ford’s is against a Republican-appointed justice. Reade supported Sen. Bernie Sanders’ bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, and came forward as the contest narrowed to Sanders and Biden. Ford is a registered Democrat, who made her allegation public after Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court. Both say they hesitated to step forward earlier for fear of retaliation.

Reade’s story went untouched by The New York Times, the Washington Post, and most of the legacy media for 19 days. The Post reported Ford’s allegation shortly after she agreed to go on the record, which took months and came after other outlets were closing in on the story.

A Study in Contrasts

When The New York Times finally published an investigation into Reade’s account, it was in the form of a meta-story headlined: “Examining Tara Reade’s Sexual Assault Allegation Against Joe Biden.” The Times’ original Ford story was straight news, headlined, “Kavanaugh’s Nomination in Turmoil as Accuser Says He Assaulted Her Decades Ago.” The paper’s story on absurd gang rape allegations made by Julie Swetnick against Kavanaugh was headlined, “Julie Swetnick Is Third Woman to Accuse Brett Kavanaugh of Sexual Misconduct.”

The Times story on Reade is appropriately rigorous, but tellingly involves a higher standard of skepticism than the one applied to Ford. The headline is Example One, framing the story as an examination rather than a report.

By the story’s third paragraph, the Times noted, “In interviews, several people who worked in the Senate office with Ms. Reade said they did not recall any talk of such an incident or similar behavior by Mr. Biden toward her or any women. Two office interns who worked directly with Ms. Reade said they were unaware of the allegation or any treatment that troubled her.” Oddly enough, the next sentence mentioned, “Last year, Ms. Reade and seven other women came forward to accuse Mr. Biden of kissing, hugging or touching them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable,” despite reporting no pattern of “similar” behavior by Biden.

Later, the Times added, “No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade’s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden.” That, of course, depends on how “misconduct” is defined. The word would seem to include unwanted “kissing, hugging or touching.”

The Times was less insistent on Kavanaugh’s character testimonies. The original Times story on Ford included brief mention of a letter from 65 female classmates of Kavanaugh testifying to his character, along with a quote from the justice’s good friend, Mark Judge, whom Ford counted as a witness, denying her account and defending Kavanaugh. (The paper’s story on Swetnick’s allegation was better, although it probably should never have been published.)

The Times contextualized Ford’s allegation by placing it within the framework of a Democratic narrative about “Kavanaugh’s truthfulness,” writing, “Ms. Ford’s account comes as Democrats are already raising questions about Judge Kavanaugh’s truthfulness during his confirmation hearings this month. They have accused him of dissembling on a range of issues from his time in the George W. Bush White House, including a breach of secret Democratic files on judicial nominations and discussions about detainee policy and torture.”

But, again, the paper dubiously emphasized that Biden allegedly has no “pattern of sexual misconduct.” Why frame Kavanaugh’s denial with news that Democrats are raising concerns about his honesty and not frame Biden’s denial in the context of the allegations of inappropriate touching? Those allegations are mentioned twice in the story, and briefly. The Washington Post’s story on Reade went into much greater detail on them.

This is how media bias works. Sometimes it’s outright, but often it’s done more subtly through framing. While I would hardly call this contrast subtle, it’s certainly true the Times emphasized different elements of the story to frame Reade’s allegation more skeptically, starting right away with the headline. It’s about what you include and what you leave out.

NYT vs. NYT

This was so noticeable, even the Times had questions for the Times. Unfortunately it didn’t have great answers.

In an interview published Monday night, media columnist Ben Smith pushed Executive Editor Dean Baquet to explain the differences in coverage from Ford to Reade, particularly why the paper had an article on the Swetnick allegations up the same day she made them, but waited 19 days to report on Reade.

“Kavanaugh was in a very different situation. It was a live, ongoing story that had become the biggest political story in the country. It was just a different news judgment moment,” Baquet claimed. How Reade’s allegation did not qualify as a “live, ongoing story” is difficult to imagine.

Earlier in the interview, Baquet said the paper took more time to write about Reade’s allegation as breaking news because “Kavanaugh was already in a public forum in a large way,” other outlets had covered it and he felt the Times should bring “the expertise we had developed over doing more than a dozen of these kinds of stories” in its coverage.

But in Ford and Swetnick’s cases, other outlets covered their allegations before the Times, and the paper waited much less than 19 days to do the same. The “public forum” excuse is also silly because it’s the media’s job to bring information into the “public forum” when it can be reported out.

Baquet insisted the Times applied the same standard to both women’s stories. “The standard, to be really simple, is that we try to give the reader the best information we can come up with at the time. And we try to give the reader the information they need to make their own judgments,” he said. “Unless we can make the judgment. And Kavanaugh was a running, hot story. I don’t think it’s that the ethical standards were different. I think the news judgments had to be made from a different perspective in a running hot story.”

This explanation is absurd and not based in fact. The Times published a breaking news story on E. Jean Carroll’s assault allegation against President Trump the same day it went public last June. Like Reade, Carroll also had two friends who confirmed she told them about the incident after it allegedly occurred in the mid-1990s. The Times ran one and sat on the other.

Baquet further conceded the paper edited a perfectly fair sentence at the request of Biden’s campaign.

I want to ask about some edits that were made after publication, the deletion of the second half of the sentence: “The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable.” Why did you do that? Even though a lot of us, including me, had looked at it before the story went into the paper, I think that the campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct. And that’s not what the sentence was intended to say. And why not explain that? We didn’t think it was a factual mistake. I thought it was an awkward phrasing issue that could be read different ways and that it wasn’t something factual we were correcting. So I didn’t think that was necessary.

None of these explanations add up. He was flailing. But Baquet’s strangest answer came when Smith asked, “Do you think that, in your heart, you’re reluctant to promote a story that would hurt Joe Biden and get Donald Trump re-elected?” A good answer would be, “Of course not!” Baquet went with, “I can’t make that calculation.”

“I won’t,” he added. “I won’t let my head or my heart go there. I think once you start making those kinds of calculations, you are not a journalist anymore. You’re some sort of political actor.” But the point is that it shouldn’t be a calculation at all.

Reade and Ford

It should be noted that Reade’s allegation went public in the midst of a pandemic. Most media coverage is rightfully focused on the Wuhan coronavirus.

There are some issues with her story as well. Three aides to whom Reade claims she complained about harassment from Biden deny it. She stepped forward last year and accused Biden of inappropriate touching, but did not say anything about the alleged assault.

One friend has corroborated to the Times and Post that Reade told her about the assault after it allegedly took place in 1993. Another told the Times Reade said in 2008 she had a “traumatic experience” while working for Biden’s office in the ’90s. Reade’s brother first said his sister told him Biden touched her neck and shoulders inappropriately in 1993, but texted a journalist several days later to say he remembered being told Biden put his hand “under her clothes.”

That’s still more than Ford. When she stepped forward in 2018, she had not told anyone until 2012, when the story came up during couple’s therapy with her husband. Ford said Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh’s, jumped on top of them during the alleged assault. Judge categorically denied that, as did two other people Ford claimed were present at the party, including her close friend at the time, Leland Keyser.

Biden is obviously in a position of equal or greater consequence than Kavanaugh was at the time of his nomination. But the corporate media, Hollywood, and Democratic establishment amplified Ford’s allegations immediately. Some openly accepted them.

Perhaps this story would be bigger if the allegations hadn’t come out in the midst of a pandemic, but the Times and Post still found space in their pages to cover Reade’s story—just with questionable framing and weeks after they went public. That stands in clear contrast to their treatment of Ford.

This is not “fake news” in that it’s true both these women say they were assaulted. But it’s unfair news, and that’s evident from the framing to the delayed timeline to Baquet’s messy attempt to explain away the discrepancies.

It’s also the kind of biased treatment conservatives receive regularly from the corporate media, which largely refuses to address the problem and instead insists its critics are dangerous fools. This juxtaposition is bad, but merely representative of a long and undying pattern.

Joe Biden’s Endorsements This Week Can’t Hide Democratic Divisions,"We need to talk more about the ideological divide in the Democratic Party. The mainstream media will barely acknowledge it, much less cover it, but it’s going to have major repercussions in November.

Joe Biden’s string of endorsements this week belie not just his fundamental weakness as a candidate but also the seemingly impossible task of uniting his party for the general election. Former President Barack Obama’s endorsement of his erstwhile vice president and presumptive nominee was notable mostly for how late it was in coming—after Sen. Bernie Sanders’ tepid endorsement on Monday and after all other possible options had been eliminated.

The Obama endorsement was quickly followed by an endorsement from Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday. She ended her campaign in early March after failing to win a single state—including her home state of Massachusetts, where she finished third—or attract a solid support base among primary voters.

The 1-2-3 timing of these endorsements was no doubt meant as a show of unity, and Obama’s stamp of approval was meant to convey confidence and strength. But coming so late after Super Tuesday, when it became clear that Biden was the only candidate with a viable path to nomination, these endorsements instead convey weakness and exhaustion, which is precisely what Biden has been projecting in recent interviews.

Appearances aside, this coordinated push for the appearance of unity can’t paper over the profound divisions between the Democratic establishment and the far-left wing of the party, represented by Sanders until this week. Now that Sanders is finished, the mantle of progressive leadership passes to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and she does not appear to be in a unifying mood.

In a recent New York Times interview, AOC said the Biden camp would have to do more than throw progressives “a couple of bones” to get them on board, referring to the Biden campaign’s recent support for student loan bailouts and lowering the age for Medicare to 60—proposals meant to be an olive branch to leftists. AOC didn’t see it that way. She called the Medicare idea “almost insulting.”

“The whole process of coming together should be uncomfortable for everyone involved — that’s how you know it’s working. And if Biden is only doing things he’s comfortable with, then it’s not enough,” she said.

Certainly, Biden has been doing things he’s not comfortable with over the past year. Progressive Democrats have pushed the entire party so far to the left that Biden, once considered a moderate, has had to repudiate much of his own political legacy and gradually adopt most of Sanders’s socialist agenda.

Will that be enough for the likes of AOC? Probably not. In a January profile in New York Magazine, she said, “in any other country, Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party, but in America, we are.” She’s right about that. Biden’s entire pitch is for a return to normalcy, to an Obama-style White House and Obama-era policies.

But that’s unlikely to mollify leftists, who see the Obama years as a disappointment at best. In that Times interview, AOC admitted as much, saying progressives “need a real plan to be better than what happened during [Biden’s] service with the Obama administration.”

How Far to the Left Will Biden Have to Lurch?

Biden and the Democratic establishment now face a dilemma. Do they try to placate the far left enough to win their enthusiastic support or appeal to more moderate voters, independents, and centrist Democrats, even disaffected Republicans, in an attempt to build a national coalition that can beat Trump? Traditionally, presumptive nominees swing back to the center for the general election, but it’s not at all clear that Biden can afford to do that without losing the support of his party’s left wing.

But he also can’t afford to go full woke. Most political observers look at what happened to leftist candidates during the primary, whether it was younger up-and-comers trying to out-woke each other or Sanders and Warren battling over who had the better Medicare for All plan, and rightly conclude that Democratic voters—to say nothing of Americans at large—aren’t quite ready for a socialist revolution.

Not AOC. She looks at the defeat of Sanders and Warren and the other far-leftists and somehow concludes that Americans really did want what those candidates were offering. When the Times noted Biden got where he is today by rejecting far-left policies, AOC said she doesn’t think Biden won “because of policy,” and that most Americans actually want progressive policies even if they don’t vote for candidates who support them:

I want to respect his win, he won because of his coalition building, he won because of his service, he won for a lot of different reasons — but I don’t think he won because Americans don’t want ‘Medicare for all.’ And in this moment, I wouldn’t be surprised if what we’re seeing with coronavirus didn’t further change people’s views in further support of a progressive agenda.

For now, Biden seems to be trying to have it both ways. This week he reveled in Obama’s endorsement this week—and all the pre-Trump nostalgia that comes with it—but last week he struck a different note, declared that the next round of coronavirus pandemic relief must include things like student debt relief and “help for people who were already struggling to get by before the coronavirus.”

If this is what the Biden campaign’s plan amounts to, swinging from Obama-era normalcy to Sanders-style leftism, Democrats might well be in for a shock come November.

Media Coverage Of Kavanaugh Was Criminal. Here’s How They Can Fix It,"Coverage of the Joe Biden sexual assault allegation definitively shows that the media protect political allies who are accused of sexual assault and attempt to destroy those they perceive as political opponents. It’s nowhere near sufficient to simply note that fact. They must be forced to change their behavior and amends must begin to be made. They can start by apologizing to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and removing the “sexual assault” asterisk they constantly put next to his name.

Dozens of thoughtful articles have detailed the major media’s shockingly disparate coverage of a sexual assault allegation against presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden versus the unsubstantiated allegations against Kavanaugh.

It’s a low bar, but the charge against Biden is the stronger of the two. Unlike the situation with Kavanaugh, Biden’s accuser Tara Reade has evidence she at least met her alleged perpetrator. Even Biden defenders admit that Reade worked for him in 1993. There remains no evidence Christine Blasey Ford ever even met Brett Kavanaugh, the man she accused of trying to rape and inadvertently kill her in the 1980s.

Also unlike the Kavanaugh situation, Reade has evidence she told multiple people about the alleged assault at the time she claimed it happened and shortly thereafter. Blasey Ford never tied Kavanaugh to any claim until three decades after the 1980s, and only when he was a nationally known figure being talked about as a potential Supreme Court nominee.

Blasey Ford couldn’t get any of her claimed witnesses to back up her story. That includes her lifelong friend, Leland Keyser, who was pressured by mutual acquaintances to change her story when she said she could not corroborate Blasey Ford’s account. Both men have very good reputations among their female friends, staff, and colleagues, although Biden has also recently been forced to apologize for his well-known handsiness with women in his midst.

Nevertheless, whereas the entire media put all hands on deck to push Blasey Ford’s story and help her smooth out its many problems, they more or less had to be dragged kicking and screaming to cover Reade’s accusation, finally issuing stories on Easter Sunday after 19 days of steadfastly ignoring the claim.

For the Kavanaugh allegation, the media issued gauzy and hagiographic profiles of Blasey Ford and used the most sympathetic storytelling imaginable to dramatically roll out her allegation. They made the story massive by publishing as many articles as they could on literally anything that could be spun in Blasey Ford’s favor and against Kavanaugh’s. They applied intense public pressure against any Kavanaugh defender. They had their editorial pages pushing in lockstep for his destruction.

By contrast, the Times and other media outlets are hoping to dispose of the Biden problem with a dry, one-off accounting of Reade’s claim. Whereas the standard employed by the media for Kavanaugh’s accuser was “Believe All Women” no matter their lack of evidence (you might recall their many stories explaining the importance of that standard), the standard employed by the media for Biden’s accuser is full skepticism.

The New York Times even removed a line noting Biden’s history of handsiness with women, and deleted a tweet that said the same, at the request of his campaign. The disparate treatment goes on and on and on.

The situation is so blindingly obvious that one New York Times columnist was forced to confront New York Times editor Dean Baquet about it. Baquet asserted, implausibly, that Biden wasn’t a major news figure and the allegation wasn’t a major news story and so, you see, his paper handled both situations properly. In the words of National Review, “The New York Times Knows Nobody Believes It about Biden, Kavanaugh, and Sexual Assault.”

No additional time needs to be spent discussing whether the New York Times and other media outlets were proper or fair. We aren’t idiots. Everyone who lived through the Kavanaugh coverage knows that the Biden coverage is indefensibly different.

But noting the hypocrisy and corruption is not enough. The following items must be attended to immediately.

Remove Kavanaugh’s Asterisk

Nearly every time Kavanaugh is mentioned in a news story, the Blasey Ford allegation is mentioned. The mention of the unsubstantiated allegation serves as a stigmatizing asterisk next to his name.

Blasey Ford’s attorney Debra Katz admitted on videotape that this was their goal. She said that she and her client were politically motivated against Kavanaugh’s nomination and put forth the accusations so there would be an “asterisk” next to Kavanaugh’s name. Helping Katz with her political goal of placing an asterisk next to his name has been the fully compliant media.

The asterisk serves many malicious purposes. It ensures that every story his wife, daughters, mother, father, colleagues, and friends read about him contains this allegation that has never been substantiated. It serves to keep him from safely leaving his house.

More broadly, it harms the significant portion of the country that supports an originalist understanding of the Constitution. The ultimate goal isn’t just malice toward a father and husband the left perceived as a threat to a political goal. The ultimate goal is to delegitimize the Supreme Court and any decision at odds with The New York Times editorial board.

The media have lost the right to apply the asterisk through their disparate treatment of sexual assault allegations based on the politics of the accused. The media don’t get to get away with treating people differently based on their politics and continuing that disparate treatment into eternity with the uneven application of the asterisk.

This must stop. No more asterisks. Alternatively, the media can begin to use asterisks in each and every one of the stories on all of their political allies, such as Biden, who have been accused of rape.

Stop Using ‘Credibly Accused’ For ‘Unverified’ or ‘Unsubstantiated’

When the media really got going with their “Believe All Women (Who Accuse Our Political Opponents)” approach, they began to use the phrase “credibly accused” for allegations that were unproven. If the media claimed Kavanaugh had been “credibly accused” of rape once, they said it ten thousand times.

They even said this when Michael Avenatti’s client Julie Swetnick put forth the claim that Kavanaugh — a man who had favorably gone through six FBI background checks — was the secret leader of an underage gang rape cartel that roamed the streets of suburban Maryland. Somehow that phrase is not in use for Biden, who was by their own weak definition and liberal use of the term more than credibly accused of rape by his former employee.

Apologize to Brett Kavanaugh

That the media couldn’t even dream of putting Biden through one thousandth of what they so casually put Kavanaugh through should prick the conscience of everyone who participated in the ghoulish feeding frenzy. They know how vile it is to ruin someone’s reputation without definitive evidence.

True improvement begins with repentance and a willingness to turn away from evil behavior. What the media did to Kavanaugh was disgusting, and they should apologize.

That’s Just a Start

The above issues are the bare minimum that need to happen to begin to restore credibility to the corrupt media. There’s no reason to believe that they want to be taken seriously or as anything other than partisan activists who accomplished their desired political mission in how they treated Kavanaugh and Biden. (Or how they handled the conspiracy theory that Trump colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election. Or how they covered the 2016 election. Or how they’re covering the global pandemic.) But if they do, and if they want to be treated respectfully by those outside their political alliance, they must work on these issues.

They also must institute hiring and firing reforms, firing editors and reporters who perpetrate this sad state of affairs and hiring people who don’t share their groupthink, their political agenda, and their malicious capabilities.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/04/16/media-coverage-of-kavanaugh-was-criminal-heres-how-they-can-fix-it-going-forward/,2020-04-16
Biden's Foreign Policy Platform Is Woefully Inadequate To Today's Needs,"“He [President Trump] has launched ill-advised trade wars,” former Vice President and Democratic candidate Joe Biden writes, “against the United States’ friends and foes alike.” The essay, which outlined Biden’s foreign policy positions, came out in Foreign Affairs in December 2019, when Biden was behind both Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. Now that Sanders and the former mayor are out, and coronavirus is ravaging the planet, it is time to scrutinize Biden’s foreign policy positions and rethink some conventional wisdom.

The biggest questions about Biden’s argument will be about how to deal with China post-Wuhun virus. Biden writes, “There is no reason we should be falling behind China or anyone else when it comes to clean energy, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, 5G, high-speed rail, or the race to end cancer as we know it. We have the greatest research universities in the world.”

What Would Biden Do to Stop China?

He fails to mention what he will to do to stop China’s massive theft of intellectual property. It was under the Obama-Biden administration that China’s Office of Personnel Management hack happened, with no retaliation from the United States.

Biden acknowledges that China steals intellectual property, but argues the only way to stop China is to call out Chinese human rights violations and form a group of democracies. So, theoretically speaking, if the major part of the world does not follow the tenets of liberal democracy, Biden would rule out aligning with them against China. One can imagine how well that would work out.

Biden argues that American tech companies must not kowtow to China and must have free speech policies. That’s a good point. But one gets the feeling that Google’s support for China, NBC’s financial ties in China, and censorship against conservatives in American tech companies have not caught Biden’s attention.

How does Biden plan to compel American tech companies not to kowtow to China? The only way is to declare China a rival power and raise the cost of doing business in China through tariffs — something Biden is critiquing the Trump administration for doing. At a time 77 percent blame China for COVID-19, including more than two-thirds (67 percent) of Democrats, 71 percent say American companies should relocate manufacturing, 69 percent support Trump’s tougher trade war with China, and 54 percent say China should pay reparations, it appears Trump, not Biden, is more attuned with Americans on China.

Biden argues the United States should focus on climate change even more than we are, saying, “We will lock in enforceable commitments that will reduce emissions in global shipping and aviation, and we will pursue strong measures to make sure other nations can’t undercut the United States economically as we meet our own commitments. That includes insisting that China — the world’s largest emitter of carbon — stop subsidizing coal exports and outsourcing pollution to other countries by financing billions of dollars’ worth of dirty fossil fuel energy projects through its Belt and Road Initiative.”

There’s no way to either coerce China to be a green energy titan or ensure China is following proper green guidelines. In fact, Biden would kneecap American power, as giving up on fossil fuel and fracking would be like unilaterally disarming in a war. American power is predicated on American energy independence, and Biden wants to tie U.S. security to policies like the Paris climate accord. Given the recent example of China controlling the World Health Organization, that should ring alarm bells.

Biden Would Keep Wasting Resources in the Middle East

Getting the memo that Americans desire an end to interventions in the Middle East, Biden uses the catchphrases. “It is past time to end the forever wars, which have cost the United States untold blood and treasure.” But then he goes on to say that while he might want to bring back some troops, he would continue to focus on Afghanistan and the Middle East.

“As I have long argued, we should bring the vast majority of our troops home from the wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East and narrowly define our mission as defeating al Qaeda and the Islamic State.” Of course, that is not ending forever wars, as that would mean the policing missions would continue evermore.

Given that $6 trillion was wasted on building schools, hospitals, and roads in Afghanistan and Iraq, post-coronavirus Biden’s judgement about focusing on the Middle East and Afghanistan remains questionable. Six trillion dollars would have been useful during times of crisis like these, as 22 million Americans file for unemployment. There’s a reason true conservatives value conserving resources: times of crisis. Spending blood and treasure on radically reshaping feudal societies and imperial policing missions is the exact opposite of genuine conservatism.

Biden claims to be a restoration candidate, trying to take back the United States and the West to the glory days. Unfortunately, those days are over. A virus from China, which raged through the free-movement zone in Europe due to the corrupt incompetence of a global institution like the WHO, was the last and almost perfect nail in the post-Cold War liberal order’s coffin.

This is a changed world, where Biden’s ideas sound hollow and superficial. Foreign policy is his worst platform, and it would be criminal negligence not to question him on the challenges of the future, for which, according to his own words, he seems woefully ill-prepared.

Don’t Let Washington Post Memory-Hole Its Anti-Kavanaugh Campaign,"The Washington Post has a problem. The newspaper led the massive effort against the nomination of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by publishing and relentlessly hyping a completely unsubstantiated allegation of sexual assault against him.

Now, the paper is leading Democrats’ efforts to bury a similar, if stronger, allegation of sexual assault against Joe Biden. To accomplish this dramatic turnabout, the paper is collectively trying to rewrite history, pretending the allegation against Kavanaugh had more basis than it did while also pretending that the allegation against Biden has less basis than it does.

The Post’s anti-Kavanaugh operation had powerful divisions in both the news and opinion departments. It’s worth looking at both.

Oppositional From The Start

The Post greeted the announcement of Kavanaugh’s nomination with trademark hostility, but their task was made difficult by the relative lack of controversy around the man. An early Post effort to derail his nomination by reporting he used his credit card to pay for expensive season tickets to see the Washington Nationals before being reimbursed by his buddies led to mockery. Twitter users imagined other Kavanaugh “scandals” such as “He neglected to add the plus 4 zip codes on all his Christmas cards,” “Didn’t rewind a VHS before taking it back to Blockbuster,” and “Sources say that Kavanaugh once failed to turn off his brights for an oncoming vehicle.”

The Post’s reflexive and over-the-top hostility was even mocked by The Onion in their story, “Kavanaugh Nomination Falters after Washington Post Publishes Shocking Editorial Claiming He Forgot His Daughter’s Piano Recital.”

As Kavanaugh’s nomination seemed inevitable, the desperate paper dramatically rolled out and sympathetically handled an unsubstantiated allegation against Kavanaugh from Christine Blasey Ford. Although she never had any evidence in support of her allegation — in fact she didn’t even have evidence she had ever met Kavanaugh, much less that he had tried to rape her — the Post’s legitimizing of the claim set off one of American journalism’s most devastating feeding frenzies. Millions of Americans watched in horror as nearly every media outlet joined the Post in the effort not just to keep Kavanaugh off of the Supreme Court but to destroy the life and reputation of the married father of two young girls.

While the Post’s Emma Brown had been working with Blasey Ford since early July to help her craft a sympathetic telling of her allegation, she gave Kavanaugh just a couple of hours’ notice one Sunday morning that she was about to accuse him of being an attempted rapist when he was in high school.

The several-thousand-word story could not have been more sympathetic to Blasey Ford. It accepted Blasey Ford’s claims at face value, allowing the story to be spun as if it were true even though Blasey Ford had no evidence in support of it. All of the many problems with the story, such as that it kept changing and lacked evidence, were papered over by Brown and her editors.

A second story spun the fact that her family didn’t believe her as further evidence of her victimization. The resulting hagiographic profile was something any individual making unsubstantiated allegations could only dream of.

The Post Reverses Course For Biden

Compare the approach the Post took for Tara Reade’s allegation against her former employer, Biden. Far from breaking the story, the Post was finally forced to cover the allegation against Biden after a 19-day blackout when The New York Times ended their own blackout by finally covering it on Easter Sunday. (Easter Sunday is not known as a major news day, even when it doesn’t occur in the middle of a global pandemic.)

During the 19-day blackout, the Democratic nomination battle remained in full swing. Those who worry about collusion between the media and official Democratic leaders will not be comforted by the fact that The New York Times removed one of its only critical lines and tweets about Biden — the data point that many women have accused him of unwanted touching — at the request of the Biden campaign.

The Post’s Alice Crites was given the duty of burying the Reade story by conveying the information in as dry a manner as possible — the complete opposite of the riveting, sympathetic approach taken by Brown and her editors against Kavanaugh. The downplaying was so extreme, some of it had to be corrected.

From her first line to her last, Crites’s skepticism of Reade’s account is the main takeaway. Blasey Ford’s story changed significantly in the six or so years she told it, from saying it was a physical assault to saying it was a sexual assault, from not mentioning Kavanaugh at all to mentioning him explicitly, and from saying she was assaulted by a gang of four boys to saying that it was only four boys at the party but two in the room (she continued to give inconsistent accounts of how many people were at the party throughout 2018).

If they paid any attention to the inconsistencies, the Post gently attributed the shifting details, however implausibly, to a problem with therapist’s notes. When Reade’s story went from a claim of unwanted touching of the head and shoulders by Biden to an added claim that he also engaged in unwanted digital penetration of the vagina, that was presented in literally the first line of the story, the suggestion being that she was untrustworthy.

You may note that Blasey Ford’s lack of veracity was never a major story in the media, even when it was on national display. Blasey Ford’s claim to be afraid of flying was major news in the Democrats’ campaign to delay her testimony. During the televised hearing, it came out that she personally listed one of her hobbies as flying to remote islands over large expanses of water to surf. That changed story didn’t result in even a mention at the Post, much less the lead to a story. In fact, the media attacked people who merely noticed the false statement.

The bottom line is that after every major news outlet in America worked hard to validate Blasey Ford’s story, they were unable to. They found evidence that Kavanaugh was once a teenager, but nothing that supported her claim of attempted rape. Ever-more-ridiculous claims were put forth and accepted by the activist media, such as a client of Michael Avenatti’s allegation that Kavanaugh was the secret leader of a serial gang rape cartel that roamed the streets of suburban Maryland, a criminal mastermind so brilliant that he somehow evaded accountability even after six FBI checks.

Media like to pretend that they were at least skeptical of that claim, but don’t believe them. The Post, for example, didn’t just run with the claim from Avenatti’s client Julie Swetnick, they suggested the client had strong credibility. “The 55-year-old Web developer has held multiple security clearances for work on government-related networks,” was the subhed to their article. Those skeptical and critical of Swetnick’s patently ridiculous account were accused of “slut-shaming” by the Post.

While Blasey Ford’s claim was the least insane one put forth by activists and other Kavanaugh opponents, there were other problems with it beyond her failure to produce evidence she had ever met him. Her four named witnesses to the event all denied knowledge of it, some vociferously so.

Even her lifelong friend Leland Keyser, who worked very hard to come up with anything, came to doubt her friend’s story entirely. And when she refused to say otherwise, mutual acquaintances tried to get her to change her story. Some U.S. senators thought the witness tampering so egregious that it should be prosecuted.

Compare that situation to Reade’s. Whatever else you might say of her allegation, Reade at least has evidence that she met Biden, having worked for him in 1993. And she has evidence that she told three people about the alleged attack at the time she claims it happened in 1993. Blasey Ford was believed even though she never said a word of any attack for 30 years, never mentioned Kavanaugh for several more years, and couldn’t get any of her named witnesses to corroborate her account.

Ruth Marcus’ Special Problem

Some media outlets, such as CNN, have instituted a strict ban on even mentioning the sexual assault allegation against Biden, even though they published 705 stories about Blasey Ford.

But some of the biggest anti-Kavanaugh partisans can’t quite get away with that level of hypocrisy on account of how public their support was of the “Believe All Women” mantra that was deployed against Kavanaugh despite the lack of evidence. Michelle Goldberg at The New York Times admitted the lack of evidence against Kavanaugh but nevertheless wrote articles about how “this scandal has given us an X-ray view of the rotten foundations of elite male power.”

She assured her liberal readers that there was no need to believe Reade because Reade, a Bernie Sanders supporter, had political views she disagreed with. No mention was made of the videotaped admission from Debra Katz, Blasey Ford’s attorney, that her client’s motivation was political and revolved around her extreme support of abortion. That political motivation was no barrier for those who shared it when defaming Kavanaugh.

Washington Post deputy editorial page editor Ruth Marcus fits into this general category. She led the Post’s opinion page attacks on Kavanaugh. Marcus wrote a book on the Kavanaugh confirmation and I co-wrote a book with Carrie Severino on the confirmation.

Our book, “Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court,” was a No. 1 national best-seller based on interviews of more than 100 of the key players — at the White House, Senate, Court, and outside groups — in the confirmation battle. Many of our sources told us in lengthy interviews they refused to speak with Marcus on account of how unfairly they believed the Post editorial page treated Kavanaugh supporters during the confirmation battle.

Marcus is an unabashed liberal. She writes articles asserting that Trump staffers should quit to “save their souls.” Speaking of souls, not only does she believe that unborn children with Down syndrome should be killed, she has publicly said she would have done so herself if given the opportunity. It is an extreme understatement to say she shares — if not exceeds — Blasey Ford’s abortion motivation.

Around the time her book came out last December, she wrote, “If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. If, like me, all you’ve done for the past year is research and write a book about Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, everything has a tendency to look like a Kavanaugh replay.” Four months have done wonders on Marcus, as now that a nominee for a prominent position has been accused of sexual assault, it doesn’t look to her like a Kavanaugh replay at all. Fancy that!

Even before the accusations against Kavanaugh were public, Marcus was so invested in battling him that she was coaching Democratic senators on how to fight him. After the testimony was reopened, she was pushing Democratic messaging about the need to delay the confirmation vote at least another week.

Between those articles, she argued that even though Blasey Ford had no evidence in support of her allegation, a full FBI investigation must be launched. (She does not believe an investigation of Reade’s accusation of a more recent event is necessary.)

One of her reasons was that the allegations against Kavanaugh — attempted rape — were more serious than those against Clarence Thomas, who was accused without evidence of sexual harassment. (She does not seem particularly concerned that the allegation against Biden — penetration of the vagina with fingers — is more serious than those against Kavanaugh or Thomas.) Admitting there was no corroboration for Ford’s story, although she believed it in any case, she thought that forcing Kavanaugh to answer questions about it would help clarify some issues. (She does not think any such abasement is necessary for Biden.)

“We need the fullest possible airing of the accusation against Brett Kavanaugh,” Marcus argued on September 15, 2018. In this article, Marcus regurgitated every unsubstantiated claim made against Kavanaugh, despite the complete lack of evidence. She also revealed that she also believed Anita Hill, who also argued without evidence that Thomas had harassed her.

In Hill’s claim, also levied against an employer, her testimony was contradicted by evidence and testimony. Her colleagues said that if anyone harassed another, the direction was the opposite from what Hill had claimed. She claimed that Thomas relentlessly called her. Phone records showed the opposite. FBI agents reported that her story kept changing. That Marcus found herself on Hill’s side of the Thomas dispute, but not on Reade’s side in the Biden’s dispute, is telling.

Once Kavanaugh and Blasey Ford had testified, Marcus was even more convinced, despite the lack of any evidence in support of Blasey Ford’s claim and the new evidence in support of Kavanaugh’s denial in the form of contemporaneous calendars he kept of the summer in question. “Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony was devastating,” Marcus opined. In this article, she conceded the faulty memory and other problems displayed by Blasey Ford, but nevertheless Marcus had an emotional reaction to the testimony in her favor.

Marcus also wrote the Washington Post classic, “Does it matter what Kavanaugh did in high school? Well, yes.” In this article she attempted to justify the unseemly poring over of teenage jokes in yearbooks and other invasions of a former high schooler’s adolescence. Yet with Biden, who was accused of sexual assault dating to his time as a U.S. Senator when he was in his 50s, Marcus sees no benefit from investigating the matter.

Disposing Of Reade

This brings us, finally, to Marcus’s public disposal of the Reade allegation. It is absolutely stunning. It would be hilarious, if it weren’t so despicable what she and her colleagues did to Kavanaugh’s life.

She concedes that Reade’s allegation of sexual assault is “difficult and important,” particularly for those who believed Blasey Ford. She says she “concluded” in her book that Blasey Ford was telling the truth that Kavanaugh was an attempted rapist. She echoes Blasey Ford and Katz’s demand that Kavanaugh must forever defamed with an “asterisk” next to his name.

Nevertheless, she says she’s going to make a “good-faith effort to grapple with the seriousness of, and flaws in, the Reade allegations.” She asserts, without evidence and in contradiction of evidence, that Ford’s allegations are “on balance stronger” and simply doesn’t believe that what Reade claimed happened, happened.

Marcus, who supported Hill, Blasey Ford, and Swetnick — but not former Democratic Sen. Al Franken’s accusers — says that it’s important to note that everyone suffers from biases, that outrage only over misbehavior by those with ideological differences is hypocritical, and skepticism about accusations only when made against those whose politics you share is intellectually dishonest.

With that performative throat clearing out of the way, Marcus sets out to defend Biden and disparage Reade. It turns out #BelieveAllWomen, the metric the Post and other media outlets used to convict Kavanaugh with no evidence, is now “a dumb hashtag and a dumber approach to inevitably complex, fact-bound situations.”

Marcus admits Reade has support for her claim that Blasey Ford never had. Reade told her mother, her brother, and a friend. Reade says she filed a complaint with Senate officials and complained to Biden’s staff, but Marcus doubts that. Nevertheless, she admits, “the contemporaneous evidence is inconclusive but stronger than that in the Kavanaugh case.” She quickly explains that this is no surprise, since Blasey Ford already admitted she never told anyone anything for several decades.

Marcus says Reade’s failure to share therapist notes with the Post is sketchy since Ford made her therapist notes available “to reporters.” That’s not quite right. Even with the friendliest reporters imaginable, Blasey Ford allowed only a select portion of the relevant notes, according to the friendly reporters themselves.

As for Blasey Ford, under oath she testified that she didn’t remember whether she showed Brown the therapist’s notes or her own summary of the notes. In either case, she flat-out refused to provide those notes to Senate investigators, even while claiming she wanted a full investigation.

Telling Lies to Help Blasey Ford’s Claim

Marcus notes that Reade’s account shifted from a claim of unwanted touching to extremely unwanted penetration. She falsely states that Blasey Ford’s story “did not change over time.” As mentioned above, it did.

From Rachel Mitchell’s report to senators of Blasey Ford’s own testimony, we also are reminded that, “Dr. Ford has not offered a consistent account of when the alleged assault happened.” First she said “mid 1980s,” then “early 80s,” then “high school summer in early 80s,” then she crossed out the word “early,” then summer of 1982, then in her “late teens,” then when she was 15. She failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe.

We are also reminded in that Senate report that “Dr. Ford has struggled to identify Judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name,” according to marriage therapy notes and individual therapy notes, and never before Kavanaugh was a nationally known figure. The Senate report notes that Blasey Ford “changed her description of the incident to become less specific,” “has no memory of key details of the night in question” that could help corroborate her account, “has not been corroborated by anyone she identified as having attended—including her lifelong friend,” “has not offered a consistent account of the alleged assault,” “has struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations, and her testimony regarding recent events raises further questions about her memory,” her “explanation of why she disclosed her allegations the way she did raises questions,” her “description of the psychological impact of the event raises questions,” “Her account of who was at the party has been inconsistent,” and many other problems.

Whereas Blasey Ford’s delayed disclosures and changing details were not a problem for Marcus, Reade’s “shifting account introduces a confusing element.” She wonders — but only of Reade — why her story shifted and why she hasn’t explained that shift.

Marcus questions Reade’s motivation on account of her support of Sanders’ candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president. Blasey Ford’s liberal political motivation was well known by those we interviewed for our book. They told us how she scrubbed her “crazy liberal” social media posts before going public. The one public item about her related to participation in a pussy-hat protest of some kind. Her family talked with friends about her political motivation and strong support of abortion. Her attorney admitted that motivation on videotape.

Of this well-known and obvious political agenda from Blasey Ford, Marcus writes, “The credibility question is the biggest hurdle for me with Reade. Ford did not strike me as a person who was coming forward because of political motivations or because she wanted publicity — anything but. Reade seems a much different and less reliable figure.” It would be hilarious if it were not so dangerous.

Marcus admits that Biden has had many women accuse him of unwanted touching but suggests, again without evidence, that Kavanaugh had problematic behavior toward women. As someone who interviewed ex-girlfriends and acquaintances of him, I know that’s simply not true.

It is true that Blasey Ford accused him of attempted rape. It is also true she has no evidence she ever met him. It is true that a classmate at Yale began to think, but can’t be sure, that Kavanaugh may have been at a party where something — she’s not sure what, exactly — happened. Such a charge doesn’t deserve comment, although other liberal reporters wrote an entire book about it.

Like Marcus, their “gut feeling” about Kavanaugh was that he was an attempted rapist. Like Marcus, they’re not concerned by Reade’s allegation. And it is true that Trump critics put forth Swetnick to allege Kavanaugh was the leader of a serial gang rape cartel and various other similarly unsubstantiated claims about a nationwide rape spree. As for those false claims, Marcus thought he reacted too negatively to the charges.

Finally, Marcus ends her unconvincing tap dance with a claim that other people are the real hypocrites. “Those who disbelieved and diminished Christine Blasey Ford face the challenge of explaining why they seem so much more eager to credit Tara Reade’s account.”

Well, whether it’s Joe Biden or Brett Kavanaugh, both men deserve due process. Noting that Tara Reade at least has benefit of evidence that she has met the accused and contemporaneous corroboration of her claim makes her allegation stronger, but stronger than nothing is admittedly a low bar.

Ruth Marcus and others at the Washington Post who led the effort to destroy Brett Kavanaugh’s life based on unsubstantiated allegations know that what they did was evil. They may try to rewrite history to make it seem that Blasey Ford had evidence in support of her claim. They may try to rewrite history to make themselves feel better. They can dig as furiously as they want, but there is no memory hole deep enough to forget their behavior.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/04/20/dont-let-washington-post-get-away-with-memory-holing-its-anti-kavanaugh-campaign/,2020-04-20
Evaluating Tara Reade’s Sexual Assault Allegation Against Joe Biden,"It is critical to compare the media’s coverage of Tara Reade to its coverage of Christine Blasey Ford. It’s critical to do the same for the left’s treatment of both, even extending the comparison to Democrats’ treatment of men like former Sen. Al Franken. These parallels are instructive. They reveal dangerous hypocrisy. They are not, however, helpful in adjudicating Joe Biden’s guilt.

The way such actors collectively processed Ford’s allegation was wrong. With much more corroborating evidence, Reade’s allegation clears the standard of credibility the media and the left applied to Ford, even though they’ve shifted that same standard for Biden’s accuser. But that standard is much too low and should not be used to fairly weigh Reade’s allegation.

Here, the media and the left are running into a problem of their own creation. It’s tough to know exactly what did or did not transpire between Biden and Reade in 1993. They’re now bumping into that inconvenient reality, despite failing to acknowledge it when the political outcome was more favorable.

Of course, since Me Too’s genesis in 2017, we’ve all had to learn to adjudicate guilt in situations like these, where the court of public opinion necessarily replaces the court of law and disturbing allegations against powerful men stem from incidents years in the past. The process should be better now than it was in 2017 and 2018, because we should be learning from our mistakes. That doesn’t make it a cinch.

The Allegation

Reade’s allegation is highly descriptive. She has been visibly distraught when recounting aspects of her story, which accuses a married Biden of pushing her against a wall, kissing her, and forcibly penetrating her with his fingers under her skirt. We know she worked for Biden. We know her last month working in his Senate office fits the timeframe she’s provided. We know Biden has a record of overstepping physical boundaries with women, in line with Reade’s 2019 allegations of inappropriate touching against him.

Most importantly, evidence corroborates her claim that she told others at the time. Reade’s brother and a friend have both confirmed to media outlets that she mentioned the alleged assault after it occurred in 1993. (Her brother did, however, follow up with the Washington Post days after his initial interview to clarify he remembered the sexual assault, not just inappropriate touching.)

A former neighbor who supports Biden’s White House bid has stepped forward to say Reade told her about the assault in the mid-’90s as well, with the same basic story by which she stands now. Another woman with whom Reade worked in the mid-’90s says Reade told her “she had been sexually harassed by her former boss while she was in D.C., and as a result of her voicing her concerns to her supervisors, she was let go, fired.”

We also know that Reade, now 56, told the media her mother called into “Larry King Live” about the incident after it happened, and that The Intercept and the Media Research Center were subsequently able to verify this by finding the transcript and video clip respectively.

So what we know with near certainty is that Reade told friends and family that Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993. What we do not know is whether she was truthful at the time. Given that Reade didn’t seem to go to the press (her mother specifically asked King how to resolve the issue without going to the press), it’s difficult to know what her incentive for lying only to her own friends and family might have been.

Questions Remain

Still, there are elements of her story that raise questions. Biden, of course, has denied the allegation through his campaign. Reade does not remember the date or exact location of the assault, but claims it occurred in a “side area” which she has described as “semiprivate” and “not completely private,” somewhere in the Russell building or Capitol. Assaulting a staffer and committing adultery outside a private room in the bustling complex seems like an enormously stupid risk, even beyond the risk of committing a crime or cheating on your wife that powerful men sometimes take.

Biden is also not dogged by a pattern of allegations involving forcible penetration. No record of a serious allegation on this level exists against him. That is not, of course, to argue nothing similar ever happened, but after the wave of Me Too scrutiny against our elite class, and news cycles about Biden’s inappropriate touching, if this behavior were a pattern, it’s likely more allegations would have surfaced. No, he doesn’t have to have a pattern of assault to have assaulted Reade. But men guilty of this sort of behavior typically do.

Three of the Biden aides Reade claims to have complained of harassment to in 1993 strongly deny knowledge of such a complaint. If they took no action to address Reade’s complaints, they would have incentives to protect themselves and the Democratic nominee. On the other hand, Reade believes a record of a complaint she filed with a Senate personnel office exists in Biden’s Senate archive, housed at the University of Delaware and sealed until two years after his exit from public life.

It would thus be unwise for the aides to issue vigorous denials if such a record does exist, and Reade is aggressively demanding the school unseal its documents. The university is refusing to disclose the terms of its two-year agreement with Biden.

While Reade’s past praise of Vladimir Putin is certainly unusual, to suspect it has any connection with her allegation, of which we have corroborating video evidence from 1993, requires buying into a very deep conspiracy.

Reade accused Biden of inappropriately touching her neck and hair in media interviews last year, but stopped much short of telling the story she’s telling now. Reade says she feared retribution at the time. In fairness, the potential consequences for stepping forward to share allegations of inappropriate touching against a presidential candidate—allegations other women are making—and stepping forward to share an allegation of forcible penetration against a presidential nominee are obviously different.

The timing of her new media interviews is interesting as well, but there’s also a record of Reade trying to get 2020 Democrats’ attention on Twitter before the primary narrowed to Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, who she has supported. Reade also claims to have contacted the presidential campaigns of Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren with information about Biden, both of which declined to pursue an investigation into her story. Neither senator’s office returned The Federalist’s request for comment on whether they were made aware of Reade’s effort to contact them.

What to Do Next?

If Reade is telling the truth, she is the victim of a terrible attack. Her bravery in stepping forward would also be exposing a deep moral flaw in a man running to be president. But so long as the only two people involved in the alleged incident insist on different stories, we will never be able to assess the veracity of Reade’s claims with certainty.

That means it’s now up to voters to weigh the evidence, determine who they believe, determine whether there’s even a way to do that with reasonable confidence, and then determine whether Biden’s alleged conduct is disqualifying. For those who determine the story is credible and the behavior is disqualifying, supporters of the president should also review such allegations against him, and then confront the deeply unpleasant matter of deciding how to vote.

What we have is a 27-year-old allegation of sexual assault and adultery against the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee for president. Nobody knows what happened except Biden and Reade. Based on available evidence, we can at least be nearly certain Reade’s story has been consistent since 1993. That gives her credibility, enough credibility that Biden needs to address the allegation personally.

Comparing Reade’s allegation with Ford’s does, indeed, produce a clearcut case study in hypocrisy on the part of the media and the left. There is much to be said on that point. But it’s entirely secondary to the real matter at hand, which is whether Joe Biden sexually assaulted Tara Reade. Coming to a reasonable conclusion on that question should be everyone’s first priority. Hearing from Biden himself is the next big step.

"Joe Biden Might Not Be Guilty, But Corporate Media Is","Joe Biden might not be guilty. But the corporate media is.

Here’s what we know. We know Tara Reade alleges that in 1993 her boss, Sen. Joe Biden, sexually assaulted her, and we know that five people have thus far corroborated that she told them about this at the time. We know that, and we know that Vice President Biden denies committing sexual assault, and further, denies his office even received a complaint.

Next, we know that Reade has demanded Biden open his sealed Senate records, which should contain a report if one was filed, and that Biden has thus far refused.

Finally, we know that the corporate media ignored and manipulated this story for weeks and that some still remain silent on it. Just Wednesday morning, one popular Washington newsletter got to the subject after 14 more important stories, choosing to characterize it as “The Story That’s Not Going Away.”

It’s a difficult spot for corporate media to be in. For months, liberal guests, anchors, and reporters at CNN, MSNBC, CBS, NBC, ABC, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and elsewhere propped up Biden’s candidacy against Sen. Bernie Sanders. With a baggage train that stretches to Beijing, and well into a public cognitive decline, he was not the ideal Democratic candidate.

He didn’t embody youth, he wasn’t black, and he’s wasn’t a woman for three, but he also wasn’t gay, broke, or deeply unlikable. Finally, he wasn’t a communist. Or to sum it all up, he seemed the safest bet.

Or was he? Shortly after Sanders was defeated and all declared well, it began to unravel, first with strange interview after strange interview, and then boom: With a five-times corroborated sexual assault allegation. Tough to ignore, right? You’d think so. But maybe not.

The Washington Post interviewed Reade shortly after she made her first, less serious allegation of uncomfortable touching in an essay in April 2019, but didn’t publish the interview. In March 2020, Reade went public with accusations of sexual assault, but still nothing from the Post. The Post did eventually publish — after The New York Times ran a story on the accusations, which was almost three weeks after she went public. The Times editor in chief then admitted the paper quietly edited its story under pressure from the Biden campaign.

A Washington Free Beacon review of all 10 interviews with the vice president in the three weeks after the accusation found nary a question on the charge. On April 16, 24 days after the allegation, a CBS reporter asked Sanders what he thought, but even then couched the question, asking about Sanders ally Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez saying “she thinks its legitimate and relevant to talk about sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden.”

“Do you agree?”

Biden had yet to face one direct question.

It was still another day before CNN reported on the story at all, couching their coverage as “Democrats [grappling] with questions” about the accusation.

On Sunday, not a single morning show mentioned the news. On Monday, The Washington Post’s story was titled, “Trump allies highlight new claims regarding allegations against Biden.” By Tuesday, five weeks into the story, a Media Research Center analysis found 24-hour news network CNN had spent shy of 15 minutes on the story, PBS had spent seven minutes, MSNBC had spent less than five minutes, CBS had spent one minute, and NBC and ABC, zero seconds.

Five weeks and 19 interviews later, Biden has not been asked.

The coverage stands in stark, vivid, bloody contrast with the corporate media’s crucifixion of Justice Brett Kavanaugh — a man accused by two women, one of whom could not prove she’d ever met the judge, and the other, whose accusations were not corroborated by a single source.

In the 12 days after Kavanaugh’s first accuser was revealed, ABC, CBS, and NBC spent nearly six hours on the story, and CNN and MSNBC declared him guilty. The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway chronicled the differences in coverage exhaustively here.

There’s a lesson in this contrast. The corporate news media doesn’t care about women, nor truth. They care about ruling and will sacrifice any offering that gets them closer to it. Victims of sexual assault both real and imagined, they’re just bodies on the altar — unless the accused is in a protected class. Eat your hearts out, Aztecs.

It’s not just Biden and Kavanaugh. It’s the reason anchors, reporters, and executives at nearly every corporate channel, newspaper, and even NPR have been accused of sexual harassment, assault, or rape over the past five years, but only Roger Ailes is the subject of a miniseries and a feature film.

Sexual assault is serious business. It shames victims, destroys families, and ruin lives. Unfortunately, for too many in politics and the corporate media, sexual assault is serious business as usual.

Joe Biden might not be guilty. But the corporate media damn well is.

Biden Lies About Past Approach To Kavanaugh While Denying Charges,"Former Vice President Joe Biden denied allegations of a 1993 sexual assault Friday, while also misrepresenting his past statements related to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford.

“No, it is not true. I’m saying unequivocally it never, never happened. And it didn’t. It never happened,” Biden told Mika Brzezinski on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” of the charges from former Senate staff assistant Tara Reade.

The presumptive 2020 Democratic nominee was then pushed on past comments on sexual misconduct from himself and prominent supporters, including former Georgia State Rep. Stacey Abrams who is reportedly under serious consideration to be on the Democratic ticket this fall.

“Stacey Abrams said during the Kavanaugh hearings ‘I believe women. I believe survivors of assault should be supported and their voices heard… Are women to be believed unless it pertains to you?” asked Mika Brzezinski.

“Women are to be believed given the benefit of the doubt. If they come forward and say something that they said happen to them, they should start off with the presumption they are telling the truth,” Biden said.

“Do you regret what you said during the Kavanaugh hearing?” Brzezinski followed up.

“What I said during the Kavanaugh hearings was that she had the right to be heard. The fact that she came forward, the presumption would be that she was telling the truth unless she wasn’t telling the truth,” Biden said.

""Do you regret what you said during the Kavanaugh hearing?"" Joe Biden: ""What I said during the Kavanaugh hearings was that she had a right to be heard. The fact that she came forward, the presumption would be that she was telling the truth unless she wasn't telling the truth."" pic.twitter.com/ZkG6rf281b — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) May 1, 2020

Only that’s not what Biden said just a year and a half ago.

Ford, Biden said, “should be given the benefit of the doubt,” and stated, “for a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you’ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she’s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets the facts.” He praised Ford’s testimony in the Senate as “courageous, credible, and powerful.”

These have shown to be empty words for Reade however, whose story at this point has remained consistent and far more credible than the 30-year-old rape allegations from Ford in 2018. Though, Biden’s comments at the Iowa State Fair last year when he shouted “we choose truth over facts” appear consistent with his approach to Ford’s accusations.

On MSNBC, his concept of truth seemed to change when pressed by Brzezinski. “Why is it real for Dr. Ford, but not for Tara Reade?” she asked.

“They should come forward. They should be heard, and then they should be investigated,” Biden said. “And if there is anything that makes it, that is consistent with what’s being said…and the case is made, then it should be believed. But ultimately, the truth matters,” Biden said.

Biden is just as guilty as the rest of the Democratic Party in exposing a glaring double-standard when it comes to allegations of sexual misconduct, propping up unsubstantiated claims presented by Ford while ignoring far more credible accusations from Reade.

At this point, Reade’s story has been corroborated by multiple witnesses and a transcript of a 1993 tape of CNN’s “Larry King Live” that offer a consistent story of Reade’s description of events.

Ford on the other hand, was unable to prove that she and Kavanaugh had ever even met, let alone provide a single witness to support her claims. Her lifelong friend, Leland Keyser, who Ford named as a witness, was unable to offer credence to Ford’s claims.

Ford however, because her charges were slated to derail a conservative Supreme Court confirmation, was given far more legitimacy to her accusations from Democrats and legacy media than the evidence afforded. Contrast that with the media treatment of Reade, where women’s groups have become silent, Democrats have remained silent, prominent figures in the Me Too Movement have become silent, the media has taken far longer to even pay attention to Biden’s accuser, and the silence has become deafening. According to a media analysis from the Daily Caller, Friday’s MSNBC interview was the first time Biden was asked about Reade in the 37 days that she came public with her claims.

Despite the hypocrisy, there remain important reasons to remain skeptical of Reade’s charges against Biden. Reade says she filed a formal complaint to her supervisors in the Senate office that led to her termination which would lead a hard paper trail, but several Biden Senate staffers have denied knowledge of the complaint, and the paperwork is yet to be seen. Reade is also unable to pinpoint the data and location of the alleged incident, just that it occurred in a congressional hallway.

The presumption of innocence was a standard that was unfortunately not offered to Kavanaugh, but it must be upheld for Biden.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/01/biden-denies-tara-reade-allegations-lies-about-past-comments-on-christine-blasey-ford/,2020-05-01
Potential VP Picks Thirsty For Higher Office Overlook Biden Sexual Assault Allegations,"Democrats are descending into disarray as their presumptive presidential nominee battles allegations of sexual assault far more credible than anything ever thrown at Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose unsubstantiated allegations prompted calls for the Justice’s nomination to be withdrawn and subsequent pleas for impeachment.

In March, former Biden Senate staffer, Tara Reade, came public with accusations that the former vice president forcibly kissed her and penetrated her with his fingers in a congressional hallway in 1993. Since coming forward, Reade’s story has been corroborated by multiple witnesses, and a 1993 tape of CNN’s “Larry King Live” where her mother called into the program that matches Reade’s description of events more than 25 years ago.

Biden denied the accusations during an interview with MSNBC on Friday, marking the first time reporters have actually confronted the former vice president on the charges after more than a month that the claims were made.

Until recently, most Democrats had remained silent as their presidential candidate faces the accusations of sexual misconduct mirroring charges that have come to define the era of the Me Too movement, despite having propped up uncorroborated claims from Christine Blasey Ford to derail Kavanaugh’s path to the Supreme Court and in turn, destroying the man himself.

Ford, who was never able to even prove that the two had ever met let alone produce a single witness to support her story, was heralded by #BelieveSurvivors women’s groups, legacy media, and Democrats as a hero for women while remaining deafeningly silent when it comes to far more credible charges against one of their own.

As Biden searches for a running mate amid the accusations, here’s what the same people who praised Ford’s testimony are saying about Reade so not to spoil their chances in the veepstakes:

Stacey Abrams

Abrams is taking a break from her imaginary duties as governor of Georgia to break from tradition by publicly campaigning for the number two spot.

After Biden finally addressed the allegations head on, Abrams came out with a lackluster statement paling in comparison to what she said about Ford.

“I am pleased that the Vice President directly addressed these allegations and by how he addressed them. Women and all people should be heard, and they deserve a safe space and process through which they can come forward,” Abrams said.

On Tuesday, Abrams offered a more passionate defense on CNN.

“I believe Joe Biden,” Abrams said. “I believe that he is a person who has demonstrated his love of family, of our community, has been made perfectly clear through his work as a congressional leader and as an American leader. I know Joe Biden and I think he’s telling the truth and this did not happen.”

That’s a sharp turnaround from when Abrams said “I believe women,” in 2018.

After the courageous and compelling testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford yesterday, it is shameful that Kavanaugh's nomination is being rushed forward. I believe women, and I believe survivors of violence always deserve to be supported and to have their voices heard. https://t.co/rtT1PQr4Zq — Stacey Abrams (@staceyabrams) September 28, 2018

Kamala Harris

California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris fared no better in the sweepstakes of Me Too hypocrisy to land a top spot on the Democratic ticket.

“I believe her,” Harris said of Ford’s allegations in 2018. “Anybody who comes forward at this point to be prepared to testify in the United States Senate against someone who’s being nominated to one of the most powerful positions in the United States government, that takes an extraordinary amount of courage.”

According to Harris, simply testifying before Congress should make any allegations inherently truthful, no matter the evidence. Let’s not forget that Harris used to be the attorney general of California.

After the Senate confirmation hearings, Harris said her biggest fear was “that there will be people who will decide that if they speak out it doesn’t matter, and will feel deflated by what happened in a way that causes them to recede.”

But now, Harris is coming to Biden’s defense.

“The Joe Biden I know is somebody who really has fought for women and empowerment of women and for women’s equality and rights,” Harris told the San Francisco Chronicle last month. This is the same senator who also called for Kavanaugh’s impeachment on the one year anniversary of Ford’s testimony.

“If we want to live in a country where women are believed and given access to the justice they deserve, we must roll up our sleeves and get to work holding our leaders accountable,” Harris wrote in Elle Magazine.

Meanwhile, Reade said on The Hill’s “Rising” she had approached the California senator’s campaign with her allegations, but was ignored.

Elizabeth Warren

Another top contender in the vice presidential veepstakes, Massachusetts Sen. Warren joined Harris in calls to impeach Kavanaugh a year after Ford’s Senate testimony and is no less guilty of employing a blatant double-standard when it comes to the charges brought against Biden, where Warren has said zilch.

I still believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. And like the man who appointed him, Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 28, 2019

Reade also says she was ignored by the Warren campaign prior to going public with her story.

Amy Klobuchar

Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar was insistent on an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s alleged history of abuse against Ford, but now that she’s in the running for vice president, a rushed inconclusive New York Times investigation seems to have done the trick.

“I agree with Vice President Biden about this, that all women in these cases have the right to be heard and have their claims reviewed,” Klobuchar said. “And in this case…there was a thorough review by the New York Times. And I think that’s very important to have, especially involving public figures.”

If Klobuchar wasn’t blinded by partisan self-interest, maybe she’d be fighting just as hard for an FBI investigation of Reade’s claims.

“They’re afraid of what they’re going to find out,” Klobuchar scoffed at a potential federal probe into Kavanaugh’s passed conduct.

Of course, the FBI investigation that eventually took place in 2018 exonerated Kavanaugh.

Gretchen Whitmer

A newcomer to the national spotlight for implementing the strictest state lockdowns in the entire country, Whitmer is now on the shortlist having skipped the Democratic primary to be considered as Biden’s running mate.

Whitmer, while she was less of a national figure a year and a half ago, still made it clear where she stood on the allegations lodged against Kavanaugh.

I believe Dr. Ford — Governor Gretchen Whitmer (@GovWhitmer) September 27, 2018

Now Whitmer, eyeing a place on the ticket, is rejecting the idea that Reade’s accusations bear any kind of credibility.

“The Joe Biden I know, these stories are inconsistent with what I know and what I’ve seen, in terms of work that he’s done to support women,” Whitmer told ABC.

Nancy Pelosi

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi officially gave Biden her endorsement on Thursday and told CNN on Tuesday she was “satisfied” with Biden’s silence over Reade.

While not on the list of potential running mates, Pelosi’s hypocrisy is worth the scrutiny.

“Well I have great sympathy for any women who brings forth an allegation. I’m a big strong supporter of the Me Too Movement. I think it’s been a great contribution to our country,” Pelosi said. “I do support Joe Biden. I’m satisfied with how he responded. I know him, I was proud to endorse him on Monday… So I’m satisfied with that.”

In 2018 however, Pelosi described Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the nation’s highest court as “a profoundly heartbreaking day for women, girls, and families.”

“Courageous women risked their safety and well-being to speak truth about this nomination,” Pelosi said in a statement on the day of Kavanaugh’ confirmation.

Here’s the rest of what Pelosi had to say that day, emphasis ours:

Tens of thousands more joined them to share their own harrowing stories of sexual assault, at great personal risk. Yet, Senate Republicans chose to send a clear message to all women: do not speak out, and if you do – do not expect to be heard, believed, or respected.

Unless you’re accusing someone with the best chance at ousting President Donald Trump of course, Pelosi promises you.

Hillary Clinton

Hillary Clinton has no interest in being vice president, but her notable absence on the issue still speaks volumes.

Clinton endorsed Biden on Tuesday, telling her former colleague in the Obama administration that he had her full support without making one mention of the new developments in the Reade allegations to come the day before when two women came forward to corroborate Reade’s claims.

“I am thrilled to be part of your campaign,” Clinton said.

Meanwhile, here’s this gem from 2015:

Hillary to every survivor of sexual assault: You have the right to be heard and believed. We're with you.https://t.co/HPJ2gPPwMs — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 15, 2015

And in 2018, Clinton said Reade ought to have the “benefit of the doubt” over unsourced rape accusations.

Biden’s 'Medicare At 60' Shows Democrats’ Lust For Socialized Medicine,"The day after socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., suspended his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, presumptive nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden announced his support for a smaller version of Sanders’ signature single-payer proposal. In a Medium post, Biden said he had “directed [his] team to develop a plan to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60.”

As with many Democratic plans, the proposal sounds like a moderate option. After all, near-seniors will join Medicare soon enough, so how much harm would this plan cause?

But viewed from another perspective, Biden’s proposal looks like a major step toward Sanders’s goal of a government-run health care system. As a way to reduce the number of uninsured, the idea seems like a solution in search of a problem. But as a method to replace private coverage with government-run health care, the Biden plan could accomplish its goals effectively.

Most Eligible People Already Have Coverage

The consulting firm Avalere Health, founded by a Democrat and with liberal leanings, recently released an analysis indicating nearly 23 million people may qualify for coverage under the Biden proposal. But the firm’s headline cleverly attempted to bury the lede, obscuring the fact that the vast majority of eligible people already have health insurance.

As the below graph shows, Avalere found only 7 percent, or 1.7 million, of the 22.7 million people potentially eligible for the Biden proposal lack coverage. The majority of the 60-64 population (13.4 million, or 59 percent) obtain coverage not from government, but from their current or former employer.

Composition of Individuals Newly Eligible for Medicare Under Biden Proposal, Ages 60–64, 2018

The Avalere analysis more accurately depicts how 16.6 million people (13.4 million with employer coverage and 3.2 million with individual plans) could lose their existing private coverage. It also demonstrates how taxpayers could face major costs — particularly if people with private insurance drop that coverage and join the Biden Medicare plan — to reduce the uninsured population by a comparatively small amount.

Near-Retirees Are Comparatively Wealthy

Biden didn’t say how he would structure his proposal to allow people to buy into Medicare at age 60. But he did imply that enrolled individuals would receive some type of federal subsidy when he stated, “Any new federal cost associated with this option would be financed out of general revenues to protect the Medicare trust fund.”

Here again, many near-retirees, in the peak years of their earning potential, don’t need federal subsidies for health insurance. Various surveys show the median household income of near-retirees ranges between $85,000 and over $90,000.

At that income level, even those people who have to pay their entire insurance premiums — Obamacare Exchange policies can easily exceed $1,000 per month for the 60-64 population — could do so without a subsidy. Indeed, a family of three making $86,880 in 2020 would not qualify for any subsidy under the present regime, although Biden’s original health care plan calls for increasing the richness of the Obamacare subsidies.

‘Medicare at 60’ Is a Slingshot to Single-Payer

If Biden’s “Medicare at 60” proposal wouldn’t significantly reduce the number of uninsured — it wouldn’t — and wouldn’t lower costs for people who can’t afford coverage — the comparatively small number of uninsured among people ages 60-64 demonstrates the fallacy of that proposition — then why did Biden propose it in the first place?

Apart from serving as an obvious political sop to the Sanders crowd, the Biden “Medicare at 60” proposal would function as a major cost-shift. By and large, it wouldn’t help the previously uninsured obtain coverage nearly as much as it would use federal dollars to supplant funds already spent by the private sector (whether individuals or their employers).

By doing so, it would build the culture of dependence that represents the left’s ultimate aim: crowding out private insurance and private spending, and putting more people on the government rolls. That Biden would propose a plan so obviously centered around that objective shows he doesn’t fundamentally disagree with Sanders’s single-payer plan at all. He just doesn’t want to disclose his intentions before bringing socialized medicine to the American health-care system.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/05/joe-bidens-medicare-at-60-plan-shows-democrats-lust-for-socialized-medicine/,2020-05-05
Full Transcript: Megyn Kelly’s Interview With Tara Reade,"Tara Reade defended her sexual assault allegation against former Vice President Joe Biden in an extensive sit-down interview with Megyn Kelly posted Friday night on YouTube. Taped earlier this week, the 40-minute interview began with questions about Reade’s background, covered the alleged assault in graphic detail, and pushed Reade to confront several criticisms of her account.

A rush transcript of the full interview is below.

Megyn Kelly: Tara, thank you so much for being here. We’ll get to your accusations against Joe Biden in a minute. But first, I just want people to get a sense of who you are. Where are you from?

Tara Reade: I was born in Monterey, California. And I grew up on a farm in Wisconsin, lived in about 80 acres, for part of my childhood, and lived also in Athens, Georgia, and then back to California.

MK: So you go from the West Coast to Washington, D.C. for a stint, and you work on Capitol Hill, and then you wind up getting married and having a child. Unfortunately, that marriage took a dark turn. Can you tell us a little bit about that?

TR: Yeah, I met my ex husband, actually, during the time I was living in Washington, D.C. when I was working for Joe Biden. The joy of that was my child, and my daughter is wonderful. But the heartbreak was that he was quite abusive and had a history, and we were put in a program that required me and my daughter to leave the area and have a sealed name change, and live in a safe house.

MK: It was a very serious domestic violence situation.

TR: It was, law enforcement coordinated with women’s shelters, and then also his parental rights were terminated. And so I raised my daughter by myself.

MK: So you get a name change, you get a social security number change, you wind up moving to the Pacific Northwest, and then you decide to go to law school. How’d you pay for that?

TR: I took out a lot of loans. I’m still in debt, very deeply in debt.

MK: So you spent basically most of your career at that point, helping domestic violence survivors. I’m told working for some animal rights organizations and the like.

TR: Correct.

MK: And is that what you were doing up until recently?

TR: Correct. Off and on. Yeah.

MK: How old is your daughter now?

TR: She’s 25.

MK: So let’s go back to 1992. You get a job working for then-Senator Joe Biden, as what?

TR: A staff assistant.

MK: You were overseeing the interns?

TR: Correct. I was very excited to be on the Hill. I was very excited to work for Joe Biden. He’s someone I looked up to.

MK: So you’re on Capitol Hill, you’re how old at this point?

TR: I’m 28.

MK: And you make some friends, including a woman who I’m just going to call Karen, for the purposes of this interview who is working in Ted Kennedy’s office.

TR: Correct.

MK: And Karen becomes pretty relevant in a short amount of time. Then at some point in your eight month stint working for Biden, you claim you were sexually harassed. And I’m making a distinction here between harassment and assault. We’ll get to the alleged assault in a minute. You claim sexual harassment began. How so?

TRL I would see him in hallways or whatever, he would always just greet me, put his hands on me, or put his hands on my shoulder and rub, you know, my nec, sometimes. It was just a bit odd. And I’d never had an employer do that.

MK: Did you ever see him behave appropriately with someone other than you?

TR: Not really, he would sometimes put his hands on people that I thought it was just unusual, he would just move people instead of saying excuse me, I would see that once in a while. But he seemed to, at meetings it would be, he would not necessarily look at me, but he would just put his hand on my shoulder. And then I would feel his finger underneath my hair, like on my neck.

MK: Stroking your neck?

TR: Yeah, just a little with his finger. And it just would make me freeze up because I’m, I’m a demonstrative person, but he was my boss, and quite a bit older than me. And I just was surprised by that.

MK: What did you take from that? Did you think he was after something?

TR: At the time, I just was so kind of surprised by it. And then I walked in, I was called in actually, to the office by Marianne Baker, to her office, and there was a discussion going on about me.

MK: Marian Baker was Joe Biden’s assistant for 30 years. She’s in her 70s now, right? And but she was your boss.

TR: Correct.

MK: Okay, so she was the person that you reported to and what happened? You walked into her office…

TR: They were having a discussion about having me serve drinks at a fundraising event and an aide was arguing that to me saying that, you know, I didn’t have to do that. That wasn’t my job, that because the senator had said he liked my legs and thought I was pretty, I didn’t have to do this.

MK: Who told you that?

TR: It was a, it was a senate aide

MK: That had heard Biden wanted you because he liked your legs…

TR: Correct. And I was called into the office because they wanted to discuss it with me.

MK: Okay.

TR: And then I had one of my hallway meetings with Marianne Baker when she talked to me about it. And she just said, you know, if you want to get along here you need to keep your head down and do what you’re told. If you want to keep you know, working here basically. And she said you need to button up your blouses, you need to have longer skirts, and you need to not look so sexy and noticeable, and you need to you know, change how you’re dressing.

MK: Were you wearing short skirts, and low-cut blouses?

TR: No, I was wearing like, you know what you would get at Express, like just normal, skirts. Back then in the ’90s we wore a lot of, you know, pastely kind of things. I wore heels. I mean, I did dress.

MK: So what do you think that was about?

TR: I think looking back on it, it was almost like damage control. It was like they were coming out aggressively at me because of the drinks thing, I think. But I don’t know.

MK: Did you change the way that you dressed?

TR: No, you know, it’s strange you asked that, no one’s asked me that. But at the same time, I was talking to my mother who is a very strong feminist. And that was always ahead of her time. And she explained to me that that was probably retaliation for what I was not, you know, serving the drinks.

MK: And your mom says, ‘This is inappropriate.’ What was your mom’s name?

TR: Jeanette.

MK: So Jeanette, says, you got to do something about this. Did you?

TR: No, I didn’t. She said, ‘You need to at least document it.’ And I said, ‘Mom, this isn’t the kind of place you do that. And I also talked to my friend, Karen.

MK: You told her what was happening in the office?

TR: In real time, yes, we were discussing it.

MK: After they had the discussion with you about your dress. Do you feel there was any other retaliation?

TR: It just became very icy and my friend Karen noticed it when she would like, if we would go to lunch or something when she call for me there was like this iciness.

MK: So there comes a day, at some point that spring, spring of 1993…

TR: Correct.

MK: Where you say Senator Biden and you had an experience in a hallway in one of the Capitol buildings. Can you describe what happened that day?

TR: Yes, I was, this was during that time where I was kind of frozen out so I was kind of surprised, but Marianne came rushing in with this bag, like a duffel bag or gym bag, she called it, and said, you know, hurry the senator’s already on his way. Just follow him and try to catch him before the capital and give him this, he wants his bag.

I remember going down the Russel Building floors. And so I don’t know if I was in the first floor or the basement but there’s corridors that lead to the Capitol and that kind of thing. And I was trying to catch up with him.

MK: This would have been on a weekday?

TR: Yes. And I remember like my heels, like my legs hurting a little. And, like, you know, there was just from walking really fast. I remember things like that. And then I saw him at a distance. He was talking to someone, and they walked away the other direction. And then he greeted me, he remembered my name. And then I said, you know, here you go, Senator. I handed him the bag. And it happened very quickly. I remember… I remember being pushed up against the wall, and thinking the first thought I had was, where’s the bag? Which is an absurd thought, but that’s what I thought was where’s the bag. Yeah, because I was handing it to him.

And he had his hands under underneath my clothes, and it happened all at once. So he had one hand underneath my shirt and the other hand, I had a skirt on. And he like went down my skirt and then went up. And I remember I was up almost on my tippy toes. And when he went inside the skirt, he was talking to me at the same time, and he was leaning into me. And I pulled this way, away from his head, I remember, and he so he was kissing my neck area and he whispered, did I want to go somewhere else in a low voice. He said some other things. I can’t remember everything he said. But he said something vulgar.

MK: May I ask what?

TR: He said ‘I want to f-ck you.’ And he said it low and I was pushing away and I remember my knee hurting because our knees, he had opened my legs with his knee and our knees caps clashed. So I felt like the sharp pain. His fingers were inside of my private area, my vagina, and there was no small talk. There was no like, precept, it was just sudden and it was happening like that. And he was saying that to me, saying those things to me, and I was pulling away.

And then he pulled back immediately when he could see I wasn’t complying. I was obviously just tensed up and frozen, and not kissing him back and not going with him. And he pulled back and he looked at me and he said, ‘Come on, man. I heard you liked me.’ And when he said that, it was either I heard or I thought but I remember hearing ‘heard.’ When he said that, I immediately started thinking what I did like, how I brought this on, like, Did I say something to somebody? Did I give an impression? I was, just my mind was racing.

And in that moment, I knew this was really bad. I knew I was it was more than just like the assault. It was really bad. He was then angry, right? And I could feel it wasn’t like yelling angry, but like that hostility build. And he pulled back and he was just looking at me directly. And he said, he pointed his finger at me and he said, ‘You’re nothing to me. You’re nothing.’ And I think that’s the hardest thing. And I know people talk about the assault, but his words, those words stayed with me my whole life. And as I’ve been trying to tell my story, I’ve kind of been torn apart trying to tell it. Those words come back. And, it’s like, it was cruel.

So when he saw me, obviously start to get upset by what he said, he took me by the shoulders and he just kind of shook me almost like, you know, and said, you know, ‘You’re okay. You’re all right.’

MK: Had you said anything to him?

TR: I wanted to say stop. And I thought it. I don’t know if I said it. But sometimes, you know, I’ve had a couple bad dreams or a few bad dreams about it, I wake up yelling that. I wake up yelling stop. And then he didn’t look at me again. He picked up the gym bag, he turned around and he walked away and he never looked back.

MK: It sounds like it happened in an instant.

TR: I would say under three minutes. It was quick

MK: Within moments of seeing you.

TR: Right. Like there was no, like he’s never like engaged me, he never engaged me in conversation or asked me things. He just had me up and was was kissing me and then saying that.

MK: When you say that he went down the skirt and then back up, did he enter the skirt from the top of the skirt?

TR: No. On the outside.

MK: He came into the skirt from the bottom of the skirt.

TR: Right.

MK: And were you wearing underwear?

TR: I was wearing lingerie, underwear.

MK: And he pushed it to the side?

TR: He, there was no block. Yeah, there was no reason. Yeah, he was able to do what he wanted to do.

MK: And I don’t mean to get too graphic.

TR: That’s okay.

MK: But are you saying that they were crotchless when you say that it was lingerie? Like, can I just be clear on? Did he push the underwear to the side? Or was that not an issue?

TR: That was not an issue.

MK: Why?

TR: Because they were just lingerie panties and I was going to meet my boyfriend later. So yeah.

MK: So maybe there wasn’t much to them.

TR: Right.

MK: You know, some people are gonna hear this story and they’re gonna say you’re telling me a U.S. Senator, in the middle of the day in a Senate office building committed a sexual assault right there. How can people believe that?

TR: I don’t really care if people believe it or not, I’ve had to live with it. And it’s just one of those things that’s impacted and shattered my life. It changed everything about my life. In that moment, I knew how angry he was. And I remember thinking like taking it on myself, like thinking I put him in a bad position. Like maybe he thought I wanted to be with him.

MK: Many people look at him and they say, you know, Joe Biden is a jovial, kind, warm guy, and he couldn’t possibly be capable of that level of callousness. To those people, what do you say?

TR: He is. I’ll never forget the calling me nothing. And the way he pointed his finger at me, the sternness and then you know, when he said, ‘You’re okay, you’re okay.’ It’s like, he just walked away.

MK: So when you got out of the Senate building, who, what did you do next? Did you tell anybody?

TR: I remember just trying to get home, like I remember sitting on those stairs, thinking I just had to get my legs to work so I could go back and get my purse. And then I remember being home, and then I was curled up, like in fetal position practically talking to my mom.

MK: Was she the first person you told?

TR: I called her.

MK: You told her all the detail?

TR: Mm hmm. It took her a while to get it out of me because I kept I was embarrassed about the underwear I was wearing. She described it as sexual assault. I mean, she said, this is wrong, and you need to call the police and she was begging me to go to police. She cried and yelled at me. And then when she was yelling at me, it really stressed me out.

MK: Did you consider it? Did you consider going to the cops?

TR: I did not, because it was the Capitol Police and I just said, ‘Mom, you don’t do that here.’

MK: Did you tell anybody other than your mom?

TR: I told Karen, and I called her and then we finally got to talk. And I just knew that something was going to change incrementally like forever. Right? So I took a shower. I remember that and I remember… I remember trying to get like that, smell, you know, just kept washing and washing.

MK: Do you feel traumatized?

TR: I felt scared. What I could say is I don’t know if it was trauma, but I felt frightened. Like, and it wasn’t just about what happened, it was my job tied up with it.

MK: Did there come a time when you actually did complain about what had been going on in that office to anyone?

TR: Yes. Right before the assault, I had gone to Marianne Baker and we had had our hallway meetings and it was about, you know, not serving the drinks and I started to tell her I was uncomfortable, and she did not want to hear that. Right after the assault, I wanted to tell her about the assault. So we were in the hallway, I was trying to tell her, I was trying to say something happened. And before I could really get any words out, she put her hand up and she said, ‘I don’t want to hear this.’

MK: There was nothing that would suggest to her you had been sexually assaulted by him.

TR: No, I started to say ‘something happened.’ And she didn’t let me get further than that.

MK: All of the complaining you did about the office environment happened prior to the alleged assault except for the conversation you claim you had with Marianne…

TR: Yes.

MK: in the hallway, where you felt shut down.

TR: Yeah, mmhmm.

MK: But then there was a point at which you decided to file a written complaint.

TR: Correct.

MK: Was that after the alleged assault?

TR: Right. Yes. So I decided to seek out some help. And they had something called like it was Senate personnel, we called it loosely, but it was like a office of, you know, I don’t even know, for employees like you go, where you get your IDs, things like that. But you go and you fill out a form and you start a process. So I did an intake form. I don’t recall what I put on the intake.

MK: When you walk into the office, do you see another human?

TR: Behind the window. Like almost like, you know, behind, if you were to go to a doctor’s office, they hand you a clipboard.

MK: So they handed you a clipboard? And it had a piece of paper on there, what did you say?

TR: I filled it out with my information and then I described the sexual harassment in terms of that being asked to be served the drinks and being uncomfortable. I doubt I use the word sexual harassment. I did not talk about the sexual assault at all. I only talked about the retaliation as well, because at that point, I was really afraid of losing my position.

MK: Did you have the chance to copy the form?

TR: No, and we didn’t have cell phones back then. Like now I would have taken a picture with my phone. But…

MK: Some people have hit you for this saying you kept virtually every record from your 92 to 93 stint in Biden’s office. Why would you not keep the one form that alleged harassment or retaliation?

TR: Actually, I didn’t, I didn’t keep very much from that time. I don’t even have pictures really from that time. I think I just have a few things.

MK: Did you even think to get a copy or to try to get a copy?

TR: I thought they were going to call me for an appointment. So I was, just thought it would be, I didn’t know I was going to be fired at that time. So I just thought I would be imminently coming into the office.

MK: How long thereafter were you fired?

TR: I would say it was within a month I was stripped of my duties. So I don’t know if they knew about the form, but I suspect that it got around. But I don’t know.

MK: So there was never a call in response to your form?

TR: I never got a call.

MK: You claim that you complained to three people in Joe Biden’s office at the time about the harassment, not the assault. They have all vehemently denied it. Marianne Baker, your direct report, says ‘such a complaint,’ quote ‘would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional and as a manager. It didn’t happen.’ Ted Kaufman says ‘She did not come to me. If she had, I would have remembered her.’ A similar denial from Dennis Toner. These are pretty emphatic. Your reaction?

TR: Well, you have to look at the source. I mean, they’re still working with Biden, so they’re not just Biden staffers or former they’re with him, except I think Marianne Baker is now retired, but she was with him. Their job was to cover what he did. There are people that have enabled and allowed his behavior to continue and they know who they are. And in a way, they’re complicit.

MK: One of the witnesses who has come forward to support your story is Karen, this person you met in Ted Kennedy’s office. Karen is a working professional. She does not wish to be on the record by name. But she has spoken to my producer in this interview Rich McHugh, an investigative reporter and producer, and she has said to him specifically that your story has never varied. That you told her this story at the time it happened. Why do you think Karen is afraid to come forward with her real name and say this publicly?

TR: Because she’s, you know, she owns a business and I mean, she has, you know, a family. You see what’s happening to me, my friends and family are being harassed and attacked and discredited and dragged through the mud.

MK: There’s another woman who says you told her this story about two years after it happened.

MK: Her name is Linda LaCasse. She’s a lifelong Democrat. She says she’s a Biden supporter and is going to vote for Joe Biden this November. But she said, this happened. And I know it did because I remember talking about it, people need to believe Tara. What’s happened to her since she came out and identified herself as somebody who is a corroborating witness of yours.

TR: She said, it’s been hard on her, because she’s been getting harassing calls. People have been saying really terrible things about her in social media and dragging some of her personal life onto personal finances. Just all kinds of things smeared.

MK: You voted for Joe Biden, in 2008, and 2012. And I think a lot of people look at that and say, how could you vote for the man who sexually assaulted you?

TR: Because I wasn’t voting for him. I was voting for Obama. I mean, I was really hopeful and happy that Obama became president and Joe Biden happened to be on the ticket. My daughter was young. There was no way I was going to come forward. And at those times, there was really no mechanism. And I think when people say ‘why don’t you just tell your story?’ Well, it’s not that easy. When I when I tried to bring forth my story this year alone, it took months for a news outlet to really look at it, and then months more for them to investigate it vet it and look into it. And then they decide, they decide, when they print it. I have no control over that.

MK: But as recently as 2017, you were praising Joe Biden publicly…

TR: Right.

MK: And I think that has a lot of people scratching their heads, right. On multiple occasions you retweeted or you liked online praise for Joe Biden and his work combating sexual assault. There was a compliment you tweeted about him saying ‘My old boss speaks truth. Listen.’ I mean, it is true that women do sometimes praise men who have sexually harassed or abused them. But why would you publicly praise Joe Biden for actions on sexual assault when you claim that’s what he did to you?

TR: Well, one thing during that time, I am an expert witness on domestic violence issues, as you know, so that was like an account that was, you know, part of that awareness of domestic violence and, other violent acts. I’ve always been conflicted about Joe Biden, I didn’t want to talk badly about him. And I wasn’t ready to tell my history with Joe Biden at that point at all. And nor had any idea of going to the press about it at that point. It wasn’t until 2019, when I saw Lucy Flores come forward and the way the media treated her…

MK: Politician from the state of Nevada..

TR: Correct…

MK: Who had come out and made an allegation about Joe Biden touching her inappropriately at a campaign event, she said.

TR: I felt I wanted to come forward. So I talked to my friend Karen. And Karen actually had said, ‘Have you noticed they said no employees had come forward?’ and I said, ‘I know,’ you know, and I thought about it. But Karen was really against me ever coming forward period and public. She just said, the blowback will be so bad, it just will be terrible. And I’m like, well, this is a different time. There’s a Me Too movement. Like maybe this is the time for me to really… I feel a bit hypocritical. Here I am an advocate for other people, but I’m hiding the secret. I’m not telling what happened to me.

MK: You give an interview to your local paper and you don’t tell the full story. You only tell about the alleged harassment and you don’t mention the alleged assault. Why not?

TR: The first question that was asked of me was, ‘Well, it wasn’t sexual was it?’ And that’s all it took. I was so lacking in courage and it’d be the first time I’ve been telling the story. I just, I kind of took my breath and I thought, okay, I can’t really talk about what happened. And then as soon as the local article came out, talking about the harassment, within hours before it even hit the paper, I was being called a Russian agent.

MK: Right. We’ll get to Vladimir Putin in a minute. But how soon after speaking to that reporter in April of ’19, did you begin reconsidering and thinking about telling the full story?

TR: Almost immediately, I think it was probably later in the summer that I started reaching out back to, you know, a couple of reporters I had been speaking with, and they did not respond. And so then I started reaching out to politicians. And I really started in the fall very actively even tweeting openly, like there’s something more, there’s something more and really putting it out there but not receiving a response.

MK: Let me back up. So when you spoke out in April of ’19 about the alleged harassment, but not assault, you did something interesting. In an interview you gave to the Washington Post there’s a quote from you that is, ‘This is what I want to emphasize. It’s not him. It’s the people around him who keep covering for him. For instance, he should have known what was happening to me. Looking back now that’s my criticism. Maybe he could have been a little bit more in touch with his own staff.’ A little more in touch with his own staff. I mean, this is the guy who allegedly sexually assaulted you. And you seem to be trying to cover him in this discussion with the Washington Post. Do they have the quote, right, and why would you do that?

TR: I’m pretty sure that’s in response to the question about specifically the retaliation. So I was being, I was talking about, they were asking me if Joe Biden fired me and I said, ‘No, it was Ted Kaufman. I don’t even know if Joe Biden knew I was fired.’ Because he wasn’t in touch, what I meant by that was he wasn’t in touch with the day to day of staff. Like that’s not something he did.

MK: You’re not blaming him, and weren’t blaming him for the retaliation you suffered?

TR: Yeah, I wasn’t sure he even knew.

MK: Let’s talk about some of the backlash you got when you came out in April of 2019, including being accused of being a Russian agent. Your comments on Vladimir Putin are a little out there. Right? So just, I want to give you the chance to explain what that’s about. You’ve said he’s a ‘genius with athletic prowess that’s intoxicating.’ ‘He has an alluring combination of strength with gentleness, his sensuous image projects, his love for life, the embodiment of grace while facing adversity.’ And that,’ like most women across the world, you’d like President Putin a lot, shirt on or off.’

TR: Well, that was the joke. That was humorous, meant to be humorous, but…

MK: You sound pretty enamored with him.

TR: But I think that what I want to say about that is if you read all of the posts they’re a lot about Russia and the anti-Russia sentiment right now that we have, and I don’t like xenophobia. You know, and I was writing a Russian novel, that was part of the writing group that I mentioned earlier. And we were doing creative writing, creative posts, and I was in the middle of studying about Russia, kind of immersing myself in that. The truth of the matter is, you know, I’ve never been to Russia. I don’t know what it’s like to live there or the human rights violations that, you know he is accused of. And what I would say now is that I don’t appreciate his views about, for instance, domestic violence programs, like there’s not a lot of support for women, from my understanding…

MK: You’ve had a change of heart on him.

TR: Yeah. But all of that aside, has nothing to do with what happened in 1993. Or where Joe Biden had his hands where they weren’t supposed to be.

MK: Eventually you do decide to tell the full story and you put that decision someplace in the summer of 2019. You tried to go to the press, you didn’t get- nobody would take the story? How many publications would you say you went to?

TR: Oh, gosh, I don’t know. I went to quite a few.

MK: Would they just blow you off?

TR: Um, there was just no answer. Yeah, like I went to I think The Guardian probably there was, I reached out to NPR to the New Yorker. I mainly stayed with like PBS, NPR, New York Times. Those kinds of… yeah.

MK: Why do you think they were blowing you off?

TR: I don’t know if they were blowing me off. But I think people need to understand when they’re trying to tell a story. It’s not that easy. I think, you know, you go to the tip lines or you go if you’re not a known citizen or known person, you don’t necessarily get a platform to come forward.

MK: Was this at all politically motivated? Because that’s what people think, you know. They think you were a Marianne Williamson supporter, you’re a Bernie supporter. This is about politics.

TR: No, actually, it’s not it. Well, I think everything is political. Like maybe I’ll take that back. Everything’s political, right? But this is deeper than that. This is about watching the person that assaulted me be elevated to the highest office in the land. He’s running on a platform of character, and I just, I found that gross. I know what he’s like, I experienced what he was like. And I wanted people to know.

MK: But if you brought it to, for example, the Elizabeth Warren campaign, right, to try to get them to do something with it. And the Kamala Harris campaign?

TR: I did, mm hmm.

MK: Isn’t that inherently political? I mean doesn’t that suggest, in fact, this is all political?

TR: I tried to reach out to them, yes, I did. I tried to reach out to them… Well, Kamala Harris is my representative. So I tried to reach out to her in particular, for help, like I wanted to get a safe place to tell what happened. And I didn’t get a response. So I kept again, trying to get it out there. I think that many things can be true at once is what you know, we all know, right? He is presented as a champion of women’s rights. And yet I know personally, and I know seven other women that did not experience him that way.

MK: One of the reasons people have chosen to dismiss you, some people have chosen to dismiss your allegation, is because there was a March 3 tweet that I want to ask you about.

TR: Okay.

MK: So The Intercept’s Ryan Grim, tweeted out, quote, ‘a head to head Biden v Sanders contest will force voters to take a close look at Biden again. That went very badly for him last time.’ And you responded at 10:33pm on March 3, 2020. ‘Yep. Timing. Wait for it. Tick Tock.’ It sounds political. And it sounds like you were excited to drop this bomb.

TR: That was in response to me getting finally, I thought, an attorney from Time’s Up to finally bring something forward and bring my story forward in a safe way. So that’s why I wrote it.

MK: Tick Tock was a…

TR: Time’s up.

MK: Time’s up.

TR: Yeah.

MK: Were you excited? Because it sounds anticipatory, you’re building the anticipation and the suspense. People have used that as a reason to say she’s not credible.

TR: I think that they’ll use anything to say that I’m not credible. So I won’t address it in that way. What I will say is that I was very, very vocal on Twitter about trying to get the story forward.

MK: Can we talk about the double standard in, you know, that some believe exists in the way you’ve been treated versus the way some other two complainants have been treated. Some of those who touted the ‘we must believe all women’ line the most during for example, the Kavanaugh hearings for the Supreme Court certainly seem to have changed their tune when it comes to you. Nancy Pelosi is one of them. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Alyssa Milano. How did that feel?

TR: It makes me upset. It makes me angry, because those are people that I respected, some of which I voted for or worked with, you know, in some capacity, you know, when I was on the Hill, like, in a remote way they were there. I voted for some people that said this. For instance, I supported Elizabeth Warren, who basically said she believed Joe Biden and just dismissed me.

MK: What do you want to say to people like that who are looking into the camera right now saying, I don’t believe her. I support him.

TR: I want to say you don’t have to discredit me or not believe me to vote for Joe Biden. I even have friends and family that are still voting for Joe Biden because they, that’s what they’re doing. Why wouldn’t you ask me? Ask me what happened. Ask me my experience. And then if you choose to not believe me, that’s fine. And I don’t really care deep down if they believe me or not. I know what happened to me. And I’ll move forward. But I want other survivors to know that that they can come forward and when they see this sort of onslaught, this sort of partisanship, it’s very discouraging. So we can come forward unless it’s a Democrat? Is that the message we’re sending?

MK: You’ve been an active Democrat your whole life.

TR: Yeah.

MK: Are you still?

TR: I’m well, I don’t know if they’ve noticed, but I’m leaving the Democratic Party. And I won’t be part of any. I won’t be a Republican. It’s just not my political belief system. I’ve been pretty much a progressive all my life and so it’s been, I feel politically homeless.

MK: Do you believe we should believe all women?

TR: I believe in the survivors that have come forward like Blasey Ford, and the other ones that have come forward. I do stand with them. I think that there needs to be a conversation rather than a hashtag.

MK: Are you in favor of the conversation? I mean, does Joe Biden get due process? Does he get the chance to vet these claims and defend himself? Is that okay?

TR: I think he’s been doing that. Right? He’s had a chance for more platforms than I have.

MK: Let’s talk about what he said, because he went on TV last Friday. And said, first of all, it never happened. Period end of report. This did not happen. He did say that, in his view, accusers should start off with the presumption that they’re telling the truth. Do you think he’s afforded you that presumption?

TR: No. I mean, it’s been stunning, actually how, some of his surrogates with the blue checks, you know that his surrogates have been saying really horrible things about me and to me on social media. He hasn’t himself, but there is a measure of hypocrisy with the campaign saying it’s safe, it’s not been safe. You know, all my social media has been hacked. All my personal information has been dragged through, every person that maybe has a you know, gripe against me, an ex boyfriend or an ex landlord, whatever it is, has been able to have a platform rather than me, talking about things that have nothing to do with 1993. Like, even the whole thing with being called a Russian agent, that in particular, that incites people, people actually, I got a death threat from that because they thought I was being a traitor to America. And I mean, these are serious things and his campaign is, you know, taking this position that they want all women to be able to speak safely. I have not experienced that.

MK: Where does the line get drawn, though, right? Because, you know, he has to have the opportunity to question your story. Of course, he’s going to come out and say, ‘It isn’t true. And these are the reasons I don’t believe it’s true. And you shouldn’t believe it’s true.’ Like any man accused, or woman for that matter, has the right to do that. Right.

TR: Correct.

MK: So where are people going wrong in the coverage of this story?

TR: I think one thing that was notable was it took him a long time to respond, didn’t it?

MK: Biden?

TR: Correct, like, how long did it take?

MK: Over a month for him to publicly respond.

TR: Right, exactly. So it took over a month. And meanwhile, his campaign manager kept saying that the media had to investigate it. And to me, you know, being a past victim advocate for domestic violence, I thought that was appalling. That’s like calling the mob to like tear apart somebody. And I really, and they did.

MK: Have you had any representation during this time?

TR: No, no.

MK: So you got rejected by Time’s Up. Have you had a PR person?

TR: No, no.

MK: Have you had a lawyer?

TR: No.

MK: So it’s just you?

TR: Just me kind of stumbling around trying to tell my story.

MK: If he’s watching this, what do you want to say to him?

TR: I want to say, ‘You and I were there, Joe Biden, please step forward and be held accountable. And if you feel that you can address this in a real way, then you know, and I know that you should step down. You’re not, you should not be running on character for the president of the United States.’

MK: You want him to withdraw?

TR: I wish he would. But he won’t, but I wish he would. That’s how I feel emotionally.

MK: Do you want an apology?

TR: I think it’s a little late. That should have happened in 1993.

MK: Now he says, he’s calling on the National Archives to release whatever documents that may have come from the Senate personnel offices while you were there, in search of this alleged complaint. They say they don’t have them. Some are saying he should release his Senate files that are being kept at the University of Delaware. He says he’s not going to do that. He was asked ‘Why not just have somebody go over there and do a search only for any document that mentions Tara Reade or sexual harassment?’ He won’t do it. Your reaction to that?

TR: I think that says it all. And I think once we get the document, we’ll see what it says.

MK: What if we don’t get the document? What does that tell us?

TR: Again, that says at all. I think that his reluctance is speaking volumes.

MK: If I can just go back for one second to Blasey Ford. We mentioned her and we were talking about ‘believe all women.’ Some of those who supported her, but now have found a reason not to support you say, ‘Well, she was under oath.’ Would you go under oath?

TR: Absolutely.

MK: They say ‘Well, she subjected herself to cross examination.’ Would you do that?

TR: Absolutely.

MK: They also point out that She took a polygraph controlled by someone on her team. Is that something you want to do?

TR: I’m not a criminal. Joe Biden should take the polygraph. What I would say is that they’re not admissible into court. One. Two, Blasey Ford took one. Is that true? I believe that’s what I understand. But what kind of precedent does that set for survivors of violence? Does that mean we’re presumed guilty, and we all have to take polygraphs? So I’m just putting it out there. So I will take one if Joe Biden takes one. But I’m not a criminal.

MK: President Trump has been accused by over 12 women of sexual assault or harassment or worse. And I think that gets to the heart of it. A lot of Democrats are mad, they’re mad at you for, they see it as an attempt to tar their guy, the one guy who could bring down a man they loath and they kind of just wish you would go away. To those people, what do you say?

TR: I say again, you don’t have to discredit me or not believe me to vote for Joe Biden. Voting is a very personal thing. And I’m not here to influence a national election and I don’t want to be. I do not want to help Donald Trump win. I do not want to help Joe Biden win. Obviously, he’s the person that hurt me.

MK: There’s an op-ed in the New York Times today by Linda Hirshman, who says, I believe Tara Reade, and I’m still gonna vote for Joe Biden. And I know it means I have to sell out Tara Reade, but I just think Trump’s worse, is essentially her position. More artfully stated than that. Can you understand that?

TR: I think that says more about our culture and our society right now than it says about me, right? I mean, this is the highest office of the land. So do we want someone who thinks of women as objects who thinks that they can just take what they want in that moment for their pleasure, and that’s it? And I guess that’s the question.

MK: On the subject of others coming forward, some people have said if a guy’s gonna be this brazen in a sexual assault case. Doing this to a woman who works for him in the middle of a Senate office building in the middle of the day in the middle of a corridor. He’s a sitting U.S. Senator, there would be others. That they can’t believe Tara Reade, because there’s no one else making an allegation this serious. What do you say to them?

TR: I say I think I’m a poster child as to why women wouldn’t come forward, arent I? If you’ve been watching any of the social media or the news and seeing how I’ve been attacked basically on everything about me. It’s pretty obvious that if you did have a story to come forward with about Joe Biden it would be pretty daunting wouldn’t it?

MK: What is the end game here? You know a lot of people think, eh, she’s just disappointed bernie didn’t get she’s trying to make something up to go after Biden and even if its true what’s the end game she wants trump what is the end game for you here

TR: My end game is basically telling my story in a dignified way, not being torn apart, and it’s being able to move on with my life and heal.

MK: How has this whole thing affected you?

TR: It’s been freeing, I can’t describe it, but even all the smears, it’s just like okay bring everything out, like fine, talk terrible things about me. Like my bankruptcy was posted and I want people to know, don’t be ashamed if you’re poor, don’t be ashamed if your life is messy. That’s ridiculous, you should be able to talk about your life. We all have problems and no one’s perfect. It took me a long time to come forward because of things that were happening in my life. But from survivors they always have this feeling like they have to be perfect or they have to have you know… and I’m not perfect and it’s all out there, like everything about me, and in a way it’s just set me free.

MK: Thank you so much for being here.

TR: Thank you. Thank you for having me.

MK: You bet.

Democratic Senate Candidates Move Goalposts On Sexual Assault,"It was only a year and a half ago that last-minute sexual assault allegations upended the confirmation process for now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Desperate to block President Donald Trump’s second pick for the nation’s highest court, Democrats flocked to give unsubstantiated claims of a 30-year-old rape allegation their unwavering support in an attempted character assassination that threatened to bring about an end to the standard of presumptive innocence.

Democrats and women’s groups working with a complicit media teamed up together to sink Kavanaugh’s nomination in a movement to “believe all women,” the now-standard mantra of the left-wing approach to handling accusations sexual misconduct no matter the evidence.

In Kavanaugh’s case, the judge’s primary accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, was unable to prove that the two had ever even met let alone provide a single corroborating witness to support her claims. But because she was a woman challenging a conservative on the cusp of clinching the power on the nation’s high bench, she must have been believed. The Democrats made the rules.

Fast-forward to six months before the next presidential election, Democrats are now reaping the consequences of the culture they created, a culture that Kavanaugh had warned about. This time, one of their own who sits on the perch of presidential power having secured the Democratic nomination faces decades-old sexual assault allegations from a former staffer whose claims up to this point, have been far more credible than anything ever launched at Kavanaugh in 2018.

Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer for then-Delaware Sen. Joe Biden accused the now-presumptive Democratic presidential nominee of forcibly kissing her and penetrating her with his fingers in a congressional hallway in 1993. The fact alone that Reade worked for Biden, which nobody disputes, already provides more evidence to support Reade’s claims than those of Ford’s against Kavanaugh. Reade also has several witnesses who have gone on record to support Reade’s accounting of events including three close friends, her brother, and a 1993 tape of CNN’s “Larry King Live” that shows Reade’s mother calling into the program to describe the alleged incident. Court documents from a 1996 restraining order case with her then-ex husband further corroborate Reade’s timeline that she spoke of the alleged incident in the ’90s.

While there are still important reasons to believe in Biden’s innocence, including the public absence of a complaint Reade says she filed in the senator’s office shortly after and the denial from several former staffers that such paperwork exists, Reade’s story still stands up to far more scrutiny than was given to Ford’s who was taken at her word despite major holes in her story that have yet to be filled to this day.

It appears now however, that the culture of blindly believing women has come back to haunt Democrats trying to move back to goalposts in order to protect their ambitions of reclaiming the Senate and the White House. Here’s where some Democratic Senate candidates are now saying of Reade’s accusations ahead of competitive contests in November:

Doug Jones, Alabama

Incumbent Democratic Sen. Doug Jones criticized the lack of an investigation into Kavanaugh’s alleged past conduct, despite wall-to-wall media coverage, teams of reporters flying across the country pouring over every possible ounce of evidence, and an FBI probe into Ford’s allegations as reason why he voted down Kavanaugh’s appointment.

“It wasn’t just about who you believed, it was about the whole nature of the Kavanaugh hearings, the lack of investigation,” Jones told Politico last week.

In 2018, Jones deemed Ford’s accusations credible.

“The Kavanaugh nomination process has been flawed from the beginning and incomplete at the end. Dr. Ford was credible and courageous and I am concerned about the message our vote will be sending to our sons and daughters, as well as victims of sexual assault.”

On Reade however, Jones called the allegations “totally inconsistent” with Biden’s character and charged Reade with lacking adequate credibility.

“The more that comes out, the more and more it, to me, does not have the indicia of credibility that I would be looking to at all,” Jones told the Huffington Post.

Gary Peters, Michigan

Incumbent Michigan Democratic Sen. Gary Peters formally endorsed Biden last week while ignoring the allegations against the former vice president from Reade.

Meanwhile in 2018, Peters voted against Kavanaugh’s confirmation citing Ford’s courage to come forward.

“Like many Americans, I followed closely the testimonies of Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee. As I watched Dr. Ford, I didn’t see a partisan ideologue motivated by politics. What I saw was a woman speaking with credibility, earnestness and bravery,” Peters said.

Sara Gideon, Maine

Maine’s Democratic Speaker of the House Sara Gideon spent months hammering incumbent Republican Sen. Susan Collins for delivering a floor speech defending the rule of law to explain her support for Judge Kavanaugh.

Gideon’s opposition literature repeatedly tied Collins to Kavanaugh and accused Collin’s defense of due process of feeling “like a betrayal” to survivors of sexual assault.

On the anniversary of the Kavanaugh hearings last fall, Gideon post a picture reaffirming her support for Ford.

One year ago today. Thank you Dr. Ford for your bravery. #BelieveWomen pic.twitter.com/NrWEsuBTeV — Sara Gideon (@SaraGideon) September 27, 2019

When it comes to Biden however, Gideon remained silent for weeks after Reade came forward.

Just this month, Gideon finally broke her silence to offer support for Biden despite far more substantive charges lodged against him.

“Sexual assault and sexual harassment are incredibly serious issues and for too long, people have been too afraid to come forward. Every person should be able to come forward and tell their story, and have it thoroughly looked into,” Gideon told Politico in a statement. “I voted for Joe Biden in the primary because I thought he could bring this country together and meet the challenges we face. I still believe that to be true.”

Mark Kelly, Arizona

Former NASA astronaut seeking to unseat incumbent Republican Sen. Martha McSally said Reade’s allegations ought to be looked into, but at this point, Biden still had his full support, according to Politico.

Cal Cunningham, North Carolina

Speaking through a spokeswoman, former North Carolina State Sen. Cal Cunningham challenging incumbent Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told Politico he believes women deserve to be heard and taken seriously, and said the level of attention given to Reade has been adequate.

According to a media analysis from the Washington Free Beacon, Biden went through 19 interviews in the five weeks since Reade came forward with her allegations without a single question on the topic.

Amy McGrath, Kentucky

The Marine Corps veteran who narrowly lost a 2018 House bid now seeking to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Politico that so far, she’s satisfied with the response from Biden despite Biden promising to keep his Senate records housed at the University of Delaware sealed where investigators might find the complaint in question supposedly filed by Reade.

“We need transparency as they navigate these allegations, and so far, I’ve seen that from Joe Biden,” McGrath said.

Steve Bullock, Montana

Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, who is running up against incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, said his support for Biden hasn’t changed amid the Reade allegations, also arguing that Biden’s transparency has vindicated the Democratic nominee.

“It was important that Vice President Biden addressed this, head on and in a serious manner,” Bullock said in a statement to Politico. “Americans are looking for transparency from their leaders, and Joe Biden delivered on that.”

John Hickenlooper, Colorado

The former Colorado governor running in a competitive primary to face incumbent Republican Sen. Cory Gardner told Politico through a spokesman that his support for Biden has not abated.

Biden ‘Unity Task Force’ Features Obama Administration Haters,"Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., teamed up to create six “unity task forces” to make recommendations to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) platform committee and the Biden campaign. Several of the “unity” task force members have a history of opening criticizing policies of the Obama-Biden administration.

Immigration member Marisa Franco, immigration co-chair Marielena Hincapie, criminal justice reform member Stacey Walker, and economic member Dr. Darrick Hamilton all previously bashed the Obama administration and critiqued Democratic party platforms.

NEW this morning: Biden and Sanders roll out the members of the 6 Unity Task Forces that will offer recommendations to the DNC platform cmte and to Biden. Includes @johnkerry, @EricHolder, @vivek_murthy, @aoc, @RepJayapal, @rweingarten, @econjared, @StephanieKelton. pic.twitter.com/fGHHFJcUVE — Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) May 13, 2020

In 2016, Franco co-authored an article in The Nation titled, “The Deportation Machine Obama Built for President Trump, in which he blamed the Obama administration for expanding Immigration and Naturalization Service — since broken up into the Citizenship and Immigration Services, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

“Instead of reversing that architecture and disavowing that plan, President Obama turbocharged it. To pay for the ballooning enforcement-first approach, the budget for immigration enforcement grew 300 percent from the resources given at the time of its founding under Bush to $18 billion annually, more than all other federal law-enforcement agencies’ budgets combined,” Franco wrote.

During the first round of Democratic Debates, Franco tweeted out that Biden should be held accountable for the “deportation machine” he helped create.

Biden must acknowledge that they built up a deportation machine that was gassed up and ready to go once Trump took over. #demdebate #fueratrump https://t.co/NB2jdF1qqu — Marisa Franco 🐜 (@marisa_franco) June 28, 2019

Hincapie called out the Obama administration for their alleged “mission to deport people as quickly as possible” in a New York Times article over Obama-era immigration centers.

“By locking up women and babies, the Obama administration has made it their mission to deport these people as quickly as possible,” said Hincapie. “Our message to the government is simple: Follow the law. We must ensure that every person who interacts with our legal system has a fair hearing.”

In September 2019, she thanked a moderator for “holding Dems accountable” for immigration decisions made by the Obama administration.

.@jorgeramosnews Gracias for holding Dems accountable on behalf of immigrants and asking Biden whether he made mistake in not reducing deportations under Obama #DemDebate — Marielena Hincapié (@MarielenaNILC) September 13, 2019

Walker said Biden’s vote in favor of the 1994 crime bill “wreaked havoc on black and brown [people] for decades.”

Corporatist Dems every time something extremely problematic about Joe Biden’s record is unearthed. CONTEXT: I just saw clips from C-SPAN of Joe Biden bragging about the Crime Bill (and his support of the death penalty) that wreaked havoc on Black and Brown ppl for decades. pic.twitter.com/N4mPNzn2Ep — Stacey Walker (@swalker06) March 7, 2020

On March 31, Walker also complained about Biden’s lack of support for “Medicare for All.”

I agree activist/twitter world is sometimes far from reality. But I don’t think it is on this issue. The progressive left believes in Medicare for All with the kind of passion that seems necessary given we’re in a pandemic. Joe Biden does not. That’s a problem. — Stacey Walker (@swalker06) April 1, 2020

Walker also called Biden an “uninspiring” “gaffe machine.”

Finally, Hamilton was a vocal critic of Biden on many issues ranging from the Supreme Court and the 1994 Crime Bill to Biden’s social security record.

Hamilton criticized Biden’s role in nominating Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court calling it an “abominable confirmation” hearing. He also called Biden the “architect of modern mass incarceration.”

Hamilton also slammed Biden for not supporting “Medicare for All” amid the coronavirus pandemic and believes Biden is too moderate to achieve his desired progressive policies. Hamilton suggests Democrats reject moderates.

“Reject the radical neoliberal ‘moderate’ politics that has brought us an immoral gross plutocratic concentration of economic and political power in favor of an economy grounded justice,” Hamilton tweeted.

Hamilton called Biden’s record on social security policy a “cause for concern.”

It will surely be interesting to see the radical ideas that come out of this “unity task force.” One thing is for certain, while left-wing activists may come together to form policy there is certainly no “unity” behind Biden.

Joe Biden: If Voters Believe Tara Reade ‘They Probably Shouldn’t Vote For Me’,"During an interview with MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell, presumptive 2020 Democratic nominee Joe Biden said if voters believe his accuser Tara Reade “they probably shouldn’t vote for me.”

O’Donnell started his line of lack-luster questioning by describing a New York Times opinion article titled “I Believe Tara Reade. I’m Voting for Joe Biden Anyways.”

“What do you say to women who were ready to vote for Joe Biden, eager to vote for Joe Biden, but this gives them serious pause because they do believe Tara Reade and you’re not going to change their mind about that. What would you say to them about their vote?” O’Donnell asked.

“Well, I think they should vote their heart and if they believe Tara Reade, they probably shouldn’t vote for me. I wouldn’t vote for me if I believed Tara Reade,” Biden said.

Reade alleges Biden sexually assaulted during her time as his Senate staffer in 1993. During an interview with Megyn Kelly, Reade detailed the sexual assault allegation.

“He had his hands under underneath my clothes, and it happened all at once. So he had one hand underneath my shirt and the other hand, I had a skirt on. And he like went down my skirt and then went up,” Reade said.

Biden has denied the allegations and says he would refuse to allow a search of his Senate records for Reade’s name. According to the Washington Post, Biden’s Senate records are held at the University of Delaware and will remain sealed until two years after Biden leaves public life.

“Reade told the Daily Caller that she wants the records released since she believes they might contain a copy of the complaint filed over the alleged incident which she says led to her termination on Capitol Hill. Several Biden Senate staffers have denied the existence of any such paperwork,” writes Tristan Justice at The Federalist.

Women’s groups and left-leaning organizations have been silent on Reade’s accusations against Biden, meanwhile being outspoken in favor of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when she accused now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Groups such as Planned Parenthood and Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund have been silent on the issue of whether Reade is to be believed.

Biden has previously said that women should be believed when they come forward as it’s difficult to make that decision, but in his denial of Reade’s accusation, he stated a different standard for Reade than he held for Ford. “They should come forward. They should be heard, and then they should be investigated,” he told Mika Brzezinski.

“We need to believe women like Colbie [Holderness]. We need to recognize the incredible courage it takes for women like her to come forward. And we need to change the culture so those who live in fear can safely get the support they deserve,” Biden tweeted in February 2018.

Those standards don’t apply to Biden in the 2020 election or to Reade, his accuser.

"Lawsuit Documents Allege James Biden Committed Fraud, Racketeering","In January the FBI raided the offices of Americore Health, a health care company that manages rural hospitals, where James Biden, brother of former vice president candidate and current presidential candidate Joe Biden, was a major investor. Documents prepared as part of an ongoing lawsuit against Biden and his business partners, hedge fund managers Michael Lewitt and Amer Rustom, allege they are in violation of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and have committed fraud related to their investments in Americore and another company, Diverse Medical Management. The documents, prepared in March, were never submitted to the court and sources now say the lawsuit is headed for a settlement.

In the documents, Grant White, the former CEO of Americore, makes detailed allegations that Biden’s corrupt business practices helped drive his company into bankruptcy. White also alleges that Biden and Lewitt improperly took money meant for company operations and lined their own pockets. He further alleges that Biden failed to make good on promises that his political connections would deliver large investments from the Middle East.

A filing in federal bankruptcy court in February by the federal trustee, Paul A. Randolph, alleges White has “grossly mismanaged” his business; “has not operated the hospitals in a manner that is consistent with public safety”; and “improperly siphoned money from the Debtors for his personal benefit.” The court subsequently removed White as CEO of Americore by the court. In a lengthy missive to legal commentator Jonathan Turley’s blog in March, Michael Lewitt questioned White’s credibility at length.

However, White was prepared to submit a sworn declaration in the ongoing lawsuit against Biden and his business partners backing up his allegations. Further, he turned over a significant number of primary documents undergirding these claims that were reviewed for this article.

“[Biden told me] there’s not a single door in the country that we can’t open. So if I wanted to meet, you know, the head of Google, it’s a phone call,” White says. “He always represented himself as the fundraiser for his brother’s campaigns… he was the guy raising the money and so he knew everybody.”

According to White, James Biden, along with hedge fund managers Michael Lewitt and Amer Rustom, became enamored of Americore’s business model and approached White about investing in the company. They agreed to enter into business together on the promise that Biden and his partners would be able to deliver upwards of $30 million to invest in Americore.

Questions About a Loan Backed by Biden’s Vacation House

White says the big investment money never materialized. Not only that, as Americore struggled to keep the doors open at rural hospitals it owned, White alleges that Biden – who eventually had business cards declaring him a “principal” at the company – improperly diverted money from loans made to Americore for his own personal use. According to White, Biden approached him in January of 2018 and told him his Florida vacation home had been damaged in Hurricane Irma a few months prior, and his insurance would not cover the repairs.

Biden owns a six-bedroom vacation home on Keewaydin Island near Naples, Florida. His brother vacationed there when he was vice president. Biden spent $2.5 million purchasing the house in 2013, a questionable expense considering he would later be slapped with a lien by the IRS for failing to pay $589,000 in 2013 federal taxes. (In 2016, Biden tried sell the house for $5.9 million – it eventually sold in 2018, after sustaining hurricane damage, for $1.35 million.)

In addition to the damage sustained by the vacation home, White says Biden was deeply concerned about paying back a personal loan that was due, which was secured by the vacation house. He was worried about losing his vacation home, so he approached White. “There were financial challenges there and I’m an investment banker, so I was trying to help him figure out how to solve his problems … I’m a problem solver and I considered him a friend,” White says.

Personal Loans Allegedly Tied Up with Business Loans

At the same time, Americore was experiencing cash flow problems. White had taken out a series of “merchant cash advances” – easy to obtain, high interest business loans – to keep Americore operating. “I needed a short-term bridge [loan] and I didn’t feel like taking another MCA because they were burning a hole in my pocket,” White says. “So [Biden] made some phone calls and he basically agreed to get $2 million – but of that, a significant portion went to him.”

In his never-submitted legal declaration, White recounts the following:

In January of 2018 Lewitt arranged for his hedge fund to loan Americore $2 million as a bridge loan while we awaited the larger investment. Jim Biden directed me to loan him approximately $400,000 of this money for him to use to repay a past-due personal loan secured by his house in Florida. Subsequently, in additional bridge loans from Lewitt’s hedge fund, Biden took additional amounts totaling approximately $250,000. The approximately $650,000 was originally intended to be used for Americore working capital. Jim Biden promised that the approximately $650,000 would be paid back out of the multi-million investment coming from overseas that was imminent and certain. Jim Biden, however, has never repaid the approximately $650,000 to Americore, instead only paying back approximately $25,000. Americore has been charged forbearance fees and interest on this despite the fact that Biden took that money.

In March, Politico also reported that “a former Americore executive has told POLITICO that James Biden had more than half a million dollars transferred to him from the firm as a personal loan that has not yet been repaid.” According to White, in the paperwork filed in bankruptcy court, a line item listed under “Summary of Assets and Liabilities” in the amount of $650,000 represents the company’s outstanding loan to Biden.

Sources familiar with Americore say the personal loan Biden needed to pay back was to Joey Langston, whon he owed hundreds of thousands of dollars. Langston is a lawyer and businessman who previously raised money for Joe Biden. In 2008, Langston pleaded guilty to conspiracy to bribe a state judge in Mississippi, a crime for which he served nearly three years in prison and was disbarred. The bribery charge was related to Langston’s work as a criminal defense attorney for the infamous lawyer Dickie Scruggs, who eventually did prison time himself.

Scruggs was famous for his work obtaining a $248 billion tobacco settlement on behalf of several states in 1998 – Scruggs’ cut of the settlement was was somewhere around $300 million. According to Curtis Wilkie’s book on Scruggs, The Fall of the House of Zeus, Scruggs retained James Biden’s lobbying outfit, the Lion Hall Group, to lobby for passage of legislation related to the settlement in the Senate, to help secure the support of Joe Biden, who was key to the legislation’s passage. Joe Biden supported the legislation, though it did not pass.

Mixing Politics and Private Gain

Despite the bribery charge, James Biden later went into business with Langston – both were affiliated with a company called Trina Healthcare that promised a new treatment for diabetes. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services stopped paying for Trina’s diabetes treatment in 2009, citing evidence that it wasn’t effective.

Last year, the founder of Trina Healthcare, G. Ford Gilbert, also pleaded guilty to bribery charges related to an attempt to force passage of a bill in the Alabama legislature that would require the state to pay for the company’s diabetes treatment. Asked to confirm that Langston was the source of Biden’s loan, White wouldn’t confirm or deny Langston was the source of the loan Biden wanted to pay back. Langston did not return a request for comment.

However, a report by ProPublica in February confirms that Biden has an extensive history of taking out sizable personal loans from friends and business associates, and many of these generous lenders have political ties to his brother. Among those lenders was John Hynansky, a Ukrainian-American businessman and donor to Joe Biden’s campaigns, who in 2015 gave Biden a $500,000 loan that “came as Biden’s brother faced financial difficulties related to his acquisition of a multimillion-dollar vacation home,” according to Politico.

According to White, Biden was not the only one laundering money through Americore. In his declaration submitted to the court, which can be read here and here, White says Biden’s business partner Michael Lewitt was taking money from the hedge fund he managed and giving it to himself, using Americore as a pass-through:

On more than one occasion, Michael Lewitt directed his hedge fund to loan Americore money for his own personal use. On approximately April 18th of 2019, Michael Lewitt directed his hedge fund to loan $960,000 to Americore’s payroll account. He then directed me to pay him $950,000 via wire from the Americore account to Lewitt’s personal bank account. The money transferred on April 22, 2019. Lewitt told me he needed $950,000 so he could pay his personal IRS tax lien.

To buttress these allegations, White submitted a copy of a wire transfer in the amount of $950,000 dated April 19 of last year. A source close to Lewitt disputes this allegation. The source says that although the wire transfer went to Lewitt personally, it was to pay back a loan from Lewitt’s hedge fund, and further, Lewitt hasn’t had any tax liens in the last few years.

While White says he tolerated Biden and Lewitt’s unusual financial arrangements because he wanted to help out friends, the other reason Biden and Lewitt’s alleged skimming didn’t trouble him was that he believed Biden’s promises that he would raise much larger sums for Americore, and strung him along with repeated promises that tens of millions of dollars in investment money would arrive imminently.

White says he had almost no role in these efforts to raise money overseas. A lawsuit filed last year by Tennessee businessman Michael Frey and Dr. Mohannad Azzam, owners of Diverse Medical Management, against James Biden, and involving Americore, confirms that Biden and Lewitt also promised them that they would raise money from Qatar and a large Turkish concern, Dogan Holdings.

Despite the promise to raise an initial $30 million for Americore and much more later, White says the money for Americore never materialized. Among the reasons White was told that money didn’t come through: their investors ran afoul of Trump administration sanctions on foreign businesses.

“[Trump] put some stuff in place where it became incredibly difficult to get money from places like Qatar because they were doing business with Iran,” he says. A source close to Lewitt flatly denies that sanctions were ever a fundraising issue for Lewitt and Biden calling them “nonsense.”

Potentially Pitching to Chinese Financiers

There was, however, one notable instance where White says he did assist in raising funds for Americore. White he flew to New York and briefed James Biden and Joe Biden’s son Hunter on Americore’s business model. “Hunter wanted to hear my story cause you were going to go pitch it to its Chinese partners that he was working for,” White says. He also confirms that James and Hunter frequently worked together. “They were definitely attached at the hip in some things,” White says. White also makes a passing reference to this episode in the court filing: “I also met Hunter Biden, who was trying to arrange financing from China.”

Hunter Biden has been facing accusations that he exploited his father’s political connections for profit, specifically that he raised large sums for his hedge fund from Chinese investors after he accompanied his father on a trip to China while the latter was vice-president. In a New Yorker profile last year, Hunter Biden also admitted to taking what appears to be an $80,000 bribe from a Chinese businessman with close ties to the government.

Neither Michael Lewitt or a representative for Hunter Biden would comment on White’s accusations. A lawyer for James Biden said he could not comment on the accusations owing to laws in Tennessee, where the lawsuit originated, that limit what attorneys can say about ongoing litigation.

White strongly disputes the charges of mismanagement against him and says the paper trail left by Americore’s bankruptcy will show that Biden and Lewitt played a disproportionate role running the company into the ground and that he has taken minimal compensation during his tenure leading the company. He also alleges that the only reason he had to declare bankruptcy for Americore was that Michael Lewitt improperly gained access to the company’s accounts and took money for himself.

To that end, White has provided additional documentation showing tens of thousands of dollars of bank transfers between one of Americore’s hospitals and an account set up for Lewitt’s hedge fund, known as Third Friday Fund. White alleges that Lewitt continued to raid funds even after was he was notified the company was in Chapter 11.

“I’ve been stuck in the hospital business paying massive overheads with no money and surviving for two and a half years,” he says. “And I’ve never really been able to implement the [business] model. It’s very frustrating.” A source close to Lewitt again denies the allegation he improperly accessed Americore’s accounts and wrongly took money from the company.

Of Course, Lawsuits Filed

The legal declaration that was the source of White’s allegations were prepared as part of lawsuit originally filed last year by Tennessee businessman Michael Frey and his partner Dr. Mohannad Azzam, owners of Diverse Medical Management and Azzam Medical Services. Frey and Azzam’s allegations closely mirror many of White’s allegations – they also claim they were being strung along with promises of large sums of money from Biden and Lewitt to acquire their health-care businesses that never materialized. The lawsuit further alleges Frey and Azzam were pushed to take out loans and expand their business operations.

They made these investments with their own money, on the assurance that they would be paid back when Biden helped secure investments from Middle Eastern investors. Eventually, Frey and Azzam became overextended and their dire financial situation forced them to file suit against Biden and his partners.

According to a December report from Knox News, the FBI is investigating an incident where Frey received an envelope containing “what appeared to be blood-stained currency from a Middle Eastern country commonly known as a haven for terror groups and a ‘torture ticket’ — a voucher for the infliction of torture.” The newspaper withheld the name of the Middle Eastern country at the FBI’s request.

Along with Biden, Lewitt, and Rustom, White was originally a defendant in Frey’s lawsuit. White has reportedly presented detailed evidence of Biden and Lewitt’s mismanagement of Americore to Frey and his legal team, who found it convincing and asked that White be removed as a defendant.

“White has provided to Plaintiffs voluminous electronic evidence exonerating him in this Action and demonstrating that he too was a victim of the fraudulent actions of Defendants James Biden, Amer Rustom, Michael Lewitt, and Platinum Group USA, Inc., including documents indicating that millions of dollars in funds may have been taken by these defendants outside of the ordinary course of business,” notes a February court filing from Frey and his attorney.

Alleged Violations of Racketeering Law

Following that development, however, Frey and Azzam’s lawsuit has stalled, even though Frey and Azzam’s attorneys prepared a new filing that was never submitted to the court, which was reviewed for this article and can be read here. The filing incorporates White’s allegations, along with the supporting documentation he provided, as well as multiple heated communications from Lewitt that they allege are inappropriately threatening. The filing alleges that the cumulative behavior of Biden and his partners constitutes a violation of RICO statutes:

The Investor Defendants participated in the operation and management of an association-in-fact enterprise whose aim was to enrich themselves with foreign investment under the guise of investing in companies based in the United States, including but not limited to Plaintiffs and Americore. The Enterprise was formed for the common purpose of skimming investment into target companies through fraudulent loans and wires or ostensibly legal consulting fees. The Enterprise constituted an unlawful and continuing enterprise that has driven at least two companies into dire financial straits or bankruptcy.

Other allegations in the filing against Biden and his partners include common law and promissory fraud, civil conspiracy, and tortious interference with business relationships. A source close to Frey says recent financial pressures are one reason the filing making these allegations was never filed and Frey and Azzam are now trying negotiate a settlement in the lawsuit. Frey and Azzam’s company, Diverse Medical Management, does extensive work in nursing homes and the company has suffered serious financial hardships as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/21/lawsuit-documents-allege-james-biden-committed-fraud-racketeering/,2020-05-21
"'Joking' Or Not, Biden’s ‘You Ain’t Black’ Remark Reeked Of Identity Politics","In the pages of the Washington Post Friday, writer Jonathan Capehart spent 650 words or so explaining why Biden’s viral comment from only a few hours prior was “clearly a joke.”

The remark Capehart addresses in his article, titled “Come on. Biden’s ‘you ain’t black’ comment was clearly a joke,” occurred on an episode of “The Breakfast Club,” wherein the former vice president and presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee closed out the show with the startling and cringey comment, “I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”

“When heard in the context of the previous 17 minutes and 21 seconds, you know that Biden is joking around,” Capehart writes in Biden’s defense. “Perhaps he got a little too comfortable talking to a community with which he has a strong relationship that spans decades. Add to that being the vice president to the nation’s first black president and you know his affinity with black folks runs deep.”

Biden’s senior adviser Symone Sanders took the same line, insisting the former vice president’s comment was “in jest.”

The comments made at the end of the Breakfast Club interview were in jest, but let’s be clear about what the VP was saying: he was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump’s any day. Period. — Symone D. Sanders (@SymoneDSanders) May 22, 2020

Biden’s comment, which naturally exploded on Twitter, drew criticism from detractors who said Biden should stay locked away in his basement, away from the cameras. But they also garnered insane defenses from the likes of Nikole Hannah-Jones, who recently secured the Pulitzer Prize for her fallacy-laden 1619 Project for the New York Times.

Biden later apologized for his “cavalier” comments, rendering any defense of them as “clearly a joke” irrelevant.

MORE: ""I shouldn't have been such a wise guy,"" @JoeBiden said later in the call with the @usblackchambers ""I shouldn't have been so cavalier. … No one should have to vote for any party based on their race, their religion, their background."" — Ed O'Keefe (@edokeefe) May 22, 2020

But the problem with Biden’s remark was never its being too serious. Conservatives criticizing his comment weren’t concerned about the former vice president being “racist,” at least in the meaningless way today’s left uses the term.

Capehart’s reminder of Biden’s “being vice president to the nation’s first black president” or his “affinity with black folks” was unnecessary, for detractors didn’t take offense to Biden’s utterance out of a persuasion that he hates black people.

Rather, Biden’s remark confirms the Democrat’s unwillingness to see black voters as people, as individuals, rather than as a monolithic voting bloc.

According to progressives like Biden and Hannah-Jones, black people who don’t vote for Biden “ain’t black,” in the same way that women who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 “betrayed their gender.” Republicans are clearly far too sexist, too homophobic, too white, and too Christian to garner support from any woman, gay person, minority, or unbeliever. It’s absurd. People don’t vote with the color of their skin.

But despite Biden’s many gaffes, this wasn’t one. The former vice president didn’t misspeak. This commentary aligns with the same nonsense that escapes his mouth on a regular basis as part of his belief system, such as the idea that being black is synonymous with being poor and uneducated — a comment he tried to walk back quickly after realizing its implications.

Or his notion that choosing a VP from a higher perch in the intersectional hierarchy is morally superior to selecting someone based on their qualifications, character, or even likability. It’s why in the same “Breakfast Club” interview, he made sure to note for the record that he’s considering not just one, but “multiple” black women — two cheers for identity politics — to be his 2020 running mate. “I guarantee you, there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple,” he said.

The same Democrats who so desperately want to win back the portion of the electorate they lost to Donald Trump in 2016 are unwilling to see them as unique and individual voters, continuing ever to view them only as a caricatured group.

Counterpoint to Biden: If voters have a problem figuring out whether they’re for him or Trump, listening to a few more of his asinine interviews ought to clear things up.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/22/clearly-a-joke-or-not-bidens-you-aint-black-comment-reeked-of-identity-politics/,2020-05-22
Joe Biden Needs A Class On Political Correctness,"The word that best sums up Joe Biden’s political career is “folksy.” He’s the very image of the old school Irish politician with the wink and the smile, the firm handshake, kissing babies and making slightly off color jokes. That last one has gotten him in trouble a few times as it did Friday when he was interviewed by Charlemagne tha God.

Biden told Charlemagne, or is it “Mr. Tha God?” I don’t know, but he said that if a voter can’t “decide between Trump and Joe Biden then they ain’t black.” Dismay at Biden’s remark poured in from both sides of the political divide. It is the disappointment from the progressive left that must be his biggest concern. But here is the thing, Biden’s “joke” would not have been controversial in the 1990s, back when Bill Clinton was “the first black president.” That is still the world that Joe Biden lives in.

We got a taste of this back in the 2008 presidential cycle when Biden got in hot water for cracking wise about Indian Americans. If you recall he made a joke to a South Asian man about how you can’t go into a 7-11 without a slight Indian accent. In all honesty it’s a stretch to call that offensive, I don’t want to shock anyone but Indian Americans do commonly own convenience stores, there was a Simpsons character based on it. There was a also an early 2000s South Asian theater company in New York called Desipina which ran a festival of seven eleven minute plays set in a convenience store.

But what is the key difference between the members of Desipina and Biden? They are South Asian and Biden isn’t. This is really the key aspect of political correctness and intersectionality that Joe Biden doesn’t quite comprehend. In most cases it is not so much the speech itself that is offensive but the identity of the speaker that makes it so. Progressive whites and those in their orbit have learned a whole set of rules regarding all of this, from cultural appropriation to tone policing, Uncle Joe Biden it seems has not.

In a fascinating, now-deleted tweet from recent Pulitzer Prize winner Nikole Hannah Jones she wrote, “There is a basic difference between being politically black and racially black. I am not defending anyone [Biden], but we all know this and should stop pretending that we don’t.” Asked by another tweeter “What does this mean?” She replied, “If you don’t know it ain’t for you.” So I guess “we” don’t all “know this.”

Setting aside the weird rhetorical pirouette she makes in the response, basically saying “you not understanding my point proves my point,” let’s look at what she has to say about Biden. She is NOT defending him. That is made clear. But then she goes on to say that what he said about black voters is actually true. So, then, why isn’t she defending him? It’s because she is allowed to say it but old white Joe isn’t.

But don’t take my word for it, the Atlantic’s Jamele Hill says pretty much exactly the same thing, because she learned the same tired rules of political correctness that I have.

The issue wasn’t what Joe Biden said, because it was accurate. The issue was that it came from Biden. It also was clearly a joke that didn’t land. But I’m wondering where all this outrage was yesterday when y’all president declared his public devotion to a Nazi sympathizer. — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) May 22, 2020

I feel bad for Joe Biden on this score. He lived most of his life in a world where people could talk, even joke about race without a thousand pointed accusations of unconscious racism waiting to be fired off. In fact, millions and millions of Americans still reside in that world. Unfortunately for Joe Biden, the Democratic Party does not. Worse, he is running against Donald Trump whose voters not only don’t care if he is politically incorrect, many actually love it.

I would not be surprised if in some wing of the Biden basement today a lesson in privilege theory and intersectionality is taking place. Joe is saying things like, “So I can’t say that I think the Chinese laundry places do the best job?” and his advisors shaking their heads slowly and rubbing their eyes. Old ways die hard.

Of course, the underlying premise of Biden’s remarks, that blacks owe some perpetual allegiance to the Party of Jefferson and Jackson is in fact actually offensive to many people, especially black conservatives who do not feel themselves constrained by Hannah Jones’ concept of political blackness. But that’s not Joe Biden’s problem.

Joe Biden’s problem is that to progressives who are trepidatious of him, many who are well-educated white voters think this kind of gaffe is hard to forgive. His campaign will to try to see that it doesn’t happen again, but if they can’t control it in the basement, what hope do they have if he ever leaves and gets back on the campaign trail?

Charlamagne Tha God Says Biden’s Presidential Ticket Could Bring ‘Voter Depression’,"During an interview with MSNBC’s Joy Reid, radio host Charlamagne tha God said should the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden select a moderate vice president such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., it would cause “voter depression” among black voters in the 2020 election.

“On top of possible Russian interference and voter suppression, Dems have to worry about voter depression. That’s people staying home on election day because they just aren’t enthused by the candidate,” he said.

Charlamagne tha God criticized Biden for running a lack-luster campaign from his basement and expecting the black vote to turn out without making specific policy commitments to black voters.

“You can’t act like this is the most important election ever, but run a campaign from your basement and, you know, not make some real policy commitments to the black community. Not listening to some of the demands that the black community are making,” he said.

On Friday, Biden appeared on Charlamagne tha God’s radio show “The Breakfast Club,” where the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said black people aren’t black unless they vote for him.

“If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re voting for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,” Biden said.

Throughout the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Biden has cited the black vote as his key to victory. In the South Carolina primary, Biden received the endorsement of House Majority Whip James Clyburn who helped propel him to victory among South Carolina’s large population of black voters. Six out of ten black voters voted for Biden in southern states during the Democratic primaries. Biden’s tenure as the vice president to former President Barack Obama also bolsters his recognition among black voters.

During Biden’s interview with Charlamagne tha God, he said he is considering multiple black women including failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and California Sen. Kamala Harris.

“I’m not acknowledging anybody who is being considered, but I guarantee you, there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple,” Biden said.

After Biden’s interview on ‘The Breakfast Club,” he was forced to apologize for his racist remarks assuming all black people are Democrats. Biden said he regrets his “cavalier” comments about black voters.

According to Charlamagne tha God and Reid, Democrats and Biden are taking advantage of the black vote and an apology for Biden’s comment is not enough.

“Do you think there’s a risk that not just Joe Biden, but the Democratic Party in general just takes for granted that ‘black people are with us,’ so we don’t have to really give them anything else? They’re going to vote for us regardless,” Reid asked.

“I know that’s the attitude,” he responded. “That’s why I don’t even care about the words and the lip service. The apology is cool, but the best apology is actually a black agenda.”

Charlamagne’s Biden Interview Shows How Old Media Lost Its Way,"If the 2016 election revealed the limitations of old media, laying bare the power of unfiltered media use by Donald Trump paired with the inability of crippled institutions to haul their favored and deeply unpopular candidate over the finish line, 2020 may establish the new gatekeepers to America’s political debate. As a cultural factor, it matters more what Barstool Sports’ Dave Portnoy has to say about government lockdowns than virtually any politician. Mega-podcaster Joe Rogan’s opinions matter more than anyone on cable news. And as Joe Biden found out this weekend, you do not disrespect Charlamagne Tha God.

Most of the attention focused on Biden’s Friday interview was on his certainly memorable gaffe — first spun as a joke, later followed by an apology — that feels like it will dog him for the rest of this cycle. Here was the exchange:

‘Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.’ Charlamagne responded by saying ‘it has nothing to do with Trump,’ but that rather ‘I want something for my community.’ ‘Take a look at my record, man,’ Biden responded. ‘I extended the Voting Rights Act 25 years. I have a record that is second to none. The NAACP has endorsed me every time I’ve run. Come on, take a look at my record.’

First, the NAACP has actually never endorsed Biden, as they do not endorse candidates. And second, that record he references as “second to none” is exactly what Charlamagne was concerned about, particularly Biden’s 1990s crime bill. These are completely justifiable questions, and Biden’s dismissive attitude toward them, and toward Charlamagne, is the real problem for the candidate and his campaign.

“The Breakfast Club,” Charlamagne’s radio show, became a regular stopping point for 2020 candidates during the Democratic primary not just because of the size of its listenership but because of the intensity of his following and the diversity of his audience. Multiple major Democratic candidates gave Charlamagne time for lengthy interviews where they faced challenging questions, leading to more than one tough back and forth.

Now that he’s the presumptive nominee, Biden’s campaign wasn’t interested in giving Charlamagne any more time than absolutely necessary. Twice an aide tried to cut off the interview, prompting the host to express frustration — which led directly to the gaffe.

An aide tried to cut off the interview after 11 minutes because Jill Biden needed the office to do her own livestreamed event, but Biden agreed to stay on longer. After 18 minutes, the aide interjected again, leading Charlamagne to say jokingly: ‘You can’t do that to black media.’ ‘I do that to white media and black media because my wife has to go on at 6 o’clock,’ Biden said, looking at his watch: ‘Uh oh. I’m in trouble.’ ‘Listen, you’ve got to come see us when you come to New York, V.P. Biden,’ Charlamagne said. ‘It’s a long way until November. We’ve got more questions.’ ‘You’ve got more questions?’ Biden replied. ‘Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.’

Biden’s supporters in old media quickly attempted to spin the “you ain’t black” comment. The Washington Post’s Jonathan Capehart as a casual joke, while The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones and The Atlantic’s Jemele Hill both defended Biden’s comment as making a justifiable distinction between people who are “racially black” and “politically black.” As David Marcus notes:

Setting aside the weird rhetorical pirouette [Jones] makes in the response, basically saying “you not understanding my point proves my point,” let’s look at what she has to say about Biden. She is NOT defending him. That is made clear. But then she goes on to say that what he said about black voters is actually true. So, then, why isn’t she defending him? It’s because she is allowed to say it but old white Joe isn’t.

But that spin won’t gain much traction, certainly not with Charlamagne, who joined Joy Reid this weekend to say that should Biden select a white woman as his running mate, it could bring about “voter depression.” “You can’t act like this is the most important election ever, but run a campaign from your basement and, you know, not make some real policy commitments to the black community. Not listening to some of the demands that the black community are making.”

In past elections, politicians could operate under the illusion that by talking to the establishers of The Narrative guiding public opinion at old-guard publications could accomplish their goals. That’s impossible now. You can have all the defenders at The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Atlantic you want. But it really doesn’t matter by comparison to the influence of the new gatekeepers, who, unlike the old and tired media institutions, have a relationship with their audiences built on trust and respect.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/26/charlamagnes-biden-interview-shows-how-old-media-lost-its-way/,2020-05-26
Here's 25 Questions Joe Biden Needs To Answer About China,"Communist China poses a greater threat to America and our interests abroad than any other nation in the world.

If it wasn’t clear prior to the spread of the Chinese coronavirus, resulting largely from the Chinese Communist Party’s Chernobyl-like response, the subsequent threats should crystallize this point. It has acted malevolently toward the U.S., our European and Anglosphere allies, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and India, and across the South China Sea.

Countering the CCP is essential to preserving American life, limb, and liberty. The public deserves to know what presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s approach to China would be.

After all, this is a man who sat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for three decades. Biden ultimately chaired or served as its ranking member from 1997 on, during a career at the senior-most levels of government spanning almost the entirety of U.S.-China engagement. As a longtime senator and then vice president, Biden never once acted to scuttle the integrationist-accommodationist policy that has left America in such a perilous position.

This is to say nothing of the disturbing appearance of corruption surrounding Biden’s tenure as vice president, in which he managed the “China portfolio,” while his son Hunter contemporaneously entered into an apparent sweetheart Chinese investment deal.

Thus far in the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has flippantly downplayed the threat from China, only to quickly walk back his comments when he faced backlash. He attacked the Trump administration for “xenophobia” in enacting a travel ban early in the coronavirus crisis, only later to backtrack on that too. Now, Biden is trying a new tack: Portray himself as tougher on China than Trump.

This assertion is belied by his historical rhetoric and action, in contrast with a Trump administration that explicitly rejected the status quo by way of its national security strategy. That strategy notes the flaws of a premise to which Biden has long subscribed — that “engagement with rivals and their inclusion in international institutions and global commerce would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy partners” — and the Trump administration has acted accordingly.

The former vice president must tell us whether his views and policy prescriptions have markedly changed, or if his presidency would represent a reversion to the status quo ante.

Here are 23 questions the press ought to ask him but almost certainly won’t:

1. Does Biden still believe, as he remarked during a 2011 speech, that “a rising China is a positive, positive development, not only for China but for America and the world writ large”?

2. Does Biden regret his support for granting permanent normal trade relations to China, setting it up for accession to the World Trade Organization that would supercharge its drive toward superpower status?

3. Does Biden believe the Obama administration’s responses, or lack thereof, to China’s rampant theft of intellectual property, militarization of the South China Sea, catastrophic hack of the Office of Personnel Management, and liquidation of Central Intelligence Agency assets were sufficient, and successfully checked China’s ambitions? If not, what would he have done differently? Did he propose such alternatives as vice president?

4. Does Biden disavow the Obama administration’s signing of a 2013 memorandum of understanding — following intense lobbying of the former vice president by Chinese leaders — granting Chinese companies continued access to U.S. capital markets, in spite of their unique noncompliance in skirting basic auditing and reporting requirements, resulting in numerous frauds?

5. Does the former vice president think it appropriate for former Obama administration national security officials to lobby on behalf of Huawei, the CCP-tied, national security-threatening, alleged U.S.-lawbreaking linchpin of China’s plan for control over global communications?

6. Will Biden disclose any and all funding directly or indirectly emanating from Chinese sources for the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement?

7. Would a President-Elect Biden take a congratulatory call from Taiwan’s president, and express ambiguity regarding the “One China” policy prior to dealing with the CCP?

8. Would a Biden administration explicitly recognize the ruling CCP as a “Marxist-Leninist Party,” “hostile to the United States,” that harbors hegemonic ambitions?

9. More fundamentally, would a Biden administration recognize that China poses the greatest threat of all to America?

10. Would every member of a Biden Cabinet adopt policies geared toward countering China, or ceasing cooperation with it?

11. Would a President Biden continue the Trump administration’s military buildup aimed at countering China’s aggression?

12. Specifically, would a President Biden prioritize significant funding of missile defense and the Space Force in his budgets?

13. Would a President Biden continue to vacate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty?

14. Would a President Biden continue accelerating naval activities throughout the Indo-Pacific?

15. Would a President Biden explicitly encourage U.S. companies to move their supply chains out of China?

16. Would a President Biden impose tariffs as a means of creating leverage over China in a bid to achieve free, fair, and reciprocal trade?

17. Would a President Biden use every possible measure to counter China’s efforts to monopolize strategically significant fields, such as 5G telecommunications?

18. Would a President Biden maintain the substantially increased powers of the executive branch over conducting Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States reviews of transactions that might represent national security threats, and use it to scuttle relevant deals?

19. Would a Biden administration sanction Chinese entities doing business with sanctioned Iranian entities?

20. Would a Biden Department of Justice maintain the Trump administration’s China Initiative, aimed at preventing and prosecuting Chinese espionage and hacking efforts?

21. Would a Biden administration engage in a comprehensive strategic communications effort aimed at the CCP, including resolutely challenging its propaganda, delivering Mandarin pro-democracy and anti-CCP messages, and highlighting tyrannical CCP actions?

22. Would a Biden administration maintain restrictions on visas for Chinese students and scholars in strategically significant disciplines, and investigate and expose potentially corrupting Chinese funding of American higher ed institutions?

23. Would a President Biden order that the savings of U.S. government employees not be invested in funds with weightings toward Chinese companies antithetical to America’s interests?

America awaits Biden’s answers.

Biden’s Pro-Cop Past May Hurt Him With Progressive Mob,"Until today, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has been deafeningly silent on the radical anti-police movement gaining steam among progressives in his party.

The Democratic nominee has yet to personally speak on the issue, but Biden spokesman Andrew Bates claimed on Monday that “Biden does not believe that police should be defunded.”

Biden’s hesitance on the issue may reflect a realization that this is going to be a delicate issue for his campaign. But his past statements on law enforcement have been less careful, and are desperately at odds with current progressive calls to “defund” and “abolish” the police.

In July 2012, when he and then-President Obama were running for reelection, Biden touted that they were “honored to accept the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations,” in a tweet signed “Joe” to indicate it was personally written by Biden.

The President and I are honored to accept the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations. –Joe — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 26, 2012

Biden was the reason that the NAPO endorsed Obama in 2008 and 2012, according to NAPO’s executive director, Bill Johnson. Now, Johnson adds, police are no longer seeing Biden as an ally.

While organizations like Black Lives Matter and radical wings of the Democratic party call for the defunding of police departments, Biden made a point to criticize Obama’s Republican opponent Mitt Romney in 2012 for cutting police jobs and funding.

“Romney Economics means fewer teachers, fewer firefighters, and fewer police officers,” Biden warned.

Romney Economics means fewer teachers, fewer firefighters, and fewer police officers: http://t.co/ruNTxNG9 — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 12, 2012

In May 2012, Biden bragged about his track record of increasing police funding, reminding everyone that “In 2009, VP Biden helped secure $1 billion in grants to hire and rehire police officers around the country.”

In 2009, VP Biden helped secure $1 billion in grants to hire and rehire police officers around the country: http://t.co/4HvmDaJv — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 11, 2012

Two months later, he promised “Barack and I will continue to do everything we can to keep police officers across the country on the beat.”

Barack and I will continue to do everything we can to keep police officers across the country on the beat. –Joe — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 26, 2012

In 1994, Biden played a key role in crafting the 1994 crime bill as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen. Cory Booker dubbed Biden the “Architect of Mass Incarceration” for his work on the crime bill.

The women on Biden’s shortlist for VP candidates have also mostly dodged direct support for the movement to “defund the police.”

Rep. Val Demings (D.-Fla.), a former police chief, hinted that she was not in favor of defunding or abolishing police departments, posting on Twitter that “we must ensure legislative efforts do not prevent America’s finest sons and daughters from seeking a career in law enforcement.”

To protect our communities and the life, liberty, and safety of every American, it is vital that we hold bad cops accountable, end unjust practices, increase transparency, and refocus police on their core mission: to protect and serve every American, regardless of their race. pic.twitter.com/CgLGKoQbja — Rep. Val Demings (@RepValDemings) June 8, 2020

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who the Biden campaign was reportedly vetting, had previously introduced a bill in 2017 that increased funding and manpower for law enforcement.

2018 Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who has vocalized interest in being Biden’s running mate, bragged in a 2018 campaign pamphlet about supporting “a living wage for law enforcement,” drawing a contrast with her opponent.

If the Biden campaign doesn’t want to alienate a vocal wing of the Democratic party, he’s going to have to explain the strong support for police that he previously touted.

Media Goes Nuts On Trump’s Taxes And Ignores Joe Biden’s Tax Dodging,"The breathless coverage over the Supreme Court decision requiring disclosure of President Trump’s financial records demonstrates the continued focus on the wrong set of tax returns. While spending years speculating wildly on the contents of Trump’s financial records, both the liberal media and congressional Democrats have ignored an important story hiding in plain sight: The legally questionable tax maneuverings of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

While allowing Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. to subpoena the president’s records in a criminal probe of Trump’s businesses, seven justices demanded additional scrutiny of congressional subpoenas for similar documents. As one report described it, the justices believed lower federal courts “did not do enough to examine Democratic lawmakers’s claims that they needed the records as part of inquiries aimed at strengthening laws combating a wide range of ills including money laundering, official conflicts of interest, and foreign influence in U.S. elections.”

That bar could present a significant obstacle for congressional Democrats. Even as party leaders indefatigably pursue Trump’s tax returns, they have scrupulously avoided answering legitimate questions about Biden’s, raising questions about their motives.

Biden Avoided Self-Employment Taxes

One year ago, Biden and his wife released tax returns covering 2016 through to 2018. At that time, the Wall Street Journal noted that, by characterizing more than $13 million of income from speaking and writing engagements as profits from two corporations rather than wage income, the couple avoided paying nearly $500,000 in self-employment taxes. Tax experts interviewed by the WSJ called the scheme “pretty aggressive” and unjustified given that the income came from their own work product, as opposed to any product or service created by a larger corporation.

The development raises several fundamental questions about Biden and his campaign. First, hypocrisy. During the primaries, Biden released campaign ads claiming “Obamacare is personal to me.” Biden and Democrats want to highlight their supposed support for Obamacare and individuals with pre-existing conditions during the fall campaign.

Of the 3.8 percent self-employment tax the Bidens avoided, 0.9 percent funds Obamacare, and the other 2.9 percent funds Medicare. As a result, Biden’s tax scheme allowed him to avoid paying $119,570 in Obamacare taxes, and another $385,280 in Medicare taxes. How can Biden claim to support Obamacare when he refused the opportunity to put his money where his mouth is and dodged the very taxes that fund the law?

Second, policy. Throughout the presidential primaries, Biden claimed that, unlike those of his Democratic competitors, his health care plan would not require a middle-class tax increase but would be funded instead by wealthy taxpayers. Yet Biden’s tax situation raises the obvious question of whether other wealthy individuals will engage in the kind of evasive maneuvers Biden used to skirt Obamacare taxes so they can avoid his new tax increases, leaving the middle class holding the bill.

Third, partisanship. The House Ways and Means Committee sued last year to obtain President Trump’s tax returns, claiming that it wants to examine the integrity of the auditing process the IRS used. But despite multiple experts calling the Biden’s tax maneuvers legally questionable, Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) has avoided answering questions about whether he will request an audit of Biden’s returns.

The fact that Neal and his colleagues have not pursued credible allegations against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee suggests the pursuit of Trump’s returns is a mere partisan political exercise. This one-sided examination of tax records, coupled with the Supreme Court’s rulings, may present legal obstacles, as Democrats now must attempt to defend their actions, and motives, in court.

‘Middle-Class Joe’ Is a Bunch of Malarkey

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there’s the issue of authenticity. The individuals shown in Biden’s campaign videos praising Obamacare are likely unaware Biden failed to pay taxes used to fund the law. They, and other working-class individuals like them, may not take kindly to “Middle-Class Joe” failing to pay nearly $500,000 in self-employment taxes — more than many working-class Americans will make in a decade.

Over the years, Biden has repeatedly used a simple phrase: “Don’t tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I’ll show you your values.” But when it came time for him to “cash in” following years in the public sector, Biden’s personal budget didn’t include hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes to pay for the Obamacare law he claims to value.

If the press wants to talk about tax returns, they should ask Biden about the yawning chasm between his claims and the values he expressed in his tax returns.

"Poll: If Election Were Held Today, Trump Would Beat Biden By A Lot","Despite the spate of recent polls showing former Vice President Joe Biden with a commanding lead over President Donald Trump, a new shock poll reveals Americans aren’t quite as eager to hand over their freedom as some have said.

According to RealClearPolitics’ latest aggregate of polls, Biden leads Trump by 8 points, 49.6 percent to 40.8. But a poll conducted for the Sunday Express by the Democracy Institute, a Washington-based think tank, reveals Americans aren’t buying the narrative the U.S. media are trying to advance.

Contrary to what the media would have us believe, 77 percent of the 1,500 likely voters surveyed do not view Mount Rushmore as a racist monument. When asked which of two phrases better fit their own thinking about race in America, 29 percent of participants indicated “Black Lives Matter,” and 71 percent marked “All Lives Matter.”

Most notably, rather than showing Biden with a sharp advantage, the survey forecasts a much tighter race, with each candidate receiving 47 percent of the national popular vote. Moreover, the Democracy Institute predicts that if the election were held today, Trump would win 309 electoral votes and Biden 229.

State-by-state data isn’t conclusive, considering the limited sample size, but the data indicates Trump is ahead in the battleground states of Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin by a margin of 48 percent to 44 percent, with 8 percent undecided. The poll puts Wisconsin in the Biden column, while giving Trump Minnesota and New Hampshire.

Trump is considered less likable than Biden. When asked which candidate respondents would be more inclined to invite for a barbecue, 33 percent chose Trump, while 51 percent chose Biden. Sixteen percent said neither. When asked if they believe Biden is in the early stages of dementia, however, 55 percent answered yes, and 40 percent no.

As virtually all recent polls have found, the Democracy Institute identified the massive enthusiasm gap between the two candidates. Seventy-seven percent of Trump voters are very enthusiastic about their candidate, compared to only 43 percent of Biden supporters. That explains why 81 percent of Trump voters say their choice was “a positive vote for [their] candidate” rather than a “negative vote against his opponent.” For Biden, only 29 percent said it was a positive vote, while a whopping 71 percent said it was negative.

Notably, participants were asked if they were “comfortable with your relatives, friends, and coworkers knowing how you vote.” Only 29 percent of Trump voters said yes, versus 82 percent of Biden voters. This “shy” vote phenomenon was one of the reasons polls were so wrong in 2016. Many pro-Trumpers, wanting to avoid stigma, simply won’t tell a colleague or even a pollster whom they plan to vote for.

Fifty-two percent of those surveyed believe Trump will be reelected. While 4 percent of Trump supporters indicated their vote could change by Election Day, 12 percent of Biden backers said they could change their minds.

Other signs bode well for Trump. Although he had no serious competition for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, his supporters have still turned out in large numbers throughout Republican primaries.

Just the News pointed out that in Pennsylvania, for example, 934,524 voted for Trump while only 914,904 voted for Biden. In Ohio, the candidates received 682,843 and 623,186 votes, respectively. In Florida, 86,000 more voted for Trump than for Biden. This pattern began early in the primary season, with Trump significantly outperforming past incumbent presidents in their equivalent primaries.

Moreover, not all of Bernie Sanders’s supporters will vote for Biden. As they did in 2016, some will stay home, and some will vote for Trump. NBC’s Shannon Pettypiece reported that “in 2016, about 216,000 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin voters backed the Vermont senator in the spring and Trump in the fall, according to an analysis of exit polling — well over twice the president’s total margin of victory in those states, which were critical to his electoral vote win in the face of a decisive popular vote loss.”

After the Russian collusion hoax, the impeachment hoax, and everything in between, corporate media has lost a lot of credibility. Americans have recently watched MSNBC’s Ali Velshi tell viewers the Minneapolis riots were “not generally speaking unruly” as an out-of-control fire raged in the background. They saw the Washington governor and Seattle mayor condone an “autonomous zone” set up by anarchists in the heart of the state’s largest city, and they’ve witnessed the toppling of statues of great Americans throughout the country.

It should come as no surprise that most voters do not believe Mount Rushmore is a racist monument, that America is an irredeemably racist nation that must be burned down and rebuilt, nor that Biden’s victory is a foregone conclusion. Not everybody is ready to hop on board the socialism train. Thank God for that.

Note: This poll of 1,500 likely voters was conducted July 1-3 by the Democracy Institute. Thirty-eight percent of those surveyed were Democrats, 38 percent were Republicans, and 24 percent were independents, with a margin of error of +/- 2.5 percent and a confidence interval of 95 percent.

"With $10 Trillion In Proposed Spending, Sanders Is In Charge Of Biden","Joe Biden began unraveling a new agenda that makes the Democrat presidential nominee appear more similar to the socialist senators he faced in crowded primaries than the center-left “moderate” he portrays, which was always a myth to begin with.

On Tuesday, Biden unveiled a new $775 billion proposal for government-run childcare with additional taxpayer programs for the elderly. The latest program comes just days after Biden announced a $2 trillion package to ensure “environmental justice” hashed out with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ team to pile onto the $7 trillion in spending already proposed, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. The total price tag for the Biden agenda now stands at nearly $10 trillion with more on the way, which is already triple what was put forward by 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

“We’re going to have a breathtaking opportunity,” Biden said as he rolled out his new economic agenda this month, “to rewrite our economy so that prosperity flows not just to CEOs, but to workers who actually build the country.”

While still a fraction of what Sanders and what Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren were proposing on the campaign trail just a few months ago, where various estimates ranged anywhere from $20 trillion to $60 trillion as if real money can cease to exist, the massive spend atop the nation’s largest debt burden ever shows Biden to be the hardest left candidate Democrats have ever nominated.

“From health care to climate change, to criminal justice, Biden has proposed ideas more ambitious and liberal than policies supported by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign,” read an article in McClatchy. “Biden’s current set of policy prescriptions would likely be considered radical if they had been proposed in any previous Democratic presidential primary.”

That story was published in September, five months before the Iowa caucuses.

When the Biden campaign released the 110-page “Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations” at the start of this month, endorsing free college, tripling Clinton’s tax hikes, and threatening officers for protecting the nation’s borders, it became clear Sanders was now running the show.

“The goals of the task force were to move the Biden campaign into as progressive a direction as possible, and I think we did that,” Sanders told NPR shortly after its release. “On issue after issue, whether it was education, the economy, health care, climate, immigration, criminal justice, I think there was significant movement on the part of the Biden campaign.”

Sanders also lauded the agreement: “The compromise they came up with, if implemented, will make Biden the most progressive president since FDR,” he said on MSNBC.

The task force features a litany of other leftist promises, including expansion of Social Security even though it is already reeling towards insolvency, raising the minimum wage, doing away with cash bail, and federalized preschool.

Rather than pivot to the center to court moderates, as is typical of general election candidates, Biden lurched to the left in a moment where he’ll likely get away with it. A new Fox News poll released on Sunday shows President Donald Trump running against the coronavirus more than Biden, with 29 percent of registered voters identifying the Chinese virus as the single most important issue facing the country. Meanwhile, Biden remains sheltered in his Delaware home waging a 21st-century version of an early-20th century campaign when candidates ran the entire race from their own front porch.

In the absence of the traditional scrutiny that comes with a conventional campaign and a Republican candidate, Biden’s leftward shift will fly under the radar. Perhaps it’s Biden’s turn to take an hour’s worth of questions in front of Chris Wallace. He won’t, of course, but the offer is there.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/22/bidens-10-trillion-in-proposed-spending-puts-bernie-sanders-in-charge-of-the-democrat-ticket/,2020-07-22
Biden's First-Day-In-Office Plan Is A Betrayal Of Working-Class Americans,"Sunday marks 100 days until the 2020 election. That might come as a surprise to some Americans, who are so used to being neck-deep in conventions, speeches and rallies by now, without them they’d forgotten how close we were. The Republican convention is now cancelled, and for the past few months Joe Biden has barely been seen outside his home, dodging questions from even his sympathetic press pool.

The former vice president ran his primary campaign as a moderate. He refused to go along with the more radical proposals of his opponents, instead relying on his old centrist reputation and key endorsements to harness the black working-class voters he plans to combine with the white workers who sent Donald Trump to the White House.

Since then in his work to unite the modern Democratic Party, his direction has shifted hard to the left, earning praise from proud socialist Bernie Sander, who reiterated Wednesday, “The reason … I think Biden has a chance to be the most progressive president since FDR is that is exactly what Joe Biden said to me.”

Still, just last week The New York Times’ David Brooks predicted day one of a Biden presidency would bring soothing quiet and an end to the divisive class hate his friends and colleagues have hurled down on powerless Americans for years. Joe, he assures the people who read David Brooks, will govern with “radical centrism” informed by his working-class sensibility. Pay no mind to the hard-left class-war argued by the advisers who are writing his policies and, given his rapid cognitive decline, will soon be helping him dress in the morning.

So who is more right, Bernie Sanders or David Brooks? Let’s see what Joe Biden says.

President Biden, Day One

“Day 1 of the Biden administration is going to be very busy!” his campaign site declares. And with a team of professional Democrats and veteran operatives at his side, this should be taken seriously. He’ll be far better situated, for example, than Trump was on his first day to accomplish a lot of what he plans.

So what does he plan? While there’s no official list just yet, in campaign events, interviews, and releases over the past year, Biden has teased it out for us. Thus far, his proposals run the gamut from international organizations to international treaties, from harsher regulations to reclaiming federal land from American workers, and from legal to illegal immigration. What’s missing — completely and utterly — from his plan is a single thing that helps the American working class he’s counting on to win.

Shortly after President Trump withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization for corrupt subservience to China’s communist dictator, its active dampening of Taiwanese coronavirus warnings, and its repeat and systemic failings, Biden promised to rejoin on day one of his presidency.

“Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health,” he wrote on Twitter. “On my first day as president, I will rejoin the WHO and restore our leadership on the world stage.”

It was second promise Biden had made to other world leaders, after last fall’s debate-stage promise to redo the Paris Climate Accord Trump withdrew from in June 2017. “The first thing I would do as president of the United States,” he pledged during CNN’s seven-hour climate change town hall, “is to call a meeting of all the nations who signed on to the accord in Washington, D.C., to up the ante. Because we have learned so much just in the past three years of the science, of what has to happen quicker. And the world knows it.”

The 5-7 p.m. town hall finished dead last in cable news ratings, averaging 600,000 viewers behind MSNBC and 1.4 million viewers behind Fox News. Ratings weren’t the point, Deadline Hollywood argued in CNN’s defense: left-wing activism was the point.

Hobbling American industry is just the beginning of President Biden’s “very busy!” first day in the Oval. “To immediately make progress on his climate agenda,” his campaign site reads,

Biden will take actions including requiring aggressive methane pollution limits for new and existing oil and gas operations; developing rigorous new fuel economy standards aimed at ensuring 100 percent of new sales for light- and medium-duty vehicles will be zero emissions and annual improvements for heavy duty vehicles…”

He doesn’t stop there. Next up, he plans to re-institute the ANWR Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ending energy exploration in the largely uninhabited north of the country — energy exploration long sought by Alaska. Next, he plans to ban all “new oil and gas leasing on public lands and waters.” Woe to the American workers and companies in an industry already hard-hit by the coronavirus depression.

After this, Biden gets the rest of the people on his to-do list. Not the American people, though: His focus is on the citizens of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.

On Monday, Biden pledged to “end the ‘Muslim ban’ on day one– day one,” referring to the administration’s extra scrutiny on immigration from countries with high rates of anti-Western terrorism or that are run by anti-American dictators, specifically Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Yemen, Libya, Nigeria, Somalia, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Tanzania and North Korea. Restrictions were also put in place on visits by Venezuelan government officials or their families.

The pledge followed his promise two months earlier to begin legalizing illegal immigrants to the United States, which he estimated at 11 million people, plus their children. “Number one, on day one, I’m sending, no matter what the state of this is, to the United States Congress a bill to provide for a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, number one, in the United States,” he told MSNBC. “Number two, every DACA student will be able to stay.”

A “very busy!” day indeed. Of course, his promises to the citizens of Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, El Salvador, and the rest of the world stand in stark contrast to what he plans to accomplish for the American worker on Day One, which is absolutely nothing.

For years Biden was a centrist voice in a Democratic Party drifting further leftward each day. Some hoped his nomination would mark a turn for the party more than a turn for the candidate. Just more than 100 days from the election, those hopes are dashed. American working-class voters should take stock of the man asking for their support and ask themselves if he’s still their man at all. On day one, they’ll get their answer.

Kamala Harris Has ‘No Remorse’ For Ambushing Biden In Primary Debates,"In June 2019, during the Democrat presidential primary debates, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) blasted the now-nominee, Joe Biden, insinuating he was a racist for applauding segregationist senators and opposing a 1970s federal busing program that put children in schools based on race:

… it’s personal and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. It was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.

Former Sen. Chris Dodd, a member of Biden’s vice presidential search committee, recently asked Harris about her attack on Biden in that first debate. Dodd told a longtime Biden supporter and donor, “She laughed and said, ‘That’s politics.’ She had no remorse.” The donor relayed the exchange to Politico on condition of anonymity.

Former California Democratic Party Chair, John Burton, said he told Dodd, “Look for someone who does no harm.” Burton explained he worries President Donald Trump and Republicans will weaponize Harris’ clash with Biden on the debate stage over race. Race relations have taken center stage in the media and the American psyche as race riots have been terrorizing major U.S. cities for two months now.

After the debate, Harris capitalized on her attack on Biden by echoing her point on Twitter and selling “that little girl was me” T-shirts.

There was a little girl in California who was bussed to school. That little girl was me. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/XKm2xP1MDH — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) June 28, 2019

Harris eventually backtracked on the position she took during the debate that the federal government “must step in” to assign children to schools based on race, and took a similar position to Biden on the subject, saying busing “is in the toolbox” of ways localities can apply a racial lens to schools.

During the debate, Biden fired back at Harris by pointing out that while she was working as a prosecutor, he was working as a public defender who fought for civil rights. Kamala’s record as a “tough on crime” San Francisco district attorney inspired a “Kamala Is a Cop” meme that did not sit well with leftists.

https://twitter.com/PistolVanBuren/status/1287536223708426240

With the Black Lives Matter movement driving nationwide demands to “defund” and even “abolish” police forces and encouraging a “cancel cops” culture, the 2019 meme has understandably aged poorly.

To shake her past and her critics, Harris co-wrote Democrats’ policing bill, and opposed the Republican JUSTICE ACT introduced by the first black man to ever serve in both chambers of Congress, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.).

Harris told reporters that Scott’s bill was “empty” and “We cannot proceed with what they’re offering.” Slipping in an adulation to Biden, she added, “There’s no question that if we [Democrats] are in the majority in the Senate and that if Joe Biden were president there would be a lot more movement.”

Despite Harris’s bad blood with Biden and record as a prosecutor, she has remained a leading VP candidate. With mounting pressure for Biden to select a veep based on race and sex, one former Biden adviser said Harris “checks everything that’s so important to [Biden].”

Another Biden confidant said, “Knowing him, Kamala is the best pick for him. Their politics are very similar. I would be surprised if it wasn’t her.”

Other VP hopefuls include Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), former national security adviser Susan Rice, and Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.).

Democrats Attempt To Derail Biden Burisma Probe As Election Nears,"Congressional Democrats are waging a full-fledged disinformation campaign to derail the Biden Burisma probe led by Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa on the Finance Committee and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

Earlier this month, top Democrat lawmakers demanded an FBI briefing accusing the Russians of providing information to Senate Republicans for their years-long investigation into the Biden family’s multiple conflicts of interest at the upper echelons of government. The investigation began in 2017, long before former Vice President Joe Biden launched a 2020 campaign for the presidency in 2019.

More explicitly, the Biden campaign charged Johnson with being a Russian agent by serving as “party to a foreign influence operation against the United States” in a memo reviewed by NBC, the news operation the colluded with a foreign left-wing think tank in an attempt to de-platform The Federalist just a month ago.

While the letter addressed to the FBI this month signed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, and Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner fails to address the Johnson-led probe directly, two sources who reportedly reviewed a classified addendum say the Republican probe is a primary area of concern, according to Politico.

“We are gravely concerned, in particular, that Congress appears to be the target of a foreign interference campaign, which seeks to launder and amplify disinformation in order to influence congressional activity, public debate, and the presidential election in November,” Democrats wrote, charging Johnson’s investigation with using materials supplied by the Kremlin to undermine the upcoming presidential election now less than 100 days away.

Johnson denied the unfounded allegations coming from the Democrats who served as the lead perpetrators of the great Russia hoax accusing President Donald Trump and members of his campaign of the same charges. That culminated in a more than two-year special counsel investigation that found not one person on the Trump campaign, let alone Trump himself, was acting on behalf of the Russian government to subvert American interests in the 2016 election.

“They’re simply wrong,” Johnson told Politico. “And Schiff is the last person to talk.”

Republicans intimately familiar with the details of the Grassley-Johnson probe told The Federalist that all material reviewed by those conducting the investigation has originated from records within government agencies and the Democratic public relations firm Blue Star Strategies, in addition to current and former U.S. government officials. Republicans cited one exception, which related to a limited records request from former Ukrainian diplomat Andrii Telizhenko pertaining to contacts with Democratic National Committee contractors, meetings with the Obama White House, and work history with Blue Star Strategies, a Hunter Biden-linked firm that has been subpoenaed for important information.

“After months of Democrat-led attempts to derail and marginalize the committee’s work, the Biden campaign and Democrat leaders are now engaging in a coordinated disinformation campaign targeting our investigation,” said Johnson spokesperson Austin Altenburg. “Chairman Johnson will not be deterred in his efforts to find the truth and provide that information to the American people.”

Questions surrounding the Biden family’s suspicious overseas activities have circulated for much of the last half-decade. They intensified with greater media scrutiny in the wake of Joe Biden’s entrance into the crowded Democratic primary in April last year, along with the amplified spotlight that came from Democrats’ recent impeachment attempt.

While serving as the “public face” of the Obama White House’s policy towards Ukraine in 2014, then-Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, began raking in upwards of $50,000 a month on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company notorious for corruption. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals he was being showered in excess compensation nearly double the salaries of the board members of exponentially larger corporations within the same industry. Biden possessed no prior experience in the energy industry.

Hunter Biden’s questionable foreign activity began earlier and extends to China, where the younger Biden boarded Air Force Two on a government trip to the east Asian adversary with his father and participated in a series of meetings with Chinese businessmen. What followed included a set of transactions that would benefit Hunter Biden’s firm, BHR. That included an approval for a business license in China and a joint acquisition of the Michigan motor company Henniges with a Chinese corporation, marking “The biggest Chinese investment into US automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

Still, congressional Democrats seeking to block Republican attempts to answer questions related to the arrangements sparks even more questions over what Democrats are attempting to hide.

A Potential Susan Rice Pick Raises More Questions About Hunter Biden’s Burisma Ties,"Former U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice vaulted to the top of the presidential veepstakes in recent weeks as Biden draws near making his final pick just weeks ahead of the Democratic convention, which the former vice president pledged Tuesday would come next week.

It’s “absolutely serious,” said Biden co-chair and Louisiana Congressman Cedric Richmond of Rice’s consideration Monday in Politico. Since leaving public life, Rice has maintained a high profile with major media appearances and released a memoir earlier this year where the last few pages featured a call to action rather than an explainer of the Obama White House foreign policy.

At the same time, other candidates routinely seen at the top of the list at least appear to have fallen by the wayside as more comes public over who stands in favor amid the process.

Biden already promised in March he would pick a woman running mate, narrowing down potential candidates to a single gender while the current political climate since then has placed added pressure that the vice presidential nominee be a woman of color in particular, though Biden has made no such commitment public.

Another top contender, California Democratic senator and former presidential rival Kamala Harris seems to have lost support from key players on the selection committee. When asked by the campaign about her remarks on the Democratic debate stage last summer when she ambushed Biden on race, Harris reportedly brushed it off to the distaste of committee members.

“She laughed and said, ‘that’s politics.’ She had no remorse,” former Connecticut senator and longtime Biden ally Chris Dodd told Politico.

That puts Rice, one of the most accomplished high-profile women of color in the Democratic Party who enjoys close relationship with the Biden family at the top of the list in Biden’s search.

A Rice selection however, also comes with raised questions over the Biden family’s shady overseas business dealings that has attracted the attention of government watchdogs and even a years-long investigation by the Senate that is still ongoing.

In addition to her previous role as the U.N. ambassador, Rice most recently served as the White House national security adviser in the Obama administration from 2013 until President Donald Trump took office. Rice, therefore, was the principle security advisor for the Obama White House as the Biden family operated under questionable arrangements involving foreign powers overseas and raising concerns from even those within the administration.

Rice entered the role in July of 2013. Several months later, then-Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, flew aboard Air Force Two on an official government trip to China where Hunter participated in a series of meetings with Chinese businessmen to build a Chinese private equity firm. Shanghai authorities approved then a Chinese business license for the firm with Hunter serving on the board just days after the trip. For the past six years, a Wall Street Journal analysis shows the firm has channeled at least $2.5 billion into automotive, energy, mining, and technology deals on behalf of investors. One of those deals includes a joint acquisition of the Michigan motor company Henniges in 2015 while Rice was still national security advisor marking “the biggest Chinese investment into U.S. automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

In 2014, Hunter Biden then joined the executive board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma raking in upwards of $50,000 a month while his father was the “public face,” of the Obama White House dictating U.S. policy towards Ukraine. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals he was being showered in excess compensation nearly double the salaries of board members with larger corporations within the same industry. Biden meanwhile, possessed no prior experience in the energy business.

Rice must answer then, whether she knew of Hunter Biden’s position, what she knew about it, and whether she ever discussed the issue with the vice president.

The arrangement even raised red flags by some in the State Department, where Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent who was the top official on Ukraine told congressional lawmakers during impeachment testimony last fall that he voiced discomfort over the situation with the White House in 2015 but was brushed aside.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent told House members during a private deposition in October. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation.”

The presence of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) within the Treasury Department over Hunter Biden’s overseas business activity also came public in February in the course of a Senate probe led by Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.

Whether Kent’s complaints or the knowledge of the Treasury Department’s existing reports made it to Rice remain unknown.

Why Electing Joe Biden Will Make The Culture War Even Worse,"When contemplating who the next president will be, a decent bet is that it will be Joe Biden’s pick for vice president. This is only a little tongue-in-cheek. I’m not sanguine about President Trump’s campaign or Biden’s capabilities.

Biden’s front-porch campaign has retreated to his basement, and he does not inspire confidence when he emerges. Even if Biden wins and becomes president, his administration will be run by a shadow president, or, more likely, by several people fighting for that role.

Factional differences, as well as ego and ambition, will animate and motivate this struggle. More so than the Republicans, Democrats find themselves riven by class divisions. The Democratic Party is now home for Wall Street and big business, as well as radical leftists who want to go full Robespierre on the rich. The Democrats are the party of socialists but their top tax reform priority is restoring a tax break for the wealthy who live in high-tax blue states. Indeed, their proposed plan for student loan forgiveness would help the well-to-do much more than the oppressed proletariat.

Biden spent his career as the senator from credit card companies. The Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party detests him because he is a corporatist whose style is to cut a deal between big business and big government, not to agitate for a socialist revolution. Amid these factions, someone will have to set an agenda, even if a President Biden is incapable of formulating one. Otherwise, the administration will fracture as disparate factions fight for control. A classic strategy in such cases is to encourage unity against a common foe.

Thus, the culture war will likely escalate under a Biden presidency, as it will be the one thing Democrats will agree on. Some pundits have speculated that a Biden presidency will cool off the culture war, but culture war is a Biden administration’s ticket out of internecine warfare. Fanning the flames will be a way to unite the Democrats who hate the rich and the Democrats who are the rich. This will be an extension of Obama’s “stray voltage” strategy, which consisted of provoking culture war battles the administration thought it could turn to its advantage in energizing its base.

Biden’s campaign is already using culture war issues to appease the radicals in his party. While he was once in favor of at least some restrictions on abortion, Biden now champions taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand until the point of birth. This is an extreme position even among pro-choice Democrats, but Biden’s camp was eager to satisfy the abortion lobby. Similarly, when the Supreme Court rebuked the Democrats for their continued harassment of the Little Sisters of the Poor, Biden’s campaign promised more attacks on the nuns.

There would likely be much more of this in a Biden administration, as whoever runs it attempts to hold the Democratic coalition together by starting cultural fights. And they would be limited only by their imagination. For instance, in education, they could use the IRS to try to shut down Christian schools over LGBT issues while using the leverage of federal money to force the teaching of the ahistorical 1619 Project or dangerous critical race theory in public schools.

In using this strategy, a Biden administration would be following the success of corporate America. Big business is finding that wokeness is an effective diversion: rainbow flags, Black Lives Matter banners and a few donations to “social justice” organization are cheap indulgences that throw a bone to the internal radicals while distracting the online mob. Woke capital is thereby allowed to be capital.

Thus, corporations that profit from Chinese slave labor today are winning plaudits for moralizing about the sins of America’s past. Most of the left is content to ignore what brands like Nike and Apple do overseas so long as they use their cultural and financial clout to support the left in America. Being on the “right” side of the culture wars at home gives them a pass to do whatever they want in China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the like.

Indeed, activism often gives businesses a pass on what they do in America. It helps that activists, academics, and mainstream media outlets are far more concerned with race, sex, and sexuality than class. For all of their supposed socialist fervor, today’s Democratic activists care more about pronouns than poverty. Poor people tend not to be woke enough for the new radical, intersectional left.

No doubt a Biden administration will try to move the country to the economic left, but it will want to do so in ways that don’t threaten the migration of Wall Street money and affluent professionals to the Democratic Party. The way to buy off the radicals in the party, including those in Congress, will be by giving them their way on culture war issues.

Those who think that electing Biden will reduce cultural conflict are likely to be disappointed if he is elected. The left will cut a deal with big business rather than call off its cultural offensive.

Will Biden Be The First Nominee In 80 Years To Refuse A Debate?,"Joe Biden has shut down debates this cycle, using the Wuhan coronavirus as the 77-year-old candidate’s excuse to call off challenges with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders when it’s actually become the Democrat nominee’s saving grace.

Now, as the general election season nears full bloom next month after each party’s nominating conventions, debates have re-entered the discussion as the Trump campaign requests more while Democrats and their allies in the media plea for Biden to steer clear of facing Trump head to head.

“Let’s Scrap the Presidential Debates,” headlined a New York Times opinion piece Monday.

“Biden better walk back any offers to debate Trump,” pushed the Boston Herald.

Others have been more direct.

“Whatever you do, don’t debate Trump,” former Clinton White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart urged Biden in a CNN piece last week, arguing not that Biden’s struggle to form coherent sentences could prove problematic but instead President Donald Trump will spout unchecked lies to the millions of voters watching.

Thomas Friedman at The New York Times called on Biden to skip the presidential tradition unless Trump released his tax returns and agrees to a fact-checking team validating or correcting claims in real time.

“I worry about Joe Biden debating Donald Trump,” Friedman wrote frankly.

Biden’s allies have reason to worry. While the presumptive Democratic nominee made it through a primary of more than 25 candidates this year despite making a series of slip-ups, Biden’s apparent cognitive decline has become ever clearer as live mistakes have become far more frequent over the course of the summer.

A Zogby poll shows 55 percent of voters believe Biden is in the early stages of dementia. The former vice president’s constant slip-ups have led the campaign to limit their candidate’s media appearances by running a 20th-century campaign. Warren G. Harding’s Ohio front porch has become Biden’s Delaware basement.

The tight control over Biden’s public appearances has led the campaign to now consider refusing to participate in the fall debates. The debates have become a fundamental presidential tradition that allow voters to compare their two choices for commander-in-chief side by side. Few presidents have avoided them since Franklin D. Roosevelt refused to debate Wendell Willkie in 1940, and none have refused a debate since 1972.

The excuse Roosevelt made, while also likely trying to hide a medical condition from the public, is nearly identical to the ones being flouted by the same party today: declaring the debate nothing more than a political stunt. Since the mid-20th century, however, debates have become a staple of the American electoral tradition, with the first televised match-up between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1960. Since then, presidential elections have typically featured debates between the two major-party candidates making their case to voters over the direction of the country with exceptions in 1964, 1968, and 1972.

While the Democrat push to keep their nominee off the debate stage intensifies, the Biden campaign re-affirmed Monday they have no plans to skip the events scheduled for this fall as venues change to limit crowd size.

Biden is “very much looking forward to debating Donald Trump,” Biden campaign Communications Director Kate Bedingfield told Fox News on Monday less than 100 days until Nov. 3. If Biden backed out, he would be the first to turn away from a pre-agreed debate.

The first debate is scheduled to be held on Sept. 29 at the University of Notre Dame, although the Trump campaign has requested the date be moved earlier considering that 16 states will already be conducting mail-in voting.

Keep up with Biden’s wildest slip-ups here.

A previous version of this article wrongly quoted a piece from Washington Post Columnist Karen Tumulty as arguing in favor of abolishing the presidential debates. She was arguing in favor of limiting debate audiences.

Biden Asks Black Reporter If He’s A Junkie On Cocaine,"When a CBS News correspondent on a Yahoo! News panel asked presidential candidate Joe Biden if he was ever tested for “cognitive decline,” Biden dodged the question by asking the black reporter whether or not he took a drug test before participating in the panel.

“That’s like saying before you got on this program did you take a test where you’re taking cocaine or not huh? Are you a junkie?” he said while laughing.

“Why the hell would I take a test?”@JoeBiden scoffs at idea of taking a cognitive test. Suggests @realDonaldTrump “can’t figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion.” Full interview at @NABJ @NAHJ virtual convention Thursday 8am ET.@CBSNews pic.twitter.com/rGNJpjfbF6 — errol barnett • cbs (@errolbarnett) August 5, 2020

Despite previously claiming that he is “constantly tested” for cognitive decline and even challenging President Trump to compare results on an IQ test, Biden enthusiastically denied that he needed testing and that he was ever tested.

“No, I haven’t taken the test. Why the hell would I take a test? Come on man,” he said.

Some pointed out that Biden’s blatant lie about being “constantly tested” should receive “fair coverage” from corporate media.

“Joe Biden said on June 30 to Fox’s Doug McKelway that [sic] he is being tested ‘constantly.’ Fair coverage of Biden throughout cable news would entail playing this soundbite juxtaposed with what the presumptive Democratic nominee defiantly said today when actually asked about it by CBS,” one reporter tweeted.

The CBS reporter ignored Biden’s response and proceeded with another question, asking Biden his thoughts on Trump bragging about his own cognitive test, but Biden’s answers grew increasingly more odd as he stumbled over his words trying to communicate that he is capable of debating Trump.

“If [Trump] can’t figure out the difference between an elephant and a lion, I don’t know what the hell he’s talking about,” Biden said “Did you watch that- look, come on man. I know you’re trying to goad me but I’m so forward looking to have an opportunity to sit with the president or stand with the president and debate. There’s going to be plenty of time.”

Biden also stopped himself from saying something he “probably shouldn’t say.”

“And by the way, as I joked with him, you know- I shouldn’t say it. I’m going to say something I probably shouldn’t say,” he stopped himself.

Biden concluded by claiming that he is “very willing” to let people make their own assessment about his health and functionality.

“I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical mental, my physical as well as my mental fitness and to make judgement about who I am,” he stated while tripping over his own words.

How Long Can The Media Cover For Biden’s Racial Gaffes?,"Joe Biden has stepped on another racial landmine. As the country is torn apart by ethnic strife, the former Vice President continues to frustrate his campaign and his loyal supporters in the corporate media by saying goofy things about black people that at least border on abject racism.

Thursday it was a statement, introduced by his classic, “Come on, man!” in which he suggested that unlike Latinos, black Americans do not have diversity of thought and ideas, with “notable exceptions.”

Uhh… did Joe Biden just say that Black people are all the same? pic.twitter.com/iUgkk2uSJo — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) August 6, 2020

Put once again in the unenviable position of having to defend the Democratic nominee, CNN and MSNBC chose for the most part to ignore the troubling remarks. Others like the New York Times’ Jonathan Martin took a different approach, sidestepping the actual remarks to make a broader point about Biden’s propensity to gaffes.

The latest Biden gaffes reflect: a) the real/perceived risk he poses to himself, anxiety he causes in staff and why so many Dems are thrilled there is no real public campaign b) how much Trump was depending on Biden gaffes & how little land they have to live off of now — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) August 6, 2020

You really have to hand it to Washington Post “Fact Checker” Glenn Kessler who just pretended that Biden didn’t say what Biden literally said. In a just world, Kessler would give himself four Pinocchios for this obvious gaslighting, but don’t hold your breath.

If you listen to the clip, he didn’t actually say this. https://t.co/sU7XeCuHim — Glenn Kessler (@GlennKesslerWP) August 6, 2020

Despite these desperate deflections, the Biden camp itself decided it needed to address the comments. In a series of tweets, Biden said that he was not treating black Americans as a monolith, even though he clearly was. Later in the day he launched into some bizarre remarks about how Latinos come from all over the world “unlike African-American communities,” as if there are not black Americans from Africa, the Caribbean and Europe. These defensive statements were likely a result of President Trump highlighting the gaffe throughout the day.

This is the hill Biden's apparently going to die on. This afternoon he appeared in a virtual roundtable and doubled down on his “Latinos have a more diverse culture than blacks” take pic.twitter.com/j8azhzL5YJ — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) August 6, 2020

This is becoming a real problem for Biden who recently insisted in an interview that if a black person, presumably one of those notable exceptions doesn’t vote for him than they “ain’t black.” In 2020, these kinds of comments not only sound tinny to younger Democrats, they come off often as down right racist.

In part, the issue for Biden is that he came of political age at a time when ethnic politics had a more playful and less corrosive feeling about it. This was a time when Bill Clinton was lovingly called the first black president. Even earlier in the 1970s and 1980s, politics was often played in ethnic clubs like the Ancient Order of Hibernians.

Ethnic jokes were more commonplace and acceptable, this first started catching up to Biden in 2008 when he joked that you had to have a slight Indian accent to go to 7-11. Nobody laughed. Another very common aspect late of 20th century racial politics was code switching, using different words or accents when speaking to different groups. We still see Biden do this with his use of “man” and “ain’t” to shall we say “urbanize” his delivery to black voters.

Biden’s antiquated ways of dealing with race may not be racist so to speak, but they are certainly outside the accepted parlance of the current Democratic Party. They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, and Biden, who spent most of his life getting laughs at such remarks, is not likely to be an exception to this rule.

The best Biden’s handlers can do in this situation is try to keep Old Joe in the basement with as few chances to foul up as possible. But with several of the latest polls showing a sharply tightening race, that may not be sustainable in the long run. Meanwhile the best the media can do is try to ignore the gaffes. But here they also have a problem, namely those notable exceptions.

There is no shortage of prominent black conservatives in today’s political landscape. From Harris Faulker, to Sen. Tim Scott, to Deroy Murdock and many others, there are black voices that resent and object to being told they are part of some Democratic monolith. The still mainly white mainstream media cannot ignore these voices; even though they desperately wish to do so.

Do not expect this to be the last time Biden makes a gaffe involving race. But do expect the corporate media to use all their power to protect him when he does. The question is, will that power be enough?

Biden's Capitulation To The Crazy Left Is Alienating Democrats Like Me,"Last year, Joe Biden’s path to the presidency seemed clear: Treat President Donald Trump as a historical anomaly whom Biden would replace, then restore American values, overcome petty politics, and get government working again. This message was designed to appeal both to Democrats, like me, and to Republican and Independent voters tired of the toxic political environment we’ve suffered since 2016.

That strategy initially worked well. Despite constant attacks from opponents and the press, by March 17, Biden had effectively wrapped up the nomination, and polls showed him trouncing Trump in key states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.

In recent weeks, however, Biden’s messaging has changed. Now it is pushing millions of voters toward Trump just as regular Americans start paying closer attention to the race. Most Beltway Democrats don’t recognize this, of course. They see polls showing Biden with a large lead over Trump and believe the former vice president is headed for a blowout win.

They might be right, but the winds seem to be changing. Polls that failed to predict the outcome of the 2016 presidential contest seem just as likely to fail now, with 62 percent of Americans afraid to say what they believe because of our toxic political environment. The more Biden caves to the left, the harder it becomes for him to win middle-class voters, especially those in the upper Midwest who typically decide presidential elections.

The Hard Left Controls Biden Now

Nowhere is this more apparent than in Biden’s new alliance with democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden deserves credit for trying to bring Sanders’ supporters into the fold, something Hillary Clinton never really did. The 110-page “unity plan” Biden’s campaign developed with Sanders supporters such as Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez tries hard to make both the far-left and moderates happy.

Like most such efforts, however, it fails. It throws trillions of dollars at problems without explaining how to pay for them or taking into account the debt-fueled trillions Congress is spending to deal with the coronavirus. It envisions a bloated bureaucracy that would shift even more power away from states and local governments and into Washington, D.C.

That is not a popular idea in America, and it won’t appeal to middle-class voters who have watched their government bungle the pandemic response, unnecessarily driving the country into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, with no end in sight. While the Democratic Party worries about the details of the unity plan, the rest of America is focused on simpler things, such as getting kids back to school — real school, not the fake virtual learning kids had to participate in during the spring — and getting people back to work. On those issues, Biden’s plans miss the mark.

Biden’s Plans Are Empty Swamp-Speak

Take the former vice president’s proposal to reopen schools this fall. It consumes five pages, discussing things that have nothing to do with schools or children.

It contains bureaucratic gobbledygook such as creating a “White House-led initiative to identify evidence-based policy solutions that address gaps in learning, mental health, social and emotional well-being, and systemic racial and socioeconomic disparities in education that the pandemic has exacerbated” plus developing “a COVID-19 Educational Equity Gap Challenge Grant to encourage states and tribal governments … to develop bold plans that adopt evidence-based policy recommendations and give all of our students the support they need to succeed.”

American voters aren’t stupid. They see a five-point, five-page “roadmap” to reopening schools, and they know what it means: Schools won’t reopen any time soon. They won’t tolerate that.

Biden’s plan to reopen the American economy has similar failings. Biden would also “Build a National Contact Tracing Workforce,” which he says is “a core component of a robust nationwide data-driven disease surveillance system.”

Seriously? A nationwide surveillance system might sound good to people in D.C. — who, of course, would run this new bureaucracy — but it sounds downright Orwellian to the rest of us, for a virus that more than 99 percent of people survive. Voters across America have already seen their civil liberties trampled this year. They will not welcome further intrusions.

Biden Betrays Law Enforcement

Although Biden takes a law-and-order approach to coronavirus, he has thrown actual law enforcement officers under the bus by kowtowing to activists who want to “defund the police.” As Biden knows, defunding the police is a myth. Its proponents openly admit they want to abolish police departments, not only defund them.

Meanwhile, in the real world, crime is skyrocketing. Eliminating the police will not help the residents of Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, and Portland. Neither will conditioning federal aid on whether police departments “meet certain basic standards of decency, honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community, everybody in the community,” the position Biden took to avoid saying he wants the police defunded.

Imagine telling that to a gang unit or to undercover officers. Biden can keep trying to toe the line, but when regular Americans hear him say he will condition federal aid on cops being “decent,” they reasonably interpret that to mean he will bow to the mob and not stand up for law enforcement. This is why the National Association of Police Organizations endorsed Trump this year, despite endorsing the Obama-Biden ticket in 2008 and 2012 specifically because it included Biden.

“For Joe Biden, police are shaking their heads because he used to be a stand-up guy who backed law enforcement,” said the association’s executive director Bill Johnson. Sadly, this plays right into Trump’s hand. Trump might not know much, but he has stellar political instincts. Unlike Democrats, he’s delivering a clear message that will appeal to the majority of Americans: Send kids back to school, support police officers, and get people back to work now.

Trump Is Using Reagan’s Playbook

In this vein, Trump is following in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan, just as he did in 2016. Democrats underestimated Reagan’s appeal during the 1980s. It wasn’t until 2006 that one prominent Democrat observed that Reagan’s skill in winning middle-class voters “spoke to the failures of liberal government, during a period of economic stagnation, to give middle-class voters any sense that it was fighting for them.”

“By promising to side with those who worked hard, obeyed the law, cared for their families, and loved their country, Reagan offered Americans a sense of a common purpose that liberals seemed no longer able to muster,” this prominent Democrat observed. “And the more his critics carped, the more those critics played into the role he’d written for them — a band of out-of-touch, tax-and-spend, blame-America-first, politically correct elites.”

That Democrat was Barack Obama, writing in his 2006 book “The Audacity of Hope.” His observations apply just as much today as they did then — and they will drive people to vote for Trump again.

It’s No Mystery Why People Prefer Trump

This is already occurring across key states. CNN’s Rich Thau has been conducting focus groups of Obama-Trump voters in the Midwest and found recently that 22 of 33 respondents preferred Trump to Biden. It’s easy to see why. According to Thau:

They think a businessman is best suited to turn the country around economically. They feel COVID-19 was not Trump’s fault, and he’s doing the best he can to contain it. They conflate the Black Lives Matter protesters with the rioters attacking federal buildings and retail shops. They don’t want historic monuments torn down. And they dismiss defunding the police as ridiculous. These voters tell me they want America finally to be put first; they oppose immigration and trade policies they say give benefits to foreigners at their expense. And they want a non-politician who relentlessly fights back, after witnessing too many officeholders fold in the face of special interests.

These voters cannot be discounted as racists or deplorables who need to be canceled. Their votes matter just as much as the protesters and rioters. They could easily lift Trump to a second term.

If that happens, Democrats will have only themselves to blame. The coronavirus gave them the chance to show what real leadership looks like. So far, they have failed.

Democrats have a small window to come to their senses, reconnect with working people, and fix it. But that will require them to get out of Washington and stand up to the special interests that are exploiting the virus for political gain — and that seems increasingly unlikely.

Biden Touts Catholic Faith A Month After Vowing To Crack Down On Nuns,"The Democratic National Convention’s Twitter account posted a video touting Biden’s Catholic background on Sunday, exactly one month after Biden vowed to strip a group of nuns of their right to refuse providing contraceptives that violate their Catholic beliefs.

In the minute-long clip, Biden talks about meeting a group of nuns in St. Peter’s Basilica, saying they “epitomize everything…about generosity to other people, about reaching out, about making it a point to understand that we are our brother’s keeper.”

“That’s what, in my experience, being raised as a Catholic and being educated by the nuns, that’s what those lovely women I’m talking to symbolize to me,” he continued, punctuated by soft music and footage of Biden with the Pope and with smiling nuns.

This is the kind of moral conviction we need in the president of the United States. pic.twitter.com/iJKAOVoFns — 2020 #DemConvention 🇺🇸 (@DemConvention) August 9, 2020

“This is the kind of moral conviction we need in the president of the United States,” the caption added.

But Biden’s record is one of attacking nuns, not defending them. Last month, he pledged to overturn a Supreme Court decision that affirmed a group of nuns’ right to deny contraceptive coverage based on their sincerely-held religious beliefs. The Little Sisters of the Poor are a Catholic order that has existed since 1839 and serves impovrished elderly in over 30 countries, including the United States. In 2013, the Little Sisters sued the Obama-Biden administration’s Health and Human Services, seeking a religious exemption to providing contraceptives and abortifacients that went against their beliefs. After three years of litigation, the Supreme Court ruled in the Little Sisters’ favor in 2016.

When the Trump administration issued a new rule that expanded religious exemptions to include the Little Sisters, the state of Pennsylvania interfered, suing the administration to take protections away from the nuns. That case also made it to the Supreme Court, which again decided in favor of the Little Sisters in July 2020.

But the day the Supreme Court issued its ruling, Biden promised to take away the nuns’ hard-fought exemption if elected president.

“I am disappointed in today’s U.S. Supreme Court decision,” Biden said in response. “If I am elected I will restore the Obama-Biden policy.”

Biden, who claims to be Catholic, has also flip-flopped on the abortion issue. Forty-seven years ago, Biden said Roe v. Wade went “too far.” Now, he says he would make Roe into federal law.

Some Catholics have criticized Biden’s hypocrisy and his support for abortion, like the South Carolina priest who refused to serve Holy Communion to Biden because of his support for abortion. A “public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching,” said Rev. Robert Morey.

‘Centrist’ Biden-Harris Ticket Exposes The Limits Of Our Political Language,"The Biden-Harris ticket exposes an under-appreciated problem with our politics. We lack the language to describe a mounting army of mainstream candidates who blend cultural radicalism with liberal corporatism. Is “moderate” the word? Certainly not, although that’s how Biden and Harris have both been labeled in the press.

Given the party’s leftward lurch, Democrats like Harris who stop short of a Bernie Sanders-style economic platform are considered centrists. Even Biden’s platform leans further left than Hillary Clinton’s did in 2016. “Biden’s current set of policy prescriptions would likely be considered radical if they had been proposed in any previous Democratic presidential primary,” A McClatchy report declared last September.

Harris co-sponsored Sanders’ “Medicare for All” legislation years ago, then waffled a bit during her candidacy. She supports abolishing the Electoral College, eliminating private prisons, raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, an “assault weapons” ban, and the “Green New Deal,” on which Harris collaborated with democratic-socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). She supports late-term abortion, major cuts to police forces, the Affordable Care Act’s contraception mandate, the Equality Act, and the Obama-era Title IX regulations.

But, of course, both Biden and Harris take corporate money, work closely with their party’s establishment, and don’t go as far as others on issues like breaking up Big Tech. Harris’s record as California attorney general rankles progressives. She waffles on M4A. She’s been accused of lenience towards Wall Street, which cheered her appointment to the ticket on Tuesday, arguing the move “reinforces” Biden’s commitment to centrism.

Biden and Harris are not Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. It’s clear their economic policy is closer to the center of the political spectrum than to certain far-left party leaders. They’re essentially corporatists who favor big government, are vulnerable to cronyism, and aspirationally good for markets.

But take Harris: there is nothing centrist about her cultural agenda, which includes the Green New Deal, the Equality Act, late-term abortion, slashing police budgets, and more. Biden himself supports the Equality Act, contraception mandates, a $2 trillion “environmental justice” plan, among other policies.

Even considering leading leftists’ steady march from the center, this is not moderation. Therein lies the problem. Wall Street is right that Biden reinforced his commitment to centrism inasmuch as centrism means establishment politics. But because our cultural establishment—from boardrooms to newsrooms to classrooms—is well to the rest of the country’s left, establishment politics now come with a far-left cultural agenda.

“Moderate” and “centrist” may have worked on Biden during the Democratic primary, when the label was implicitly comparing him to the rest of the field. But it’s telling that these labels are the press’s preferred descriptors for the presumptive Democratic nominee and his running mate. The media, of course, exists in the same cultural bubble as powerful Democrats, meaning they lack awareness of the range of mainstream views outside elite enclaves.

Progressives are right to be frustrated with Biden and Harris, neither of whom is interested in any sort of proletarian revolution. On the other hand, their actual policy platforms, rather than their FEC records and posturing, are solidly left-wing, and their cultural agendas are too. This conundrum is an indictment of our current understanding of the left-right spectrum, but also raises a serious problem for the press from now until November. It’s simply not fair or accurate to refer to this ticket as moderate.

Donald Trump’s patchwork of beliefs defies labels too, and for a million reasons. But Biden and Harris defy these labels because their cultural inclinations are normal to elites, so they are categorized as “moderates.” Elites are not “moderate” on cultural issues, yet their ignorance of that reality is boosting the far-left’s efforts to mainstream and normalize its agenda.

Biden and Harris will be referred to as moderates from now until November, and likely long after ballots are cast. But their establishment politics should push us to question the limits of our political language and make improvements.

Why The Harris VP Nod Feels Obvious And Underwhelming,"Sometimes, maybe even usually, conventional wisdom proves to be correct. Such is the case for the effect vice-presidential nominees tend to have on presidential elections. No, Joe Biden’s campaign will not sink or swim on the back of his choice of Kamala Harris as his running mate. It is hard to see how she will make a significant difference either way, but that doesn’t mean Democrats didn’t miss an opportunity in her selection.

The problem is not so much Harris herself, who was probably the best option Biden had on the table. It is the way she was rolled out. A VP choice is not so much about crossing the finish line as it is about creating a crescendo of excitement going into the conventions. A compelling choice can provide a bounce not only in head-to-head polling, where Biden is doing fine, but also in enthusiasm, where Old Scranton Joe has struggled. It is hard to see how Harris moves that particular needle.

Part of the problem here was Biden’s odd decision to announce back on March 15, during the debate with no audience against Bernie Sanders, that he would select a woman to be on the ticket. It was a very strange thing to do at the time. Mind you, this was almost two weeks after his Super Tuesday rout of Sanders, and for all intents and purposes, Biden had the nomination wrapped up. So why make any such announcement?

By Tuesday, when Biden made it official, he had also all but promised to select a black woman. So it basically came down to Harris and Susan Rice. This made the pick, which for some reason the campaign dragged out longer than a middle school Christmas pageant, feel inevitable, not exciting. Having a woman of color on a national ticket is big and historic news, but it didn’t feel that way because we all knew it was coming. It had all the suspense of flipping a double-headed coin.

Biden’s focus on demography also undermined the most essential argument he has to make on Harris’ behalf, namely that she is the most qualified person for the job. Now, maybe she is. Maybe Biden thinks that she is. But the fact that she was only competing with women to be a breath away from the most powerful position on earth cannot help but undermine that argument.

Had Biden stayed cool and coy about his pick, had Pete Buttigieg or Beto O’Rourke, or Corey Booker been in play, the choice of Harris would have had vastly more oomph. What would have been a story of an American from supposedly marginalized groups beating out the boys instead became a story about old, white Joe Biden handing out prizes and giving the ladies a hand up.

The best hope now for the Biden-Harris ticket, at least in terms of how they deploy their would-be vice president, is for a compelling relationship to develop between the two. And that could happen. This was utterly lacking the relationship between John McCain and Sarah Palin in 2008, although as a Democrat Harris can certainly be expected to be treated with softer gloves in the media.

They could still be an effective team, but the most important moment, the selection itself, has been lost. Perhaps the strategists bunkered with Biden in the basement feel that Harris plays into a narrative of inevitability surrounding Biden’s run, but my goodness, what an error that attitude was for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Tuesday’s announcement tapping Harris just wasn’t a very big deal, and it very easily could have been. It could have been a match starting a fire that blazed during next week’s convention, or whatever we are calling these virtual town halls in the times of the China Virus.

A solid convention bounce could switch a race in which Trump has recently seen glimmers of hope return to a clear double-digit rout in the making. Without such a bounce, Biden risks being the football team that lets its opponent hang around a bit too long in the fourth quarter.

The election is far from won or lost on the pick of Kamala Harris. In fact, the prevailing attitude among journalists and political junkies was a struggle to make it seem important. There is something safe about that, and Biden is in some sense running as the “safe word” of American politics, but that too carries dangers.

Biden is trying to be the first person in a long time to win the presidency by being underwhelming. His rollout of Kamala Harris was a prime and central example of that.

"At DNC, Kasich Dubs Biden Moderate Before Sanders Touts Left-Wing Win","Former Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich crossed party lines Monday night to speak out in support of presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden at this year’s virtual Democratic National Convention (DNC).

During his brief online testimony standing at a literal fork in the road in his hometown Columbus suburb of Westerville, which also held the fourth round of Democratic debates, Kasich’s appearance was meant to suggest broad bipartisan support even coming from a NeverTrumper who never had and never was going to support Trump in the first place.

While urging the country to unify behind the Democratic nominee, Kasich, whose appearance was derided by the party’s faithful ahead of the prime-time event, sought to assuage fears that a potential Biden administration would drift too far to the left for the independent voter.

“I’m sure there are Republicans and independents who couldn’t imagine crossing over to support a Democrat. They fear Joe may turn sharp left and leave them behind. I don’t believe that,” Kasich said. “He’s reasonable, faithful, respectful, and you know, no one pushes Joe around.”

Just moments later, former presidential rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose team strong-armed Biden into endorsing a litany of hard-left proposals in the “Unity Task Forces” agreement earlier this summer, reaffirmed to voters of Biden’s commitment to pursuing what Sanders celebrated as ideas once considered “radical” have gone mainstream. Sanders touted Biden’s commitment to raise the minimum wage, expand payments to families taking a break from work, and government kindergarten.

“To everyone who supported other candidates in the primary and to those who may have voted for Donald Trump in the last election: The future of our democracy is at stake,” Sanders warned in the typical apocalyptic tone voters were subjected to in 2016. “The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake. We must come together, defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice president.”

As most recently evidenced by his selection of one of the most liberal senators as a running mate, however, Biden is a vehicle for the left’s revolution whether it be in the explicit form of a major-party nominee or a presidential figurehead for an administration run by California Sen. Kamala Harris. Given Biden’s age at 77 combined with increasingly frequent episodes illustrating serious cognitive decline, the answer is probably the latter, but the messaging is not so subtle.

As of this writing with more plans likely to be rolled out this week, Biden has already proposed upwards of $10 trillion in new spending for a debt-riddled federal government that hasn’t passed a proper budget in two decades, including $2 trillion to achieve “environmental justice,” a key item hashed out in the task force agreement with Sanders.

Biden’s pick in Harris, whose voting record in the upper chamber has earned her a GovTrack rating as the Senate’s most liberal member even to the left of Sanders, also reveals no aversion to drifting leftward as a result of party forces. Harris has endorsed nearly every policy on the far-left agenda, including socialized medicine, the Green New Deal, higher taxes, open borders, sanctuary cities, late-term abortions, and a religious litmus test on Catholic nominees to the judiciary.

But Biden can’t “turn sharp left?” It appears, contrary to Kasich’s political plea, that Biden already has.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/18/at-dnc-john-kasich-voices-faith-in-bidens-independence-before-sanders-affirms-biden-as-a-vehicle-for-the-revolution/,2020-08-18
Michelle Obama’s DNC Speech Disqualifies Joe Biden For The Presidency,"Michelle Obama addressed the Democratic National Convention Monday night, ostensibly in support of Joe Biden. Appealing to her intimate knowledge of the office of the presidency, the former first lady offered a glimpse of what it takes to lead the country. Instead of inspiring confidence in the former vice president, however, her speech disqualified Biden for the Oval.

“I am one of a handful of people living today who have seen firsthand the immense weight and awesome power of the presidency. And let me once again tell you this: The job is hard,” Michelle Obama said. “It requires clear-headed judgment, a mastery of complex and competing issues, a devotion to facts and history, a moral compass, and an ability to listen — and an abiding belief that each of the 330,000,000 lives in this country has meaning and worth.”

Clear-headed judgment? A mastery of complex issues? A commitment to life? In just one short list of requirements, Obama betrayed Biden’s capacity.

The long months of this election cycle have consisted of gaffe after gaffe from Biden, causing onlookers to question his mental fitness and thus to doubt his “clear-headed judgment.”

“We hold these truths to be self-evident,” Biden said back in March during a Texas campaign stop. “All men and women created by — go — you know — you know the thing.” The thing to which he refers is of course the Declaration of Independence, and one of its most recognizable lines at that.

Here’s just one of countless other examples of Biden’s unintelligible comments, this time about China, arguably an incredibly “complex and competing” issue for the United States.

The same people who bash Trump for his cognition are voting for this guy. https://t.co/JqE7xgBiC4 — Kylee Zempel (@kyleezempel) August 5, 2020

For your convenience, The Federalist has been tracking the never-ending list of Biden gaffes here.

Obama is right that the president does confront a host of “complex and competing issues,” in addition to China. Coronavirus has unearthed several, such as the balance between safety and liberty, and the interests of the federal government compared to the states. Pandemic aside, the commander-in-chief must weigh plenty of other complexities, such as national security, women’s rights, immigration, and foreign policy.

Biden has demonstrated, however, that when it comes to complex questions and competing interests, he will do whatever is politically expedient. This is evidenced by his radical swing from moderate democrat to far-left progressive.

For example, in 2006, when Biden was a senator, he voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act, which approved and partially funded fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. Fast forward to the 2020 presidential debates, when Biden indicated he supports taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants.

Or consider his inability to stand firm in the face of competing interests when it comes to abortion. During a 2006 interview, Biden said, “I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it’s always a tragedy.” In 2020, however, Biden flip-flopped on the Hyde Amendment, indicating he would support using taxpayer dollars to fund abortions — a clear sign of a broken “moral compass” if ever there was one, as Catholic churches agreed in denying him Communion. It’s also a signal that Biden’s “abiding belief that each of the 330,000,000 lives in this country has meaning and worth” is grossly distorted. To Biden, the most vulnerable are dispensable.

As for Biden’s “devotion to facts,” he has proved unable to get even the facts of his own life straight, having lied about possessing three undergraduate degrees (he has two), graduating in the top half of his class (he was actually 76 of 85), and attending law school on a full academic scholarship (it was actually a financial need-based scholarship that covered half his tuition). Don’t forget about Biden’s war story fabrication, which he repeated throughout his vice presidency and on the campaign trail. Biden himself told a crowd at the Iowa State Fair that he “choose[s] truth over facts” — whatever that means.

Finally, while Biden has often demonstrated an ability to connect with supporters and display empathy even for his political opponents, his “ability to listen” has worn thin on the campaign trail, where he’s called people “fat” and a “damn liar,” and told them they’re “full of sh-t.”

“You simply cannot fake your way through this job,” Michelle Obama said, and she’s absolutely right. That’s why you shouldn’t vote for Joe.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/18/michelle-obamas-dnc-speech-disqualifies-joe-biden-for-the-presidency/,2020-08-18
"No, Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Aren’t ‘Rockefeller Republicans’","As the Democratic National Convention gets underway this week — sort of — Democrats, corporate media, and Hollywood are all at great pains to convince voters that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are just boring old moderates, nothing to be afraid of, and whatever you hear to the contrary from conservatives or the Donald Trump campaign is just fearmongering and distortions and lies.

One recent iteration of this narrative line is that Biden and Harris are “Rockefeller Republicans.”

During an episode of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” last week, Colbert and his guests, Mark McKinnon and Alex Wagner, co-hosts of Showtime’s “The Circus,” went on and on about how, contrary to what Republicans would have you believe, Biden and Harris are moderates, centrists, pragmatists.

“When I was a kid, we would have called them Rockefeller Republicans,” said Colbert, to the vigorous agreement of McKinnon and Wagner.

Colbert, McKinnon, and Wagner have no clue what Rockefeller Republicans believed. If they did, they’d know that if anyone’s a Rockefeller Republican in this race, it’s not Biden or Harris. It’s Trump.

Not that the label fits perfectly, but it does a better job of describing Trump’s views on policy than Biden’s or Harris’s. Named after Nelson Rockefeller, the Republican governor of New York and later vice president under Gerald Ford, Rockefeller Republicans were the so-called “Eastern Establishment” of the GOP, known for being comfortable with big business, okay with government spending on the social safety net and infrastructure, and cozy with unions.

Trump — unlike, say, Paul Ryan Republicans — fits this mold better than any Republican president since Richard Nixon. He has no problem with a big social safety net or government spending on infrastructure.

Like Rockefeller Republicans of the 1950s and ‘60s who opposed the spread of Soviet communism, Trump has done more than any president, Republican or Democrat, to oppose communist China. Indeed, part of Trump’s appeal in 2016 was that he brought in many northern, white, blue-collar voters—the sort of voters who might have supported pro-union Rockefeller Republicans in the middle of the last century but gradually left the GOP as it became the party of Ronald Reagan.

Biden and Harris might be cozy with Wall Street, but the woke oligarchy they would usher in is a far cry from the kind of big government spending Rockefeller Republicans supported and that have become so thoroughly established as a feature of our national life that no one, in any party, really opposes them anymore. It’s the difference between taxpayers helping to fund large research budgets at major universities and taxpayers funding the Green New Deal.

But do you know what Rockefeller Republicans would never have supported? Pretty much everything the Democratic Party stands for today, and certainly almost nothing that either Biden or Harris have proposed as a policy on any subject. Calling them Rockefeller Republicans is a way to deny or obscure what the Democratic Party has become and whose interests it serves.

Hoping the ‘Rockefeller Republican’ Label Hides Reality

There is of course a good reason for Democrats to hide behind such a misleading historical label. The ongoing violence and unrest in the streets of several major cities are rightly associated at this point with the Democratic Party, not just because those cities have long been governed by Democrat mayors and political machines that have too often sided with rioters against the police, but also because the national Democrats have used the protests as opportunities for political grandstanding under the naïve assumption that the radicals in their party can be placated by mere gestures.

That’s why, for example, Sen. Mazie Hirono refused to breathe a word against Antifa in a recent Senate hearing on the riots. And why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quipped that “people will do what they do,” in response to a violent mob that pulled down a statue of Christopher Columbus in Baltimore, where Pelosi was born and raised and threw it into the harbor last month. At every turn, the message has been that such actions are righteous and necessary and any criticism of them—the sort of criticism you might hear from Trump and conservatives in the media—is racist.

Under these conditions, the nomination of Harris as Biden’s vice presidential running mate seemingly offers the media and Democratic leaders the chance to dial things back and assure voters that it’s okay to put Democrats in power, that a vote for Biden isn’t a break from the past or an endorsement of the chaos reigning in our cities, but is a vote for normalcy and competence—a return to the halcyon days of the Obama era, before all this unpleasantness. After all, Biden and Harris are just Rockefeller Republicans!

This narrative also masks the radicalism that both Biden and Harris have already endorsed as a matter of policy on everything from the environment, to guns, to religious freedom and freedom of speech. If they’re nothing more than a couple of milquetoast moderates, after all, what’s to fear? It’s not like they’re going to use the Department of Justice to prosecute pro-life activists, or stack the Supreme Court, or impose anti-Catholic religious tests on nominees for the federal bench. Right?

But of course, we can be reasonably sure they would do all this and more because they have told us they would. Throughout the primaries, Biden moved inexorably to the left on almost every major issue, only distinguishing himself from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders by slightly disagreeing with their plans to socialize the health-care system at the cost of some $30 trillion.

Indeed, far-left Democrats like Rep. Pramila Jayapal have bragged about pushing Biden to the left on a range of issues—“he is moveable,” she said—and how she and other radicals in the party intend to keep pushing him should he win the White House.

Harris as Biden’s VP pick does nothing to mitigate this dynamic. On almost every issue, she’s to the left of Biden and can be expected to do so much pushing in a Biden administration that in a very real sense the election is really between Trump and Harris.

The narrative that Biden and Harris are just milquetoast moderates serves therefore not just to set voters at ease, but to make it easier for them to govern as stealth authoritarians, selling every radical new policy as a common-sense step by a no-nonsense, pragmatic Biden administration. (If you recall, this is the same posture the Obama administration adopted, couching its radical agenda as ho-hum governance because, in Obama’s own words, all the major debates about what needs to be done are “over,” the only disagreement is about which policies will be most effective.)

So expect to hear more talk of Biden and Harris as “Rockefeller Republicans”—a term that in any other election cycle Democrats might lob as an insult, tarring the GOP as the party of Wall Street and the wealthy East-Coast elite. This time around they mean it as flattery, even if in the end it’s completely disingenuous.

Joe Biden’s Flip-Flops Prove He’s Not Running His Own Campaign,"Out of the 29 candidates who sought the Democratic nomination for president, fate, voters, and Democratic Party power brokers finally worked their magic to push out all candidates except for the oldest white male of the bunch, a man who has spent 50 of his 77 years in politics: Joe Biden.

The quintessential career politician, a man who was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 (the sixth-youngest ever) and is now a gray-haired septuagenarian, was crowned as the party’s nominee for president of the United States. As such, he is officially the standard-bearer for its ideals.

But after watching Biden over his career, and more closely this year, I’m left feeling like a panelist on the old “To Tell the Truth” television show. Somebody please say it: “Will the real Joe Biden please stand up?”

Biden has been known for a few things over the years: a moderate-Democrat voting record, an outstanding ability to plagiarize (it takes quite a lot of chutzpah to steal another man’s life story), a penchant for telling entertaining and sometimes untrue stories, and an almost unparalleled tendency to say the wrong thing at the wrong time (“Chuck, stand up. … Let them see ya!”).

But after comparing his long voting record to the proposals of his presidential campaign, I’m left wondering if this is even the same Joe Biden.

Joe Biden Flip-Flopped on a Host of Policies

For his history of supporting fracking and other balanced energy plans, Greenpeace USA gave Biden a D-minus score last year, near the bottom of the field of competing candidates. He stood a cautious distance from the Green New Deal and had not taken the “No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge.” But suddenly Joe is a climate-change warrior. His website proclaims it. He will eliminate the two-thirds of our electricity that is generated by fossil fuels by 2035 and enact costly carbon taxes to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

He once led in the passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, the “largest crime bill in the history of the United States.” It provided for 100,000 new police officers and almost $10 billion in funding for prisons. The National Association of Police Organizations supported it. But Biden now supports reallocating resources away from police, which by definition constitutes “defunding,” and the organization has abandoned him.

On trade, then-Sen. Joe Biden supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and normalizing trade with China. He’s now suddenly adopted a populist “Made In America” mantra in this campaign season. Appreciative of the change in position, President Donald Trump might offer some bright red hats with “MIA” emblazoned in white letters.

Regarding use of the military to stop drug traffickers at the border, Biden once bragged, “Way back in the 1980s, I was the guy who convinced a lot of my colleagues in the military that the military should get involved in this process, and so in the drug strategy thing.” In July, however, he put forward the “Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations,” a 110-page document detailing plans to gut immigration enforcement and essentially cede the border to cartels.

Perhaps it is on immigration that his recent inconsistency is most obvious. In 1995, he voted for the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which “put into action now-commonplace fast-track deportations and mandatory detention of immigrants convicted of even minor drug crimes, and it expanded the use of indefinite detention for some noncitizens.” The American Immigration Lawyers Association charged that it let the government “deport the mothers and fathers of innocent kids.”

Biden drove a bill that focused on illegal immigration, eventually becoming the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. By doubling the number of Border Patrol agents, the number of people in detention centers also doubled in just two years afterward. Critics blasted it for injecting the criminal justice system into the immigration system.

Additionally, Biden once supported a proposal to end birthright citizenship. The Obama-Biden record is one of detention centers and rapid deportments. But now Biden says, “There will not be another foot of wall construction in my administration.”

Biden Is Only the Puppet

After rising to the top as a moderate, Biden now promises to be “one of the most progressive presidents in American history.” There will be a doubling of the minimum wage, free college, expansion of Obamacare, a public housing entitlement, and an empowered climate-change agenda, to name just a few items on the list.

Perhaps scarier than the policies is the fact that Biden isn’t driving any of them. In fact, if the flip-flops look suspicious, it’s because they are. They’re an indication that the candidate isn’t setting the agenda for the future Biden administration. Sometimes the cat is let out of the bag on such matters. Vox writer Matthew Yglesias said the following just three months ago regarding Biden’s climate policies:

But this is an area where it’s probably not yet worth spending much time sweating the details of Biden’s existing plan. The Biden/Sanders climate working group on policy, led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former Secretary of State John Kerry and featuring the Obama administration’s former [Environmental Protection Agency] director and the executive director of the Sunrise Movement, is an extremely high-powered crew. It’s widely believed in the climate policy community that there is going to be a substantial rewrite of Biden’s plan.

Indeed, there will be a substantial rewrite of all the candidate’s ideas. The evidence of other hands at work is everywhere. Take a tour around his campaign website. I’ve had an easier time deciphering the English instructions written by a collaboration of Chinese translators on how to assemble the 100 pieces of my new desk. Perhaps it seems that way because it’s truly analogous to the inner-workings of the Biden campaign.

Joe Biden, the Man, vs. Joe Biden, the Campaign

The truth is that Joe Biden, the candidate, is not the Joe Biden campaign. To even the most casual observer it’s clear that the man is simply the incarnate vehicle for selling and implementing the radical agenda of the left. They will mold him like clay into anything they want. He is their useful idiot.

So if the campaign’s voice appears not to be that of a singular man, that’s because it really isn’t. It is an amalgam of disparate and self-interested political handlers, activists, and contributors all seeking to get their goodies stuffed into the Christmas stocking. Constructed over time by different people with different ideas, it is the ultimate Rube Goldberg machine to nowhere, littered with lots of fancy words such as “environmental justice” and “equitable economic opportunity” that are like salve to leftists’ souls. Few of the campaign’s ideas make sense to the average working American, and there’s absolutely no coherent vision for how they all fit together.

That the campaign’s economic slogan is unknown to most voters is a testament itself to a lack of authentic vision (although given that it was found to have been plagiarized, perhaps Biden was involved). But Biden is their man. With visible symptoms of mental decline, if they have to prop him up until November, figuratively and literally, they will. The desperation is so high that one might wonder whether, if things went really awry, they might dress him in sunglasses and Bermuda shorts and carry him to the finish line.

Biden is indeed the “great white hope” of Democrats. If necessary, he will be corralled into a basement. If his words go off-script, the cameras will stop. If he misspeaks, the press will cooperate. He will go where they say and repeat the words they’ve written for him. Just last week, he was positioned in a chair behind a monitor to offer the VP slot to a senator from California. Leaving nothing to chance, everything was written down, including her name.

For the sake of Joe Biden, the campaign, progressives can’t allow Joe Biden, the man, to fail.

"DNC Night 4: Biden Veers Toward The Center, Calming Worried Dems","Vice President Joe Biden wrapped up the Democratic Convention Thursday night, putting an authentic and well-received closing argument at the end of an otherwise halting, depressing and frankly alien four-day rally, and previewing what may be the campaign’s calculation that a Kamala Harris VP provides left-wing cover for a rapid return to messaging from the Democratic Party’s political center.

Biden used the 25-minute speech, delivered from an empty convention center in Wilmington, Delaware, to contrast President Donald Trump’s “darkness” with his own “light,” and continued to stress the moderate credentials that have been a major theme of the Democratic National Convention. His words gently repudiated the more radical shifts of the Democratic Party, including anthem protests, demonizing white people, and The New York Times’ anti-American “1619 Project.”

Americans, Biden said, must, “Live up to the promise of our sacred founding documents that promise our rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” The highly contentious “Black Lives Matter” group powerful Democrats have literally bowed to went unmentioned, replaced instead with the late Rep. John Lewis’s call for America to “lay down the heavy burden of hate.” A mere moment later, however, Biden paid homage to “systemic racism” — the concept that America is a racist country that’s very systems conspire to subjugate minorities.

“No miracle is coming,” he angrily charged, blaming the president for the Chinese coronavirus and later adding, again with anger, that “the president still does not have a plan, but I do.” His plan, he said, is to make and distribute tests (as the president has done), “to take the muzzle off our experts” (who have dominated the White House press conferences for months while liberal tech companies censor and punish expert dissent), and to “have a national mandate to wear masks,” describing it as “a patriotic duty.”

Free the experts already running the country and mask the people is a very strange message, but played to the entire four days of coronavirus cowering. While public gatherings are allowed in every state of the union, many restaurants and bars are open, people are returning to work, politicians have locked arms with protesters, and riots have raged in the streets, the Democratic Convention paid high homage to the insistence that gathering in America is a deadly exercise.

Despite the existence of rapid-result tests, as used by the White House Press Corps — and by wealthy Hollywood Democrats for their social parties — the Bidens kept their distance from his vice presidential candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris, and her husband. Despite President Donald Trump meeting multiple times a week with reporters, daily with his staff, and traveling the country speaking to crowds of cheering supporters, neither the Bidens nor any other Democratic speaker appeared with or in front of the public.

Although forceful at points, Biden, just three years older than Trump, seemed far older than the spirited and combative president, who spoke to a public crowd earlier the same day in his opponent’s hometown. The vice president, to Democrats’ relief, did not commit any gaffes or lose his place during his longest speech since winning the primary, making strides against the increasingly bipartisan observation he is fighting a losing battle against cognitive decline.

It is difficult to imagine four days of empty seats and moderate messaging, capped with a strong and well-delivered speech by Biden, will make up for months of dodging interviews, banning questions, and sheltering in place while shifting increasingly leftward. Conventions are almost never a messaging anomaly, though, and are most often used to set the campaign’s tone for the rest of the race.

If that’s the case here, then the campaign has calculated that the nomination of a black woman will satiate the party’s activist wing thoroughly enough to provide cover for a rapid return to the party’s political center. Biden, after all, won the primary from the center of the party. Casual observers might have forgotten this, given his post-win shift left and socialist Bernie Sanders’s enthusiastic stumping on his behalf. Fortunately for Biden, if Sanders’ playful appearance Thursday night is any indicator, the personal animus the senator held toward Hillary Clinton is absent this time around.

Biden’s speech closed out a night that lurched awkwardly from segment to segment, room to room — and always without an audience. The convention’s deficiencies were obvious for everyone but a Washington Post theater critic. Even the master of ceremonies, actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, opened her set with a joke that the first three nights had gone so well they were going to add a fifth.

The theme of tragedy and loss has dominated the convention’s effort to reintroduce Biden to the public, with Tuesday night revolving around it, and death and sadness still circling Thursday’s more triumphant, patriotic-toned videos and speeches. Beyond the story of his eldest son Beau’s death of cancer five years ago, a documentary-style remembrance of John Lewis delivered a touching moment, ending with a moving performance of “Glory” by pianist and singer John Legend, rapper Common, and a Gospel choir.

These 10 minutes were among the most flawless emotional peaks of the convention, drawing tragedy up into political resolve and a biblical, godly crusade for justice and the people — all to a great tune. Like so many moments, however, the DNC almost immediately squandered it.

“Wow, that was so beautiful, ” Louis-Dreyfus followed up with the tone you might use with a child showing you a bowl of Cheerios for the fifth time that morning. “Wow,” she repeated for good measure before launching into a repeat of a joke about mispronouncing Vice President’s Mike Pence’s name (because mispronouncing “Kamala” is racist now) and one about Trump cheating at golf. There was no one in the audience, so no one laughed, and for the following eight minutes we were subjected to Jon Meacham, who most people don’t recognize, talking about our souls.

After Jon, Rep. Deb Haaland came on the screen. She told us about her “people, the Pueblo people,” and drew on her mother’s military service. No one knows who she is either, but when a San Felipe Pueblo Indian family with 60 years of military service in just two generations asked her to help them bury Master Sgt. Joseph Velasquez with the honors he deserved during COVID, Haaland ignored her constituents. The congresswoman did, however, find the time during Covid-19 to attend George Floyd’s funeral — and to represent military service and the Pueblo people during a DNC speech.

After Jon and Deb, viewers were treated to the baseless conspiracy theory that President Donald Trump made the Post Office bad. This isn’t all to give a play-by-play of the convention, but to illustrate how badly the emotions the DNC worked tirelessly to evoke were wasted on stupid segments.

One portion that managed to get beyond the terrible awkwardness of speeches to empty rooms was a playful conversation between some of Biden’s defeated opponents, recalling their favorite memories of Joe from the trail. Another strong segment featured a veteran of World War II and Korea remembering his combat jump, listing his NRA membership, and saying that he will change his vote from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020. The veteran’s short story kicked off a military-themed portion on Biden’s devotion to our servicemen and women.

In the end, the documentary-style medium — one invented for television audiences — won out over nearly every speech, which is great for a long commercial but rough for eight hours of primetime television. Biden’s closing speech can’t give the burst of energy a successful public convention would have, but the sighs of relief from consultants, pundits and supporters increasingly wondering if he could still give a strong speech will have to suffice, and the increasingly uncomfortable defense of a hidden candidate will certainly get a burst of energy.

On Monday evening, the Republican National Convention will begin. While details are still being finalized, early reports indicate the president will speak from the South Lawn of the White House, Pence will speak from Fort McHenry (of “Star-Spangled Banner” fame), the public might be treated to a fireworks show on the National Mall, and many or all of the speeches will be delivered in front of live audiences.

White Supremacist Who Organized Charlottesville Race Riots Endorses Joe Biden,"Richard Spencer, neo-Nazi, white supremacist, and organizer of the infamous 2017 Charlottesville riots, announced yesterday on Twitter that he will be voting for Joe Biden in the upcoming 2020 election.

A Twitter user asked Spencer if he will be voting for Biden or sitting out the election, given his belief that “Biden/Kamala will be tougher on crime/BLM than Trump.” Spencer responded, “I plan to vote for Biden and a straight democratic ticket. It’s not based on ‘accelerationism’ or anything like that; the liberals are clearly more competent people.”

Although Spencer claims that his endorsement is about competence and not ideology, his comments from the 2017 Charlottesville riots say otherwise. During his keynote speech in Charlottesville, Spencer explained how abortion advances white nationalist goals, stating, “The people who are having abortions are generally very often black or Hispanic or from very poor circumstances.”

It’s true that the vast majority of Planned Parenthood clinics, the leading abortion provider in the U.S., are in minority neighborhoods. According to the CDC’s Abortion Surveillance report, black women make up 34 percent of all abortions in the United States, though they are only approximately 12 percent of the U.S. female population. The Charlotte Lozier Institute in New York City reported that black women in New York City have more abortions than live births. This is not too surprising considering the Planned Parenthood’s original goal of targeting the offspring of the poor, of minorities, and babies who are physically or mentally challenged.

The Biden/ Harris ticket has been named by the Susan B. Anthony List the “most pro-abortion ticket” in U.S. history. Sen. Kamala Harris is a pro-abortion extremist who supports late-term abortion. Alternatively, Trump has maintained firmly pro-life policies during his presidency and is actually the first sitting president in U.S. history to speak at the annual “March for Life” in Washington, D.C.

Since he kicked off his presidential campaign, Biden has made various racist comments. His own running mate even accused Biden of supporting racist policies when she viciously attacked him on the debate stage in prime time.

When pressed by Errol Barnett of CBS News on whether he’d taken a cognitive test, Biden fired back saying that the question was akin to asking the black reporter if he would take a drug test to see if “you’re taking cocaine or not” and if he was a “junkie.”

In an interview with National Public Radio’s Lulu Garcia-Navarro, Biden claimed that Latinos were more intellectually diverse than black people. “Unlike the African American community with notable exceptions,” said Biden. “the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things,” he told the Latina reporter.

Last year, Joe Biden told the Asian & Latino Coalition in Des Moines, Iowa, that “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.”

In an interview with The Breakfast Club Biden said “If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re voting for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”

Despite Biden’s comments, it is President Donald Trump who has been dubbed a racist by his opponents and their allies in the corporate media. In 2017, the left falsely charged Trump with giving moral equivalence to the two sides of the Charlottesville riots and calling white supremacist protesters “very fine people.”

The context from the interview where the quote is derived from proves this is a lie. Instead, Trump was pointing out that not everyone protesting was a racist and there were good people on both sides.

The reporter said, “The neo-Nazis started this. They showed up in Charlottesville to protest –.” Trump interjected to point out that some protesters came with good intentions to defend statues and monuments. “Excuse me, excuse me,” said the president, “They didn’t put themselves — and you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. You had people in that group. Excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.”

Biden wasted no time after he announced his candidacy for president, jumping on the false reporting conjured by the media. He accused Trump of giving “oxygen” to racists and having “yet once to condemn white supremacy.”

In truth, the day that a woman was killed and many others injured after a man plowed his car into a group of counter protesters, Trump said, “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides. On many sides.”

Trump also stated he had spoken to Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, and “we agreed that the hate and the division must stop and must stop right now. We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation and true affection — really — and I say this so strongly — true affection for each other.”

Additionally, Trump issued a statement from the White House, and referred to “KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.”

While Trump has been labeled an avid racist by his political opponents and members of the media, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are being endorsed by one of the most notorious racists in America. If the corporate media didn’t memory-hole Biden’s history of racist comments and the links between abortion and white nationalist goals, it might not come as such a shock.

"Biden's Plan Will Raise Taxes On Those Who Earn Less Than $400,000","Joe Biden says that taxes would not increase for those who make under $400,000 under his proposed plans. Yet the 2020 Democratic nominee for president is either mistaken or lying, because his plans would indeed guarantee a tax increase for all tax-paying Americans.

When Biden and vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris went to ABC give their first joint interview together since her selection, Biden said any American earning more than $400,000 a year would face tax increases to “pay their fair share.” David Muir pushed Biden to clarify whether if he is elected taxes would increase for those who make less than $400,000 per year, and Biden assured voters that there would be “no new taxes. There would be no need for any.”

In fact, under Biden’s proposed plans, there would in fact be a need for across the board tax increases. Analysis of Biden’s plans by the Tax Foundation, American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Tax Policy Center, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), and Wharton Business School have all come to the same conclusion: Biden’s plans will increase taxes across the board.

Research and modeling by Huaqun Li, Garrett Watson, and Taylor LaJoie for the Tax Foundation has determined that “After-tax income for all taxpayers shrinks by 1.7 percent, lower than the 2.5 percent decline in 2021.” Along with raising taxes across the board, they’ve determined that the economy would shrink by 1.51 percent if Biden’s plans are enacted. Further, his policies would “reduce the overall wage rate by 0.98 percent, leading to 585,000 fewer full-time equivalent jobs.”

AEI’s analysis by Kyle Pomerleau, Jason DeBacker, and Richard W. Evans found that “Biden’s proposals would increase taxes, on average, for households at every income level.” They estimate that “tax filers in the bottom 95 percent” would see their after-tax income shrink by 0.3 – 0.8 percent in 2021.

In addition to individual taxes, corporate taxes would likewise be ultimately taken from the people Biden claims his policies are meant to protect. In the burden of corporate taxes, “20 percent falls on workers in the form of lower compensation.”

Gordon B. Mermin, Surachai Khitatrakun, Chenxi Lu, Thornton Matheson, and Jeffrey Rohaly analyzed Biden’s proposals for Tax Policy Center, determining that “In 2021, the roposals would increase taxes on average on all income groups.” They estimate that “taxpayers in the middle quintile” would see after-tax income decrease by 0.4 percent, those in the second quintile would see after-tax income reduced by 0.3 percent, and those in the lowest quintile would see after-tax income drop by 0.2 percent.

According to the CRFB, the Biden tax plan would not just increase taxes for the wealthy, but also “increase taxes for most other groups by 0.2 to 0.6 percent.”

John Ricco, Alexander Arnon and Xiaoyue Sun analyzed the Biden plan for Wharton, showing taxes would increase at every income level under his presidency, with the bottom quintile’s after-tax income decreasing 0.5 percent, and the second, middle, and fourth quintiles all seeing after-tax income drop 0.4 percent. Likewise, wages are projected to decrease.

Taxes are not solely affected by his specifically proposed increases. In an interview with Chris Cuomo, Biden promised to bring back the individual mandate from the Affordable Care Act.

The individual mandate requires nearly everyone in the country to either buy private health insurance, qualify for Medicare or Medicaid, or opt into the Obamacare. Refusal to do so would result in a tax penalty, which was undone by the Trump tax cuts in 2019.

Biden has also declared his intent to repeal the Trump tax cuts, which not only cut taxes for the wealthy, but for people of all income levels. According to MarketWatch, “Taxpayers making between $40,000 and $50,000 a year had the largest fall in average tax liability, a 14.5% drop.” Under Trump’s tax cuts, those making between $15,000 to $20,000 a year saw a tax decrease of 12.5 percent, $25,000 to $30,000 decreased 11.2 percent, and $100,000 to $200,000 decreased 10.96 percent.

Biden thus openly plans to replace a tax plan that has reduced many Americans’ tax burdens with one that would raise everyone’s taxes while slowing the economy.

Biden has literally been promising that he is going to raise taxes from the stump. You can argue “ending the Trump tax cuts isn’t new taxes” if you want to die on that hill but those are far from the only middle class tax hikes we’d see under Biden.https://t.co/ffgfykOhGC — Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) August 24, 2020

Moreover, Biden told Anderson Cooper in an interview that he supports a carbon tax. Carbon taxes do not discriminate based on yearly earnings, but on carbon emissions. Should Biden enact this policy, the tax burden of those who make less than his threshold of $400,000 would definitely be affected.

With five independent agencies determining that his tax policy would raise taxes across all income levels, the return of the individual mandate tax penalty, the repeal of the Trump tax cuts, and the institution of a carbon tax, a Biden presidency would oversee tax increases for just about every working American.

Why Biden's Won't Fully Distance From The Far-Left's Antisemitism,"Joe Biden has a serious dilemma that was on clear display last week. It stems from his efforts to appeal to a Democratic Party so splintered that it has no real identity. The differences between the splinter groups are so extreme, Biden cannot appeal to one without alienating another. While he tried to do so during the online Democratic National Convention this year, his efforts were disingenuous and politically risky.

A perfect example of Biden’s disingenuousness manifested when former Women’s March leader Linda Sarsour participated in the DNC. As Fox News reported:

Sarsour and Tamika Mallory were kicked out of the Women’s March organization due to concerns of anti-Semitism following statements against Israel and claims that Jewish activists were being excluded from the movement. Sarsour has also been a vocal supporter of the BDS movement that calls for boycotts, divestment, and sanctions against Israel.

Upon learning about Sarsour’s participation, Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates issued a statement that tried to distance the Biden campaign and the Democratic platform from Sarsour. “Joe Biden has been a strong supporter of Israel and a vehement opponent of anti-Semitism his entire life, and he obviously condemns her views and opposes BDS, as does the Democratic platform,” Bates said, referring to Sarsour. “She has no role in the Biden campaign whatsoever.”

Yet Biden’s Record and Policies Betray Him

Biden’s efforts to distance himself from Sarsour’s blatant anti-Israel sentiment are clearly an effort to appease more moderate (this term is relative these days) and Jewish Democratic voters. The trouble for Biden, of course, is that he can’t honestly condemn it in light of his record, policies, and plans toward Israel if he’s elected, which should seriously concern Jewish voters.

For example, Biden has indicated he would rejoin the disastrous 2015 Iran nuclear deal that President Barack Obama signed when Biden served as vice president. That deal provided Iran, the leaders of which have called for the destruction of Israel, enormous sums of money in exchange for Iran’s promise to comply with supposed limits on its nuclear program.

As The Hill reported, “Biden also does not support Israeli moves to annex territory, his most forceful opposition to the prospect of Israel’s government moving forward on sovereignty over the West Bank and Jordan Valley.”

In an effort to appease the far left, Biden also reversed course on his position on moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, after President Donald Trump announced it would be. As Fox News reported in 2019:

Despite supporting the idea of moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem for over three decades, former vice president and 2020 hopeful Joe Biden abandoned his previous stance on the issue and said he wouldn’t have made the move ‘in the first place.’

These policies are not those of a person who supports Israel and the interests of the majority of Jews worldwide. Rather, they are consistent with a presidential candidate who will try to appease the far left. In an article published in the Jewish News Syndicate, Daniel Greenfield points out, “Even as Democrats try to sell pro-Israel Jews on Biden, the campaign has already sold them out. The Biden campaign’s position on Israel will be that of J Street.”

Separating from Sarsour Is Politically Perilous

Biden’s disingenuous effort to distance himself from Sarsour and the far left is also politically risky. Sarsour and some of her farther left colleagues represent a fairly large segment of the Democratic Party. As The Federalist has reported, Sarsour has been praised by some of the party’s most vocal, controversial, and radical representatives, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib.

“The squad,” as the group is called, has been critical of Israel and has made numerous remarks that many have interpreted as antisemitic. They also have pretty strong support among far-left voters. As such, the Biden-Harris ticket cannot afford to alienate this particular segment of the party.

During her short speech at the convention, Ocasio-Cortez didn’t even mention Biden and endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. Moreover, after the Biden campaign tried to distance itself from Sarsour’s comments, Tlaib condemned the negative reactions and verbal attacks against Sarsour.

Herein lies the problem for Biden. Should he publicly support such radical Democrats because he needs to appease the far-left segment of the party, which happens to align with some of his policies? Or should he genuinely and publicly condemn them to appease more moderate and Jewish Democrats by way of actions, not cheap banter, such as refusing to give them a forum to speak and condemning their anti-Israel policies, and risk losing a portion of the left vote?

Normally, this would be a non-issue because the party would have a clearly defined theme and, for the most part, be politically aligned with its chosen nominee. Given the splintered nature of the party, however, Biden will have a tough time satisfying all of its various “segments” because of his record, his future plans, his far-left policies, and the influence and control the far left will likely have on his decisions. Time will tell how the fractured party will affect Biden come November.

The One Glaring Question No One Has Asked Joe Biden But Should,"In “The Hound of the Baskervilles,” Sherlock Holmes solved a murder mystery by investigating the dog that didn’t bark. Similarly, one of the biggest wild cards of a potential Biden presidency comes from a question the media haven’t asked

Given his septuagenarian status, reporters have queried Biden about his mental and physical health. ABC’s David Muir posed the question in an interview right after the Democratic National Convention.

But while Biden has answered questions about whether he would need to leave the presidency involuntarily, due to death or disability, this observer has no recollection of a reporter asking him whether he would leave the presidency voluntarily, to “grease the skids” for Kamala Harris to succeed him. It sounds far-fetched, but it happens in Washington quite often.

No Second Term?

In the interview with Muir, Biden said he was “absolutely” leaving himself “open [to] the possibility you’ll serve eight years if elected.” But as Biden himself might say, Come on, man!

Politico has noted that, based on Biden’s age and sex, the 77-year-old has a roughly one in five chance of not completing his first term (using the same calculations, Donald Trump has a roughly 15 percent chance of not completing his second). The idea that he would run for re-election, which would see him leave office at age 86, is absurd on its face.

That fact explains why Politico reported late last year that Biden told his friends he won’t seek re-election, and why he has publicly called himself a “transition candidate” within his party.

Congressional Machinations

If Biden won’t run for re-election — and his responses to Muir notwithstanding, the smart money assumes he won’t — that raises the question of who would succeed him, and when and how. Among all elected presidents, only Richard Nixon resigned early, due to the Watergate scandal. But while the presidency has yet to see abrupt, premature, or questionably timed departures, Congress sees them just about every election cycle.

Earlier this year, Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.) lost the Democratic primary in his Chicago district. But 15 years ago, Lipinski originally won the seat due to the machinations of his father, Rep. Bill Lipinski (D-Ill.). In 2004, Bill Lipinski announced he would retire from Congress after he had already won the Democratic nomination, and promptly arranged for the state Democratic Party to nominate his son for his seat — even though Dan Lipinski lived in Tennessee at the time. Having been gifted the Democratic nomination, Lipinski moved back to Illinois and won eight successive terms in Congress.

Over the years, both Republicans and Democrats have engaged in this type of “swampy” behavior during election cycles. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) faced similar charges late last year, when he announced his retirement shortly one day before the North Carolina filing deadline, leaving those potentially interested in running little time to prepare a campaign and paperwork to run for the seat. Meadows resigned from Congress in March to become White House chief of staff, and the candidate Meadows supposedly tried to time his resignation to favor lost the primary contest to succeed him.

‘The People’s Seat’

As part of their push to pass Obamacare, Massachusetts Democrats took these “swampy” machinations to a whole new level. In 2004, the state’s legislature had taken away the governor’s power to appoint replacements to the U.S. Senate. At the time, Democrats in the state legislature feared that, if then-Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) defeated George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election, then-Gov. Mitt Romney (R-Mass.) would appoint a Republican to replace him. They stripped the governor’s appointment power (over Romney’s veto), requiring a special election to fill all Senate vacancies.

But after Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) died in August 2009, Democrats found they had put themselves in a box. The special election couldn’t occur for months — and the vacant Senate seat meant Democrats didn’t have 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster and ram through Obamacare. As a result, the Democratic-controlled Massachusetts legislature passed another bill giving the governor — Democrat Deval Patrick, who succeeded Romney — the ability to appoint a temporary senator for the five months between the declaration of the vacancy and the special election.

That maneuver gave Democrats the 60th vote they needed, in the form of temporary Sen. Paul Kirk (D-Mass.), to pass Obamacare on Christmas Eve 2009. But Massachusetts voters didn’t react very well to the way state Democrats treated a place in the Senate — what liberals and the press called “the Kennedy Seat” — as their plaything. In January 2010, Republican Scott Brown decisively won the election to replace Kennedy, running to fill what he called “the People’s Seat.”

A Son’s Influence?

If a President Biden announces he won’t run for re-election, he would likely come under pressure from within his party to depart the presidency early. Such a move would allow Harris, his running mate, to succeed him, gaining the benefits of incumbency while seeking a term in her own right.

One argument might persuade Biden to reject any pressure to resign prematurely: The influence of his son Beau. The Democratic National Convention featured a video highlighting that Beau Biden turned down an appointment to succeed his father in the Senate when Joe Biden became vice president, and then chose to serve out his term as Delaware attorney general rather than run for the Senate seat in 2010. Joe Biden might cite his son’s example as a reason he couldn’t, and shouldn’t, leave the presidency until his term expires.

But at the very least, someone should ask Biden whether he will publicly commit to serving out his full term of office if healthy and able. As with questions surrounding his health, the American people have a right to hear his answer, and judge it for themselves, before they vote.

Bobby Kennedy Calmed Down A Mob. Joe Biden Tweets,"Joe Biden is no Bobby Kennedy.

Much recent news coverage has focused on the mob that accosted Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and other guests late Thursday night as they left the president’s speech at the White House. Lost in that coverage was the weak and indecisive action of the Democratic presidential nominee.

While Kennedy worked half a century ago to quell mob violence, Biden stood by and did exactly nothing to prevent the mob scenes that took place Thursday evening. For someone who claims the 2017 violence in Charlottesville, Virginia prompted his run for the presidency, the silence represented an abdication of leadership.

Remembering RFK’s Indianapolis Speech

The evening of April 4, 1968, saw one of the most dramatic acts of political character and leadership in modern American history — on one of the saddest days in modern American history. While preparing for a rally for his presidential campaign in the Indiana capital, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.) heard of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

Speaking on the back of a flatbed truck, Kennedy informed the crowd of King’s assassination and death. Most had not heard the news, and gasped and cried upon learning of the civil rights leader’s murder.

Kennedy then gave a brief extemporaneous speech, in which he pleaded for calm, peace, and understanding during a time of violence and crisis. He related the grief and anguish he faced after his brother John’s assassination five years earlier, citing his favorite quote from Aeschylus to speak of the healing that would slowly come:

The speech resounds to this day, made more dramatic by the fact that a mere two months later, an assassin’s bullet claimed the younger Kennedy’s life as well. Yet it’s the real-life impact that is the most important takeaway.

As cities across the nation — Washington, DC, Detroit, Baltimore, New York, and Biden’s hometown of Wilmington, Delaware — faced riots that night in anger at King’s death, the crowd in Indianapolis dispersed peacefully. Thanks to Kennedy’s eloquent example, the city wasn’t reduced to smoldering embers.

Predictable Mob Scenes

Compare that to Thursday night’s events in D.C., and Biden comes out the poorer. Indeed, it didn’t take a rocket scientist to realize that attendees at the White House event would face difficulties on their return home, as crowds had been gathering outside the complex for hours. Consider just a few examples the Twitter timeline of one correspondent on the ground Thursday:

8:56 PM: Crowd masses north of the White House, screaming F-bombs

9:08 PM: An agitator threatens to beat up a cop with his bare hands: “I’ll f—ing take you out quick, n—-! I’ll probably bust your brains, n—-!” (The police in the area don’t respond to the abuse).

9:30 PM: Crowd screams in unison: “If we don’t get it [i.e., justice], BURN IT DOWN!!!”

9:44 PM: A minute after someone in the crowd with a bullhorn screams at an older man, “Get the f— out!” he gets sucker-punched in the head and falls to the ground.

10:00 PM: The crowd chases a cameraman out of the area, with a woman screaming loudly, “Get the f— out of here!!!”

10:29 PM: A guillotine gets placed in front of the White House, for a mock execution of a Trump doll.

I could go on, but I won’t. Remember: Virtually all of these events took place before Trump even came on stage to give his speech. The idea that the turmoil would abate as the evening went on and the crowds inside the White House needed to leave the complex through the mobs outside defies common sense. It had all the makings of the disaster it eventually became.

Biden Could Try to Soothe a Tense Situation…

By 9 p.m., and certainly by 10 p.m., it seemed obvious that a mob of racial protestors, agitators, and demonstrators had surrounded the White House, waiting to accost attendees as they exited the complex. What did the Democratic nominee for president do about this situation?

First, consider what he could — indeed, should — have done. He, or someone in his campaign with access to his Twitter feed, could have tweeted messages decrying the threats of violence. He could have sent out a live video, asking the crowds to remain peaceful and respect the opinions of those with whom they disagree. He could have called D.C.’s Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser to express his concern about the deteriorating situation.

…But Does Nothing

Given those options, what did Biden do? In a word, nothing. Before and during the president’s speech Thursday night, Biden’s Twitter feed contained general talking points, information about the coronavirus, and two separate fundraising appeals.

About the deteriorating situation around the White House, Biden’s Twitter feed said nothing. He did issue two tweets, one asking “How safe do you feel in Donald Trump’s America?” and the second pointing out that “Every example of violence Donald Trump decries has happened on his watch. Under his leadership. During his presidency.”

The last tweet in particular represents a cheap shot, seeing as how the federal government (unlike states and cities) has no general police power. To look at it another way, if Trump tried to use his authority as president to quell the violence, by federalizing the National Guard or invoking the Insurrection Act, do you think Biden would support such moves? As Biden himself might say, “Come on, man!”

Where’s the Leadership?

Of course, those same limitations apply to Biden — both now as a candidate, and as a potential president. Yet instead of proactively and publicly denouncing the violence and encouraging Democratic mayors and governors to request additional assistance, Thursday night, he did neither.

The fact that Biden and his campaign failed to respond to the looming threat that protestors presented in the nation’s capital might have something to do with their suspicion that those protestors would ignore any statements for calm Biden made — making him look weak and ineffective.

The Biden campaign tweeted that message Thursday evening, attempting to claim that the release of a pandemic plan last fall meant that Biden exercised appropriate judgment regarding the coronavirus pandemic (he didn’t come close).

But if leadership requires foresight, then why didn’t Biden and his team anticipate the hostile scenes outside the White House Thursday evening, and attempt to stop the mob before (more) people got hurt, or worse? Biden’s tweet Thursday night begs that question — because Biden himself won’t like the answer.

President Trump's Stupid Tweets Are Better Than Joe Biden's Evil Policies,"I don’t like President Trump. I don’t think he is a good man, and I didn’t think he was the best choice for Republicans in 2016. I certainly don’t like everything he does, says, or tweets. But I am still going to vote for him, and I don’t think I’m the only one.

Unlike four years ago, Trump is now a known political quantity. He has fought to keep his promises on the issues I care most about: abortion, religious liberty, and the rule of law. Meanwhile, the radicals running the Democratic Party have demonstrated that they will do anything for power — and that they view people like me as enemies to be punished and destroyed.

My tipping point was the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation fight. After Trump’s election, the Democrats tried to claim the moral high ground; in the Kavanaugh battle, they shelled that position into oblivion. The Democrats not only tried to defeat the nomination, but they also promoted even the most grotesque and lurid smears — accusing a respected, mainstream judge of having been a high school gang-rape mastermind.

Democrats profess alarm over Trump’s prevarications, only to match him lie for lie. Most egregious was the Russian collusion hoax that they and their media allies invented. Supposedly serious people argued that the president was a Russian agent who had colluded with Putin to steal the election.

Other, more reasonable, criticisms of the president are undermined by Democrats’ hypocrisy. It was foolish for Trump to downplay the dangers of the Chinese coronavirus. But Democrats would be more persuasive on the point if they had not praised mass protests and feted the disastrous efforts of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ordered infected patients into nursing homes.

Likewise, Trump’s flattery of foreign dictators has been unseemly, and it does not seem to help his negotiations. But as vice president, Joe Biden did worse by endorsing China’s murderous one-child policy. Nothing Trump has said is as obscene and wicked as that. Indeed, established elites such as Biden are more like Trump than they care to admit.

Of course, there is more to the case for President Trump than the flaws of his enemies. Trump broke open a Republican orthodoxy that had become staid and unwilling to adjust to the tasks of conservatism today.

He has also compiled a strong foreign policy record, being less belligerent than his predecessors while still using American might when necessary, as demonstrated by the strike on Iran’s terrorist mastermind, Qassem Soleimani. Most of Trump’s judicial selections have been excellent, and our legal setbacks have resulted not from his mistakes but from members of the conservative legal establishment betraying their originalist principles and promises.

It is nonetheless important to acknowledge the compromises of supporting Trump, especially for Christians whose idea of good character is very far from that the president often exhibits. But this does not require us to follow Never Trump writer David French, who recently scolded Christians who support Trump — how dare we vote for such a bad man!

French highlighted the civil rights movement as an ideal example of Christian political engagement. But the civil rights movement worked with and voted for some of the wickedest men to ever inhabit the White House. If the goal of civil rights for black Americans was worth working with Presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson (whose respective adulteries, election fraud, and vulgarity, among other sins, are well known), civil rights for those in utero is worth working with President Trump.

As French put it in 2012:

Your vote can help determine whether we have a fighting chance at overturning a constitutional atrocity or whether you secure the right to kill yet another generation of unborn Americans. The lines are crystal clear. Where will you stand?

Even if French now refuses to see them, the lines on abortion and many other issues have not become blurrier since 2012. The moderate Democrats who voted for Biden in the primary won the battle but lost the war as Biden shifted left and chose Kamala Harris as his successor. A Biden administration will force Democrats’ cultural radicalism on the entire country, and Harris will be even worse when she succeeds him. Don’t expect moderation from her: Harris has fundraised for a group that bails out accused rioters, murderers, and sex criminals.

On everything from abortion to energy to health care, Biden is more radical than he was in 2008. The supposed moderation of the Biden-Harris ticket consists mostly of being friendlier to Wall Street and big business than the Bernie Sanders wing of the party. But left-wing corporatism is not centrism, it is just oligarchy with a veneer of social justice buzzwords.

Biden is the candidate of the rich and famous who incessantly criticize the United States but won’t say a word against the genocide being committed by the Chinese communists. He is the candidate for those who use the idea of free trade to require American workers to compete with Chinese slave labor.

The blue-collar Democratic Party of yore is long gone. Biden is an empty vessel whose administration will be filled by the radical left. He will not return the country to normalcy, nor will he unite us, because the identity politics his party has embraced preclude unity. If you want a preview of Joe Biden’s America, look at what Democrats say; even more, look at what is happening in Democrat-controlled areas.

In Joe Biden’s America, taxpayers will fund abortion on demand until birth. In Joe Biden’s America, men will be allowed in every women-only sport, shelter, and locker room. In Joe Biden’s America, public school teachers will encourage students with gender identity issues to transition over parental objections (if they even tell the parents). In Joe Biden’s America, religious dissenters, even nuns, will be relentlessly harassed by the government.

In Joe Biden’s America, there will be blackouts as our energy infrastructure is intentionally crippled in the name of the environment. In Joe Biden’s America, the rioters, looters, and murderers who have taken over the streets in Democratic areas will have the tacit approval of the federal government. In Joe Biden’s America, the president will work to make China great again.

No, thank you. I’d rather have Trump.

Black Lives Matter Protesters Reviling Trump's Kenosha Visit: 'Riots Work',"When President Trump traveled to Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday, Black Lives Matter protesters congregated by the county courthouse, which was gated off and protected by National Guardsmen. The protesters carried signs that said “F-ck the police,” “Dump Trump,” and “F-ck Trump,” but there was not a single sign for or against Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden.

A Black Lives Matter protester and Bernie Sanders supporter who traveled from Grand Rapids, Mich. to protest Trump’s visit told me, “I don’t know who I’m voting for” in the 2020 presidential election. The Bernie bro described the Biden nomination as “blowing.” Although he thinks left-wing activists will ultimately vote for Biden, he said it is going to be “very hard” for him to vote for Biden. “If I don’t vote for Biden it’s going to be for the Green Party,” he said.

Lamar Whitfield, the founder of the No More Foundation, traveled to Kenosha from Chicago to protest. Lamar said, “Right now, I’m not really in support of any of the candidates.” Lamar doesn’t know whether Trump or Biden are “sincere.” “We need someone that is going to come out and make a difference,” said Lamar, who even said he might sit out of the election.

“I’m less pro-Biden and more anti-Trump,” said Rachel Thompson, a BLM protester who also traveled to Kenosha from Chicago. Niko Estwind, who self identifies as a “revolutionary Communist” added he believes Biden is a “war criminal.”

“Biden still represents the Washington establishment in a lot of ways,” explained Thompson. “… he’s pro-fracking… he was the one who wrote the 94’ crime bill.” “There’s a lot that I think is pushed on us, that he’s the most progressive candidate, and I want that to stop, and I want the vote-shaming to stop,” she said. Although Thompson is not enthusiastic about Biden, she affirmed her support for him, stating, “I think when it really comes down to… do we want a fascist regime to continue for another four years?”

Enthusiasm among the BLM protesters centered around “police brutality,” “justice for Jacob Blake,” and their hatred for the “fascist,” Trump. In a tight presidential race, with tensions higher than they have ever been in American politics, one might think left-wing activists, at a protest many of them traveled from out of state to attend, would be more excited about their presidential nominee. He has certainly attempted to win them over by allowing Sanders and fellow socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to write Biden’s policy platforms.

Yet there are many reasons members of the left, especially young voters, aren’t excited about the “pro-fracking” and “establishment” Democrat presidential nominee.

Biden has made blatantly racist statements throughout his career and even during this election cycle. Biden’s own running mate, Kamala Harris, viciously attacked him on the debate stage in prime time, insinuating he was a racist for opposing busing laws in California. Now that Biden has decided to denounce rioting, it is hard to imagine that his popularity is rising among the radical left-wing parts of the Democratic Party, such as the protesters who came to Kenosha.

Although I did not come across a BLM protester who thought looting and destruction of property was necessarily a good thing, many excused the behavior because it “gets attention.” A young woman I spoke with explained the rationale: “Riots work. Burning down buildings works and it gets the attention of people to make real change. That’s what we had to do during the civil rights movement. That’s what we had to do during Stonewall. It’s what we had to do during women’s rights. People that aren’t white cis males wouldn’t have rights if it weren’t for burning down a f-cking building.”

While some left-wing activists, like the young woman I interviewed, see merit in violent and destructive rioting, many Americans are put off by it, especially old school blue-collar Democrats, like the many who live in Kenosha.

Racial minorities in many ways are being hit the hardest by BLM and Antifa rioting across the country this summer, which is taking place in mostly poor black and brown neighborhoods. In Kenosha, an Indian immigrant, who owns a family-run car dealership had his entire lot and American dream destroyed by BLM arsonists. He says insurance will not cover his losses.

Valerie, a 25-year-old African-American former Democrat from the inner city of Milwaukee, was in Kenosha supporting President Trump. She told us she does not believe Democrats help black people, but use them by exploiting “the pain” in their communities.

Valerie said the welfare state, burning buildings, and defunding the police are not the solutions she wants to see for black people. To Democrats' solutions Valerie said, “I’m good, no thank you.” pic.twitter.com/c31w2IWGxr — The Federalist (@FDRLST) September 2, 2020

Valerie said that the welfare state, burning buildings, and defunding the police are not the kind of solutions black people need. “I’m good, no thank you,” she said to Democrat solutions. “If anything, I see Republicans doing things to help my community. I don’t see Democrats doing things to help my community,” said Valerie.

Thanks to recent polls, Democrats have begun to realize that condoning domestic terrorism is not popular with voters, and they are scrambling to appease undecided voters, classical liberals, and minorities who do not like the destruction and violence BLM and Antifa have brought to their neighborhoods.

Biden has decided to play both sides. He denounces rioting, but still protects violent elements of the radical left, like some BLM rioters and Antifa, by not specifically calling them out and by endorsing policies that distribute government awards and attention based on race. Biden is hoping that blanket-condemning violence will appease both sides of the Democrat vote. However, he risks turning off everyone. The radical left may become more put off by his establishment behavior, and undecided Americans may think he is not done enough to condemn violence.

The question is will “anti-Trump not pro-Biden” be enough to get people out to vote for Biden, or will significant numbers of Democrats sit this election out, write in a candidate, or vote for in a third party.

Time will tell, but Trump certainly doesn’t have the enthusiasm problem Biden has. Trump supporters waited hours in partial rain just to get a glimpse of President Trump’s motorcade. They were pro-Trump, not simply anti-Biden. Unlike the BLM protesters, the Trump supporters showed support for their nominee with Trump flags, signs, hats, T-shirts, cozies, and even “MAGA” cheese heads.

Yes, a woman I met wearing a MAGA cheese head, who has been to seven Trump rallies, said proudly, “the true cheese heads of Wisconsin love our president!”

Joe Biden’s School Reopening Plan Would Keep Kids Online Indefinitely,"On Thursday, Joe Biden gave a speech that seemed to cast himself as supporting school reopening. But his actual plan is so vague and bureaucratic it could keep schools shut down indefinitely.

“If President Trump and his administration had done their jobs early on in this crisis, American schools would be open, and would be open safely,” Biden charged, ignoring that he downplayed the threat of coronavirus in January and February and effectively called Trump a racist for successfully slowing virus transmission by shutting down international travel.

“President Trump doesn’t have a real plan for how to open schools safely,” Biden charged, implying that he would be a better president who would ensure schools remained open, unlike Trump. But neither does Biden have such a plan. And in reality, Trump and his education secretary have strongly encouraged schools to open as normal and have been hounded as killers for doing so.

From day one, it has been Democrats that have insisted schools stay closed indefinitely against the scientific evidence that children are at higher risk of bad effects from the seasonal flu than from COVID-19, with CNN’s Dana Bash going so far to demand that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ensure no child ever gets infected with coronavirus before allowing schools to educate anyone. Needless to say, with a preposterous standard like that, schools would never open again.

Because Americans were becoming wise to Democrats’ attempt to hold families with school-age children hostage to damage Trump’s presidency, Democrats had to switch tactics. Biden is now presenting their pivot from “opening schools equals the mass murder of children” to “of course we want schools open, we just want them open safely!”

Yet the hostage attempt continues, because coronavirus has long gone from “15 days to slow the spread” to “you don’t get your lives back so long as Trump is president.” Since the nation is docile enough to take an eight-month shutdown so long as we keep getting fed our children’s inheritances and the Amazon trucks arrive on time, but pictures of autistic kids being denied desperately needed therapy make enough people queasy, something has to be done. Not for real, only for PR, you understand.

“Millions of students are now starting a new school year the same way they finished the last one – at home,” Biden noted in his speech, appearing to accept as legitimate people finally noticing that shutdowns are a terrible idea and we were led into them on false premises. “Parents are doing their best but more and more are finding themselves at their wit’s end, struggling to balance work and child care and educational duties.”

Yet since Trump is still president, Democrats can’t let up on the panic porn. The economy might uptick again, and that might help Trump. So what to do? Retcon history and start saying of course schools need to open. Democrats have always supported opening schools. We’ve always been at war with Eurasia. Thus what Biden is saying about his school opening policies and what his actual policies would do are two different things.

In his speech, Biden provided almost no specifics besides appearing to endorse the idea that schools must reopen. He told listeners to go to JoeBiden.com to learn more. So at JoeBiden.com, at the bottom there is a link to his speech and to the “fact sheet” he referred to in it.

Click on the “fact sheet” and you get this:

The 459-word “fact sheet,” however, contains very few facts, and very little of what one could call a “plan.” Like Biden in his speech, it does empathize with parents’ shutdown frustrations and claims that Biden supports “reopening schools safely.”

“Students are falling behind, parents are struggling to cope, and educators are worried for their health and that of their families and students. And for communities of color, the impact has been devastating,” it notes. All true. Yet pretty much all it provides by way of a “plan” to address this is a demand that Congress triple the annual federal K-12 outlay to the tune of $200 billion, even though schools have not used the extra $31 billion Congress sent them this spring and if throwing money at problems worked, the United States’ problems would be few.

So it appears Biden’s solution, as is Democrats’ for everything since they have no workable policy ideas, is to throw money at a virus and hope it, unlike Congress, runs from other people’s cash.

This “fact sheet” refers very dedicated readers to a “five-step” “roadmap to reopen schools safely” on yet another web page. This one is 1,772 words long, and represents the final stop on the “Biden plan to reopen schools safely” railway. Here we find that Biden’s metrics would basically allow for keeping public schools shut down indefinitely until coronavirus, like polio, has been eradicated.

“If we want to reopen schools safely, we need to get cases down in states and communities across America,” it states. So “get cases down” is a precondition for opening schools. No word on how far they must be down, however, which allows for continued lockdowns.

The Biden plan’s demands for “safe reopening” include: “Implement nationwide testing-and-tracing, including doubling the number of drive-through testing sites.” He must not be aware that contract tracing has a terrible track record of success generally, and that includes in Democrat-controlled locales like New York. If school reopening depends on contact tracing being in place, schools will not reopen.

Rather than allowing local leaders to make decisions about school reopening based on local conditions, Biden would also implement a centrally controlled set of federal “reopening guidelines” “to answer basic questions that schools have, including: How low does the community infection rate need to be to reopen and at what point should schools shut down again if cases rise? What are the safe maximum class sizes? If schools cannot accommodate everyone, who should return to the classroom first?”

That last question is eerily suggestive of several school districts’ plans to deprive children of an education based on their race. Yes, school districts in Washington, Illinois, and California actually prioritized getting non-white children into classrooms before white children. School reopenings with a side of racism, I guess. Is that a-okay with Joe Biden? No reporter will ever ask.

Biden’s plan also calls for hundreds of billions more in debt-derived funding for schools and the establishment of a number of federal commissions to somehow solve the fact that online learning sucks. Biden must not be aware of this, but philanthrocapitalists like Bill Gates, owner of the world’s largest tax-free cash stockpile, and hundreds of millions in venture capital have attempted to solve this problem for decades and they still haven’t found a solution.

But Biden is apparently a unicorn who can simply declare the federal government will solve problems nobody has been able to solve despite spending millions, and that declaration will alone magically solve it. If only Trump thought of that solution: sorcery! Make sure Biden puts Harry Potter on his coronavirus commission.

So, to recap, Biden’s plan for “reopening schools” requires basically three things: hundreds of billions more dollars, more government commissions, and to “Get the Virus Under Control.” This isn’t a plan, it’s a vague wish list that will allow for no accountability from Biden to uphold it. My second grader could do better than this.

Biden provides zero hard metrics for what will allow children back to school in person, only soft metrics such as the existence of “sufficient testing, adequate contact tracing, [and] reliable supply chains.” By Democrats’ understanding of all these metrics, based on their attacks on Trump, schools would not be open for the foreseeable future, if ever. Yet Biden’s speech, the only thing most Americans might encounter on this issue, would lead them to think precisely the opposite.

It’s yet another example of how Democrats constantly sell voters reasonable-sounding things people want while constantly delivering outlandish things Americans hate.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/08/joe-bidens-school-reopening-plan-would-keep-kids-online-indefinitely/,2020-09-08
Atlantic Staffer Falsely Claims Trump Team Mocked Biden At Beau's Grave,"Vice President Joe Biden once again dodged questions from the press Sunday, walking from Mass to his motorcade while a pool reporter yelled “Mr. Vice President, come back to us!”

Biden dodging media interactions is not surprising, even if it is very strange for a modern political campaign. What is unusual are some of the people who are defending his dodging of reporters and difficult questions, among them The Atlantic’s Edward-Isaac Dovere, who claimed Biden was visiting his son’s grave and shamed the President Donald Trump’s campaign for criticizing Biden. Worse still than flacking for Biden when he is supposed to be reporting on his campaign, is that there’s no evidence Dovere’s version of events happened at all.

A press pool report and a video from Sunday recorded Biden walking out the front door of his church after Mass, along a path that leads past some administrative buildings and to the parking lot. Francis Brennan, the Trump campaign’s director of strategic response, tweeted a video of the candidate declining to speak with the press.

REPORTER: ""Mr. Vice President come talk to us."" Joe Biden just keeps meandering along. pic.twitter.com/6tnNQj2Ucg — Francis Brennan (@FrancisBrennan) September 6, 2020

The Atlantic’s Biden reporter was, for some reason, quick to fire back, tweeting that the Trump campaign was mocking the former vice president while he was “visiting his son’s grave” — an accusation that spread rapidly on Twitter, leading to multiple news stories.

In July, a RNC spokesman mockingly tweeted a photo of Biden and his dead son as a boy. Today, a Trump campaign spokesman mockingly tweeted a video of Biden visiting his son’s grave. pic.twitter.com/3v15U4eWe7 — Edward-Isaac Dovere (@IsaacDovere) September 6, 2020

The problem is that this isn’t true.

Biden makes a habit of arriving late at Mass and leaving a little early so his security detail causes less disruption to parishioners. On Sunday he attended the mid-morning Mass, leaving a few minutes before 11:30 a.m.

A press pool report and a video record him walking out the front door of the church along a path that leads past administrative buildings and to the parking lot that borders Montchanin Road. Two minutes after he emerged from the church and went to the motorcade, he was on the road, and four minutes later he was home.

Like a lot of old churchyards, the original cemetery surrounds the path, with two expansions nearby for more recent burials. Biden’s first wife, his daughter Naomi, and his recently deceased son, Beau, are all buried in the church’s cemetery.

The church’s only doors exit into the old cemetery, so any picture or video from where the press and any other onlookers were along the northern loop of Old Church Road would show tombstones, but Biden did not slow down or stop this Sunday morning to visit any graves. Specifically to Dovere’s claim that he was visiting the grave of his son, Biden didn’t go to the more recent cemetery section across the road where Beau Biden is laid to rest.

Dovere covers the Biden campaign, so he has access to the pool reports that show his accusation is simply wrong. He did not respond to The Federalist’s request for any possible unknown circumstances that justify his accusation. Biden campaign rapid response directors Mike Gwin and Andrew Bates similarly did not provide any information to clear up Dovere’s claim.

This most recent incident might be less surprising, however, when people realize he is the same reporter who asked Biden what he thinks “about President Trump’s soul and the life he leads?”

Dovere’s false accusation and question join a growing list of recent breakdowns in journalistic standards at the once-storied Atlantic. On Thursday, Editor in Chief Jeffrey Goldberg published a badly sourced, difficult-to-confirm, belief-stretching story about President Donald Trump denigrating America’s honored dead at Belleau Wood, France that has since been publicly contradicted by multiple primary sources. Just weeks before this, a Federalist investigation revealed a story about a police officer shooting a child in a community recreation center and going unpunished was false on nearly every level but had gone unchecked by once-storied fact-checkers.

While eventually forced to “update” the false article on the police officer, no “update” has been given to the Belleau Woods article, despite the editor in chief acknowledging on CNN the opening paragraph is demonstrably false. Dovere has also not deleted or updated his false accusation, although he has since tweeted two jokes about lazy journalism.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/09/atlantic-reporter-falsely-claims-trump-campaign-mocked-biden-at-beaus-grave/,2020-09-09
"If Kenosha Is Any Indication, Trump Will Win Wisconsin","He doesn’t seem well. In fact, he sounds exactly like every person I’ve encountered on their deathbed. These thoughts ran through my mind Thursday while I watched Joe Biden breathlessly address Kenosha community leaders through his surgical mask.

Aside from the former vice president’s extortionate call-to-action that if you don’t vote for him, racism and riots will reign forever, my primary takeaway from his remarks was that Biden is the weakest and least-inspiring candidate I’ve ever seen. This was quite a contrast from the energy I felt pulsing through Kenosha as I walked the glass-littered streets the day President Donald Trump came to town.

Trump Can’t Win… Or Can He?

Sometime around the second month of the pandemic, I made my peace with a Biden presidency. There was no way Trump could win, it seemed. With the death toll rising, businesses closing, and the economy tanking, things weren’t looking too good for the incumbent. Pair that with the fact that Democrats wield unrivaled power in our major institutions, controlling all of them save for some churches — including media, education, and entertainment — a second-term victory for Trump seemed impossible.

But administrations come and go. Unlike many prominent Democrats, who’ve thrown a four-year tantrum since 2016, most people realize presidential elections aren’t the end of the world. Would it be a bummer if Biden sealed the deal? Sure, but it would be fine. We would survive (without an embittered #NotMyPresident campaign).

I’m becoming increasingly convinced that’s a reality we’ll never have to face. As The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway pointed out, Biden held a 25-point lead in the betting odds at the beginning of August. Fast-forward just one month, and Trump has made up the entire deficit, now neck-and-neck with Biden.

“So here is the cold reality the media are for some reason refusing to tell people as the country rounds Labor Day and this campaign really gets into high gear,” Hemingway wrote. “This race is effectively tied today, Trump has momentum, and Biden is going to have to campaign hard, energize his voters, and earn it if he hopes to unseat the incumbent.”

Protesters Are Anti-Trump — but Not Pro-Biden

As we learned in 2016, it isn’t all just a numbers game. But if a swing-state city can serve as a case study amid political unrest, Kenosha backs up the data.

2020 has become the year of the pros and the antis. This was never so clear as during the back-to-back weeks of the partisan national conventions. Democrats are anti-hate, anti-bigotry, anti-establishment. Republicans are pro-America, pro-First Amendment, pro-law enforcement.

The left’s messaging is more about loathing the status quo than about beckoning to something better. This is a bit hyperbolic, of course. Democrats are certainly “for” things: masks, socialized health care, and reproductive irresponsibility are near the top of the list. They don’t love anything as much as they hate one thing, however, and that one thing is all wrapped up in a single man, Donald Trump.

“So I’m definitely pro-Biden — because I’m anti-Trump,” Jessica Cwik, a Kenosha native, told The Federalist in an interview.

“Me, personally, I’m less pro-Biden, and I’m more anti-Trump,” echoed Rachel Thompson in a similar interview. “No matter what, I do want Trump out, and that’s what the bottom line is. … I’m not going to pretend everything is going to be, you know, amazing and peachy once Biden gets in.” Black Lives Matter protesters throughout uptown Kenosha sounded like they were reading from the same script of Biden indifference.

“It’s not about ‘Biden is some champion for the people.’ No, he’s not,” added Niko Estwind, a self-described communist revolutionary, calling Biden a “war criminal.” “You know, all the policies and the stuff that he stands for — but he’s not a fascist. So that’s the difference between him and Trump. He’s not a fascist.”

“Biden still represents the Washington establishment in a lot of ways,” said Thompson. “He’s pro-fracking and, you know, he was the one who wrote the ’94 crime bill.”

“I don’t know who I’m voting for. I’m definitely not voting for Trump,” one protester in a “F-ck Police Brutality” shirt and “Black Lives Matter” hat who campaigned for Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020 told The Federalist. “It’s going to be really hard for me to vote for Biden just because I’m very anti-establishment.”

The same story repeated itself over and over. Protesters weren’t pro-Biden. They were just anti-Trump. It’s possible we just happened to talk to the wrong people and that plenty of Wisconsinites watching the madness in Kenosha are fervently pro-Biden and just didn’t speak to us. One would think if that were the case, however, Biden’s visit to the midwestern town just two days later would have turned out his supporters. It didn’t.

According to reporters on the ground, the response to the former vice president’s visit was “much more low key.”

Watching Biden’s Kenosha address, it isn’t hard to see why people are disillusioned. Off-teleprompter, Biden was a feeble disaster. He addressed a room of people at a decibel below conversational volume and set a new gaffe record, joking about people shooting him for his tax hikes — during the visit centered on a police shooting.

Enthusiasm Radiates From Trump Supporters

Unlike prospective Biden voters, Trump supporters are revved up. Their excitement was palpable.

Brandon Harris, who calls himself the tattooed conservative, is the founder of Freedom Movement U.S.A, which co-hosts Trump rallies across the country. Harris said he’s thrown 590 rallies. “I’ve been [twice] in Chicago, back and forth to California this week, Nevada, Washington, D.C. — Trump supporters are coming up everywhere,” he told The Federalist in Kenosha. “We’ve seen nothing but people like this everywhere. I have yet to see two Biden supporters show up to a rally.”

“I’ve been to seven of his rallies, traveled the United States, and not one riot,” said Danell Vincenti, donning a MAGA cheesehead. “The true Wisconsinites, the true cheeseheads of Wisconsin, we love our president, and he’s got our support 100 percent.”

“It’s awesome,” one young man, Richard Ross, told me when I asked how he felt about Trump being in Kenosha. “I’m excited to see the leader of the greatest country in the world.”

One person after the next offered a variation of the same sentiment: “We’re super excited to see him. We super support him,” as Amy, a Kenosha native, said.

Trump supporters are zealously pro-Trump. Although the fervor is almost religious, it largely lacks the cultish component of its leftist counterpart, identity-politics progressivism, which includes the sin, atonement, penance, and dogma of a religious order — but none of the grace.

That’s because, based on most of the Trumpers I’ve interviewed and contrary to what the left seems to believe, their passion isn’t driven by blind support of a man, a movement, or an apology. It’s based on the fundamental belief that America is truly great and is worth preserving, and so long as they have a fighter committed to the American dream, they’ll commit to him.

Their allegiance has conditions, to be sure. But what the left continuously fails to grasp is that those conditions are not social media decorum or politically correct platitudes. Those conditions are wrapped up in the president’s devotion to aggressively defend those things these Americans hold dear: namely faith, family, and freedom.

“I don’t care what color you are, what religion you are, what sex you are — we’re all together,” Vincenti said. “We love this country. We love our flag. We stand for the flag and kneel for God.”

Who can say what the 2020 election will bring? But after surveying Kenosha, I’m convinced Trump won’t lose Wisconsin. And if I were a betting woman, I’d say he won’t lose the White House.

Press Secretary Refuses to Say If Biden Uses Teleprompter In Interviews,"Joe Biden’s National Press Secretary T.J. Ducklo repeatedly refused to answer simple “yes or no” questions on Thursday night during a segment of Fox News’s “Special Report.” It was one of the few times in Biden’s entire campaign that a representative has responded to real-time inquiries from any non-leftist corporate media.

Ducklo not only dodged Baier’s questions repeatedly, he refused to say whether Biden uses a teleprompter to feed him replies when he does corporate media interviews. Ducklo also falsely claimed Biden did not early this year condemn President Trump’s decision to close travel from coronavirus-infected areas, a decision credited with saving tens of thousands of American lives.

Ducklo joined Baier to discuss journalist Bob Woodward’s allegations that President Trump tried to “downplay” the virus, but the conversation quickly intensified when Baier asked what Biden would have done to handle COVID-19 differently.

“Joe Biden has said he wouldn’t have closed the travel from China. What specifically would the former vice president have done?” Baier asked.

“The vice president was not against the travel ban,” Ducklo claimed. “Let’s remember an important distinction: Donald Trump was the president of the United States. It was on Donald Trump to take action to actually protect the American people.”

Baier pressed into Ducklo’s heated response by clarifying his question.

“You’re saying, yes, [Biden] was for the China travel ban when the president implemented it 48 hours after receiving that briefing?” Baier asked. “Yes or no?”

“Brett, I know that you all like to cite the travel ban and I know the president likes to cite the travel ban but,” Ducklo began, skirting the question.

Baier interrupted Ducklo: “No, no, no. The president does.” Baier said. “That’s why I’m bringing it up. Obviously it’s going to be in the debates.”

Despite Ducklo’s insistence that Biden “was not against the travel ban,” Biden publicly and repeatedly condemned it back in February, accusing the Trump administration’s coronavirus mitigation steps of being full of “hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering.”

We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) February 1, 2020

The “Special Report” interview continued after the heated exchange, but when Baier asked another “yes or no” question about Biden’s use of a teleprompter, Ducklo, once again, avoided it and declined to provide a straightforward answer.

“Has Joe Biden ever used the teleprompter during the local interviews, or to answer Q&A with supporters?” Baier asked.

“I’m not going to allow Trump campaign to funnel their questions through Fox News,” Ducklo said, attacking the network.

Ducklo continued to insult Baier and Fox News, accusing them of “finding excuses” for Trump after Baier pointed out that even Dr. Anthony Fauci says there were no ” discrepancies” between what Trump said to Woodward and what he said in public.

“I know that you all are working overtime to try to find excuses for this president,” Ducklo said.

Baier took to Twitter on Thursday night to ask for suggestions as well as clarify that he is “not a ‘shill’ for either campaign.”

“I’m asking each campaign questions in the news their candidates WILL eventually face in a debate or on the trail & pushing back w/ their opponents’ criticisms,” he wrote.

Thoughts on the show? Suggestions? And no.. I'm not a ""shill"" for either campaign.. (see tweets from both sides below) I'm asking each campaign questions in the news their candidates WILL eventually face in a debate or on the trail & pushing back w/ their opponents' criticisms — Bret Baier (@BretBaier) September 10, 2020

Ducklo received backlash on social media for his poor responses, with many speculating that he would not be returning to TV anytime soon and might even be fired.

Word of advice to the Biden campaign. Don’t roll out Tj Ducklo to do anymore interviews. — Fodder (@LoKeys910) September 11, 2020

TJ Ducklo telling @BretBaier he's being fed questions by the Trump campaign sounds just like something a whiny CNN or Washington Post reporter, or a person at you-know-where would say. It's prepubescent nonsense. — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) September 10, 2020

As @TDucklo should know, the correct answer is, “No, of course not. How can anyone who needs a teleprompter to answer questions be running for President of the United States?” His non-answer is all the answer voters need. @BretBaier https://t.co/Skb6ZP4EBE — JD Rucker (@JDRucker) September 11, 2020

So I guess TJ Ducklo won’t be going back on TV. — Stephen L. Miller (@redsteeze) September 10, 2020

TJ Ducklo is likely not going on television again. Yikes. — Josh Holmes (@HolmesJosh) September 10, 2020

TJ Ducklo is so fired after that Bret Baier interview — Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) September 10, 2020

Biden Condemns Antisemitism While Ignoring Democrats Who Support It,"On August 18, the Joe Biden campaign distanced itself from New York Democratic National Convention delegate Linda Sarsour after she gave a speech to a delegation of Muslim Democrats. A spokesman for Biden condemned Sarsour’s history of antisemitism and her support for the extremist boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement aimed at Israel.

“She has no role in the Biden campaign whatsoever,” said Andrew Bates, director of rapid response for the campaign.

However commendable Biden’s decision was to disavow a habitual antisemite such as Sarsour, the former vice president should clean up his own house first. Indeed, Biden’s Muslim outreach director supports the same BDS movement that prompted Sarsour’s renunciation.

Moreover, Sarsour wasn’t the only member of the Muslim delegation who should have provoked controversy among Democrats. The “Muslim Delegates and Allies Coalition” that Sarsour addressed includes Islamist clerics, activists, and community leaders who possess extremist views.

To be sure, Sarsour did not attend the national convention on behalf of Biden; she was invited by Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), who made a deal with the Biden campaign to drop out of the presidential race in April, so long as he could retain the delegates he won during the primaries. These delegates, including Sarsour and members of the Muslim coalition, voted against the official Democratic Party platform on August 4 because it failed to deny military aid to Israel and lift sanctions against Iran.

Although Sarsour was part of the Sanders delegation, the Biden campaign felt compelled to denounce her appearance before a small virtual audience of Muslim delegates. “Joe Biden has been a strong supporter of Israel and a vehement opponent of antisemitism his entire life, and he obviously condemns her views and opposes BDS, as does the Democratic platform,” Bates told CNN.

Certainly, Sarsour is worthy of criticism. In 2018, she was ousted as a co-chair of the national Women’s March for making antisemitic statements. In late 2019, the Palestinian American activist said that “Israel is built on the idea that Jews are supreme to everyone else.” She has also stated that “nothing is creepier than Zionism” and refused to denounce Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a notorious Jew-hater.

Most significantly, Sarsour is an outspoken BDS adherent, a movement that Biden believes “singles out Israel and too often veers into anti-Semitism.” His concerns are warranted: the Ramallah-based BDS National Committee is composed of a coalition of Palestinian terrorist groups working with U.S. and European civil rights NGOs to destroy Israel through economic and diplomatic isolation.

Despite these concerns, Biden continues to ignore the BDS advocate on his staff. In June 2018, his liaison to the Muslim American community, Farooq Mitha, shared a Facebook post opposing federal legislation to prohibit U.S. businesses from joining foreign boycotts against Israel.

Mitha is a founding board member of Emgage, an umbrella of civic engagement projects consumed with electing pro-Islamist political candidates. Emgage holds many of its political literacy programs at terror-tied mosques, such as Florida’s Darul Uloom Institute, former home to Al Qaeda “Dirty Bomber” Jose Padilla. In 2014, Emgage (formerly Emerge USA) hosted Sayed Ammar Nakshawani, a British-Iraqi Islamist who has questioned Holocaust casualty figures and referred to members of a historic Jewish tribe as “loan sharks” to justify their slaughter by early Muslims.

Sarsour and Mitha, however, are hardly alone in championing a destructive boycott against Israel. The Muslim Delegates and Allies Coalition convinced the DNC to adopt its recommendation discouraging “elected officials from authoring or sponsoring anti-First Amendment anti-BDS legislation that chills speech and infringes on rights guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution.”

Some members of this Muslim delegation surpass Sarsour in terms of extremism, and their appearance at the national convention should have aroused dissent from party officials and the Biden campaign.

For instance, Asad Zaman is a delegate from Minnesota and the director of his state’s Muslim American Society chapter, an Islamist nonprofit known as the “overt arm” of the Muslim Brotherhood in America. Zaman has shared neo-Nazi websites on his social media which deny the Holocaust. He even publicly mourned the execution of a war criminal belonging to Jamaat-e-Islami, a violent South Asian Islamist movement.

Khurrum Wahid wasn’t only a Florida delegate to the DNC, but he also sat on the Democratic Party’s Platform Committee. A founding member and former co-chair of Emgage, Wahid built his South Florida legal practice around representing some of America’s most notorious terrorism offenders. His clients include Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, an al-Qaeda operative who received a life sentence for plotting to assassinate President George W. Bush.

Texas delegate Azhar Azeez is the former president of the Islamic Society of North America, an Islamist nonprofit listed in 2008 as an unindicted co-conspirator in the nation’s largest terrorism finance trial for supporting the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. Azeez called Israel’s right to defend itself “false propaganda,” and he promoted a YouTube video claiming that support for Israel is predicated in a sinister Jewish lobby.

Michigan delegate Huwaida Arraf is a lawyer who represented Palestinian terrorist Rasmeah Odeh, the “principal architect” of a 1969 bombing that killed two Israelis. Arraf also helped organize the 2010 Gaza flotilla, a publicity stunt by international activists to break an Israeli naval blockade against Hamas.

Other delegates include BDS advocates Sameena Usman, Samia Assed, Faisal Qazi, and Sabina Mohammad,

Ultimately, the DNC agenda expressed opposition to the BDS movement, while noting the importance of “protecting the constitutional right of our citizens to free speech.” In other words, the Democratic Party will oppose anti-BDS legislation enacted in 28 states, despite acknowledging the boycott’s inherent bigotry.

Unfortunately, the Biden campaign’s brief moment of courage has already been negated. Just days after condemning Sarsour, the Democratic presidential nominee sent his top advisors to placate Islamist supporters upset over the controversy. They apologized profusely, calling Bates’ statement an “egregious misstep” and pledging “to do better going forward.”

After such a cowardly and timid retraction, Democrats who are truly committed to equality have little hope of rooting out bigotry and antisemitism within the party — nevermind the country. How can they, when the delegates who write the rules are some of the most outspoken offenders?

"Joe Biden Lies All The Time, But The Media Just Plays Along","Joe Biden (or more likely, his staff) recently took to Twitter to push out the passive-aggressive proclamation: “You deserve a president who tells you the truth.” Without reflection, the media regurgitated the Democratic presidential candidate’s talking point, helping the Biden campaign market its “character counts” theme.

While the right is accustomed to the corporate media’s double-standards when reporting on Republican and Democratic Party politicians, this latest example is emblematic of the reality that in this election cycle the media’s bias has jumped from merely slanting stories for their preferred candidate: The corporate press’s election coverage this year moves it squarely into the position of propaganda.

With nary an exception, every Trump tweet prompts criticism, fact-checks, or both from the hostile media. But when Biden’s team, in effect, calls the president a liar, there is no chastisement for incivility or claims the presidential wannabe is dividing the country. Rather, the press uses Biden’s tweet as a hook for another anti-Trump story, while ignoring Biden’s chronic peddling of falsehoods.

A favorite lie of Biden’s is that Trump called the white supremacists who descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, “very fine people.” No amount of fact-checking that falsehood with the transcript of Trump’s remarks — he specifically clarified, and this is a quote from him, “I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and white nationalists because they should be condemned totally” — has stopped Biden from repeating the lie.

In a foreshadowing of what would soon be unveiled as Biden’s campaign theme, Biden tweeted the lie in mid-August to further his assertion that “we are in a battle for the soul of our nation.”

Biden then featured the prevarication in his elect-me-because­-I’m-nice Democratic National Convention speech. “Just a week ago yesterday was the third anniversary of the events in Charlottesville,” Biden intoned. “Remember seeing those neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists coming out of the fields with lighted torches? Veins bulging? Spewing the same antisemitic bile heard across Europe in the ’30s? Remember the violent clash that ensued between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it? Remember what the president said? There were quote, ‘very fine people on both sides.’”

“At that moment, I knew I’d have to run,” Biden told his fellow Democrats. “At the time, I said we were in a battle for the soul of this nation,” Biden repeated, hitting his holier-than-him mantra.

With all the talk of soul-cleansing, one would think the media would ask Biden how he is fit for that role given his chronic lying about Trump’s words. This lie isn’t merely election-year political puffery: Biden intentionally chooses to misrepresent Trump’s words to foment racial tensions in the hopes of safeguarding the black vote. How can a candidate who seeks to divide to win an election hope to claim the mantle of healer-in-chief?

Since Biden proclaimed character as his raison d’être for being elected president, not only has the press not challenged his claims, it has joined forces with Democrats to further that narrative. Indeed, just a week ago, The Atlantic ran a story smearing Trump as a hateful, self-centered leader, who disrespects our fallen heroes.

“When President Donald Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris in 2018, he blamed the rain for the last-minute decision, saying ‘the helicopter couldn’t fly’ and that the Secret Service wouldn’t drive him there. Neither claim was true,” Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg opened the hit piece, then continued with a myriad of nasty comments supposedly attributed to Trump.

More than 20 officials who were with Trump on that trip dispute Goldberg’s reporting, however, and when open-records-requested documents established the cemetery visit was canceled due to inclement weather, Goldberg was forced to admit the thesis of his story was false. Yet even with denials of the story from Trump critic and former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who was on the trip, Biden parlayed the hit piece into a campaign ad.

Mr. Biden, how can you heal the soul of the country by slandering your political enemies while atop the graves of dead heroes?

While the lies Biden peddles prove the most compelling counter to his claim of superior character, they are not the sole stain on the pristine persona he attempts to present to the public. Over the last year, a hostile Biden has hollered, “You’re full of sh-t,” at a UAW autoworker who confronted the candidate about his position on gun rights, then after shushing a campaign aide trying to extricate Biden from the scene, he seethed at the union member, “Don’t be a horse’s ass.”

At other times when challenged on his position or the facts, Biden has lashed out against voters with bizarre exchanges, calling one a “lying, dog-faced, pony soldier,” another “fats,” and telling one man, “I’m beginning to see why your wife left you.”

Biden’s bullying expands beyond Joe and Joanne Public with hits against reporters, such as Errol Barnett of CBS News who asked if Biden had ever been tested for “cognitive decline.” “Biden dodged the question by asking the black reporter whether or not he took a drug test before participating in the panel. ‘That’s like saying before you got on this program did you take a test where you’re taking cocaine or not huh? Are you a junkie?’”

Despite all this, as Biden presents Trump as the unfit bully and himself as the righteous unifier, the media willfully assists in this marketing effort. To be sure, it’s not just that the press ignores Biden’s blatant lies about Trump, including racially divisive falsehoods. It’s not merely the media glossing over Biden’s intemperate exchanges with voters. While the media rails against every imprecise word used by Trump or revisits his past to cast aspersions on his present. Biden’s past and present escapes scrutiny.

Passing mention may be of Biden’s lie that his wife and daughter were killed by a trucker who “drank his lunch.” A snippet may play highlighting Biden’s 1987 lies about his academic career. Coverage may briefly break of a former staffer’s allegation that Biden sexually assaulted her. And an outlet or two might run reports that Biden was accused of having an affair with his now-wife Jill when she was still married to her first husband. But no narrative forms about Biden’s character apart from the favorable one he and his fellow Democrats present.

Any other year, the media’s assist could be written off as their longstanding routine of playing favorites. But because Biden sells himself as the savior to our splintered country and his character as the most important reason for voting for him, this year is different.

We’re meant to believe that if Biden lands in the Oval Office and silences Trump’s unpresidential words, unity will reign from sea to shining sea. This is nonsense. And the media knows it.

Joe Biden Crassly Capitalizes On Cop-Killing Attempt For Gun Control,"Joe Biden has a way of twisting and co-opting events to usher in his radical anti-gun agenda. This is evident most recently in his thoughtless tweet demanding his vision of far-left gun control in the wake of an assassination attempt on two Los Angeles County Sheriff deputies.

The former vice president, who is trotted out by his wife as the presidential candidate who “feels” America’s angst, was blithely callous when he tweeted for gun and magazine bans less than 24 hours after a criminal brazenly walked up to a sheriff’s vehicle and fired several times with a handgun, critically wounding two deputies.

Biden’s first instinct was to call for a ban on “weapons of war,” facts be damned. What’s more important to Biden is to establish the “it’s the gun’s fault” narrative. Biden also demonstrated willful ignorance concerning how he and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., are complicit in stoking anti-police animus.

Ignorance or Exposure

Biden either exposes his ignorance of firearms and existing laws or opens up his true intentions on gun control. “Weapons of war have no place in our communities,” his tweet said. “We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.”

Surveillance video clearly shows the assailant walk up to the deputies’ vehicle and fire a handgun several times, striking both deputies in the face and head. The criminal wasn’t holding Biden’s vaunted “assault weapon,” a term invented by gun control advocates to scare Americans into adopting the gun control narrative.

The Violence Policy Center’s Josh Sugarmann created the term in 1988 to confuse and mislead the public into believing that commonly owned semiautomatic rifles are the same as machine guns. Sugarmann wrote, “[A]nything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine gun [and] — can only increase the chance of public support for restrictions of these weapons.” In reality, the modern sporting rifle operates in the same manner as other semiautomatic firearms, firing one round with each pull and release of the trigger.

Biden knows this yet perpetuates this myth. He cherry-picks data to support his political agenda but ignores the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s findings that the ban on AR-15 rifles and magazines had no effect on crime reduction. He would reinstate an even more draconian version of the 1994 assault weapons ban. Instead of just banning the sale of modern sporting rifles with certain cosmetic features that have no bearing on the firearm’s function, he’d go further.

Biden’s Gun Control

Biden’s plan would put current modern sporting-rifle owners on government watchlists by forcing them to register their guns under the restrictions of the National Firearms Act, which is the same tax-and-license plan in place for machine guns and firearm suppressors. These permits require fingerprint and photo submissions, tax fees, multiple background checks, and paperwork delays averaging nine months or longer.

It gets worse. Biden’s plan includes a provision to use taxpayer funds to “buy back” privately owned firearms from those who refuse to register with government watchlists. Biden also stood on the campaign stage with Beto O’Rourke, pledging to make him his gun control czar, even after the former representative from Texas shouted “Hell, yes,” he would confiscate modern sporting rifles by force, if necessary.

If he got his way, Biden would put the more than 18 million modern sporting rifles in circulation in jeopardy. He’d also outlaw more than half the firearm magazines in possession today, according to questions raised by a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which rejected California’s ban as unconstitutional. That decision is pending an en banc hearing, and 17 state attorneys general signed on, begging the court to keep the ban.

Doing Backers’ Bidding

Biden is purposefully conflating handguns and criminal activity with lawful firearm ownership. The concern is why. Biden’s tweet clearly labels what he sees in the video as a “weapon of war,” and Biden’s backers, including anti-gun billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who funds the gun control groups Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action, don’t want everyday Americans to own firearms.

Bloomberg said Americans can’t be trusted with their constitutional right to own a gun. He made this outrageous claim just days after Jack Wilson, a concealed carry permit-holder and member of the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, responded immediately to a murderer in his church and neutralized the threat just six seconds after it began. Bloomberg is now dumping $100 million into Florida to buy the state for Biden and Bloomberg’s gun control fantasy.

Biden’s call for gun control in the wake of a blatant attack is also tone-deaf to the tacit approval he and Harris gave to the mob targeting police. Biden said, “Yes, absolutely,” when asked if he would support redirecting funding away from police departments. Harris promoted and solicited donations to the Minnesota Freedom Fund to bail out rioters, looters, and those attacking police. Those donations include bailing out a two-time rapist and other violent criminals.

Biden’s call to ban guns in the wake of an attack on police shows how obtuse he is. This wasn’t a mistimed tweet or poorly worded platform plank. If Biden has his way, we’ll be left with a disarmed America, rendered helpless against the criminals he refuses to confront.

Leaked Call Reveals Biden Risked National Security To Sabotage Trump,"A recently leaked phone call between then-Vice President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko directly after the 2016 presidential election shows that Biden sought to sabotage the incoming Trump administration before Donald Trump even took office, and much worse.

During the course of the call, Biden badmouthed the incoming administration, saying, “The truth of the matter is that the incoming administration doesn’t know a great deal about [Ukraine]” and that they were unprepared for the transition. This in itself is inappropriate, but it was meant to set the stage for Biden’s next statement and future plans.

Biden then told Poroshenko, “I don’t plan on going away. As a private citizen, I plan on staying deeply engaged in the endeavor that you have begun and we have begun.” In a matter of moments, Biden undermined the incoming administration, branded them as not knowing anything about Ukraine, and attempted to set up a foreign policy backchannel for himself after he left office as a private citizen, which could violate the Logan Act.

The Logan Act bars private citizens from engaging in U.S. foreign policy, although its constitutionality remains questionable and no person has ever been convicted of violating it since it was signed into law in 1799. Ironically, this is the same act that, at Joe Biden’s suggestion, the FBI accused National Security Advisor Michael Flynn of violating as a result of a discussion Flynn had with the Russian ambassador to the United States around nearly the same time as Biden’s call with Poroshenko.

To fortify his position and to make Poroshenko more confident that he should continue to deal with Biden once he left office, in the call Biden also intimated that there is a problem with the incoming administration: “The reason I bother to tell you that is I have been somewhat limited on what I am able to tell their team about Ukraine.”

While Biden blamed this on a late start to the transition process, we now know he said this at the same time the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies were conducting a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia, known as “Crossfire Hurricane,” of which Ukraine was a part.

Since it was leaked by a Ukrainian member of Parliament, the phone call was obviously recorded by the Ukrainians, and almost certainly by Russian intelligence services. Biden would have been aware of this from his time on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as vice president.

So Biden, the sitting vice president of the United States, told a foreign leader whose country was part of a highly classified FBI counterintelligence investigation that there were things he couldn’t share about his country with the incoming administration and that they weren’t cleared. We now know from subsequent investigations that the Trump administration did not in fact collude with Russia, but at the time, Biden didn’t and he was privy to the fact that the FBI had opened the investigation.

If Russian intelligence had actually penetrated the incoming Trump administration, Biden’s comments would have almost certainly tipped them off that something was amiss, placing our national security in grave danger.

Additionally, it is mind-boggling that the vice president felt comfortable telling a foreign leader that there were things he was unable to tell the incoming administration at the same time the Department of Justice and the FBI failed to notify President-elect Trump of potential counterintelligence risks (that ended up not being true) posed by members of his campaign team who might join his administration in official capacities.

In the end, it is clear that Biden exercised incredibly poor judgment, placing a highly classified counterintelligence operation at risk; undermined the incoming administration; and attempted to set up a foreign policy backchannel for himself so he could remain involved in U.S-Ukrainian policy even though he was not sanctioned to do so by law.

All of this took place while his son, Hunter Biden, was on the payroll of a Ukrainian energy firm for which he admitted he had no related experience.

Biden Resurrects False Claim That Helped Ruin His 1988 Presidential Run,"Joe Biden is not the first person in his family to have gone to college. But he has a lengthy history of claiming otherwise, no matter how much the lie gets him in trouble.

Even after having famously admitted exactly 33 years ago to the day that he had family who had gone to college before him, Biden once again made the false claim at a CNN Town Hall on Thursday night.

Biden enthusiast Charlotte Alter, a national correspondent at Time magazine, tweeted out his line, apparently unaware of its role in Biden’s 1987 presidential campaign collapse:

Back in 1987, The New York Times published Biden’s quote admitting that was not true:

In addition, Mr. Biden said … he had miscast some of his own forebears, painting them as having rather more humble origins than they in fact did. For example, borrowing Mr. Kinnock’s sentiments, Mr. Biden had said he was ‘the first in his family ever to go to university.’ In fact, Mr. Biden said today, ‘there are Finnegans, my mother’s family, that went to college.’

Among others, his great-grandfather attended college at a time in which fewer than 2 percent of college-aged men and women in the United States did so. Now it’s around 60 percent.

Anniversary Of Kinnock Plagiarism Scandal

Biden’s first failed run for the presidency was ended by his dishonesty over his academic record and his plagiarism, including the biography and speeches of British Labor politician Neil Kinnock.

On a campaign stop in New Hampshire in 1987, a voter asked Biden where he attended law school and where he placed in his class.

Biden lashed out at the man angrily, making a series of claims that were not true:

BIDEN: I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect. I went to law school on a full academic scholarship, the only one in my — in my class to have a full academic scholarship. In the first year in law school I decided didn’t want to be in law school and ended up in the bottom two-thirds of my class, and then decided I wanted to stay, went back to law school, and in fact ended up in the top half of my class. I won the international moot-court competition. I was the outstanding student in the political science department at the end of my year. I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school and 165 credits — I only needed 123 credits. And I’d be delighted to sit down and compare my IQ to yours if you’d like Frank.

It turned out that Biden did not receive a full academic scholarship, but a half scholarship based on financial need. He did not end up in the top half of his class, but near the very bottom. There is no record of him winning the moot court competition. He did not receive the outstanding student award at the University of Delaware. And he graduated with only one degree.

Worse, a release of his academic records showed that Biden had plagiarized five pages of a law review article.

Biden was also busted for lifting lines from the speeches of British Labor politician Neil Kinnock and other politicians. In Kinnock’s case, he even took biographical details as his own, such as that he was the first member of his family to attend college. That was true for Kinnock, but it was not true for Biden, as he admitted in 1987.

This video shows examples of his plagiarism:

Media Ignorance of Biden History

The media praised Biden’s line about college, apparently unaware of its history. It was such big news at the time that even Johnny Carson mocked Biden for it. Politico’s Tim Alberta said it might be the “single-most effective line” deployed against Trump since his political career began.

“Nobody has ever prosecuted the case that Trump, beneath the Queens bluster, actually despises his base,” the “chief political correspondent” opined. Tara Setmayer, one of CNN’s Never Trump activists, agreed that it was an “excellent moment” for Biden.

The Washington Post’s “fact” “checker” watched the town hall and gave Biden high marks, gently dinging him for saying, for example, patently absurd things such as that no one would have died from the coronavirus if Donald Trump had “done his job.” Nevertheless, the overall review was kind.

“A Joe Biden town hall does not hit the Pinocchio meter as much as a Donald Trump town hall. Biden tends to stick close to the facts but occasionally gets carried away with some over-exuberance,” Glenn Kessler and Salvador Rizzo wrote. (For perspective, the Washington Post “fact” “checking” team has claimed, among other things, that Trump is lying to say that the Russia collusion probe was a “witch hunt” that hampered his ability to do his job.)

Kessler and Rizzo completely missed Biden’s false claim about college, even as they gently dinged him for erroneously saying that if he were elected he’d be the first president without an Ivy League degree. There are many without such a degree, including Ronald Reagan, they note.

But the famous false claim about being the first in his family to go to college was not even noticed by the vaunted “fact” “checkers.”

The Washington Post has covered the issue previously, however. In June of last year, the Washington Post mentioned Biden’s lie about college, in an article headlined “Echoes of Biden’s 1987 plagiarism scandal continue to reverberate.”

‘Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?’ he asks in the speech. Referring to his ancestors, some of whom were coal miners, he adds: ‘Was it because all our predecessors were thick? . . . Those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry? . . . Those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football?’ In the other, Biden speaks at the close of a debate at the Iowa State Fair. ‘Why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university? . . . Is it because I’m the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree? That I was smarter than the rest? Those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse? Is it because they didn’t work hard? My ancestors, who worked in the coal mines of northeast Pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours?’

The article noted, “Biden also acknowledged that he had inaccurately appropriated some details of Kinnock’s life: While Biden was the first on his father’s side of the family to go to college, he was not the first in his whole family. And his ancestors had not been coal miners; rather, some were mining engineers.”

Biden came clean about his plagiarism, his dishonesty about his academic record, and the fact that he was not the first person in his family to attend college back in 1983. He even addressed the scandal, which forced him out of the presidential race, in a subsequent book. It is unclear why he has resurrected one of the false claims that got him in so much trouble 33 years ago.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/18/joe-biden-resurrects-false-college-claim-that-helped-ruin-his-1988-presidential-run/,2020-09-18
"After Taking Another Day Off The Campaign Trail, It’s Time To Ask If Biden Is OK","Tuesday morning before 9 a.m., the Biden campaign announced it was putting a lid on the day. For those unfamiliar with this lingo it means that Biden will have no events or appearances for the rest of the day.

This is a Tuesday, just 42 days away from an election that by all accounts seems to be tightening, especially in key battleground states. To basically take the day off in the midst of a heated campaign is strange, even more so because he has done this several times in the past few weeks. It is becoming impossible not to wonder if Biden really is fit to campaign, and by extension, be president of the United States.

Personally, I detest the politics of mental or physical decline. I didn’t like the attacks made on Hillary Clinton’s health in 2016, or the ridiculous assertions that Trump has had anything from a stroke to dementia. For most of the past few months when I did interviews and the subject of Biden’s well being came up I just sloughed it off, making it clear it wasn’t something I wanted to discuss because I had no way of assessing it. That is starting to change.

The fair thing to do here is to look first at the Biden campaign’s own explanation for all these days off. It basically boils down to “this is our plan and we know what we are doing.” Fair enough. They clearly think Biden does better in controlled environments, because he does and they do still lead in the polls, even if Biden is leading from the basement.

However, in the days before the Democratic National Convention last month Biden finally escaped the basement and seemed to be revving up his engine for more conventional campaigning. That engine is stalling out now, very often.

To be sure, at times the former vice president has seemed full of vim and vigor in recent weeks, but at other times, has appeared sluggish and tired. This has led President Trump to suggest, perhaps in jest, that Biden is taking drugs or stimulants before events. Trump has even called for drug testing before the debate. That seems unlikely to come to fruition, but it does drive home the point.

At this point in presidential elections we are accustomed to seeing a full court political press. Instead, Joe Biden seems to be standing under the basket waiting for a rebound. And the fact of the matter is that the crushing and brutal schedule a presidential candidate faces on the campaign trail does inform voters about a certain kind of fitness for an office in which matters of great global importance can pop up any time, day or night. The American people need to know that Joe Biden can work a full day for more than just a few in a row.

This is an issue that most of the corporate media really, really, really does not want to cover. But we are getting to a place where they will just have no choice. Put simply, what looked this summer like a reasonable strategy to lay low and let an inevitable win come to Biden now looks flat out bizarre. The polls are getting closer, Trump is doing rallies, sometimes more than one, almost everyday, and the contrast in apparent physical and mental fitness grows more stark each day Biden hides out in the bunker instead of pounding the trail.

Another wrinkle in all of this is that Biden campaign has basically bet the farm on a policy of emphasizing that the COVID crisis is not over and we are not once again in normal times. More than anything else, that was the theme of their convention which was for the most part literally phoned in. The more normal campaign events Biden does, the less it feels like we are still neck deep in a crisis. That makes a kind of twisted sense but it is now being outweighed by the pure strangeness of this campaign that isn’t.

A major issue in this campaign is whether Biden, if elected, really will be the president, or just a figurehead for those really pulling the political strings. All of these days off only add fuel to that fire. And there is no doubt that Trump will continue to hammer this message home as he has been doing for months now.

I am still not in a position to know whether Joe Biden has suffered mental or physical decline that could be disqualifying for the presidency, I just don’t have enough information. But I expected that by now I would. I expected that after the convention he would surely have two and a half months worth of stamina to prove he is fully fit and up for the task.

He hasn’t done that. I want to know why, and I can no longer rule out the possibility that he just doesn’t have it in him. Biden needs to understand and he needs to understand now that you can’t be elected president without actually running for president, even against Donald Trump.

Joe Biden needs to get off the bench and get in the game. If he doesn’t, he won’t like the final score when the clock runs out.

"Joe Biden Isn’t Running For President, His Teleprompter Is","Election 2020 has seen its fair share of the comical and bizarre, of the heartening and debased. There is something to be learned from it all, I believe, even from a simple machine designed to facilitate clear communication to the general public. Once the prized, not-so-secret weapon of President Obama’s supposed rhetorical prowess, the teleprompter has become the conspicuous centerpiece of Joe Biden’s third attempt to capture America’s highest office.

Saving Obama from his tendency to uhhhh and errrr his way through the English language, the teleprompter made him appear oh-so-presidential and caused his swooning supporters’ chests to swell with pride, and gormless Republicans to quake in their loafers. The teleprompter was so essential to preserving Obama’s carefully crafted image that someone started a parody blog with the catchy tagline, “There is no POTUS without TOTUS.” No matter what the teleprompter says or what its handler does, Biden is bound to gaffe it up.

What is happening here in this interview w/ @JoeBiden? After he says he’ll freeze deportations once becoming president, he tells someone off camera, “I lost that line.” Telemundo’s @jdbalart then tells him “We can talk you and I on that.” José, was he reading his responses? pic.twitter.com/Yoausx0zTr — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 21, 2020

Stepping on a rake has been part of Biden’s shtick for ages, and we’ve been gaslighted to think this is the essence of charm. That’s just Joe, folks! But in 2014, then-Vice President Biden’s blunders caught up with him again, this time embarrassing the Obama administration.

So The New Yorker published an article about his verbal doozies that riled allies at home and interests abroad. That was not that long ago, but six years can have a profound, compounding effect on the brain. It’s now a crapshoot what’s going to come out of Biden’s mouth on or off the prompter.

Biden has regressed to the point of reading cues out loud, giving hand signals—that we can see—to scroll up the text, and botching words as they appear on the screen. At one point during a remote interview with “The Late Late Show with James Corden,” Biden held up a picture of himself with sons Hunter and Beau, and the frame’s reflection revealed a teleprompter—a big fat warning sign that he needed help for such a non-serious, televised appearance.

It’s become clear that Biden is also using a teleprompter during interviews with “journalists,” press conferences, and townhall events. Rather than merely a normal and expected part of a campaign for making speeches and policy addresses, the teleprompter has become a crutch for the befuddled Biden. It of course says something very serious about the state of his mental affairs that he’s better on prompter than off.

Off, he meanders aimlessly about chicken manure and “you know, the thing” (equal rights in the Declaration of Independence). He tells oddball stories about Corn Pop and hairy legs and gets aggressive with voters who challenge his record and policy positions. These are but a few examples, and not the actions of a well-adjusted human being.

Last Wednesday, the Trump campaign released a scathing one-minute ad entitled, “Joe’s Teleprompter,” showing Biden struggling to communicate, awkwardly filling the gaps with exhausted-sounding sighs and noises. The ad also shows Biden’s national press secretary T.J. Ducklo avoiding Fox News anchor Bret Baier’s pointed question whether Biden uses a teleprompter in interviews and Q&As.

At campaign rallies last week in Minnesota and North Carolina, President Trump hit hard the point that Biden clearly lacks the mental capacity and energy to defend America against her greatest threat: China. Putting aside his well-aimed and comically timed jibes, Trump zeroed in on his ultimate point. To the huge crowd in Bemidji, Minn., he asked:

Would you rather go teleprompter or freelance? Isn’t it nice when you have the option because you have this [pointing to his head] and you have the option to go either? See, Joe doesn’t have the option. He doesn’t have the option. But if Biden wins, China wins, and it’s very simple.

Biden has skirted the topic of China or lauded the country outright, soft-pedaling the communist regime’s shenanigans, including its complicity in the coronavirus, intellectual property theft, and dubious trade practices. Biden’s financial interests in China have dovetailed conveniently with his political ambitions, leveraging the latter to secure the former. Great research by Peter Schweizer and others highlights the problematic Biden-China relationship, and the Trump campaign rightly targets this glaring weakness, and how Biden’s antics in front of the teleprompter exacerbate the dynamic.

Something clearly is wrong with Biden’s mental acuity, and the magical powers of a teleprompter can only do so much. As we veer wildly toward Nov. 3, Biden sounds increasingly tired—that is, when we see him at all. “Calling a lid” (taking a break from campaigning) first thing Saturday morning—less than two months before Election Day and less than 24 hours after Supreme Court Justice Ginsberg passed away—skywrites to the world a total lack of interest and vigor to campaign, let alone govern.

The cynical conduct of the Democratic Party, not to mention Biden’s own family, who let it get this far tells us how low they are willing to go, and what it will cost the rest of us if we let them win. As if we needed further proof in a year as lit as 2020.

Media Love Joe Biden's Faith And Hate Amy Coney Barrett's,"The media loves to fawn over the pious and heartfelt Catholicism of Joe Biden. Now they’re talking about the Catholic faith of Amy Coney Barrett, the frontrunner to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. But you’ll notice a very different tone. The key differences are their adherence to their faith’s actual teachings, as well as their political leanings.

The Washington Post can’t call Barrett a “devout Catholic” without including in the same sentence that she is “fervently antiabortion.” Meanwhile, Biden touts his Catholicism — despite his support for abortion, which church teaching expressly calls a “moral evil.”

The Post also notes that, when Barrett was first nominated to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, “Democrats balked at her nomination, questioning whether the academic could be an impartial arbiter because of her deep religious convictions.” If Biden has deep religious convictions, it has never bothered the Post.

Newsweek went further, suggesting that the religious community Barrett and her family are part of was the inspiration for “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood. In the book’s dystopian world, Newsweek says, “women’s bodies are governed and treated as the property of the state under a theocratic regime.” Newsweek later corrected the article’s wild claims to say that Atwood’s inspiration was in fact another unrelated group.

Barrett and her family are part of a group called “People of Praise,” a Christian community that emphasizes members keeping each other accountable to biblical teaching. Members have spiritual mentors, some of whom have been smeared as “handmaids,” prompting Atwood’s novel and Newsweek’s apparent concern. Reuters also compared Barrett’s community to “The Handmaid’s Tale.”

The New York Times ran a story in 2017, when Barrett was appointed to the 7th Circuit, headlined “Some Worry About Judicial Nominee’s Ties to a Religious Group.” The story also noted Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s comment toward Barrett during Barrett’s confirmation hearing: “The dogma lives loudly in you.”

In an apparent criticism of Barrett’s views on abortion, Refinery 29 recently proclaimed that Barrett “hates your uterus.” No word about Biden’s hatred for uteruses even though he supports violently emptying them of human life.

Ron Charles, a writer for the Washington Post, tweeted about Barrett’s belief that a “legal career is but a means to an end … and that end is building the Kingdom of God.”

https://twitter.com/RonCharles/status/1307737438006243330

Film director Arlen Parsa, in a now-deleted tweet, called Barrett a “Catholic extremist” who “wants the rest of American women to be stuck with her extreme lifestyle.”

In another tweet that has since been deleted, former Special Counsel for the Obama White House Norm Eisen called Barrett’s faith community, which is part of a religion that is 2,000 years old, a “secretive religious cult.” Edward Ongweso Jr., a writer at Vice, also tweeted about Barrett’s “cult.”

oh her cult literally inspired margaret atwood's book, that's cool https://t.co/XpxEWEsf06 — Edward Ongweso Jr (@bigblackjacobin) September 21, 2020

An op-ed published by the New York Times expressed concerns that adding Barrett would put simply too many Catholics on the Supreme Court. Ever see them publish an op-ed about how there are too many men on the court or too many Ivy League law school grads?

When coverage of Barrett’s faith isn’t downright bigoted like this, it’s usually used as an entry point into a discussion of Barrett’s views on abortion. Her faith is hardly applauded as an endearing, positive trait. Biden’s Catholicism, however, is a different story.

“How Joe Biden’s Faith Shaped His Politics,” is the headline of one article on NPR. “When Joe Biden seeks to inspire or comfort, he turns to his faith,” it continues. “Biden, who carries a rosary in his pocket and attends Mass every Sunday, is known as a deeply devout person of faith.”

This isn’t an old article either — it was published on Sunday, at the same time outlets have been criticizing Barrett. NPR goes on to quote Biden’s deputy political director, John McCarthy, on how Biden’s Catholicism is a positive attribute of his presidential run: “Because this is such a true part of Joe Biden, this is something that is just in the core messaging of our campaign.”

The Salt Lake Tribune tells an endearing story of young Senator Biden meeting Pope John Paul II and compares Biden’s faith to that of fellow Catholic John F. Kennedy. “Joe Biden’s Catholic politics are complicated, but deeply American,” the headline insists.

“Joe Biden is a man of faith,” praises CNN. “Biden grew up in a multigenerational Catholic home, where he says he learned the foundational principles of politics,” the article continues. It also highlights nice anecdotes of Biden slipping away to pray while vice president, and of his faith helping him through the loss of his son Beau. Biden even wears Beau’s rosary on his wrist, CNN tells us.

Another CNN article explains how “personal loss, pastoral instincts and his son’s rosary” are “what defines Joe Biden.” CNN also did a documentary about Biden’s faith; we hear a friend and fellow senator talk about Biden’s faith while birds chirp gently in the background, and then Jill Biden reminds listeners again that “Joe is really devout.” Next, Biden pulls Beau’s rosary out of his pocket to show CNN’s Gloria Borger, prompting Borger to blink back her emotions before telling Anderson Cooper what a “remarkable moment” it was.

The Washington Post adds, “Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.” Rushing to defend against Trump’s accusation that the former vice president is “against God,” the Post reassures its readers that Biden “has been motivated by his faith throughout his long career in politics.”

Time reminds us that Biden is the country’s “first Catholic vice president,” and quotes his deputy political director praising his religious “authenticity.” And when Sister Dede Byrne, a nun speaking at the Republican National Convention, criticized Biden’s stance on abortion — a stance completely at odds with that of his church — Politico accused the “GOP” of “attacking” Biden’s faith.

The media can’t have it both ways. The drastically different portrayals of Biden’s and Barrett’s faith shows legacy media’s deep partisanship and subjection of every consideration to leftist power politics, like Melania Trump and Kamala Harris’s Timberland boots. Biden and Barrett’s faith should be treated equally, and if corporate media were fair and balanced, they would do so.

Hunter Biden Took $3.5 Million From Ex-Moscow Mayor’s Wife,"A new Senate report out Wednesday shows former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden accepted $3.5 million from the wife of a fired mayor of Moscow in 2014.

According to the joint report released by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee with the Senate Finance Committee, Rosemont Seneca, an investment firm co-founded by Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina in 2014 while his father, Joe Biden, was vice president. The firm was also co-founded with former Secretary of State John Kerry’s stepson Christopher Heinz, which received the money while Kerry was serving as the head of the State Department.

Baturina used to be married to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov who was fired in 2010 by then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev over allegations of corruption benefiting Baturina’s enterprises.

“Luzhkov used his position as mayor to approve over 20 real estate projects that were built by a Baturina-owned construction company and ultimately generated multibillion-ruble profits for his family,” Senate investigators wrote.

Other items in the Senate’s long-anticipated report detailing the Biden family’s conflicts of interest include accusations that Hunter Biden paid Eastern European hookers who might have been trafficked.

Hunter Biden, the committees wrote, initiated some transactions that were Russian- and Ukrainian-linked to what “appears to be an Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.”

The Senate’s conclusions from an investigation launched in 2017, long before Joe Biden would eventually make an entrance into the crowded Democratic presidential race come now just 41 days until the November election and features a wide array of potentially criminal allegations exposing a far deeper level of corruption in the people working with the Biden family than previously known.

In China, a series of businessmen working with Hunter Biden to establish a private equity firm investing Chinese capital in major American projects were also shown to possess deep ties within the Chinese Communist Party. The same Chinese business leaders also reportedly opened up a line of credit allowing Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s brother James Biden, and James’ wife Sara to go on a more than $100,000 shopping spree that included extravagant items such as airplane tickets and high-tech products from Apple.

“The transaction,” committee investigators wrote, “was identified for potential financial criminal activity.”

Senate investigators also found that Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma where Hunter Biden raked in an excess upwards of $50,000 a month for serving on the board, bribed Ukrainian prosecutors to shut down an investigation into the firm and release $23 million in frozen assets by British authorities.

The bribe reportedly raised red flags within the State Department, where Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent who also served as the department’s top official on Ukraine, informed Vice President Joe Biden’s office of his concerns which were dismissed by White House staff.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/23/hunter-biden-took-3-5-million-from-ex-moscow-mayors-wife/,2020-09-23
Senate Report: Burisma Bribed Officials After Hunter Biden Joined Board,"The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee released the first part of its long-awaited report with the Senate Treasury Committee Wednesday detailing a wide array of Hunter Biden’s conflicts of interest, including potentially criminal overseas business activity while his father Joe Biden served as vice president.

Among the key findings in the report are substantial allegations that Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, from which Hunter Biden raked in upwards of $50,000 a month for serving the board, paid a $7 million bribe to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office to close an investigation seven months following Hunter Biden’s addition to its leadership.

According to the report, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, the State Department’s top official on Ukraine, told congressional investigators that he learned of the bribe from First Deputy Prosecutor General Anatoliy Danylenko during a Kyiv meeting on Feb. 3., 2015. The bribe was meant to close Ukrainian investigations and release $23 million of Zlochevsky’s frozen assets by British officials. At the time, Daylenko was the country’s number two prosecutor serving under Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Vitaly Yarema. One week after Kent confrontation with Danylenko, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko fired Yarema and other members of his team.

Kent testified that he learned shortly after the meeting with Danylenko that Hunter Biden was sitting on the board of the Ukrainian energy company owned by Zlochevsky. Biden’s role was supposedly to consult on corporate governance and transparency. Hunter Biden joined the firm and raked in excess compensation despite no prior experience in the industry just weeks after his business partner, Devon Archer, met with Joe Biden at the White House. Joe Biden had just recently been described by the press as the Obama administration’s “public face of the administration’s handling of Ukraine.”

Kent reportedly told lawmakers that the Department of Justice official at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv relayed the allegation of Zlochevsky’s $7 million bribe to the FBI. The Senate committees are still awaiting answers on what actions the federal law enforcement agency took, if any.

Kent also told lawmakers that upon learning of Hunter Biden’s lucrative role on Burisma’s board, he raised his concerns with the vice president’s office. The top State Department official testified over the course of President Donald Trump’s impeachment hearings that his discomfort about the situation was brushed off by the administration.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent told House members during a private deposition in October last year. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation.”

State Department officials, according to the Senate report, widely viewed Zlochevsky as a corrupt, “odious oligarch” who Kent described as “a poster child for corrupt behavior.”

“I would have advised any American not to get on the board of Zlochevsky’s company,” Kent said, telling colleagues in 2016 Zlochevsky “almost certainly paid off the [prosecutors] in December 2014.”

Vice President Joe Biden however, refused to launch accusations of corruption against Zlochevsky.

“The committees were not able to locate any public statements Vice President Biden gave from 2014 to 2016 in which he called Zlochevsky corrupt,” Senate investigators wrote in the joint report.

Instead, a Biden spokesperson told reporters, “the vice president does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company.”

The Senate’s report marks the first phase of revelations to emerge from the probe launched in 2017, long before Joe Biden jumped into the crowded presidential race in the spring of 2019.

In a desperate bid to shut down the investigation out of concern that its findings could harm their attempt at the White House in November, Democrats, true to form, repeatedly attacked the ongoing probe as an instrument of Russian interference in the upcoming U.S. election, accusing Republican senators of being Kremlin agents.

Even Democrats on the committees attempted to undermine the Republican-led probe by leaking selected material to the same press that suddenly began re-characterizing the ongoing three-year investigation as a political weapon being wielded against the Biden campaign once it was clear that the former vice president was going to capture the Democratic nomination.

Multiple letter requests prior to Biden’s March Super Tuesday victories show, however, that the probe aimed to wrap up much sooner before the pandemic-related shutdowns and a partisan impeachment distracted the government from its oversight work and the coronavirus brewing overseas.

Senate Report: Hunter Biden's Chinese Activity Raise Criminal Concerns,"Senate investigators released an earth-shattering report Wednesday outlining a long list of the Biden family’s conflicts of interest conducting shady overseas business activity with foreign adversaries while serving at the upper echelons of government, raising significant national security concerns with potentially criminal conduct and threats of extortion.

According to the joint report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee with the Senate Treasury Committee, Hunter Biden, along with business partner Devon Archer, “engaged in numerous financial transactions with Chinese nationals who had deep connections to the Communist Chinese government.”

These connections, investigators wrote, include Ye Jianming, the founder of CEFC China Energy Co. Ltd (CEFC), and his associate, Gongwen Dong, who reportedly carried out transactions for Jianming’s companies. Ye, the report noted, who formerly held positions with the People’s Liberation Army, also possessed financial connections to former Vice President Joe Biden’s brother, James Biden.

For years, according to the Senate report, Hunter Biden leveraged his vast network of connections to ultimately create the investment firm Bohai Harvest RST (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Co. (BHR), which prioritized investing Chinese capital in overseas projects. The financial group received its approval for a Chinese business license after a series of meetings arranged by Hunter Biden on a government 2013 government trip to China with his vice president father, both flying aboard Air Force Two.

The firm, according to the Wall Street Journal, “is controlled and funded primarily by large Chinese government-owned shareholders” and channeled at least $2.5 billion into automotive, energy, mining, and technology deals on behalf of these investors.

“BHR’s extensive connections to Chinese government intertwined its existence with the decision-making of Communist party leaders,” wrote investigators in the Senate report, highlighting the presence of a consortium that includes the China Development Bank tied to Ye, which controls 30 percent of BHR as an example. Once Ye fell from Chinese President Xi Jinping’s good graces, the Chinese bank pulled lines of credit from Ye’s CEFC.

The Senate’s report outlined a number of other projects Ye and Hunter Biden cooperatively worked on, including Biden’s assistance to help Ye execute a $40 million investment for a natural gas project in Louisiana that ultimately fell through.

James Biden is named in the report, along with his wife Sara Biden and Hunter Biden, as an authorized user for a line of credit opened by Gongwen. The family then went on a more than $100,000 shopping spree purchasing extravagant items that included airplane tickets and high-tech products from Apple.

House GOP Demands Answers From FBI Over Hunter Biden Allegations,"Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee are demanding the FBI provide answers on the actions it took, if any, upon reports from the Justice Department in 2015 that the owner of Hunter Biden’s Ukraine energy company paid a $7 million bribe to Ukrainian officials to shut down an investigation.

Based on findings from the Senate’s long-anticipated report chronicling the Biden family’s conflicts of interest released Wednesday, House Republicans are also requesting to know whether the FBI plans to investigate Hunter Biden’s series of potentially criminal transactions with foreign actors, including the alleged receipt of $3.5 million from the wife of a former Moscow mayor. Hunter Biden also raked in millions conducting overseas business deals with officials deeply connected with the Chinese Communist Party and allegedly sent thousands of dollars to Eastern European hookers who appear linked to a sex trafficking ring.

“The report by Chairman Johnson and Chairman Grassley shows that the FBI has been aware of some alleged misconduct for years,” wrote Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, where the Senate report out this week reveals officials within the agency were approached over Biden’s suspicious activity.

Jordan went on to reference concerns within the Obama State Department related to Hunter Biden’s lucrative board position with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he raked in upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry, while his father served as the administration’s “public face” of White House policy towards the Eastern European ally.

“The report detailed widespread concern within the Obama-Biden Administration about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian company founded by Mykola Zlochevsky,” Jordan wrote, highlighting Zlochevsky’s $7 million bribe reportedly paid to prosecutors seven months following Biden’s addition to the board. “The Chairmen noted that they had asked the FBI about its actions in response to these allegations, but have received no answer from you.”

Senate's Report On Biden Exposes Absurdity Of Trump's Impeachment,"It was this time last year that House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump after all prior efforts to overturn the results of the 2016 election failed.

The drawn-out head-hunt from the same party promising to impeach the president since before inauguration finally centered on a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. It was during this conversation that an anonymous whistleblower, eventually identified by Real Clear Investigations as Eric Ciaramella, an Obama White House holdover on the National Security Council, accused Trump of demanding his Ukrainian counterpart launch a series of investigations into the Biden family in exchange for nearly $400 million in military aid in a claimed quid pro quo.

Democrats and legacy media, desperate to resurrect charges of foreign corruption against the president several months after the collapse of the Russia hoax, immediately capitalized on the complaint. The hysterical news coverage provoked the White House to take the extraordinary step of releasing the transcript of the phone call in question, an unprecedented move potentially upending relations with Ukraine and risking the mistrust of world leaders about engaging in candid conversations with the president over fears that their discussions too could be revealed.

The grand revelation from its release? That the American president urged the leader of one of the world’s most notoriously corrupt countries to rid his government of corruption and to investigate Ukraine’s peddling of the Russian hoax that did irreparable harm to the United States. That’s the “high crime and misdemeanor” for which the president was impeached.

Democrats and their allies in the complicit media, however, concentrated outrage over the president’s mention of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company where former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, served on the board for upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry while his father served as the Obama administration’s “public face” for handling Ukraine. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s Burisma pay shows the former vice president’s son was being showered in excess compensation that dwarfed the earnings of other board executives in the same field.

True to form, CNN, The New York Times, and the Washington Post deceptively edited portions of the transcript to fit the Democrat narrative that the president requested a “favor” from the Ukrainian leader that featured launching a foreign investigation into Trump’s political opponents centered on Burisma, when a clear and honest reading of the transcript illustrated nothing of the sort. Here’s what the president said when using the word “favor” to request that the Ukrainian president uncover his government’s role in the Russia hoax:

I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… the server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you and your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you said yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.

Here’s what the president said 540 words later:

There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it. It sounds horrible to me.

In 2018, Joe Biden indeed bragged about his role in ousting the Ukrainian prosecutor with plans to investigate his son’s company by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans if the vice president’s demands were not met. Did Joe Biden, then, engage in a quid pro quo to save his son’s lucrative overseas sinecure?

Democrats, however, treated Republican scrutiny of Hunter Biden’s suspicious overseas business activity as a red herring intended to distract from the supposed seditious actions of the president. Democrats refused to even allow Hunter Biden to testify in the House or Senate.

“We don’t need to have witnesses that have nothing to do with this that are trying to distract Americans from the truth,” scoffed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Hunter Biden, California Rep. Adam Schiff said, was “irrelevant and immaterial.” Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen called Hunter Biden a “total sideshow.”

These comments were made even after the American public knew of Hunter Biden’s overpaid board position and his father’s pressure campaign to stop investigations into his son’s firm.

A new earthshattering report released by Senate investigators Wednesday, however, reveals the Biden family’s long series of conflicts of interest while serving at the upper echelons of government go far deeper than previously known.

The report, unveiled by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee with the Senate Treasury Committee and led by Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, shows Hunter Biden engaged in a wide array of potentially criminal transactions that also includes Joe Biden’s brother, James Biden, expanding the network of conflicting interests in the Biden family beyond Hunter that raised concerns of extortion.

According to Senate investigators, Hunter Biden helped invest millions of Chinese capital on American soil following a government trip with his vice president father to Beijing aboard Air Force Two in 2013. Hunter Biden’s Chinese business partners, the report says, held deep ties with the Chinese Communist Party.

In 2018, the same individuals linked to the Chinese Communist Party funded a more than $100,000 shopping spree for Hunter Biden, James Biden, and James’ wife, Sara, featuring extravagant purchases from airplane tickers to Apple products. The transactions, the committee wrote, were flagged for potential criminal activity.

In Ukraine, the Senate found that Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky, widely viewed as a corrupt, “odious oligarch,” is accused of paying a $7 million bribe to Ukrainian officials to shut down an investigation of the firm.

U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent told committee staff that the FBI was informed of Zlochevsky’s alleged bribe and then later learned of Hunter Biden’s lucrative position with Zlochevsky’s company. Kent described Zlochevsky as “a poster child for corrupt behavior.” Kent, the administration’s top official on Ukraine, told lawmakers that he raised his concerns over Hunter Biden’s overseas role with White House staff, who dismissed them.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent told House members during a private deposition during House impeachment proceedings in October. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation.”

In Russia, Hunter Biden was found by Senate investigators to have received a $3.5 million payment in 2014 from the wife of a former Moscow mayor who had been fired by then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev four years earlier based on charges of corruption. Hunter Biden is also accused by Senate investigators of making payments to Eastern European hookers who may be linked to a sex trafficking ring.

One can easily imagine the kind of press coverage there would have been this week had Donald Trump Jr. been caught displaying any of Hunter Biden’s growing series of alleged misconduct. Would Trump Jr. be called to testify before Congress? Would Democrats again resurrect their theories of collusion? Would they launch a second impeachment?

The entire Democrat rebuttal to Republican objections over impeachment was predicated on Hunter Biden’s innocence. They said the president had no reason to mention the former vice president’s son other than to score political points. Wednesday’s Senate report, however, detailing an expansive series of potentially criminal conduct that jeopardized U.S. interests, shows Democrats were the ones initiating a cover-up.

TIPP Shows Biden Ahead In Tightening PA Race,"A new poll from The Federalist/TIPP shows a tight presidential race in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, with Democratic nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump by 5 percentage points in the Keystone State. The poll of 774 likely voters in Pennsylvania, which was conducted from September 24 through September 26, found that 49 percent of respondents favored Biden compared to 44 percent for Trump.

The online-only poll of likely Pennsylvania voters found stark divides for the two candidates between men and women and urban and rural voters.

Rural voters overwhelmingly support Trump over Biden, 55 to 39 percent, while urban voters prefer Biden, 54 to 39 percent. The poll found that Biden has a double-digit lead among suburban voters, with 53 percent supporting Biden compared to 40 percent support for Trump.

A similar divide is evident between the sexes, with men overwhelmingly supporting Trump and women going for Biden in large numbers. The poll from The Federalist/TIPP found that Trump leads Biden among men, 55 to 38 percent, while Biden leads among women, 59-35.

In addition to asking voters for their personal preferences in the upcoming presidential election, the poll also asked respondents who they thought would win the election in November, as well as who they thought their neighbors were supporting. The poll from The Federalist/TIPP found that a plurality of voters believed Trump would win the election, with 42 percent predicting a Trump victory compared to 38 percent predicting a Biden victory in November. Twenty percent said they were unsure who would win. When asked who they thought their neighbors supported, 49 percent said Trump, while just 32 percent said they thought their neighbors would support Biden. Nineteen percent said they did not who their neighbors supported.

Undecided voters, while few in number, responded that if pushed, they leaned toward Trump by a margin of nearly 2-to-1, with 37 percent saying they preferred Trump compared to 18 percent who said they preferred Biden.

Respondents were also asked whether they were generally comfortable sharing their political preferences with others. One-third of independent voters said they felt uncomfortable sharing their political opinions, while nearly a quarter of Trump voters said they did not feel comfortable sharing their opinions. Even more striking was how many Trump voters said that they were reluctant to share their support of Trump’s policies in public. According to the poll, 55 percent of Trump voters agreed with the statement that while they personally agree with Donald Trump on a number of issues, they were reluctant to admit so in public. Among upper-class Trump supporters by income, that number soared to 76 percent.

The Federalist/TIPP Pennsyl… by The Federalist

According to the RealClearPolitics polling average in Pennsylvania, Biden’s lead over Trump has been cut nearly in half over the last two months. While Biden led Trump in that average by over 8 percentage points in late July, the most recent average shows a Biden lead of roughly 4 percentage points.

With its 20 electoral votes, Pennsylvania has become integral to the election strategies of both candidates. In 2016, Trump narrowly defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by approximately 45,000 votes. It was the first time a Republican had carried the state since George H. W. Bush’s 2-point victory in the state in 1988.

ABOUT THE POLL:

TechnoMetrica conducted the Federalist/TIPP Poll using an online survey from September 24 to September 26. A sample of 909 registered voters participated in the nationwide study, of which TechnoMetrica identified 774 as likely voters. TechnoMetrica acquired the study sample from its network of panel partners. Upon the study completion, TechnoMetrica weighted the study dataset by gender, age, race, education, geographical region, and party to mirror known benchmarks such as the U.S. Census and the state’s registration data. The credibility interval (CI) for the survey is +/- 3.6 percentage points for the likely voter sample, meaning the study is accurate to within ± 3.6 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, had all Americans been surveyed. Subgroups based on gender, age, ethnicity, and region have higher credibility intervals due to smaller sample sizes.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/27/new-poll-from-the-federalist-tipp-shows-biden-leads-tightening-race-in-pennsylvania/,2020-09-27
Biden Compares Trump To A Nazi Propagandist And Dictator Fidel Castro,"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden compared President Trump to a Nazi politician and propagandist on Saturday in an interview with MSNBC.

“[Trump] is sort of like [Joseph Goebbels]. You say the lie long enough, keep repeating, repeating, repeating, it becomes common knowledge,” Biden said.

UNHINGED: Joe Biden compares President Trump to Joseph Goebbels pic.twitter.com/GRYqN8UkTb — Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) September 26, 2020

Goebbels was the Reich’s minister of propaganda of Nazi Germany and worked closely under Adolf Hitler’s orders to carry out antisemitic policies.

“The era of extreme Jewish intellectualism is at an end,” Goebbels said in 1933. Goebbels is also a murderer who poisoned his six children and took his own life when the Nazi regime began falling apart.

While many on the left have called Trump and his supporters “Nazis,” it’s a preposterous comparison that insults the memory of the true Holocaust, in which 6 million were murdered, many incinerated in work camps.

The Republican Jewish Coalition also condemned Biden’s comments as “demeaning,” claiming that Biden has “been in politics long enough to know this.”

“The rule in debate is that if your only argument is to call your opponent a Nazi, you have no argument at all. Instead of engaging in a debate on policy, Joe Biden has descended to name-calling and Holocaust references,” the statement read. “There is no place in political discourse for Holocaust imagery or comparing candidates to Nazis. It’s offensive and it demeans the memory of the Holocaust, the suffering of the victims, and the lessons we must learn from that terribly dark chapter of history.”

Biden’s accusation came in response to Trump’s claims that Biden promotes and enables socialism. He also claimed that Trump is similar to the Marxist former leader of Cuba who is responsible for the deaths of many Cubans.

“I think people see very clearly the difference between me and Donald Trump,” Biden said. “Trump is clearing protests in front of the White House that are peaceful, you know, with the military. This guy is more Castro than Churchill.”

The Trump campaign rejected Biden’s comments, telling Fox News that Biden is “desperately trying to distract Americans from his disastrous record and socialist policies.” The statement also asked Biden to defend his decision to host antisemitic speakers at the Democratic National Convention.

“Rather than launching preposterous accusations against the president, Joe Biden and his team should answer for inviting notorious antisemites Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour to speak at the Democrat National Convention,” said Ken Farnaso, deputy national press secretary for the Trump campaign.

Sarsour and Mallory have a history of antisemitic comments and even resigned from their board member positions for the Women’s March in Sept. 2019 over such comments, but were still granted speaking spots during the programming of the 2020 DNC.

Just a day after his interview with MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle, Biden claimed that now is “a time to de-escalate,” urging senators to “take off the blinders for just one critical moment and stand up for the Constitution you swore to uphold” during the confirmation hearings for Trump’s SCOTUS nominee Amy Coney Barrett.

“This is a time to de-escalate,” said Joe Biden, 24 hours after he compared President Trump to Joseph Goebbels—a Nazi who aided the systematic murder of 6 million Jews https://t.co/FoidiZkIOj — Ben Williamson (@_WilliamsonBen) September 27, 2020

"Biden Denies Allegations Against His Son Hunter, Claims He 'Did Nothing Wrong'","Joe Biden insisted his son Hunter “did nothing wrong” in Ukraine when pressed by President Donald Trump on the debate stage Tuesday night.

“My son did nothing wrong at Burisma,” Biden said after Trump brought up Hunter’s board position at the Ukrainian energy company, where he raked in upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience in the industry.

Biden’s denial comes on the heels of a recent Senate committee report and data from the Treasury Department that confirmed Hunter’s conflicts of interest and “widespread concern within the Obama-Biden Administration about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Burisma Holdings.”

https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1311123354997452800

Trump then turned to another recent allegation against the former vice president’s son, asking Biden, “Why did he deserve $3.5 million from Moscow?” referring to another discovery in the Senate report. As Tristan Justice reported last week, “According to the joint report released by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee with the Senate Finance Committee, Rosemont Seneca, an investment firm co-founded by Hunter Biden, received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina in 2014 while his father, Joe Biden, was vice president.”

Later in the debate, Biden denied another previously reported fact about his son’s military service. “Hunter Biden was dishonorably discharged for cocaine use,” Trump said after Biden brought up his son’s service. “No, he wasn’t,” Biden responded.

In fact, it has been widely reported that Hunter failed a drug test for cocaine a month after beginning a commission in the Navy Reserve and was then discharged.

Biden said this was false but even the Washington Post admitted Hunter was discharged after a positive cocaine test back in 2014. pic.twitter.com/wUxNb4Oidl — Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 30, 2020",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/29/joe-biden-denies-allegations-against-his-son-hunter-claims-he-did-nothing-wrong/,2020-09-29
The Best Thing About Last Night’s Debate Were These Tweets,"Last night, Americans gathered ’round the warm glow of their television screens to watch the first of three presidential debates between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. It was hosted by the Cleveland Clinic, which is appropriate given the age of the two candidates. If you felt your own health would have been endangered by sitting through it, rest easy: I’ve collected the best tweets of the night to sum it up for you.

Who’s ready for the debate? pic.twitter.com/MFHfU1pzme — Kyle Sammin (@KyleSammin) September 30, 2020



(Yes, I put my own tweet in a best tweets article.)

The debate started past Biden’s bedtime (and many of ours)

hot debate take: 9pm is too late — Grace Segers (@Grace_Segers) September 29, 2020

Biden just called a lid. — Stephen L. Miller (@redsteeze) September 30, 2020

I hope Joe Biden has an earpiece tonight and some 15 year old kid hacks it and has him saying the lyrics to WAP. — Adam Hunter (@AdamComedian) September 29, 2020



Disorder in the Court

It actually started kind of pleasantly.

Did…Biden just say “how’re you doing, man?” — Karol Markowicz (@karol) September 30, 2020



Moderator Chris Wallace joined his fellow septuagenarians to ask the questions, beginning with the matter of the Supreme Court and Judge Amy Barrett’s nomination to it. Trump said he was correct in nominating Barrett and hoped she would be confirmed.

“Elections have consequences.” — Trump on right to fill SCOTUS seat — Brad Polumbo 🇺🇸⚽️ 🏳️🌈 (@brad_polumbo) September 30, 2020



Biden disagreed, saying that the people should vote first.

“She seems like a very fine person,” Biden says of ACB. One wonders where that sentiment was 33 years ago, during the nomination of Bob Bork.

— Josh Hammer (@josh_hammer) September 30, 2020

Biden doing the classic debate tactic of answering the question he wants rather than the one he got. — ryan teague beckwith (@ryanbeckwith) September 30, 2020



Asked about court-packing, Biden again refused to answer, saying that whatever he said would become a talking point. Well, yes, candidates’ positions on proposed laws have a way of doing that!

Biden straight-up refuses to answer the packing the court question. That is absolutely hilarious. #Debates2020 — Joe Cunningham (@JoePCunningham) September 30, 2020

Biden’s Supreme Court answer is as weak as the signal in his secret earpiece — Buck Sexton (@BuckSexton) September 30, 2020



Crossfire

Biden turned the Supreme Court question into one about Obamacare, but Trump interrupted him so often that the message became confused.

The Grumpy Old Men predictions were not wrong. — Robert VerBruggen (@RAVerBruggen) September 30, 2020

This has already devolved into a garbled mess and we are less than 10 minutes in. — Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) September 30, 2020



At first, Biden was cowed by it.

Biden’s response to Trump’s points will be to uncomfortably laugh- all night. — Allie Beth Stuckey (@conservmillen) September 30, 2020

Trump is doing the Biden-against-Paul-Ryan thing of yelling down everything he says. — Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) September 30, 2020



Eventually, he revised his 2012 VP debate and decided to interrupt constantly, too.

I like this new format of no moderating and two old men talking at once. — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) September 30, 2020

This is already off the rails. #Debates2020 — Carol Roth (@caroljsroth) September 30, 2020



In a shouting match, the President has no peer, but even some conservatives thought it was a bit much.

Trump needs to let Biden talk. — Ed Whelan (@EdWhelanEPPC) September 30, 2020

Trump is filibustering his own debate — Grant Addison (@jgrantaddison) September 30, 2020

man i can’t believe it has already devolved into closed captions “CROSS TALK” this soon into the debate. — tsar becket adams (@BecketAdams) September 30, 2020

Seen every Presidential debate since 1976 and never seen the anger and interruptions of the first 15 minutes. — David A. F. Sweet (@davidafsweet) September 30, 2020



Coronavirus and Vaccines

As the topic turned to the coronavirus, Biden tried to paint Trump as inept in leading the national response.

Smart of Biden to hit Trump for not being tough enough on China. Of course, Biden’s “plan” on COVID is no more real than Trump’s health care plan. — Jeremy Senderowicz (@jsende) September 30, 2020



While Trump noted that Biden criticized everything he did do.

Biden is wrong, the Trump administration did press the Chinese government to allow U.S. CDC representatives into Wuhan. Beijing refused. — Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) September 30, 2020

Is Biden really complaining about a shutdown? The guy who said he’d shut down again if the “science” says so? #Debates2020 — Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 30, 2020



Wallace questioned Biden on the doubts his running mate, Kamala Harris, had cast on the vaccine. Biden said he trusted the scientists but also thought they wouldn’t be allowed to tell the truth. Just asking questions!

so, biden thinks trump personally is making the vaccine? — tsar becket adams (@BecketAdams) September 30, 2020

Oh no, Joe. Don’t go full anti-vaxx. Never go full anti-vaxx. — Justin Lee (@justindeanlee) September 30, 2020



The constant interrupting continued.

“Hectoring” is a great word we don’t use much anymore. — Martin Kaste (@MartinKaste) September 30, 2020



Trump said he liked masks just fine, kinda.

Wallace: about masks. Trump: I wear it when needed. Then makes fun of Biden’s mask. — Pradheep J. Shanker (@Neoavatara) September 30, 2020



Biden said his rallies were small because of the virus. Trump suggested otherwise.

WALLACE: ” Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events…” TRUMP: “Because nobody would show up” pic.twitter.com/fDSrktRoKW

— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) September 30, 2020



Biden tried to blame Trump for shutting down the economy, having just a few minutes ago blamed him for not acting quickly enough.

Biden saying Trump is the one who demanded shutdowns, which is some serious revisionist history. — Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) September 30, 2020



Trump talked about the mental cost of the lockdowns—a serious point in what was becoming an unserious night.

Yes! Trump mentioning how the economic shut down is hurting people’s mental health. Let’s talk about it. #2020debates — Julie Borowski (@JulieBorowski) September 30, 2020



But by now, the viewers at home were starting to feel their own mental health degrading.

Somewhere, a man just woke up from a coma, turned on the TV, saw this, and decided to go back into a coma. — ryan teague beckwith (@ryanbeckwith) September 30, 2020

Just settle this with arm-wrestling and we can all go to bed. — Kyle Smith (@rkylesmith) September 30, 2020



The Taxman

The subject of taxes came up, both Trump’s and everyone else’s.

TRUMP: “I don’t want to pay tax.” — Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) September 30, 2020

we can see the tax returns at the end of infrastructure week please be patient — Adam Steinbaugh (@adamsteinbaugh) September 30, 2020



Biden started speaking Arabic?

Biden just said “Inshallah” @SirajAHashmi’s moment has arrived — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) September 30, 2020

Joe Biden: “inshallah” habibis, it’s happening…

— Siraj Hashmi (@SirajAHashmi) September 30, 2020



That’s going to get worked into a few conspiracy theories.

Meanwhile, Biden tried to say that Trump was not tough on China, which led Trump to bring up the Chinese investments of Biden’s ne’er-do’well son, Hunter.

Trump to Biden: “China ate your lunch Joe, and maybe its because your son took billions of dollars in loans from them” — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) September 30, 2020



On Russia, the refrain was the same.

Trump brings up Hunter Biden getting 3.5M from a Moscow oligarch and also profiting off of China. Asks what Hunter did to earn this. This is based on official Treasury documents. Biden claims that it’s not true and says “My son did nothing wrong” at Burisma. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 30, 2020



Intersectional Something Or Other

Wallace moved on to the race question.

oh good it’s the race question — Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) September 30, 2020

If you came across two men talking to each other like this in a park, how insane would you be to decide that you should introduce the topic of race? — ryan teague beckwith (@ryanbeckwith) September 30, 2020



It devolved quickly into a law-and-order question.

Unsolicited opinion from a black man: everything that’s wrong with race in America is three white men starting a conversation “about race” and having it immediately degenerate into an argument about “law and order.” — Elliot Williams (@elliotcwilliams) September 30, 2020



Biden hit some buzzwords.

Biden: my campaign is about equity and equality and equivalence and equanimity and equestrians and Equal sugar substitute — Razor (@hale_razor) September 30, 2020



And dredged up an old slander.

That’s very fine people line by Biden is just a flat out lie. And he says it’s why he got in the race. Chris Wallace knows that. C’mon man… — Dave Rubin (@RubinReport) September 30, 2020

Biden just repeated the totally debunked lie that Trump said there were “fine people on both sides” in the Charlottesville protest. — John Daniel Davidson (@johnddavidson) September 30, 2020



While Trump said he was tough on crime. But also let people out of jail?

Trump. “I’m letting people out of jail!” Also: “Joe Biden will let everyone out of jail!”

And law and order.

— Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) September 30, 2020



Biden just went straight for the name-calling

Biden, on Trump, after a discussion of critical race theory: “He’s the racist.” — Johnny Verhovek (@JTHVerhovek) September 30, 2020



Asked about ANTIFA, Biden slithered away from the question

“Antifa is an idea not an organization” by Biden is atrocious. — Karol Markowicz (@karol) September 30, 2020



Trump was likewise less than forceful against the Proud Boys.

Wallace asks Trump to condemn white supremacist groups, Proud Boys. Trump volunteers to condemn, but refuses to concede premise that they’re a major source of the street violence. Biden insists that Antifa doesn’t exist, it’s just an idea. — Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) September 30, 2020



In fact, the disorder in the streets seemed to have been replicated on the stage.

Shouldn’t the National Guard be called out to quell this? — Jack Shafer (@jackshafer) September 30, 2020



Taking Away Our Cows

We moved on then to the candidates yelling about the environment, an issue that two percent of people find to be the most important in their lives.

WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING SBOUT CLIMATE CHANGE NOBODY CARES — Hans Fiene (@HansFiene) September 30, 2020



The discussion was somewhat calmer now, either because the issue was less important to the candidates or because they were getting tired. Trump said the Green New Deal would bankrupt us. Biden said he wasn’t for it, but also spent a lot of time defending it.

“The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward” — Patrick Ruffini (@PatrickRuffini) September 30, 2020

Why Doesn’t Anyone Ask Biden Why He’s Dodging Obamacare Taxes?,"Chris Wallace ignored Donald Trump’s answer about paying “millions” in taxes during Tuesday night’s debate, repeatedly demanding that the president answer a question he’d already answered. Meanwhile, the person who really should answer for his tax returns is Joe Biden.

A few hours before the first presidential debate of the 2020 general election campaign, and amid a full-blown media kerfuffle over Trump’s taxes, the Democratic nominee released his 2019 tax returns. The timing of the release seemed far from coincidental: ahead of the debate, so Biden could say he made his returns public, but without giving reporters and moderator Chris Wallace time to absorb the returns prior to the debate. It seems Biden was hoping the details of his returns would become old news immediately after Tuesday evening.

Reporters should dig into Biden’s tax returns, however, in the same way they have shown a seemingly unquenchable curiosity regarding Trump’s, for one reason: Biden claims to support Obamacare — but has consistently avoided paying Obamacare taxes.

You read that right. I noted last year that Biden’s 2017 and 2018 returns showed a tax avoidance strategy that allowed him to circumvent over half a million dollars in Medicare and Obamacare taxes. According to their own returns, Biden and his wife Jill did the same thing in 2019.

The Strategy, Explained

Since the vice president left government service in early 2017, the Bidens funneled their income from book royalties and speaking fees through two corporations: CelticCapri Corporation and Giacoppa Corporation. They paid themselves modest salaries through the corporations, on which they paid full Social Security and Medicare taxes.

The Bidens took most of this book and speech income — over $13.5 million — not as wages, however, but as profits from the two corporations. Taking that income as corporate profits allowed them to avoid payroll taxes on the $13.5 million.

Because Social Security taxes only applied to the first $132,900 of income in 2019, the Bidens didn’t avoid paying the taxes that fund that program. But the 2.9 percent Medicare tax applies to all income, and the 0.9 percent “high-income” tax created in Section 9015 of Obamacare applies to all wage income over $200,000 for an individual or $250,000 for a family.

Taking their income as corporate profits allowed the Bidens to avoid paying this combined 3.8 percent payroll tax on the more than $13.5 million in income they received from 2017 through 2019. This chart lays out the details:

The tax avoidance strategy saved them less in 2019 than in prior years. On the other hand, Biden earned much less last year, likely due to curtailing paid speaking appearances once he began his presidential campaign.

To most ordinary Americans, however, the Bidens still circumvented a staggering amount of taxes: $513,540 in total over the three years. Whereas the Bidens avoided $391,912 in Medicare taxes from 2017 through 2019, the Urban Institute found that a couple with average earnings, retiring this year, would pay a combined $161,000 in Medicare taxes their entire working lives.

Biden’s Hypocrisy — and Democrats’ Silence

Even as he released another set of tax returns showing his continued willingness to circumvent Obamacare taxes, the Biden campaign continues to run ads in which Biden claims Obamacare “is personal to me.” Democrats want to run on the law this fall, believing that fears over the Obamacare lawsuit pending at the Supreme Court will motivate their voters. But how personal can Obamacare be to Biden if he went out of his way to avoid Obamacare taxes?

Likewise, the Democrats attempting to subpoena Trump’s tax returns should answer a simple question: If they want those returns for nonpartisan oversight purposes, why haven’t they called for an Internal Revenue Service audit of Biden’s taxes? Particularly in 2017, Biden paid himself a paltry salary compared to the $10 million in corporate profits he received, an arrangement that might violate IRS compensation guidelines.

The deafening silence from the liberal media notwithstanding, the real questions about Biden’s taxes won’t go away, nor should they. The American people have a right to know from “Middle-Class Joe” himself why he put his own financial self-interest over a law he supposedly cares so much about.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/30/why-doesnt-anyone-ask-joe-biden-why-hes-dodging-obamacare-taxes/,2020-09-30
"Sorry, Joe Biden, You’re Not The Democratic Party, Just Its Facade","In an exchange about health care during Tuesday night’s presidential debate, former Vice President Joe Biden declared, “I am the Democratic Party!” He was responding to President Trump’s claim that Democrats want “socialist medicine,” a Trumpian but mostly accurate characterization of where most Democrats are on health care. Biden vehemently denied it, saying he’s not for getting rid of private health insurance.

But beyond the question of health care, Biden’s claim of ownership over the Democratic Party stood out Tuesday night if only because the rest of his performance demonstrated the extent to which it’s not true. In fact, Biden is so afraid of his own party — and so bullied by its dominant left wing — he can’t truthfully answer basic questions about where he stands on major policy issues, not even when asked point-blank on a national stage.

That’s why he refused to answer a simple question about whether he supports packing the Supreme Court and ending the Senate filibuster — a question he has been dodging lately. Instead, Biden awkwardly pivoted to a canned talking point about the importance of voting. When pressed by Trump to answer, Biden shot back bluntly, “I’m not going to answer the question… Will you shut up?”

""I'm not going to answer the question… Will you shut up?"" Biden said when asked about court packing pic.twitter.com/i4RHShQAIP — The Federalist (@FDRLST) September 30, 2020

As Biden and everyone else knows, the left wing of the Democratic Party is eager to kill the filibuster and pack the court if their party wins control of the White House and the Senate. Some, like House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler, have openly endorsed a court-packing scheme. Other leading Democrats, like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have not ruled out packing the court, saying that “nothing is off the table.”

That’s the line Biden’s own running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, took as early as last March when she was running against Biden for the nomination. Harris has since adopted Biden’s rule of refusing to answer the question, resorting to the same dodge about the importance of voting when CNN’s Jake Tapper asked her about court-packing immediately following Tuesday’s debate.

Why won’t they answer? Because they know that while the left wing of their party, led by the likes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, very much wants to pack the court, they also know that most Americans are against it. One recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found less than a third of Americans support adding more justices, while 54 percent oppose the idea. Among independents, 6 out of 10 are against court-packing, while Democrats are split on the issue.

Biden has in the past made his opposition to court-packing clear. As recently as last July, he warned that Democrats would “live to rue that day” if they packed the court. That Biden won’t even speak to the issue now, as his party’s presidential nominee, is telling. What it tells is that Biden is trying to please left-wing Democrats who are actually in control of the party.

On Most Major Issues, Biden Parrots Left-Wing Lines

One other issues, like expressing support for law and order and condemning Antifa, Biden was reluctant to say anything that would anger left-wing Democrats — to the point that, when pressed to condemn Antifa, he replied, absurdly, that “Antifa’s an idea, not an organization,” and argued the real problem with civic unrest comes from white supremacist militias.

On law and order, Biden uttered left-wing shibboleths about systemic racism in law enforcement, saying, “There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced,” showing deference to organizations like Black Lives Matter. That he later contradicted himself, saying most police officers are “good, decent, honorable men and women” and the problem is that “there are some bad apples,” came as an afterthought, an echo of what Biden used to think but has set aside for BLM pieties.

On the Green New Deal, Biden insisted he doesn’t support it and it’s not his plan even though his own campaign website cites the Green New Deal as a “crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.” Indeed, Biden’s climate plan was hammered out in consultation with Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign and amounts to a watered-down version of the Green New Deal.

And so it went throughout the debate. But Tuesday’s debate was just the latest example of Biden’s long march to the left. He can claim all he wants that he “is” the Democratic Party, but his constantly leftward-shifting positions, on everything from abortion to criminal justice, suggest that the Democratic Party’s most ardent leftists are leading Biden, not the other way around.

What Did Joe Biden Know About His Family's Financial Ties To China?,"Given the grave threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), especially near an election and in an era in which fears of foreign influence are at an all-time high, one might think revelations about the family of Democratic nominee Joe Biden cashing in on Communist China while he was vice president might be a “big [expletive] deal,” in the cellar-dwelling candidate’s words.

Yet the media and political class have completely blacked out these newly released facts. This was on display during the first presidential debate when Biden and moderator Chris Wallace called a “lid” on it.

Biden Family Secrets Exposed

The joint Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Finance Committee report on Hunter Biden’s business dealings with foreign powers, and their relation to U.S. government policy during the Obama-Biden administration, states the following:

Hunter Biden has extensive connections to Chinese businesses and Chinese foreign nationals that are linked to the Communist government. Those contacts bore financial fruit when his father was vice president and after he left office.

These ties went beyond the former vice president’s son. The report adds: “The records acquired by the Committees show consistent, significant and extensive financial connections among and between Hunter Biden, James Biden, Sara Biden … and Chinese nationals connected to the Communist regime and PLA as well as other foreign nationals with questionable backgrounds.”

The joint investigation details a stunning array of transactions that “paint a mosaic of the complex corporate structure that existed between entities linked to Hunter Biden, his associates, and his family and Chinese companies linked to the Communist government.” Many of the transactions were flagged for “potential financial criminal activity.” Such activity enriched Hunter Biden to the tune of millions of dollars.

As vice president of the United States, Joe Biden had an absolute obligation to know what his family members were up to, disclose it, and end it. This is not just because of the potential for corruption, but the myriad ways his family’s acts could imperil American national security. Indeed, as the report concludes, the dealings between the Biden family and China don’t merely “raise conflicts of interest concerns, they raise criminal financial, counterintelligence and extortion concerns.”

A Free Pass from Democrats and the Media

The unseemly reality of Hunter Biden enriching himself through positions for which he appears to lack any qualification other than his family name is the least of the issues here. Far more significant is that the loved ones of a high-ranking politician had deep financial interests with foreign adversaries, presenting a nightmare scenario in terms of the potential for exploitation.

If Joe Biden were seeking a security clearance, most everything in the Senate committee report and more would have to be reported. Presumably, these disclosures would imperil his odds of receiving one.

Since he is a candidate, it is up to the American people to do this vetting. This is why it was particularly troublesome that during the first presidential debate, he got a free pass on these issues. Twice, Hunter Biden’s connections with adversarial powers came up. The first time, the former vice president ignored President Donald Trump’s assertion about the unique investment opportunities Hunter exploited, seemingly based on his father’s dealings with Beijing.

The second time, the exchange went like this:

Trump: Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow, and various other places.

Biden: That is not true.

Trump: He made a fortune, and he didn’t have a job. … Why was he given tens of millions of dollars?

Biden: He wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk] It was all discredited.

Wallace: We’ve already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, as the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here.

Trump: I know, but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow.

Biden: That is not true. That report is totally discredited.

Trump: Why did he get it?

Biden: Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayers’ money. That report was written for political reasons.

Wallace: I’d like to talk about climate change.

Biden: So would I.

Does anything better depict the gap between Washington and real America than this back-and-forth?

Biden’s Record with China

Joe Biden cannot be allowed to shrug this off with a “C’mon man,” as he has in the past with respect to his son’s Ukrainian dalliances and their relation to the Obama-Biden administration’s Ukraine policy, the troubling centerpiece of the joint Senate committee report.

He has to be straight with the American people about what he knew about his family’s China business, when he knew it, what he did about it, and how it might have affected his duties and responsibilities. This is all especially important since Biden was the man in charge of the Obama administration’s China portfolio. If Biden truly was in the dark regarding these links, that is disturbing. If he knowingly concealed them, all the more so.

Over the course of his time in Washington, Biden has helped guide American foreign policy at the highest levels, first as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and then as vice president. What accentuates the disturbing nature of these revelations about his family is the fact that throughout his career, Biden cheered China’s rise.

Joe Biden supported granting China permanent normal trade relations and the communist country’s accession to the World Trade Organization. Over and over, he served as an avatar of the political establishment’s integrationist and accommodationist approach to China, helping turn it into a global superpower. All along, he claimed this was good for America, even saying it wouldn’t threaten the livelihoods of American workers.

Biden helped make Communist China strong — again, while his family directly profited from it when he was in office — cultivating a relationship with Xi Jinping. The Obama-Biden administration was remarkably soft on China over its most grievous provocations, whether in terms of the catastrophic Office of Personnel Management hack, the militarization of the South China Sea, or its flouting of U.S. capital market regulations with impunity, gaining the imprimatur of the administration after lobbying Biden to ink a memorandum of understanding effectively normalizing its cheating.

Where Are the Russia Collusion-Mongers?

Meanwhile, even today, with Biden forced to toughen his rhetoric about China for the first time in his life — largely thanks to an opponent in Trump, who has engaged in an unprecedented effort to comprehensively confront the Chinese Communist Party — Biden still can only manage to call China a “serious competitor.” He dubs Russia, by contrast, an “opponent.” This is laughable given how much bigger, stronger, richer, and more dangerous is the former.

This raises another question: Where are the Russiagate collusion-mongers on Biden and China? Leave aside that the joint Senate report asserts that Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire from the wife of Moscow’s former mayor, who had allegedly received illegal construction contracts from her husband. Also ignore for a moment that Hunter allegedly sent thousands of dollars to Ukrainian and Russian citizens involved in the sex industry, some transactions of which might have been associated with an “Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.” Why are the collusion-mongers silent about China?

By their silence and inaction, the collusion-mongers tell us they never actually cared about foreign influence, or at very best only cared about it as a political weapon. It was never about the merits. It was always about power. Part of that power concerned maintaining the China status quo from which the political establishment had so richly profited, and which the Trump administration has since upended.

We now know the extent to which the Biden family was a beneficiary of that China status quo. So once again, we must ask: What did Joe Biden know, and when did he know it?

Joe Biden Laughs Off Socialist Label To Hispanics In Florida,"“Do I look like a socialist?” quipped former Vice President Joe Biden during an NBC town hall in Florida Monday. In a word, yes.

Biden’s platform promises to rack up $10 trillion in new programs as the federal government faces its highest debt and deficits in world history, illustrating the Democratic presidential candidate’s leftward lurch since capturing his party’s nomination this spring.

“Look, I’m the guy that ran against a socialist,” Biden continued, complaining that throughout the 20-plus candidate primary, Democrats complained that Biden was too moderate, even though Biden was never by any means moderate.

It’s true Biden defeated self-proclaiming socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic nomination. It is also true that since Biden’s electoral victory, Sanders dominated the nominee’s post-primary platform to resurrect the Vermont senator’s socialist agenda with Biden as its Trojan horse.

In July, Biden signed onto the 110-page “Unity Task Force Recommendations” in an agreement hammered out by teams of the two former rivals. Sanders clearly emerged having secured a socialist nominee for the Democratic Party after all by guaranteeing Biden will support fully taxpayer-funded college tuition, tripling the Clinton tax hikes, and threatening officers for securing the nation’s borders. Even NPR labeled the document “A Blueprint For A Progressive Presidency.”

“The compromise they came up with, if implemented, will make Biden the most progressive president since FDR,” Sanders celebrated on MSNBC shortly after its release.

This of course all came before California Sen. Kamala Harris was placed on the ticket. She possesses a Senate voting record even the left of Sanders. Harris has endorsed Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, higher taxes, open borders, sanctuary cities, taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants, late-term abortion, and a religious litmus test for Catholic nominations to the federal judiciary.

Biden’s words Monday night came in response to a question from a Florida voter worried that the Democratic nominee’s radical platform might alienate Cuban voters in the critical southern battleground. According to a new poll out from Florida International University (FIU) Friday, Trump holds a 34 percent lead with Cuban voters, who are more likely to have personally experienced the lies of socialist leaders.

An NBC/Marist poll last month shows Trump winning Florida Hispanics over Biden 50 to 46 percent. Clinton decisively carried this core group over voters in 2016 and still lost the state by less than 1 percent.

The results of Friday’s FIU survey shows Cuban-Americans trending towards the Republican Party as Democrats leap left at breakneck speed.

The poll confirms a trend we found in Equis polling: Cubans who've arrived since the mid-90s have swung heavily toward GOP. I mean, look at this chart on party ID…yeesh. pic.twitter.com/oEtisySi3w — Carlos Odio (@carlosodio) October 2, 2020

The Democrats’ 21st-century radicalism is presenting a long-term problem for the party in a must-win state on the road to the White House. The party’s enthusiastic embrace of socialist reforms deploying the same rhetoric to promote them is alienating the state’s Hispanic voters, who heard the same promises before under the broken regimes they fled.

Biden currently leads in Florida by a narrow 2 point margin in the latest aggregate of polls gathered by RealClearPolitics. Clinton however, held a wider lead in the state four years ago at the same point in the race.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/06/joe-biden-laughs-off-socialist-label-to-hispanics-in-florida-while-omitting-10-trillion-platform/,2020-10-06
Media Is Avoiding Hunter Biden's Corruption Scandals That Implicate Joe,"Last week, a Senate Intelligence Committee report detailed how the son of a major presidential candidate, who has an extensive history of shady foreign business dealings, received a $3.5-million wire transfer from the wife of a Russian politician. The New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, and most major media outlets didn’t cover the wire-transfer story at all. Four years ago, not reporting such a story was a possibility too absurd to even contemplate — but then again, no one would have predicted the candidate with the shady Russia ties is not Donald Trump, but Joe Biden.

People often talk about how Trump is responsible for destroying political norms, and that’s a valid concern. One of the truly frightening things about the Trump era, however, is how institutions have exploited a perceived crisis in truth-telling to justify abandoning their own standards by blaming it on Trump. Increasingly, we see major stories break where the media establishment decides on a collective omertà because the story undermines its own credibility or might sway voters in directions it doesn’t approve of. When that happens, no news is good news.

The problem with hiding the truth is that you can’t suppress it forever, let alone a week, in this news environment. After the initial blackout, we are finally starting to see some coverage of Hunter Biden’s suspect wire transfer — but only after Trump himself raised the issue in the recent presidential debate and forced the media’s hand. The little coverage the issue has received is instructive, and not in a good way.

The Hunter Biden Report Wasn’t ‘Totally Discredited’

When Trump raised the issue at the debate, Joe Biden responded by saying the claim was “totally discredited. Totally discredited.” Given that it’s a direct allegation in a government document and Biden is flatly denying it, you’d think this would be a perfect opportunity for the media to dig in and sort out the truth of the claim. Instead, they have essentially punted on the issue.

According to PolitiFact, which refused to rate the claim either true or false, the facts are in dispute because “Biden’s lawyer says he did not co-found the partnership [that received the money] and had no stake in it,” and “Democrats say they reviewed the Republicans’ documentation but did not find a specific link to Hunter Biden.”

Serious journalists would see this for the artful dodge that it is. Essentially, no one disputes Treasury documents showing $3.5 million was wired to the Rosemont Seneca Thornton firm from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow for a vague “consultancy agreement.” Hunter Biden’s lawyer is suddenly disputing his client’s involvement in Rosemont Seneca Thornton without providing any tangible evidence to back up the denial. Senate Democrats have a partisan interest in separating Hunter Biden from the source of the tainted cash, and their denial is obviously parsed.

So why does the Senate intel committee report that Biden was a “co-founder” of the firm in question? Well, one clue might be that committee members read it in the media. A lengthy New Yorker profile of Hunter Biden from last year, which clearly had extensive cooperation from the Biden team, reported the following: “In June, 2009, five months after Joe Biden became Vice-President, Hunter co-founded a second company, Rosemont Seneca Partners, with Christopher Heinz, Senator John Kerry’s stepson.” That was 15 months ago. For the Biden camp to be disputing this key fact now seems awfully convenient. Further, in that same magazine article, Hunter Biden admits to taking an $80,000 bribe from a Communist Chinese Party-connected tycoon, in the form of a 2.8-carat diamond delivered to his hotel room.

If the Biden camp is denying Hunter’s role in the firm in question, the media should note the denial, while investigating the truth of the claim. In the meantime, the press is probably obligated to note his history of taking money from foreign sources, a pattern which tends to undercut the denials. And then there’s still the issue of what his father said at the debate.

The Media Has Proved Not to Be Credible

For Joe Biden to tell the American people this accusation is “totally discredited,” when the media hadn’t even touched the story, well, honest fact-checkers would tell it like it is: Joe Biden stood up in front of tens of millions of Americans last Tuesday and told a self-serving lie — a lie that would have been called a four-alarm trouser conflagration if Trump had said it.

Naturally, there are consequences for the decision not to report major news such as the Hunter Biden story until you are forced to. The most obvious one is that media credibility takes a huge hit. The media have adopted a fairly jejune attitude toward their own institutional decline, blaming it on an increase in partisanship and polarization, but they’re quick to mix up cause and effect. They never seem to ask how much their skewed coverage is fueling that same polarization.

Exhibit A here would be the media’s QAnon fascination — the right-wing, largely pro-Trump online cult centered on a bunch of deranged conspiracies about a pedophile ring running the country. There’s a case to be made that the blizzard of media coverage has vastly overstated the influence of QAnon, but it’s caused enough real-world problems that the media are understandably baying for relevant Republicans and conservative activists to make it clear this lunacy is “totally discredited,” in the literal meaning, as opposed to the Joe Biden meaning, of the phrase.

The rise of QAnon, however, is also partially a result of a media environment where supposedly authoritative sources of information aren’t credible. If you can’t trust, say, the New York Times to do straightforward reporting on Hunter Biden’s obvious corruption, you’re going to be a lot more inclined to stumble across fringe sources of information while searching for facts online.

Unfortunately, the Hunter Biden story is practically the new normal in terms of how it illustrates media willingness to suppress or ignore inconvenient truths. The credulous groupthink coverage of Trump-Russia collusion, as well as the unwillingness to pursue Jeffrey Epstein — an actual pedophile cabal involving very powerful people — also goes a long way toward making QAnon’s nutjobbery seem more credible than it should be.

The Media Is Fueling America’s Information Crisis

None of this is to say the mainstream press is responsible for anything QAnon does or says, but the media can still do something about America’s information crisis. If citizens lacked valid reasons to suspect the truth is being hidden, they wouldn’t go looking for it on parts of the information superhighway where it’s a good idea not to roll down the window.

Edicts need to come down from major media outlets about reporting the news when it happens, not when political circumstances necessitate or dictate how a story is covered. One way of preventing such obvious imbalances in coverage is to pursue ideological diversity in newsrooms along with actual diversity — if no one in your newsroom attends church weekly, owns a gun, or regularly votes Republican, you don’t have reporters who are going to raise objections about imbalanced coverage, much less understand half the country.

Right now, any understanding of half the country begins and ends with the fact that they loathe and distrust the media. Perhaps not all of that anger at the media is justified, but it’s righteous enough, especially after last week. For once, the media were handed a Russian influence-peddling scandal on a silver platter, and the vast majority of major outlets declined to even mention it. Such bad behavior makes the calculus for determining who’s a bigger threat pretty clear for a lot of Trump supporters. Even if the president does and says things that make them uncomfortable, he’ll be gone in four months or four years. A media that hides the truth this brazenly is going to be much harder to get rid of.

Best Tweets Of The 2020 Vice Presidential Debate,"A week is a long time in politics.

After some more foreign policy talk, the debate turned to the courts. Pence attempted to get a straight answer out of Harris on the $64,000 Question: would the Biden administration pack the courts? As Biden did last week, she attempted to slither out of it.

FLASHBACK: Joe Biden Implied Thomas Sowell Was Racist For Opposing Affirmative Action,"Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden implied that Dr. Thomas Sowell, Senior Fellow at The Hoover Institution at Stanford University, a black man, was racist for opposing the principles motivating affirmative action legislation.

The exchange occurred during the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Nominee Robert Bork in 1987. Sowell attended the hearings to testify on behalf of Judge Bork and was given 10 minutes to make a case for his character. It was during this hearing that Democrats, including then Sen. Biden, slandered Bork and failed to confirm him in a 42–58 vote.

Biden pushed Sowell on his public opposition to affirmative action, implying that Sowell, a black man, is racist for his opinion on the policy.

“I gather from your comments about MIT and Harvard that you don’t think there’s enough blacks out there who are qualified to fill the number of vacancies, allotted for them in those schools, is that right? My point is, you believe there’s not enough black women and men out there that are the same as white women and men go through Harvard and MIT? You’re saying factually there are not enough?” Biden asked.

Sowell previously explained that affirmative action sets up many black Americans for failure due to race-based quotas.

“They are systematically mismatched with universities and the admissions process,” Sowell said. “That is if Harvard feels that it must have X percent of blacks. And the pool is such that they can’t get X percent of blacks at the same level as the rest of the Harvard students, they’re going to take those blacks who would have succeeded in some state university and bring them to Harvard where many of them will fail.”

Biden continued questioning Sowell by asking if Bork is opposed to desegregating schools.

Sowell quickly responded that they both agree in desegregation, but believe that the underlying principles motivating that decision were based on racism. Sowell explained:

The problem is not whether you believe that school segregation is to have ended. I believe it should have ended long before Judge Bork believes it should have ended long before.



What he and what I have objected to are the principles used in that decision because those principles take on a life of their own, and they come back to haunt you in other areas. Obviously, this old phrase ‘the hard cases make bad law’ derive from that fact. You dream up a principle, to reach this result and then the principle has a life of its own.



This is what bothers me people are talking about how judges should be sensitive to this particular group or that particular group. And if that means anything, if it means he’s applying the law differently. That’s precisely how blacks were held down for generations in the South.

Biden then continued his attempts to trap Sowell with his own words.

“So literacy tests, as long as they were equally applied, are all right?” Biden asked.

“Sure,” Sowell said.

“That’s what I thought you thought,” Biden replied.

When Sowell further explained that Bork believed in desegregation but that it wasn’t truly an example of equal protection, Biden interrupted him.

“I’m just trying to figure out what you’re saying,” Biden said.

Sowell also expressed that judicial activism has played a large role in reinforcing systematic racism.

“It is easy to forget that all groups, stand to lose as Americans, when the law is undermined as judicial activism surrounds all laws, with a large and growing number of uncertainty,” Sowell said

“I don’t think that judicial activism has been beneficial to minorities,” he stated.

Biden has a long history of racist comments and legislation.

In August 2019, he told members of the Asian and Latino Coalition in Des Moines, Iowa that “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.” He also apologized for referring to then Sen. Barack Obama as the “first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.”

During his time as a senator, Biden opposed busing policies that would allow children from black neighborhoods to attend white schools.

“Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point. We have got to make some move on this,” Biden said in 1977.

Harris reprimanded Biden over the issue at the Democratic debate in June of 2019.

“I also believe — and it’s personal and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing,” Harris said. “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me. So I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats.”

More recently, Biden claimed in an interview with Charlamagne tha God that “you ain’t black” if you vote for Trump.

“Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,” he said.

The VP Debate Showed The Biden-Harris Ticket Has No Policies,"It is no secret that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want the 2020 presidential election to be a referendum on President Donald Trump, not a choice between Republican and Democratic policies.

One reason for this is that for an incumbent, Trump is a uniquely polarizing figure that rubs many voters, even some who like the job he has done, the wrong way. But a second, arguably more important reason emerged Wednesday night. On issue after issue, Harris made perfectly clear that her ticket simply doesn’t have a whole lot of policies they stand for beyond “anyone but Trump.”

There were myriad examples of Harris refusing to say, even in broad terms, what Democrats would do if they take back power over the federal government. On the potential of packing the Supreme Court should Amy Coney Barrett become our next Justice, Harris again refused to give a straight answer, instead launching into a bizarre take on Abraham Lincoln and the election of 1864, all with a weird grin meant to assure us she was answering the question she wasn’t.

Similarly, on fracking Harris acted like she and Biden have had matching We Love Fracking tattoos for the past 20 years when in fact both have emphatically called for it and the jobs attendant to it to go the way of the typewriter very recently. More broadly on energy policy both moderator Susan Page and Mike Pence pointed out that the Democratic plan is basically a folder that has Green New Deal crossed out in crayon and the words Biden Plan etched above it.

On the Coronavirus response, Harris was specifically asked what she and Biden would do differently going forward from the Trump administration and she basically had nothing. Not only that, but her description of what they would have done already sounded so similar to the Trump response that Pence credibly, though jokingly accused of her plagiarism, adding that is something that Joe Biden knows a lot about.

This happened over and over throughout the night. One tell was that while Pence frequently went over his allotted two minutes to answer tough policy questions in detail, Harris rarely did. This was not Harris being polite and sticking to the rules, it was her getting through her milquetoast non-answer answers as soon as she could with as little detail as humanly possible.

The reason why Democrats don’t want to talk about policy is that there is no consensus in the party regarding any of the issues raised above. After the fracking exchange, far-left darling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, in response to Harris’s pro-fracking answer, “Fracking is bad, actually.” This leaves voters in a bind because they have no idea if Biden and Harris’s newfound regard for fracking is genuine or just a put up job. They clearly haven’t brought the base of their party along on the issue.

Vice Presidential debates do not typically move the needle on presidential elections and this one is likely no departure from the rule, but there was a lot for Donald Trump and his campaign to glean from Pence’s solid performance. The biggest of these is to simply let them talk. It was widely noted after the first presidential debate that Trump consistently bailed out Biden by interrupting what were often very poor answers and provided Uncle Joe with an escape hatch. That must not be repeated.

Next week in the second debate, Trump must much more carefully pick and choose his spots to snipe at Biden, he cannot forgo his natural pugilistic style entirely, but he also has to let Biden punch himself out a bit. The American people, especially those with children, are perfectly capable of seeing when someone is ducking an important question. Harris did little else all night. Trump must force Biden into the same box next week.

The Republicans need this to be more of a choice election and less of a referendum on the president. This is true because however much, if any blame one wishes to ascribe to Trump for the ravages of the Coronavirus crisis, it happened under his watch, so the “choice” is who can get us out of it and back to the prosperity we had before it.

Biden and Harris have made very few compelling arguments about what they would actually do in the White House. Are they a Trojan horse for the far left as many conservatives argue? Maybe. Are they actually moderates who are willing to throw the nuttier ideas of the progressive base of the party under the bus? Maybe. We just don’t know because they just won’t say.

In the 26 days left in the election, the Trump campaign and the media need to force Biden to answer these questions. By November 3, they must force the real Joe Biden to stand up. On Wednesday night, Mike Pence got that job started.

How Joe Biden Could Endanger Your Employer-Provided Health Coverage,"Joe Biden has often said that his health-care plan wouldn’t disturb individuals who currently have coverage.

During the first presidential debate, he denied President Trump’s assertion that his plan would ban private insurance or take away coverage options. When rolling out his health-care plan last year, Biden went so far as to reiterate Barack Obama’s infamous “Lie of the Year;” the former vice president claimed that “If you like your employer-based plan, you can keep it.”

Except many Americans may not get to do that. Repeating something over and over again doesn’t make it so. As I outline in a recently released report, Biden’s policy proposals could do much to destabilize the current system of employer-based health coverage — putting us further down the path to a government-run single-payer system.

Key Features of the Biden Plan

The issue arises from two linked elements of Biden’s health-care platform. First, Biden would increase subsidies for coverage on the Obamacare exchanges. He hasn’t released all the specifics, but he wants to lower the share of income individuals must pay out-of-pocket in premiums, and provide additional cost-sharing assistance to handle things like deductibles and co-payments.

Second, Biden would allow individuals who currently have employer coverage to qualify for exchange subsidies. Obamacare created a so-called firewall between employer and exchange plans, such that individuals with an offer of “affordable” coverage from their employer cannot qualify for exchange subsidies.

Democrats originally included the firewall in Obamacare because they wanted to keep individuals with employer coverage in their employer plan, to lower the spending on Obamacare subsidies. Biden now has no such compunctions about increasing subsidy spending, so wants to repeal the firewall entirely.

People Likely to Switch

The richer subsidies, coupled with the repeal of the firewall, would mean that many individuals with employer coverage will switch to exchange plans. My report uses data on the average employer plan premiums and deductibles in 2018 and compared those to a subsidy regime proposed by the Urban Institute and cited in Biden’s plan.

As the below chart shows, I find that virtually all households with incomes of under 200 percent of the federal poverty level will save at least $100 per month in total premium and deductible costs. A sizable number of households with incomes between 200-300 percent of the poverty level will save money as well.

Assuming that most (90 percent) of households who can save at least $100 per month switch, and that half of households who can save some amount less than $100 per month do so as well, I find that approximately 24 million individuals would switch from employer coverage to the exchanges.

Serious Consequences

Of course, the left would consider this finding a feature and not a bug. If households of modest means can save thousands of dollars by switching coverage, why not give them the chance to do so? But as Newton’s third law of motion suggests, this action would have significant opposing reactions on the health-care system. Here are some of the major such repercussions.

Higher Spending: The change would put a lot more people on the exchanges, raising subsidy spending substantially. Applying Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates of average exchange subsidy costs to the 24 million people likely to switch coverage suggests that total spending would rise by $2.2 trillion over the next ten years (2020-2029).

By comparison, CBO estimates that under current law, exchange spending will total approximately $612 billion in the coming decade — a fraction of the potential new spending under Biden’s plan. Also worth noting: The $2.2 trillion in new spending would not reduce the number of uninsured one bit — it merely represents a cost shift from the private sector to the federal government.

Taxes on Businesses: If workers have the opportunity to move to exchange coverage, employers could face employer mandate taxes for workers who switch. Obamacare imposes a penalty, set to rise to approximately $4,060 per worker in 2021, for employees of large businesses who receive exchange subsidies.

Right now, employees of firms that offer “affordable” coverage can’t qualify for exchange subsidies. But if Democrats remove this firewall, workers who switch would trigger Obamacare mandate taxes for their employers.

Biden hasn’t said whether he supports modifying the employer mandate so that workers who voluntarily switch to the exchanges would not trigger taxes for their employers. But if this tax remains, it would hit businesses to the tune of approximately $481 billion in the coming decade.

As the below graph shows, that amount wouldn’t begin to pay for all the $2.2 trillion in new subsidy spending — but it would drag on businesses as they try to grow and recover from coronavirus lockdowns.

Employers Dropping Coverage: Finally, the departure of approximately 15 percent of all those with employer coverage would weaken the employer-based health insurance system. I estimate that, of the individuals switching coverage, approximately 64 percent would be under the age of 35.

Younger individuals have lower incomes earlier in their working careers, and thus are more likely to benefit from the subsidies available to households of modest means in the exchanges. Of course, younger, and often healthier, workers departing from employer coverage would leave businesses to cover an older — and often sicker — pool of workers. Facing this scenario, some employers could well decide to drop coverage altogether.

Democrats: Nothing to See Here, Just the End of Insurance

The Biden plan provides a framework for unraveling the current system of employer-based health coverage, in ways that may not take much longer than the legislation by Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., that outlaws private insurance. Even if it doesn’t abolish private coverage outright, Biden’s plan will have greater and more far-reaching effects than the candidate suggests in his public comments and rhetoric.

Nearly two years ago, Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., infamously suggested with regard to private health insurance: “Let’s eliminate all of that. Let’s move on.” His rhetoric notwithstanding, Biden’s health-care plan could lead to that very outcome.

17 Questions Joe Biden Needs To Answer Before The Election,"Most viewers of the first 2020 presidential debate were disgusted with the shouting and the bellicose tone of the match, and because most of the shouting and disrupting came from President Trump, he took a big hit in the morning-after polls and in polling since.

In any remaining debates, the president needs a different approach, one that highlights his long list of achievements and contrasts them with Joe Biden’s skimpy set. If the debates do not occur, as seems possible given the attempt to change their format, any media organization worthy of the designation owes it to the American public to ask these questions of Biden.

The most consequential incident in election debate history was not the proclamation of a compelling policy position, but the asking of a simple question: “Are you better off today than you were four years ago?” Instead of being combative, Trump ought to follow Ronald Reagan’s example and ask questions, many of which an honest media would already have made Biden answer.

What questions? In addition to pinning Biden down on his positions, the president should insist that Biden stipulate whether he would overturn specific gains of Trump’s presidency. The president can emphasize his numerous achievements by asking whether Biden would dismantle them.

Last month, CNN anchor, Jake Tapper, asked the former vice president if Trump’s United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) is better than the North American Free Trade Agreement it replaced (NAFTA). Biden dodged the question, but after repeated prodding from Tapper, he acknowledged USMCA is better, and in so doing, conceded Trump had achieved something great for America.

When responding to a debate question, the president should ask the former vice president if he would overturn a specific achievement of Trump’s presidency, and like Tapper, he should keep asking until Biden answers.

The more Biden equivocates or evades, the more apparent it will be to viewers that Trump’s gains are praiseworthy. Asking Biden if he would overturn Trump’s accomplishments also serves to educate voters on his achievements. The more evident it becomes that his administration has been successful, the more likely voters will be to give the president another term.

Here are some examples of questions Biden needs to answer from either the media or Trump in a debate.

On COVID-19

Do you still feel it was xenophobic of Trump to ban travel from China early in the pandemic?

On March 22, Dr. Anthony Fauci called the Trump administration’s coordinated response to the pandemic “impressive,” and that he couldn’t imagine anyone “could be doing more.” Do you think Fauci was deceiving the American people when he said that?

Do you oppose the Trump administration’s “Warp Speed” efforts to fast-track therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19?

The Trump administration tasked the private sector to produce personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, testing devices, therapeutics, and vaccines at a record pace. It will deliver a vaccine in the coming days, and leave the nation’s stockpile of PPE and other critical supplies fully replenished. Besides calling for a longer shutdown and a nationwide mandate for wearing masks, what would you have done differently?

On Immigration

Will you terminate the agreement Trump brokered with Mexico that resulted in Mexico patrolling its borders?

Will you end the construction of the border wall on the southern border? Will you tear down the segments of the wall already built?

On Domestic Issues

Do you intend to forfeit our energy independence while we wait for affordable, renewable energy sources to emerge?

Will you try to rescind the First Step Act that revamped the criminal justice system you put in place that disproportionally harmed African Americans?

Will you try to rescind the VA Choice bill that expands health care options for veterans?

Will you rescind Trump’s executive orders compelling drug companies to reduce prices?

Will you try to repeal “Opportunity Zones”?

On International Relations

The ISIS caliphate has been destroyed, peace negotiations are underway in Afghanistan, and most of our troops have come home. In regard to foreign wars, will you concede we are better off today than we were when you and Obama left office?

Will you recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and keep our embassy there?

Do you support the peace accords the Trump administration brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Bahrain, and Kosovo and Serbia?

Is USMCA better than NAFTA?

Do you favor allowing NATO members to elude paying their share of alliance expenses?

The Trump administration has disrupted China’s ambition to dominate the world. What did you and President Obama do to curb China’s aggression and hold them accountable for unfair trade practices?

These are just some of the many valuable queries that could be put to Biden on Trump’s most undisputed successes. As Biden would be hard-pressed to oppose any of them, that poses a dilemma. If he concedes the gains are worth keeping, it helps validate Trump’s presidency. If he says they should be overturned, he risks mocking common sense and offending mainstream voters.

The most compelling case for electing Trump to a second term is the strong record of accomplishment in his first term. Forcing Biden to assert which achievements he would overturn should be the go-to strategy not just in any remaining debates but in all the interviews, speeches, and rallies the president will have before Election Day. Instead of focusing solely on Trump’s demeanor, the conversation would evolve to include his record of accomplishments versus Biden’s ever-shifting positions and thread-bare resume.

Republican candidates could also benefit from employing this tactic, asking their opponents whether they favor upending specific Trump administration gains. This could be just the election-shifting change Trump needs.

Biden In-Law Advising Campaign While He Could Profit Off Covid Policies,"The growing web of conflicts of interest surrounding the Biden family stretches far beyond the potentially criminal overseas business activity conducted by the former vice president’s son and brother.

According to a new report from Politico published Tuesday, ethics experts are raising eyebrows at Biden son-in-law’s health care start ups capitalizing on the coronavirus pandemic while Joe Biden remains within a three-week striking distance of capturing the White House.

Howard Krein, the paper reported, who married Biden’s daughter, Ashley, in 2012, is advising the Democratic nominee’s presidential campaign while simultaneously investing in health care start-ups that could be on the other end of receiving billions in government pandemic spending.

In April, Krein’s investment firm, StartUP Health, announced it would be sending $1 million to 10 startups working on the coronavirus pandemic after Krein was reported by Bloomberg and the New York Times to be participating in daily calls with the Democratic candidate advising him on public health.

“StartUp Health is putting the full support of its platform and network behind building a post-Covid world that uses technology and entrepreneurial ingenuity to improve health outcomes,” the company wrote in an April statement.

StartUp Health was launched in 2011, a year after Krein began dating Biden’s daughter. The firm, which has invested in more than 300 health care businesses and enjoyed a close relationship with the Obama White House, even prominently employs the same “Moonshot” terminology to describe its goals as employed by the former vice president in starting the Cancer Moonshot initiative.

Avik Roy, who founded his own investment firm named Roy Healthcare Research, said Krein’s close access to the potential president on its own is likely to court big-money interest.

“I have little doubt that the relationship to Joe Biden, particularly if he becomes president, would attract the interest of some investors,” Roy told Politico, adding that the relationship could also land Krein’s firm stakes in competitive startups.

“People who are plugged in have an advantage, and that is a common feature of a lot of heavily regulated industries,” Roy told the paper.

Politico reported that existing ethics concerns are amplified by StartUp Health’s foreign investments from Swiss and Chinese firms.

A spokesperson for the Biden campaign simply pointed Politico to an earlier statement playing down Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings when contacted by the magazine questioning Krein’s conflicts of interest.

“I have never discussed, with my son or my brother or with anyone else, anything having to do with their businesses. Period,” Biden said in South Carolina. “And what I will do is the same thing we did in our administration.”

However, consequent revelations unearthed earlier this year illustrated that Biden’s office knew more than what was reported last year about Hunter Biden’s overseas business activity that set off red flags within the State Department and the Justice Department.

According to a Senate report chronicling the Biden family’s conflicts of interest while Joe Biden served as vice president, the owner of Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board raking in excess compensation, allegedly paid a $7 million bribe to Ukrainian officials to shut down a government investigation.

Upon learning of the illegal payment, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent told Senate investigators that the Ukraine embassy’s DOJ official relayed the information to the FBI. Congressional lawmakers, who have since requested information from the federal law enforcement agency, were stonewalled from any information on a FBI possible probe. The FBI maintained that it was against agency protocol to either confirm or deny the existence of any such investigation despite freely commenting on the deep-state coordinated Russia Hoax against President Donald Trump.

Kent had also raised his concerns over Hunter Biden’s lucrative role in Ukraine with Biden’s White House office but was dismissed by the vice president’s staff.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent told House members during a private deposition in October during the impeachment proceedings last year. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time … That was the end of that conversation.”

The long-anticipated Senate report last month also expanded the Biden family’s conflicts of interest to Joe Biden’s brother, James. According to the report, Chinese businessmen engaged with the Biden family’s overseas ventures provided Hunter, James, and James’ wife Sara Biden with a line of credit where the family went on a more than $100,000 shopping spree to purchase extravagant items from airplane tickets to Apple products.

Senate investigators have flagged the transaction as potential financial criminal activity.

Trump Should Let Biden Lose The Election All By Himself,"On Oct. 8, the Commission on Presidential Debates issued a statement that the second presidential debate scheduled for Oct. 15 must take place online with both candidates participating from “separate remote locations.”

The Trump campaign promptly issued a thanks-but-no-thanks response with typical flair and directness: “For the swamp creatures at the Presidential Debate Commission to now rush to Joe Biden’s defense by unilaterally canceling an in-person debate is pathetic.” It concludes, saying that Trump will instead hold a rally that night, reminiscent of the time in April 2019 the president skipped another swamp creature event: the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.

This is a second and obvious attempt by the commission to change the format in favor of Biden, after it pitched a fit following the first and highly combative debate on Sept. 29, where “moderator” Chris Wallace made a spectacle of himself and failed to neutralize Trump. Analysis of the president’s performance has run the gamut and, unsurprisingly, most members of the corporate media have been negative.

Here is my own quick take and advice for the president: Let Biden be Biden.

Unable to watch the debate live, I saw initial reactions on social media and thought, “Oh, lawd. Was it really that bad?” So I read the transcript first to ease my way into the melee, and it was classic Trump: aggressive, funny, quick-thinking, probing, “truthfully” hyperbolic, and repetitive. It was far less stressful than the televised version, but it was still smashmouth politics.

That’s not the dominant strain in our cultural DNA but necessary for these times, so it makes sense — and I think also a very good sign — there were mixed reactions by the general public. Trump also missed some glaring opportunities to let Biden hang himself rhetorically and to refute outright lies, for example, when Biden repeated the “fine people” hoax (teed up generously by Wallace) and when both Wallace and Biden maddeningly characterized critical race theory as “racial sensitivity training.”

That Biden completed whole sentences was a vast improvement and no doubt the result of calling a lid (meaning no campaign events) for at least four of the seven days leading up to the debate, not including the numerous lids called previously and noted copiously by others.

But Biden struggled predictably with numbers and facts; played the juvenile opposite game; gave the super creeps with the double entendre, “I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well”; called Trump a clown and racist; and evoked a bizarre visual of “Children of the Corn” meets “Mississippi Burning.”

Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, ‘There were very fine people on both sides.’ No president’s ever said anything like that.

Putting aside for the moment Biden’s concerning mental condition, his anemic campaign schedule has been rather baffling particularly given his slogan, “BATTLE for the SOUL of the NATION.” If he really thinks our country’s soul is at stake, then shouldn’t he be showing signs of life, all the time, and everywhere? Trump was more active with COVID in the hospital than Biden was during that same time and then some.

In 2016, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski made famous the directive to his staff to “let Trump be Trump” — let the man just be himself and ultimately that authenticity will win the day. He was right, but the simplicity of the phrase belies the variations within the man. Trump is not paradoxical; he’s wild. He couldn’t have taken a wrecking ball to (every) real estate negotiation and emerge an international success.

This is Trump’s election to lose, as all the momentum is with him. I don’t care too much what the polls say. Hundreds if not thousands of people show up wherever Trump is and even where he isn’t. “Trumptillas” have become a real thing—vast numbers of boats adorned with Trump signs and American flags sailing in Florida, New York, Michigan, and elsewhere to show support for his reelection.

A ginormous TRUMP sign much like the iconic HOLLYWOOD sign recently appeared on a hillside in Southern California before the land owner’s property rights were violated with its removal by authorities. Loyal supporters showed up outside, and the size of the crowd kept growing, while the president was being treated for the coronavirus at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Anecdotal, yes, but fitting nonetheless in 2020, especially when most in the media so completely fail to do their job and Democratic voter oversampling in polling is the order of the day.

Trump’s just getting started on key initiatives such as the 1776 Commission and declassifying Russia-hoax documents. We can see new FBI and CIA directors, a renewal of patriotic education, and other desperately needed corrections just beyond the horizon of Nov. 4.

Whether there is another presidential debate before Election Day or not, when Biden is Biden — uninterrupted, unprotected, on and off prompter — it reveals so much. Contradictory, confused, and weak, a Biden presidency would embolden efforts to weaken our country from within, halting in its tracks the America First ethos Trump has been trying to instill.

Play to all your strengths, Mr. President.

"Biden Muddles Through Gentle, Hunter-Free Town Hall","Joe Biden came into Thursday night’s town hall, which was originally supposed to be a debate, stung by new allegations of influence-peddling involving his son Hunter. The question on everyone’s mind going in was whether he would be allowed to answer any question harder than chocolate or tapioca? With social media strangling the Hunter story from the New York Post, the nation’s oldest continuous daily newspaper, and Twitter going dark after criticism, it was up to old media, ABC News, to act responsibly and ask the question.

Joe appeared with Greek heartthrob George Stephanopoulos. They started off with a question from a Democrat who was dismayed by Trump’s response to COVID-19. What would Biden have done differently? Now listen, carefully. He wanted more access to China; so did Trump. After that? Biden wrote a USA op-ed. But he can point to nothing he would have done substantively differently from Trump’s response. Nothing. This is important. According to Democrats, Trump killed 200,000 people, but they can’t say what they would have done differently.

Biden’s big plan going forward seems to be a mix of big signs about masks in stores, ventilation systems, and bearing the example of wearing a mask. On vaccines, Biden referred to the body of scientists, whatever that means, and said that if they said it was OK, he would take it. But he reminded us that Trump lies and we should be careful.

Joe Biden insisted that as president he would spend a lot of time telling governors, mayors, and maybe even city councilmen, “Wear a mask!” “Mandate masks!” He then suggested that kids are in danger. Joe was waving his mask around the whole time, but he wasn’t providing a lot of evidence.

Lucky Joe just happened to have some kind of card in his pocket when he was asked by a Trump supporter about eliminating middle-class tax cuts Trump provided. Joe kept referring to the card — not without difficulty — but didn’t really answer the question. And heartthrob George, instead of pressing Biden on taking away middle-class tax cuts, asked if it’s really fair to tax the rich. He didn’t just put the ball on the tee, he grabbed Biden by the hips and said, “swing.”

A young, progressive, black voter asked if Biden would change the racist systems in America. Biden talked about funding, funding for education. He did not address the fact that some of our best-funded schools are some of our worst, especially in vulnerable communities. It was a saccharine repetition of generations of failure.

Biden insisted in regard to his support of the 1994 crime bill that he does not think drug addicts should go to jail. He thinks they should go into mandatory rehab — presumably in Ukraine on business travel. There were promises of talking to black and brown people. Biden also said police should “shoot them in the leg,” instead of shooting to kill in self-defense. He is very cavalier about the lives of law enforcement officers.

Biden was very gently asked if the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett as a Supreme Court justice would open the door to establishing “guardrails” to protect the judicial system. Yeah, that was the question on whether he would pack the Supreme Court. No question, no answer — exactly what ABC News intended. Biden defended his position by referring to arguments between scholars. When pressed, Biden said he wants a slow debate process in the Senate or else he will consider packing the court.

Shockingly, we got a question from a disaffected Republican who doesn’t like Trump. Thank God ABC News found one of these 57 people or so who exist in the world. The question was how will Biden be more civil? It was a trash bag of nonsense that had no place in a serious town hall. It was the breadcrumbs in a very disappointing meatball.

What didn’t come up was Hunter Biden. What didn’t come up was credible claims from the New York Post, the oldest daily newspaper in America, showing that the former vice president met with a Ukrainian businessman connected to his son. The biggest story in America right now was just ignored. That tells us pretty much everything.

This was really sad. It was sad in the way that old baseball players used to suit up and do old-timers games. This was an old-timer game. Biden put on his uniform and took batting practice, and he didn’t take it all that well. Biden was a back-up in the Obama administration, and making him the starter isn’t looking like a great bet.

The New Yorker’s Hunter Biden Whitewash Looks Awful In Retrospect,"It is almost as if the New Yorker prepared for this moment.

In early July of 2019, just more than two months after former Vice President Joe Biden kicked off his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, the magazine published a more than 10,000 word piece attempting to whitewash misconduct by the candidate’s troubled son, Hunter.

The article chronicled Hunter Biden’s upbringing, a senator’s son as a sympathetic figure who has struggled with heartbreak and addiction while, unlike many children of prominent politicians, still had to work part-time jobs in college to make ends meet. Most striking about the New Yorker essay however, was its explicit attempts to get ahead of a news cycle prophesied by the eventual Democratic nominee’s son himself.

Here is the fourth paragraph of the feature-length profile:

Donald J. Trump and some of his allies, in their eagerness to undermine Biden’s candidacy, and possibly to deflect attention from their own ethical lapses, have gone to extreme lengths, promoting, without evidence, the dubious narrative that Biden used the office of the Vice President to advance and protect his son’s interests.

Later, the piece continued to forecast what the next few months would look like, which would also ultimately feature Democrats going nuclear – all the way to a six-month impeachment trial while the coronavirus brewed overseas – to deter any real investigation of Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings. Democrats would even charge a Senate investigation launched in 2017 by Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa as Russian interference, a favorite and increasingly familiar line of attack based on nothing more than a political motivation to merely link “Russia” with “Republican” in the same sentence. After all, a considerable population remains absolutely convinced that the president sits in the Oval Office operating as a Russian agent as a consequence of a four-year media campaign to legitimize the Democratic conspiracy.

“Through weeks of conversations, [Hunter] became increasingly open about his setbacks, aware that many of the stories that he told me would otherwise emerge, likely in a distorted form, in Breitbart or on ‘Hannity,'” the New Yorker piece read.

He wanted to protect his father from a trickle of disclosures, and to share a personal narrative that he sees no reason to hide. ‘Look, everybody faced pain,’ he said. ‘Everybody has trauma. There’s addiction in every family. I was in that darkness. I was in that tunnel – it’s a never-ending tunnel. You don’t get rid of it. You figure out how to deal with it.

Of course new revelations taking focus on Hunter Biden’s personal impropriety would indeed come out. Just several months later, Lunden Alexis Roberts, an Arkansas woman mentioned in the piece suing Hunter Biden for child support would win her case against the son of the Democratic presidential frontrunner. Roberts was a stripper at a D.C. strip club that Hunter Biden reportedly frequented. And last month, Hunter Biden was accused by Senate investigators of making payments to eastern European hookers who may have been victims of sex trafficking. And on Wednesday, the New York Post published that among the incriminating materials found on a Delaware computer include “a raunchy 12-minute video” appearing to show Hunter “smoking crack while engaged in a sex act with an unidentified woman,” in addition to “other sexually explicit images.”

Casting Hunter Biden as a sympathetic survivor of addiction to get out in front of the subsequent stories on his personal life that would emerge, did emerge, and continue to emerge, would constitute only half the article’s preemptive protection.

A recurring theme throughout the profile was Hunter Biden’s apparent commitment to consistently recuse himself from his own priorities in order to protect his father from holding appearances of conflicts of interest. Hunter Biden refrained from early lobbying gigs that involved his father serving in the Senate. He resigned from his unpaid role at Amtrak when his father ran ran for vice president in 2008. He would tell clients that he could no longer represent them upon election.

The article even addressed Hunter Biden’s foreign trip to China in 2013, where he flew aboard Air Force Two with his vice president father while building a private equity firm.

Hunter Biden used the platform offered in the New Yorker to dismiss criticism of the trip showing a conflict of interest as merely mingling with close associates. Senate investigators would later point out that Hunter Biden’s Chinese business partners held strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party who lawmakers accused Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden’s brother James of engaging in criminal financial activity with.

“How do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them for a cup of coffee?” Hunter Biden said at the time.

On Thursday, the New York Post broke another blockbuster story showing that Hunter Biden stood to rake in $10 million a year for “introductions alone,” from Ye Jianming, the founder of CEFC China Energy Co. Ltd (CEFC). Ye, the Senate report showed last month, formerly held positions with the People’s Liberation Army.

The New Yorker also addressed Hunter Biden’s role on the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, playing down the apparent conflict of interest presented with Joe Biden playing a “central role” in dictating U.S. policy towards Ukraine.

“Jen Psaki, a State Department spokesperson, said that the State Department was not concerned about perceived conflicts of interest, because Hunter was a ‘private citizen,'” the paper wrote, including additional testimony from administration officials that Hunter Biden’s position was of little concern. “Hunter told Burisma’s management and other board members that he would not be involved in any matters that were connected to the U.S. government or to his father.”

For the next 15 months, Joe Biden would repeatedly deny that he spoke about business with his son as more revelations surrounding the questionable arrangement would surface over the course of the campaign.

“I have never discussed, with my son or my brother or with anyone else, anything having to do with their businesses. Period,” Biden said in August last year.

On Wednesday however, the bombshell story from the New York Post would show that was not true. According to emails obtained by the paper, Hunter Biden had in fact introduced a top advisor for Burisma to Joe Biden. While the Biden campaign initially denied any such meeting took place, Politico later reported Wednesday night that the campaign “would not rule out the possibility that the former VP had some kind of interaction,” with his son’s Ukrainian business associate.

Further, several top State Department officials were very concerned about Hunter Biden’s board position in Ukraine.

U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, the State Department’s top official on Ukraine testified during House impeachment proceedings that he had called the vice president’s office upon learning of Hunter Biden’s lucrative gig but was dismissed by White House staff.

“The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation,” Kent said.

5 Things Trump Should Say Once He Gets Back On The Debate Stage,"President Trump has one more debate, scheduled for Oct. 22. He needs to learn how to talk in short sentences. Even Vice President Mike Pence should have had more coaching. He wasted a lot of time, saying things like, “Errrrr [shake head like Reagan], thank you, Susan [pause].” Four seconds wasted — about 13 words, e.g.: “Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, are in the pockets of the Chinese financial interests.”

Herewith are five responses to likely questions — not “answers,” but responses — because it’s what the president should say whatever the question may be. They’re about 300 words each, which a practiced speaker can easily deliver in two minutes.

They cover some of the topics voters are said to be most interested in. Two are about the Chinese Flu, because that is, unfortunately, the number one issue of the day. It is, obviously, not the most important issue, but it’s the issue the left-wing media are harping on because they think it’s their best chance of unseating Trump.

The president is trailing badly in the polls. He needs to up his game. Here’s how.

1. On COVID

I want to talk to you about the Chinese Flu. First, I call it the Chinese Flu because it came from China. Joe Biden doesn’t like to blame the Chinese because his son, Hunter, has extensive financial dealings with China, which he developed when he flew to China on Air Force Two while Joe was vice president.

Second, the media are fixated on the number of reported cases. But why? Why are we so concerned about how many people get sick? The news media don’t normally publish the number of flu cases every year. In the 2017–18 flu season, an estimated 80,000 Americans died of the flu.

But did you read or hear a single news story about that number? Probably not. People get sick all the time, but we don’t panic. And we shouldn’t panic now either.

Democrats want you to panic, because then they can take control of your life: they can shut your business, your school, even your church or synagogue. And they have.

But remember: what matters is not how many people get sick. What matters is how many people die from the Chinese Flu, and who they are.

For people age 65 and under, the survival rate is about 99.94 percent—that is, roughly speaking, everyone. So we should stop panicking and stop counting every flu case. When you count cases every day, people worry every day—even when there’s no need to worry.

Old people should worry. They should be very careful. This disease is dangerous for them. But it’s not very dangerous for the rest of us.

We need to stop counting cases, stop being afraid, and stop listening to fear-mongers in the media. We need to go back to work and back to school. And back to the business of being Americans.

2. On Race and Crime

I want to talk about race and crime. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are basically anti-American. “Anti-American” is not just a debating term: it means Biden and Harris fundamentally don’t like the American people. Biden said recently, “[Racism is] not just in law enforcement, it’s across the board. It’s in housing, it’s in education, and it’s in everything we do.”

Biden is not complaining about a few nasty people, or even about some sicko Nazi-type white supremacists. He is saying most Americans are awful people. He said the problem is much broader than “systemic racism in law enforcement.” Biden said, “It’s in everything we do.” He’s talking about you.

Harris said recently that “the reality is that the life of a black person in America has never been treated as fully human.” Really? That’s rubbish, and you know it’s rubbish—and it’s rich, coming from a woman who has no objection to late-term abortions (which are disproportionately black babies).

These racist comments come from a man who served with the first elected (and reelected!) black U.S. president; and from a black woman, who has climbed the ladder of success and become a U.S. senator. What a country!

But Biden and Harris don’t like this country. They don’t like America. They don’t like Americans. And they don’t like you. They think you are deplorable, just as Hillary Clinton thought you were deplorable.

And they don’t care at all about black Americans who are killed regularly on the streets of Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore, and the other big cities run by Democrats for decades. Hundred of black people have been killed this year alone in those cities. Have you heard Biden say, even once, that those black lives mattered? No, he’s too busy calling you a racist.

Joe Biden doesn’t like you, and his policies will reflect that dislike.

3. On Health Care

Health care is important to all Americans, and we know from experience that we can’t trust what Joe Biden says about health care. When he was vice president, he and his boss told us that if we liked our health-care program, we could keep it. Remember that? Well, it was a lie, a deliberate lie, and one of their people, one of the architects of their program, admitted they lied. You can look it up.

Under Biden’s new plan, the government will run all health care. Your private plan will vanish. We will have socialized medicine. As you may know, people from places like England and Canada come to America for health care. Why? Because they are afraid they will die waiting for treatment in their own country’s socialized medical systems. And they know they will get better care here.

I have said repeatedly that my administration will protect people with preexisting conditions, but Biden continues to lie about that — because he doesn’t want you to notice that his program is socialized medicine.

My administration has expanded the use of Health Reimbursement Arrangements. With HRAs, employers can subsidize workers’ individual-market premiums and out-of-pocket costs instead of providing a health plan directly. That’s important because it gives workers the freedom to choose the coverage they want, and to keep that coverage when they change jobs. That puts the American people in control of their health care instead of the government.

My administration has also made short-term limited-duration insurance plans a practical option. Short-term plans fill gaps in coverage when, for example, people switch jobs. And because they’re not subject to the premium-inflating rules of Obamacare, they tend to be much more affordable. Joe Biden doesn’t like HRAs — because they’re not a government program.

4. Revisiting the Chinese Flu

I want to make a few more comments about the Chinese Flu.

First: It’s front-page news now, but in only a few months, it will be behind us, and we’ll move on to other, more important issues like what kind of an economy we want; how we’re going to handle China; how we keep peace in the streets. Make sure you understand the difference between Joe Biden and me on those important issues. He, his running mate, and his entire party are essentially big-government, left-wing democrat socialists, who have been condoning violence in our streets. I am a traditional American who believes in free enterprise and law and order.

Second: Biden talks about “following the science” on the Chinese Flu. But Joe obviously doesn’t understand science. Science doesn’t wear a white coat or talk into a microphone. Only scientists do those things. And scientists differ. Joe Biden thinks there’s only one correct way to handle the Chinese Flu — his way. That’s nonsense.

Third: Biden claims my administration did not handle the Chinese Flu correctly. No doubt we made mistakes — this was a novel situation. But one thing we did do right, and right in the beginning, is we stopped people coming into this country from China. But when we did that, Joe Biden called it “xenophobic.” He would have allowed sick Chinese to continue to pour into the United States and infect Americans.

Fourth, and this is most important: we need to be brave and stop being afraid of the Chinese Flu. We need to show some true American grit. We will survive this. We should all go back to work and back to school. Old people should be very careful. But the rest of us need to go back to Making America Great Again.

5. On the Stakes in This Election

This is the most important presidential election we’ve had in decades. As you know, Joe Biden has refused to say if he will pack the Supreme Court. He says if he answers it — c’mon, man — that will be all people talk about. He’s right. And I’ll tell you why.

Biden and the Democrat Party plan to turn this country into a single-party state. They will do that by eliminating the Senate filibuster, packing the Supreme Court, and voting the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico into the Union. That will increase the number of Democrat electors in the Electoral College, and Republicans will not win a presidential election for—who knows?—the next 50 years.

We will then have a single-party state — like Venezuela, Cuba, and Russia.

A packed Supreme Court will have the votes to take away both your First and Second Amendment rights. One of the first things the thugs in single-party Venezuela did when they took power was to confiscate the people’s guns. It will happen here too, with the approval of a packed Supreme Court.

That is why, whether you are a Republican, a Democrat, or an Independent, you should vote Republican this time. Because if you don’t, it may not make any difference how you vote next time.

Of course, there are other issues in this election — there always are. What should the minimum wage be? What kind of health insurance should we have? What should our policy be toward China? People disagree on those topics — and they always will.

Some people may not like me — but remember: even if I win, I’ll be gone in four years. But if Biden wins, his party, the radical Kamala Harris social democrats, will be in power for the rest of your life.

So, vote Republican this time, so you’ll have a choice next time.

Thank you for listening. Good night. And may God bless America.

Biden Campaign Goes Dark Until Thursday Without Answering Questions On Hunter Biden Story,"With only 15 days until Election Day, Democratic Nominee Joe Biden’s Campaign called off campaigning and answering press questions until after Thursday night’s final presidential debate in Nashville.

The Biden campaign has called a lid until Thursday. — Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) October 19, 2020

This campaign lid comes mere days after the New York Post ran a series of stories alleging that, despite previously denying any knowledge of his son’s foreign business dealings, Biden knew and may have been involved in them during his time as vice president.

Since the stories’ publications in mid-October, Biden nor the Biden Campaign have directly addressed the allegations except to say that there was no official meeting scheduled between the former VP and Ukrainian Burisma board adviser Vadym Pozharskyi, which the Post claims was leveraged by Hunter Biden.

Biden’s only personal acknowledgment of the story came on Friday when he called it a “smear campaign.”

I asked Joe Biden: What is your response to the NYPost story about your son, sir? He called it a “smear campaign” and then went after me. “I know you’d ask it.

According to CBS News Political Correspondent Ed O’Keefe, Biden is taking off four days to have ample time to prepare for the debate.

“This week is mostly about debate prep,” O’Keefe said. “He will not be seen again. After today, until Thursday night in Nashville at that next debate so they are going to keep him focused on that. That’s a signal that they believe this is still a very big opportunity for them to provide one last big contrast with the president, and that they have to prepare him for potential attacks from the president.”

Before the end of September, Biden took off nine days of campaigning. No explanation was offered for any of the days except for the one directly before the first presidential debate, which Biden’s campaign said he was using to prepare for his first head-to-head with the president.

Intelligence Director Ratcliffe Debunks Disinformation Theories On Biden,"The director of National Intelligence (DNI) laid to rest foreign disinformation theories on Monday surrounding a series of bombshell revelations last week exposing the Biden family as far more corrupt than initially reported.

“Let me be clear,” DNI Director John Ratcliffe said on Fox Business regarding whether Hunter Biden’s leaked emails stem from a foreign election interference campaign. “The intelligence community doesn’t believe that because there is no intelligence that supports that.”

Ratcliffe took a direct shot at House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, who, along with legacy media have again harnessed unsubstantiated allegations of Russian interference surrounding the Biden emails as the basis to either ignore or delegitimize the damning evidence against their preferred presidential candidate.

“We know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin,” Schiff said on CNN last week, only to be discredited by the U.S. intelligence chief Monday.

“We have shared no intelligence with Chairman Schiff, or any other member of Congress that Hunter Biden’s laptop is part of some Russian disinformation campaign,” Ratcliffe said. “It’s simply not true.”

It's almost like Adam Schiff, the Dems & the media are all repeating false propaganda about ""Russian disinfo"" w/ ZERO EVIDENCE, to hide Joe Biden's corruption from the American people. “Hunter Biden’s laptop is NOT part of some Russian disinformation campaign.” – @DNI_Ratcliffe pic.twitter.com/BTuDo5uQC9 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 19, 2020

A senior U.S. intelligence official later confirmed Ratcliffe’s comments on the absence of such intelligence to The Federalist.

“Ratcliffe is 100 percent correct. There is no intelligence at this time to support Chairman Schiff’s statement that recent stories on the Biden’s foreign business dealings are part of a smear campaign that ‘comes from the Kremlin,'” the senior U.S. official told The Federalist. “Numerous foreign adversaries are seeking to influence American politics, policies and media narratives. They don’t need any help from politicians who spread false information under the guise of intelligence.”

https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/1318179020975071233?s=20

The statements come less than a week after the New York Post obtained what is believed to be Hunter Biden’s laptop from a computer repair store in Delaware. The Post then began publishing incriminating content from its hard drive showing that Joe Biden stood to personally profit from his son’s business activity with Chinese officials with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and repeatedly lied about never discussing overseas business activity with Hunter, “or with anyone else.”

Fox News later confirmed on Friday that an unnamed individual in one email referred to as “the big guy,” poised to rake in 10 percent of a lucrative contract funneled through Hunter Biden was indeed former Vice President Joe Biden.

On Wednesday, the Post reported emails contradicting Joe Biden’s claims that he never talked business with his son. Rather, Joe Biden was actually introduced to a senior adviser to Burisma, the Ukrainian energy firm Hunter Biden served on the board for upwards of $50,000 a month in excess compensation while Joe was the “public face” of the Obama administration’s policy towards Ukraine.

“Thank you for inviting me to DC and giving me an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together,” Burisma consultant Vadym Pozharskyi wrote.

After corporate media completely ignored the Post’s reporting to complement big tech censorship, the same people who perpetuated the never-ending Russia Hoax alleging President Donald Trump to be a Russian agent are now attempting to capitalize on Schiff’s baseless accusations that the Hunter Biden story is Russian interference.

The primary sub-source, whose reporting was the basis for the widely debunked pee tape Steele Dossier to allege Trump was an agent of the Kremlin on the other hand, was an actual suspect of being a Russian operative.

Meanwhile, the authenticity of Hunter Biden’s emails have not been disputed by Joe Biden’s campaign which called a 72-hour lid early Monday morning.

"Study: Biden Will Raise Taxes On 80 Percent Of Americans, Cut Annual Income $6,500 Per Household","A new study shows that Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden’s proposed economic plan would significantly hurt the long-term American economy if implemented.

While many mainstream media outlets claim Biden’s plan will target the wealthy and save the middle-class money, the 50-page study released by the Hoover Institution shows different results.

“Economists have paid too little attention to the economic effects of the Biden plan,” said Casey B. Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago. “Our report, which focuses on taxation, health insurance, regulation, and energy policy, suggests that these effects are potentially very large indeed.”

The study conducted by a group of financial and economic experts including Mulligan, former Chief Economist of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and Kevin Hassett, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers since 2017, demonstrates how Biden’s plan will hurt everyone.

“We conclude that, in the long run, Vice President Biden’s full agenda reduces full-time equivalent employment per person by about 3 percent, the capital stock per person by about 15 percent, real GDP per capita by more than 8 percent, and real consumption per household by about 7 percent,” the report stated.

If Biden’s proposed changes are implemented, the economists warn that, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s projections, 2030 may yield “4.9 million fewer employed individuals, $2.6 trillion less GDP, and $1.5 trillion less consumption in that year alone.” The economists also note that the median household income in 2030 would fall by $6,500 despite Biden’s promises to prioritize the middle class.

In the study, the economists’ main findings center on three conclusions. First, that for Biden to achieve the “ambitious plans to further cut the nation’s carbon emissions,” 1.3 million net additional energy workers will need to be added into the transportation and electrical industries.

“Biden’s plans are ambitious,” says Mulligan. “Unless people drive a lot less, the electrification of all or even most passenger vehicles would increase the per capita demand for electric power by about 25 percent. Simultaneously, more than 70 percent of the baseline supply (i.e., electricity generated from fossil fuels) would be taken offline and another 11 percent (nuclear) would not expand.”

The study also concludes that “labor wedges are increased by proposed changes to regulation as well as to the ACA.” Because of the subsidations, the study found the average marginal tax rate on labor would rise by 2.4 percentage points.

“Labor falls primarily due to new and high implicit taxes associated with more generous health insurance assistance delivered in the framework of the Affordable Care Act (ACA),” the study reads.

“Our quantitative findings for the ACA should be no surprise given what had been found for previous efforts in the U.S. and other countries to expand health insurance coverage,” the study adds.

Lastly, the study concludes that Biden’s plan “reduces capital intensity by increasing average marginal tax rates on capital income.”

“Biden’s plan to raise personal income and payroll tax rates would push their federal rates from below 40 percent to, often, above 50 percent, and these are on top of state income taxes,” the study states, which would hurt small businesses, their employees, and consumers substantially.

While Biden and his VP Nominee Kamala Harris previously promised that they will not “raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000,” they have also promised to repeal the tax cuts made by President Trump, which gave 80.4 percent of all taxpayers a cut and 91 percent of the middle quintile a cut.

“On Day One, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He will get rid of it,” Harris said during the vice presidential debate in early October.

"The Biden Corruption Scandal Isn’t About Hunter, It’s About Joe","Hunter Biden’s addiction is not the issue. Joe Biden’s addiction is: His addiction to power and money. And it is the evidence of the former vice president’s corruption, and the national security risk our country would face by electing Biden, that is the story of the MacBook hard drive, not the salacious, verified photographs and videos of Hunter Biden.

For nearly a week, corporate media successfully ignored or downplayed news of the trove of Hunter Biden’s emails, texts, photographs, and videos recovered from a laptop abandoned at a Delaware computer repair store. Then confirmation of the authenticity of the materials first reported in the New York Post, and the release of a second set of emails — also confirmed— from another source finally forced the press to acknowledge the issue.

On Friday evening, CBS News’ Bo Erickson asked Joe Biden about the New York Post story as the Democrat candidate for president departed from a campaign stop in Michigan. “I have no response. It’s another smear campaign — right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask,” Biden snipped at the long-time reporter.

With more details coming out daily, this non-answer will not placate even a compliant press for long. Nor will the “Russia disinformation” narrative pushed by Biden’s media boosters suffice because multiple confirmations of the evidence establish this story is not disinformation.

It’s Not about Hunter’s Addiction, It’s about Joe’s

So, the dissembling will start, with Biden attempting to make the story about his son’s drug addiction. We already saw this when President Trump hit his opponent during the first presidential debate with the fact that once Biden “became vice president [Hunter] made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places.” Biden’s first response was outright denial: “That is not true.” But that won’t work with the constantly accumulating evidence from the hard drive and the other independent emails.

So Biden’s second tack will likely be his campaign’s official response once they regroup over the weekend: “My son, like a lot of people at home, had a drug problem. He’s overtaking it. He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him, I’m proud of my son,” Biden punched back during the first presidential debate.

Wisely, President Trump ignored the misdirection, replying, “But why was he given tens of millions of dollars?” “Moderator” Chris Wallace rescued Biden by interjecting, “We’ve already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, as the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here.”

Senate Report Confirms Corruption

While Hunter Biden’s highly lucrative position on the board of the Ukrainian company Burisma has received some press, the media all but ignored the U.S. Senate committee report on “Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Corruption: The Impact on U.S. Government Policy and Related Concerns.” This report not only details “examples of extensive and complex financial transactions involving the Bidens, it also describes the quandary other U.S. governmental officials faced as they attempted to guide and support Ukraine’s anticorruption efforts.”

The report’s key findings included concerns raised by “officials in Vice President Joe Biden’s office about the perception of a conflict of interest with respect to Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board,” and a senior State Department official’s warning to Vice President Biden or his staff “that Hunter Biden’s position on Burisma’s board enabled Russian disinformation efforts and risked undermining U.S. policy in Ukraine.” The report also confirmed that former Secretary of State John Kerry “had knowledge of Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board,” even though he falsely denied that knowledge during a town hall event in 2019.

The report was not limited to Hunter Biden’s role on the Burisma board and the Obama-Biden administration’s knowledge of that conflict of interest. The Senate committees also detailed Hunter’s receipt of “a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow,” and Hunter’s opening of “a bank account with Gongwen Dong to fund a $100,000 global spending spree with James Biden and Sara Biden,” as well as his “business associations with Ye Jianming, Gongwen Dong, and other Chinese nationals linked to the Communist government and the People’s Liberation Army.”

“Those associations,” the report continued, “resulted in millions of dollars in cash flow,” some of which Hunter “paid nonresident women who were nationals of Russia or other Eastern European countries and who appear to be linked to an ‘Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.’”

Whistleblower Turns Over Hunter’s Laptop

Then on Saturday, we learned from a letter sent by Sen. Ron Johnson, the chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, to FBI Director Christopher Wray, that the report triggered “a whistleblower” to contact Johnson’s “committee and informed [his] staff that he had possession of a laptop left in his business by Hunter Biden,” clearly the same source as behind the New York Post’s story.

The letter continued: “He also informed us that he provided its contents to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in response to a December 9, 2019 grand jury subpoena.” The FBI refused to confirm any or deny any information sought by the committee, including questions unrelated to ongoing grand jury investigations. Johnson stressed the importance of the FBI responding to the committee’s inquiry: “I have a responsibility to validate and verify the contents of any information produced to my committee. The committee must know if it receives information that could be fraudulent or not accurate.”

“For example,” Johnson’s letter continued, “if any information offered to the committee was linked to a foreign adversary’s attempt to interfere in the election, I would expect the FBI to ensure the committee is protected and receives a defensive briefing.” Additionally, as Johnson noted, “knowingly providing false information to Congress is a crime.” Johnson then listed a litany of questions concerning the laptop and the FBI’s efforts to verify the authenticity of the material, asking for an answer by Oct. 22, 2020.

It seems unlikely the FBI will respond to the inquiry, or at least not publicly, but to date, several outlets are claiming they confirmed the validity of the emails and other material on the hard drive, and the personal texts and photographs and videos released leave little doubt that the hard drive truly was Hunter Biden’s.

This Is about Joe Biden, Not Hunter

That is the extent of the relevance of the personal information being released: The public does not need to know of the unsavory and illegal behavior Hunter engaged in—much less watch it—while he was in the throes of addiction. America also does not need to read the words of anguish exchanged between an addict son undergoing rehab and his famous father.

Yet Hunter Biden’s addiction, and the fact that tens of thousands of other Americans suffer similar demons, does not atone for the sins of the father. And that is what the email and text scandal concerns: Evidence that Joe Biden, while vice president of the United States, knowingly allowed his son to profit by selling access to Biden and others in the Obama administration, including to Communist Party of China leaders, and then lied about it.

The emails and texts Joe personally received also suggest a cut from Hunter’s influence-peddling. For instance, one email published by the New York Post detailed a deal Hunter Biden pursued with China’s largest private energy company that was “interesting for me and my family.”

A May 13, 2017 email with the subject line “Expectations” listed expected “renumeration packages” for various individuals, including “‘H,’ apparently referring to Biden.” The Post noted that “the deal also listed ‘10 Jim’ and ‘10 held by H for the big guy?’” but did not identify the “big guy.” However, sources have told Fox News “‘the big guy’ is a reference to the former vice president.”

A text recovered from the hard drive also suggests the former vice president may have received a cut of Hunter’s “earnings.” “I Hope you all cal do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family Fro 30 years,” a screenshot of a text from January 2019 to Hunter’s daughter read. “It’s really hard. But don’t worry unlike Pop I won’t make you give me half your salary.”

This Compromising Material Is a National Security Risk

Evidence of this scandal is too strong to ignore or to allow Joe Biden, the Democratic Party, or corporate media to cast aside as an unseemly attack on a recovering drug addict, and not merely because of the corruption at issue. Every country, every foreign politician or political faction, and every corrupt oligarch or business that paid for access has the emails, notes, receipts, itineraries, fund transfers, and maybe even photographs or recordings. And that makes Joe Biden a national security risk.

Remember, it was Acting Attorney General Sally Yates’ concern that then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was a national security risk that sent her to the White House to get him fired. The Russians would know, she maintained, that Flynn had misrepresented to Vice President Mike Pence his conversations with the Russian ambassador, and that would leave Flynn compromised. Of course, that theory was so preposterous that even disgraced former FBI Director James Comey called it a stretch.

But there is a world of difference between a conversation among a transition team member and a foreign ambassador and a conversation between individuals with foreign interests and the former vice president, bought and paid for with cash funneled through his son. A compromise of that kind holds serious national security issues, which is why our country needs a full vetting of this evidence.

If the emails and texts are fake, we need to know that. But all indications to date are that they are real, and spectacularly damning. And that has nothing to do with Hunter Biden’s addiction, and everything to do with Joe Biden’s unfitness for office.

Will Joe Biden Get Any Questions About Hunter Biden In Final Debate?,"The supposedly independent Commission on Presidential Debates unveiled the topics for Thursday night’s primetime match-up. The topics were announced late last week after a series of bombshell revelations from the New York Post expanded public knowledge of the Biden family’s corrupt overseas business activity while in the upper echelons of U.S. government.

The debate, moderated by NBC’s Kristen Welker — who celebrated Christmas with the Obamas and whose family has donated thousands to Democrats including Joe Biden — will feature questions on “Fighting COVID-19,” “American Families,” “Race in America,” “Climate Change,” “National Security,” and “Leadership.”

After former Clinton White House Communications Director George Stephanopoulos refused to ask Biden a single question during ABC’s town hall last week about the fresh evidence implicating the former vice president in his son’s foreign business dealings, one has to wonder if the Democratic candidate already being protected by big tech, legacy media, and the debate commission will be forced to finally address the controversy.

On Wednesday, the New York Post dropped its first round of blockbuster reporting that revealed incriminating evidence against the former vice president on a laptop suspected of belonging to Hunter Biden obtained from a computer repair shop in Delaware.

Emails published by the Post show Joe Biden lied when he claimed repeatedly that he never spoke business with his son, “or with anyone else.” Now-public correspondence shows that Hunter Biden introduced his vice president father to a senior adviser for Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company where Hunter served on the board. Hunter had no prior experience in the industry yet received upwards of $50,000 a month in excess compensation.

“Thank you for inviting me to DC and giving me an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together,” Burisma consultant Vadym Pozharskyi wrote to Hunter, whose father at the time was the “public face” of the Obama administration’s policy towards Ukraine.

Twitter and Facebook immediately weaponized their monopolistic power over the 21st-century public square to suppress the story.

On Thursday, the New York Post dropped round two of their reporting on content found in the computer that showed Hunter Biden stood to rake in $10 million a year for “introductions alone,” from a Chinese businessman with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The story was, of course, subjected to big tech censorship again.

The debate commission revealed its debate topics the next day. Foreign policy, which the Trump campaign claims had been the previously agreed focus following internal deliberations with Team Biden and the debate commission, wasn’t among them.

Trump Campaign Manager Bill Stepein demanded the commission feature foreign policy as a primary topic for Thursday night’s event. That has become custom for the third presidential debate, although this week’s is technically the second to actually occur, after last week’s was canceled.

“We write with great concern over the announced topics for what was always billed as the ‘Foreign Policy Debate,’ in a series of events agreed to by both the Trump campaign and the Biden campaign many months ago,” Stepein wrote, noting that many of the topics on the next debate’s docket had already been addressed at length in the first debate moderated by Chris Wallace. “For the good of campaign integrity, and for the benefit of the American people, we urge you to rethink and reissue a set of topics for the October 22 debate, with an emphasis on foreign policy.”

It’s unlikely they will, given that the commission run entirely by Biden supporters has already been making decisions to the Democrat’s benefit such as flanking Trump with demands for a virtual debate that ultimately ended in canceling it. The second debate was also supposed to be moderated by a former Biden intern who exposed his own bias on Twitter when he publicly consulted fired former Trump White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, now a vocal NeverTrumper, on how to handle the president.

Interesting tweet from debate moderator Steve Scully to Anthony Scaramucci. https://t.co/3iRN9lidR6 pic.twitter.com/gImyfTCz9C — Mollie (@MZHemingway) October 9, 2020

Scully initially claimed he was hacked before admitting it was a lie a week later. C-SPAN suspended Scully indefinitely. The town halls that took place instead paraded Biden supporters as “undecided voters,” and each failed to offer substantive dialogue on American foreign policy from the candidates, a major area of success for the Trump administration. Trump has brokered Middle East treaties culminating in the explosion of peace in the region.

Whether Biden will be pressed on Hunter Biden Thursday night is certain. The Trump campaign has already promised it. Whether it comes from the debate moderator as it should, however, remains the open question. Whether the moderator will step in to protect Joe Biden on stage remains an even bigger one.

When the Democratic nominee was finally pressed on the charges of corruption now plaguing his campaign, at least from conservative media reporting what legacy media has attempted to delegitimize despite hyping up the pee tape Steele dossier, Biden lashed out at the press, calling the report a smear campaign.

“I have no response,” Biden said. “It’s another smear campaign, right up your alley.”

I asked Joe Biden: What is your response to the NYPost story about your son, sir? He called it a “smear campaign” and then went after me. “I know you’d ask it. I have no response, it’s another smear campaign, right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask.” pic.twitter.com/Eo6VD4TqxD — Bo Erickson CBS (@BoKnowsNews) October 17, 2020

With new allegations of corruption roiling the campaign, reporters reverted to softball coverage, asking Biden what kind of ice cream he got on Sunday.

One could easily imagine how the same reporters would behave if the roles were reversed and it was Trump exiting the North Carolina food joint while facing the same kind of accusations.

Possibly to avoid any more questions about the content revealed on his son’s laptop, the Biden campaign called a 72-hour cessation of campaigning Monday while not disputing the authenticity of the reported emails.

Joe Biden’s Boosters Financed His Prodigal Son’s Entire Career,"Hunter Biden profited from his father’s political connections long before he struck questionable deals in countries where Joe Biden was undertaking diplomatic missions as vice president. In fact, virtually all the jobs listed on his resume going back to his first position out of college, which paid a six-figure salary, came courtesy of the former six-term senator’s donors, lobbyists, and allies, a RealClearInvestigations examination has found.

One document reviewed by RCI reveals that a Biden associate admitted “finding employment” for Hunter Biden specifically as a special favor to his father, then a Senate leader running for president. He secured a $1.2 million gig on Wall Street for his young son, even though it was understood he had no experience in high finance. Many of his generous patrons, in turn, ended up with legislation and policies favorable to their businesses or investments, an RCI review of lobbying records and legislative actions taken by the elder Biden confirms.

That the 50-year-old Hunter has been trading on his Democratic father’s political influence his entire adult life raises legal questions about possible influence-peddling, government watchdogs and former federal investigators say. In addition, the more than two-decades-long pattern of nepotism casts fresh doubt on Joe Biden’s recent statements that he “never discussed” business with his son, and that his activities posed “no conflicts of interest.”

No fewer than three committees in the Republican-controlled Senate have opened probes into potential Biden family conflicts. Investigators are also poring over Treasury Department records that have flagged suspicious activities involving Hunter’s banking transactions and business deals that may be connected to his father’s political influence.

U.S. ethics rules require all government officials to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest in taking official actions. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing.

While most of the attention on Hunter has focused on his dealings in Ukraine and China when his father was in the White House, he also cashed in on cushy jobs and sweetheart deals throughout his dad’s long Senate career, records reveal.

“Hunter Biden’s Ukraine-China connections are just one element of the Biden corruption story,” said Tom Fitton, president of the Washington-based watchdog group Judicial Watch, who contends Biden used both the Office of the Vice President and the Senate to advance his son’s personal interests.

In each case, Hunter Biden appeared under-qualified for the positions he obtained. All the while, he was a chronic abuser of alcohol and drugs, including crack cocaine, and has cycled in and out of no fewer than six drug-rehab treatment programs, according to published reports. He’s also been the subject of at least two drug-related investigations by police, one in 1988 and another in 2016, according to federal records and reports. A third drug investigation resulted in his discharge from the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2014.

This comprehensive account of Hunter Biden’s “unique career trajectory,” as one former family friend gently put it, was pieced together through interviews with more than a dozen people, several of whom insisted on anonymity to describe private conversations, and after an in-depth examination of public records, including Securities and Exchange Commission filings, court papers, campaign filings, federal lobbying disclosures, and congressional documents.

Hunter Biden’s resume begins 24 years ago. Here is a rundown of the plum positions he has managed to land since 1996, thanks to his politically connected father and his boosters:

1996-1998: MBNA Corp.

Fresh out of college, credit-card giant MBNA put him on its payroll as “senior vice president” earning more than $100,000 a year, plus an undisclosed signing bonus. Delaware-based MBNA at the time was Biden’s largest donor and lobbying the Delaware senator for bankruptcy reforms that would make it harder for consumers to declare bankruptcy and write off credit-card debt.

Besides a job for Hunter, bank executives and employees gave generously to Joe Biden’s campaigns – $214,000 total, federal records show – and one top executive even bought Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware, home for more than $200,000 above the market value, real estate records show. The exec paid top dollar – $1.2 million – for the old house even though it lacked central air conditioning. MBNA also flew Biden and his wife to events and covered their travel costs, disclosure forms show.

Sen. Biden eventually came through for MBNA by sponsoring and whipping votes in the Senate to pass the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention Act.

When NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw asked Biden during the 2008 presidential campaign whether it was wrong “for someone like you in the middle of all this to have your son collecting money from this big credit-card company while you were on the (Senate) floor protecting its interests,” Biden gave an answer he would repeat many times in the future: “Absolutely not,” he snapped, arguing it was completely appropriate and that Hunter deserved the position and generous salary because he graduated from Yale.

1998-2001: Commerce Department

Hunter also capitalized on the family name in 1998 when he joined President Clinton’s agency. In spite of having no experience in the dot-com industry, he was appointed “executive director of e-commerce policy coordination,” pulling down another six-figure salary plus bonuses.

He landed the job after his father’s longtime campaign manager and lawyer William Oldaker called then-Commerce Secretary William Daley, who’d also worked on Biden’s campaigns, and put in a good word for his son, according to public records.

2001-2009: Oldaker, Biden & Belair

After Republican President George W. Bush took over the Commerce Department, Hunter left the government and joined Oldaker to open a lobbying shop in Washington, just blocks from Congress, where he gained access to exclusive business and political deals.

Federal disclosure forms show Hunter Biden and his firm billed millions of dollars while lobbying on behalf of a host of hospitals and private colleges and universities, among other clients. In a 2006 disclosure statement submitted to the Senate, Hunter said his clients were “seeking federal appropriations dollars.”

Hunter won the contract to represent St. Joseph’s University from an old Biden family friend who worked in government relations at the university and proposed he solicit earmarks for one of its programs in Philadelphia. The friend, Robert Skomorucha, remarked in a press interview that Hunter had “a very strong last name that really paid off in terms of our lobbying efforts.”

These clients, like MBNA, also favored bankruptcy reforms to make it harder for patients and students to discharge debt in bankruptcy filings. At the same time Hunter was operating as a Beltway lobbyist, he was receiving “consulting payments” from his old employer MBNA, which was still courting his father over the bankruptcy reforms.

In 2007, Hunter also dined with a private prison lobbyist who had business before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee Joe Biden chaired, according to published reports. Senate rules bar members or their staff from having contact with family members who are lobbyists seeking to influence legislation.

Hunter’s lawyer-lobbyist firm was embroiled in a conflict-of-interest controversy in 2006 when it was criticized for representing a lobbyist under investigation by the House ethics committee. The lobbyist was still taking payments from his old K Street firm while working as a top aide on the House Appropriations Committee. Hunter at the time was lobbying that same committee for earmarks for his clients.

William Oldaker did not just make Hunter a rich lobbyist. Oldaker also secured a $1 million loan for him through a bank he co-founded, WashingtonFirst, that Hunter sought for an investment scheme, which later went sour.

Joe Biden deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign and political action committee donations at WashingtonFirst, while funneling hundreds of thousands in campaign and PAC expenditures to Oldaker, Biden & Belair. Joe Biden’s payments to Hunter’s lobbying firm, including more than $143,000 in 2007 alone, were listed as “legal services” in Federal Election Commission filings.

Oldaker did not respond to a request for comment left at his office.

2003-2005: National Group LLP

While serving as a partner at Oldaker, Biden & Belair, Hunter also registered as a lobbyist for National Group, a lobbying-only subsidiary which shared offices with OB&B and specialized in targeted spending items inserted into legislation known as “earmarks.”

Hunter represented his father’s alma mater, the University of Delaware, and other Biden constituents and submitted requests to Biden’s office for earmarks benefiting these clients in appropriations bills.

2006-2007: Paradigm Companies LLC

In 2005, when Joe Biden was thinking about making another run at the White House, after a 1987 bid that ended in plagiarism charges, his lobbyist son was looking for a new line of work too.

In early 2006, Wall Street executive and Biden family friend Anthony Lotito said, Biden’s younger brother, Jim, phoned him on behalf of the senator. He said Biden wanted his youngest son – whom he still called “Honey” – to get out of the lobbying business to avoid allegations of conflicts of interest that might dog Biden’s presidential bid.

“Biden was concerned with the impact that Hunter’s lobbying activities might have on his expected campaign [and asked his brother to] seek Lotito’s assistance in finding employment for Hunter in a non-lobbying capacity,” according to a January 2007 complaint that Lotito filed in New York state court against Hunter over alleged breach of contract in a related venture. (Jim and Hunter Biden denied such a phone call took place as described.)

Lotito told the court he agreed to help Hunter as a favor to the senator, who had served on the powerful banking committee. He figured “the financial community might be a good starting place in which to seek out employment on Hunter’s behalf,” the court documents state. But he quickly found that Wall Street had “no interest” in hiring Biden.

So the Bidens hatched a scheme to buy a hedge fund, “whereby Hunter would then assume a senior executive position with the company.” And Lotito helped broker the deal. Despite having no Wall Street experience, Biden was appointed interim CEO and president of the Paradigm investment fund and given a $1.2 million salary, according to SEC filings. Lotito joined the enterprise as a partner, and agreed to shepherd Hunter, still in his mid-30s, through his new role in high-finance.

“Given Hunter Biden’s inexperience in the securities industry,” the complaint states, it was agreed that Lotito would maintain an office at the new holding company’s New York headquarters “in order to assist Biden in discharging his duties as president.”

After the venture failed, Lotito sued the Bidens for fraud. The Bidens countersued and the two parties settled in 2008.

2006-2009: Amtrak

During this same period, Hunter was appointed vice chairman of the taxpayer-subsidized rail line, thanks to the sponsorship of powerful Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, a political ally of his father.

In a 2006 statement submitted to the Senate during his confirmation, Hunter asserted that he was qualified for the Amtrak board because “as a frequent commuter and Amtrak customer for over 30 years, I have literally logged thousands of miles on Amtrak.”

Amtrak officials and employees have been big supporters of Joe Biden — for example donating a total of $44,490 to Biden this year (vs. $12,413 to Trump), according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Amtrak even named a train station after him in Wilmington. In return, Biden has supported taxpayer subsidies for the government railroad throughout his political career.

In his testimony, Hunter denied his Amtrak appointment pushed conflict-of-interest boundaries.

2009- : Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC

Hunter co-founded the investment firm five months after his father moved into the White House and incorporated it in his father’s home state of Delaware, which has strict corporate secrecy rules.

At the time, President Barack Obama had tapped Vice President Biden to oversee the recovery from the financial crisis. Three weeks after Rosemont was incorporated, Hunter and his partners set up a subsidiary called Rosemont TALF and got $24 million in loans from the federal program known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. TALF was designed to help bail out banks and auto lenders hit by the crisis.

Within months, Rosemont had secured a total of $130 million from the program. Some of the government cash was then funneled into an investment fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands, SEC records show. Such offshore accounts are commonly used to evade taxes.

The move raised ethical flags with government watchdogs who suspected the bailout cash was used to benefit a well-connected insider.

Other records reveal that another subsidiary created years later – Rosemont Realty – touted to its investors that board adviser Hunter was politically connected. It highlighted in a company prospectus that he was the “son of Vice President Biden.”

2009-2012: Eudora Global

On his resume, Hunter also lists himself as “founder” of yet another investment firm. But Eudora’s articles of incorporation show it was actually set up by a major Biden donor, Jeffrey Cooper, who put Hunter on his board after his father became vice president.

A self-described “friend of the Biden family,” Cooper also happened to run one of the largest asbestos-litigation firms in the country — SimmonsCooper LLC — and had courted Biden to make it easier to file asbestos lawsuits by defeating tort reforms. As a leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden had blocked reform of asbestos litigation every time bills reached the Senate floor.

Cooper’s law firm, which directly lobbied the Delaware senator’s office to kill such bills, donated more than $200,000 to Biden’s campaigns over the years, as well as his Unite Our States PAC, FEC records show. In fact, SimmonsCooper was one of Biden’s biggest donors during his failed 2007-2008 run for president, pumping $53,000 into his campaign.

The firm also put up $1 million in investment capital to help his son buy out the Paradigm hedge fund as part of the arrangement brokered by another Biden family friend, Lotito, to find non-lobbying work for Hunter. Thanks in large part to Biden’s effort to kill bills reining in asbestos trial lawyers, SimmonsCooper has hauled in more than $1 billion for alleged asbestos victims.

Attempts to reach Cooper for comment were unsuccessful.

2009-2016: Boies Schiller Flexner LLP

When Joe Biden became vice president, Hunter landed a high-paying, no-show job at the New York-based law firm, a Democrat shop long tied to the Clintons. Another major Biden donor, the firm gave him the title “of counsel.”

Boies Schiller brought Hunter aboard in 2009 after the Bidens hired the firm to defend Hunter against charges he defrauded partners in the Paradigm investment venture. Boies Schiller managed to get the case dismissed.

In 2014, a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch, who was under investigation and looking to repair his reputation to attract Western investors, started sending large payments to Boies to support Hunter for unspecified work. It’s unclear what Hunter did for the oligarch, who ran the gas giant Burisma, but $283,000 showed up at the same time his father was tapped by Obama to play a central role in overseeing U.S. energy policy in Ukraine.

Boies Schiller has pumped more than $50,000 into Biden’s campaigns, Federal Election Commission records show.

2013-2019: BHR Partners

After Obama named Biden his point man on China policy, Rosemont Seneca set up a joint venture worth $1 billion with the Bank of China called BHR – and Hunter was named vice chairman and director of the new concern.

Following in the shadow of his father’s political trajectory, Hunter’s new venture won the first-of-its-kind investment deal with the Chinese government at the same time Biden was jetting to Beijing to meet with top communist leaders. Secret Service records reveal Hunter flew to China on Air Force Two with his father while brokering the December 2013 deal. He arranged for one of his Chinese partners to shake hands with the vice president. BHR was registered 12 days later. Beijing OK’d a business license shortly afterward.

“No one else had such an arrangement in China,” said Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute.

Hunter resigned from the board of the Beijing-backed equity firm earlier this year as his father faced growing criticism on the campaign trail over what critics called a glaring conflict of interest. He did not, however, divest his 10 percent equity stake in the Chinese fund, which is estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars.

Schweizer, whose books include “Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elites,” said Biden went “soft” on the Chinese communists so his son could “cash in” on China business deals. Biden insists he did not discuss the venture with his son before, during, or after his official visit to Beijing. But others see obvious hypocrisy at play in the Biden family’s self-dealing in notoriously corrupt China.

“Biden was one of the most vocal champions of anti-corruption efforts in the Obama administration. So when this same Biden takes his son with him to China aboard Air Force Two, and within days Hunter joins the board of an investment advisory firm with stakes in China, it does not matter what father and son discussed,” said Sarah Chayes, author of “Thieves of State: Why Corruption Threatens National Security.” “Joe Biden has enabled this brand of practice.”

2013-2014: U.S. Navy Reserve

Hunter was selected for a direct commission as a public affairs officer in a Virginia reserve unit.

He clearly received special treatment in securing the part-time post. Officers had to issue him two waivers – one for his age and one for a previous drug offense. His vice president father swore him in at the White House in a small, private ceremony.

Barely a year later, authorities booted Hunter from the Navy for cocaine use after he tested positive from a urine test. The reason for his discharge was withheld from the press for several months.

2014-2019: Burisma Holdings

The Ukrainian gas giant added Hunter to its board soon after Obama named his father his point man on Ukraine policy, focusing on energy. The company paid his son as much as $83,000 a month, even though he had no energy experience to bring to the table and was required to attend just one board meeting a year.

At the time, the vice president was steering U.S. aid to Kyiv to help develop its gas fields, which stood to benefit Burisma as the holder of permits to develop natural gas in three of Ukraine’s most lucrative fields. Biden promised Ukrainian officials the United States would pump more than $1 billion into their energy industry and economy during a visit to Kyiv in late April 2014. He urged leaders to increase the country’s gas supply and to rely on Americans to help them. Less than three weeks later, Burisma appointed his son to the board, after already retaining him for undisclosed services through Boies Schiller.

Burisma was run by an oligarch, Mykola Zlochevsky, who was under investigation at the time and seeking Western protection from prosecution. In a move observers suspect was intended to send a message to prosecutors, the company sent out a news release in May 2014 claiming, falsely, that Hunter would be in charge of its “legal unit.” Burisma also trumpeted the fact that Hunter was “the son of the current U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden.”

Biden’s office was aware Burisma was under investigation. The administration had tried to partner with the gas company through U.S. aid programs, but the outreach project was blocked over corruption concerns lodged by career diplomats.

In early 2016, Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not dismiss the country’s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma. “If the prosecutor is not fired,” Biden recalled telling Ukraine’s leader, “you’re not getting the money.”

Biden’s muscling worked: Shokin was sacked in March 2016.

The former vice president says he was carrying out official U.S. policy that sought to remove an ineffective prosecutor. But Shokin had raided the home of Burisma’s owner and seized his property.

In addition, Shokin said that as part of his probe he was making plans to interview Hunter about millions of dollars in fees he and his partners had received from Burisma. He insists he was fired because he refused to close the investigation.

“The truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma, and Joe Biden’s son was a member of the board,” Shokin said in a recent sworn affidavit prepared for a European court. “I assume Burisma had the support of Joe Biden because his son was on the board.” He added that the vice president himself had “significant interests” in Burisma.

The prosecutor who replaced Shokin shut down the Burisma probe within 10 months. Burisma’s founder was also taken off a U.S. government visa ban list.

Biden claims he only learned of his son joining the Burisma board from the news media. But there is evidence Biden had been consulted in advance. White House visitor logs show that Biden met with Hunter’s business partner Devon Archer on April 16, 2014. Burisma put Archer on its board shortly thereafter, followed by Hunter the next month. (Both Archer and Hunter maintain Burisma never came up during the private visit in Biden’s office, which lasted late into the night.)

The day after Joe Biden’s meeting with Hunter’s partner in the White House, Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi reportedly emailed Hunter to thank him for inviting him to Washington and “giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent[sic] some time together.” The Biden campaign asserts it cannot find a meeting with Pozharskyi on the former vice president’s “schedule,” though it did not deny such a meeting could have taken place. The Ukrainian official mentioned going out for coffee with Hunter on April 17, 2014, which indicated he was physically in D.C. at the time. RCI has not confirmed the authenticity of the April 17 email document, first disclosed by the New York Post after obtaining it from a hard drive allegedly copied from a laptop of Hunter Biden left at a computer repair shop in Wilmington, Delaware. Pozharskyi did not respond to emails seeking comment.

Hunter stepped down from Burisma’s board in April 2019, a month before his father announced his White House bid and after critics made an issue of the conflicts his sinecure posed. He has since kept a very low profile. Unlike Trump’s children, Biden’s son is not out on the trail campaigning for him.

1,850 Boxes Sealed Until After Election

“Hunter Biden had no experience in the field, but he did have a notable connection to the vice president, who publicly has bragged about making clear to the Ukrainians that he alone controlled U.S. aid to the country,” noted Jonathan Turley, a public-interest law professor at George Washington University.

Retired FBI official I.C. Smith, who led public corruption investigations in Washington and Little Rock, Arkansas, said both father and son should have known joining Burisma was a bad idea, adding that it gives at least the appearance he was leveraging his name for payoffs from shady clients abroad.

“Clearly he’s led a troubled life and would be the sort of person susceptible to becoming engaged in this sort of rather sordid deal,” Smith said of Hunter.

“When he said his father asked if the deal was on the up and up and was assured it was, I would think, given Hunter’s past, the father would have asked more questions,” he added.

Hunter acknowledged in an ABC News interview last year that he lacked experience in both energy and Ukraine, but maintained that Burisma was impressed by other things on his resume.

“Ironically, Hunter highlighted his work at MBNA and his work on the board of Amtrak as evidence of his qualifications for the Burisma gig,” said Fitton of Judicial Watch. “But both the MBNA and Amtrak jobs, under any sensible analysis, were obvious favors for Joe Biden.”

Fitton argued that Biden’s claim he never discussed his son’s jobs and business deals rings hollow against the lengthy record of something-for-nothing nepotism.

“That’s campaign spin,” he said. “Hunter has already admitted to having at least one conversation on the Ukraine issue with Vice President Biden.”

Biden defenders argue that many relatives of politicians are often involved in government and politics. Ivanka Trump and Don Trump Jr., for instance, have cozy relationships with, or financial stakes in, companies that may benefit from those decisions. They also point out that, while they may look bad, there’s nothing illegal about such arrangements.

Fitton isn’t so sure. He said Judicial Watch is demanding Obama administration documents related to Hunter’s Ukraine and China deals, as well as other business arrangements potentially monetizing Biden’s political power.

“We can’t be sure if the arrangements were legal,” he said. “If any payments or jobs were neither ordinary nor customary, there may be legal issues.”

It’s a federal crime to provide a government benefit or favorable change in policy in exchange for something of personal value. At a minimum, argued former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy, Biden “had a conflict of interest with the position his son had” on the Burisma board, noting that at the time, Biden was pushing energy policies that favored the gas giant.

Not all of Hunter Biden’s critics are coming from the right, either.

“It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter’s foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter’s relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him,” said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a liberal watchdog group based in Washington.

While Joe Biden insists “there’s been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else,” Senate investigators are seeking a number of related emails and memos generated during the Obama administration, as well as his 36-year Senate career. That period, spanning from 1973 to 2009, coincides with a large chunk of his son’s resume.

However, Biden has sealed the bulk of the records at the University of Delaware Library, which refuses to release any of his papers until after the election. It maintains more than 1,850 boxes of Biden records, including his speeches, voting records, position papers, and notes from confidential interviews he’s conducted with foreign leaders, among other documents. The papers the university is keeping a lid on could shed light on Biden’s thinking behind foreign policies and controversial bills he sponsored.

A spokeswoman said the library will not release any of Biden’s papers to the public until they are “properly processed and archived.” Until then, “access is only available with Vice President Biden’s express consent,” she said, while declining to answer whether the university would comply if the Senate subpoenaed documents as part of its investigation of the Bidens.

The university houses the Biden Institute, which is part of the Joseph R. Biden, Jr. School of Public Policy and Administration.

Through a lawyer, Hunter maintained he and his father dutifully avoided “conflicts of interest” — or even “the appearance of such conflicts.” In every business pursuit, he asserted, they acted “appropriately and in good faith.”

However, in a moment of candor during a recent ABC News interview, Hunter confessed: “I don’t think that there’s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn’t Biden,” before adding, “There’s literally nothing my father in some way hasn’t had influence over.”

Still, the elder Biden argues it’s the Trump family who has the nepotism problem. In a recent CBS “60 Minutes” interview, he slammed the president for letting his daughter and son-in-law “sit in on Cabinet meetings.”

“It’s just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you’re doing is for them,” he intoned. “For them.”

Why Big Media Will Never Report On Hunter Biden’s Emails,"The corporate media has refused to cover the substance of the New York Post’s bombshell reporting on Hunter Biden’s recovered laptop and emails, not because there’s nothing to the story or because the emails are fake, but because the story itself is, on its face, harmful to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

That’s not to say news outlets haven’t been writing about the Post’s reporting. They’ve simply decided to cover the meta-narrative—the story about the story—while studiously ignoring what Hunter Biden’s emails reveal about his family’s overseas business dealings and influence-peddling.

Here’s how it works. Instead of aggressive follow-up reporting on the content of Hunter Biden’s emails, which is what you’d expect from news organizations, we’ve gotten a wave of process stories about the “anatomy” of the Post’s “dubious” reporting, censorship stories about Twitter and Facebook, and wild conspiracy theory stories about a rumored Russian disinformation plot.

Last week when all this broke, the focus quickly shifted from Hunter Biden’s emails to a decision by Facebook and Twitter to censor the Post’s reporting, and, in Twitter’s case, lock the Post’s official account for posting “hacked” materials (there’s no evidence the emails were hacked). When Twitter tried to walk back but also justify its draconian policies, the media reported on that, and when a handful of Republican senators announced they’d be subpoenaing Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey over the imbroglio, the media reported on that, too.

What they didn’t report on is the obvious thing the emails reveal: Hunter Biden was trading on his family name overseas, and Joe Biden, despite his many denials, seems to have been aware of this and might have even been a part of it.

Understand what’s going on here: The media will report on almost any aspect of this story, no matter how tangential or relatively insignificant, rather than grapple with the story itself.

Almost nothing is too trivial on this front. Over the weekend, we got stories in The New York Times and New York Magazine about behind-the-scenes dissent from a handful of anonymous Post employees who thought the Biden story shouldn’t have run. The Times article goes into great detail about whose bylines were attached to the Post’s reporting, how long each reporter had been at the paper, where he or she had worked previously, and the process top Post editors went through before publication.

Same for the New York Magazine article, which also tacitly dismissed the substance of the Post’s reporting—“supposed” scoop, “purported” emails—while quoting anonymous Post reporters grousing about how they’ve been “bracing” for the Post to “go pro-Trump before the election.”

What meager follow-up reporting on the substance of the emails we have seen has almost all been for the purpose of undermining the Post. The Washington Post, for one, was quick to “fact-check” the Post by casting vague aspersions on its reporting while failing to offer any new information or insights into the trove of emails detailing Hunter Biden’s foreign business deals.

Even more embarrassing have been outlets like CNN and USA Today, which, citing unnamed sources, breathlessly speculated that the FBI was investigating whether the emails were a possible “disinformation campaign” originating from—where else?—Moscow. (Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe on Monday laid these feverish rumors to rest, saying the recovered laptop and emails are “not part of some Russian disinformation campaign.”)

The Media Can’t Handle The Truth

The media’s preoccupation with the provenance of the laptop and the emails—are they “hacked materials” or are they part of a shadowy plot hatched by the Kremlin?—is meant to distract the broader public about what the laptop and emails actually contain.

After all, the last thing a media establishment in thrall to the Democratic Party wants to do is ask substantive questions about any of this. Why did a Ukrainian oligarch thank Hunter Biden for an introduction to his father in 2015 when the elder Biden was the Obama administration’s point-man on Ukraine? What did Hunter Biden mean when he told a Chinese energy firm that a lucrative deal would be “interesting for me and my family”?

The press isn’t interested, just like they weren’t interested in a recent U.S. Senate committee report on the Bidens’ complex financial transactions in Ukraine and elsewhere. I mean, if you’re not curious why the wife of the former mayor of Moscow would pay Hunter Biden $3.5 million, then you’re not going to be curious about any of this other stuff.

To be clear, it doesn’t matter what the Post or any other news outlet actually reports, or how airtight their reporting is. It doesn’t matter that no one, not even the Biden campaign, has denied the authenticity of the emails in question. It doesn’t matter that Fox News has independently corroborated one of the emails that indirectly references Joe Biden as one of six recipients of “renumeration packages” from the aforementioned Chinese energy firm. It doesn’t matter that the laptop came from a Delaware computer store and not, you know, Russia.

The mainstream media will not, under any circumstances, treat this as a serious story. The same media establishment that was willing to perpetuate a years-long Russia collusion hoax, for which it relied on an outlandish dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton’s campaign, will not countenance the Hunter Biden laptop story—no matter what.

They won’t do it for the simple reason that it will almost certainly hurt Biden’s White House bid, and they can’t have that.

Biden Falsely Claims Intel Community Has Cleared His Family Of Wrongdoing,"Without any evidence, Democratic Nominee Joe Biden claimed that the “vast majority” of the intelligence community agrees there is “no basis at all” for the allegations of corruption against him and his son Hunter Biden.

“And, you know, and all and the vast majority of the intelligence people have come out and said, there’s no basis at all,” Biden claimed.

Despite his baseless claims, the intelligence community has weighed in on the potentially incriminating evidence presented by the New York Post and others who obtained information from a laptop hard drive reportedly belonging to Hunter Biden.

On Tuesday, the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) agreed with Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe Tuesday that the information released about Biden and his son Hunter is not a Russian disinformation campaign.

“Let me be clear,” Ratcliffe said on Fox Business, debunking Rep. Adam Schiff’s baseless claims of foreign election interference. “The intelligence community doesn’t believe that because there is no intelligence that supports that.”

The FBI is also in possession of the laptop.

Despite these claims, Biden continued to criticize the spread of this damning evidence, calling it a “last-ditch effort in this desperate campaign to smear me and my family.”

“This is the same garbage [as] Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s henchmen,” Biden said.

Biden’s comments come after Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, released a statement “on Homeland Security letterhead” claiming that Hunter and the Biden family were profiting from “the Biden name.”

A Senate report released in late September outlined “a long list of the Biden family’s conflicts of interest conducting shady overseas business activity with foreign adversaries while serving at the upper echelons of government, raising significant national security concerns with potentially criminal conduct and threats of extortion.”

Johnson reiterated his position on the issue to Sean Hannity on Fox News Monday night, expressing his concern that the mainstream media was not covering the scandal properly.

“Hunter Biden, together with other Biden family members, profited off the Biden name. That’s what’s happening here,” he said. “What we revealed in our 87-page report is a vast web of connections with Chinese nationals, with people all over the world. Again, trading on the Biden name.”

“But it’s these business dealings – you know, our report raises far more questions than it actually answered – but it raises so my troubling issues that the mainstream media is simply not looking at,” Johnson added. “They are suppressing the information, which is a scandal in and of itself.”

It's a scandal in and of itself that the mainstream media is ignoring the vast web of conflicts of interest raised about the Biden family in our 87-page report. Read the report here: https://t.co/obf1Lougv6 pic.twitter.com/8wUVTo5Gyl — Senator Ron Johnson (@SenRonJohnson) October 20, 2020

In response, Biden said that “Ron should be ashamed of himself” and referred to GOP outsider Sen. Mitt Romney’s denial of these claims. Romney has historically opposed his Republican colleagues on multiple contentious issues including endorsing the Democrats’ campaign to attempt to impeach Trump.

“Even the man who served with him on that committee, a former nominee for the Republican Party, said there’s no basis to this,” Biden said.

There’s No Evidence For NYT’s ‘Disinformation’ Cover Of Biden Emails,"The campaign to delegitimize newly surfaced emails that implicate the Biden family in a massive foreign corruption scheme was a year in the making, and the seed for Team Biden’s “Russian disinformation” rebuttal was first planted in The New York Times.

Last week, the New York Post released a series of bombshell articles highlighting Hunter Biden’s corrupt business dealings with America’s greatest adversaries. Hunter Biden’s emails, which were acquired by The Post, appeared to reveal that he was leveraging his father’s political prestige to acquire riches for his family from adversarial regimes in China, shadowy companies in Eastern Europe, and elsewhere around the world.

The emails also reference the possibility that Joe Biden, who appears to be referred to as “the big guy” and other monikers, was personally aware of Hunter’s activities, and even took a cut of the money.

Almost immediately after the emails surfaced, countless legacy media outlets and Democrat surrogates suggested they were not authentic. Twitter and Facebook blocked the stories from getting out. They claimed this was not the work of terrific research and reporting, but a “Russian disinformation” campaign.

The New York Times published an article claiming that “United States intelligence analysts” had “picked up chatter that stolen Burisma emails would be leaked in the form of an ‘October surprise,’” claiming the Biden emails may have been the result of a previous hack of Burisma, a Ukraine-based gas company that gave Hunter Biden a seat on their board until he resigned in April 2019.

This was enough for the rest of the legacy media to run wild with the story. Countless publications cited The New York Times article in bolstering the claim that the Biden emails were part of a sophisticated Russian disinformation operation.

There is one major problem with this Russian hacking origin story. There’s no proof any of it ever happened.

On January 13, 2020, less than a month after the FBI took possession of Hunter Biden’s emails, The New York Times reported that Burisma was hacked by the Russians. The story was reported as fact, but there is no reported evidence for the story. Instead, it cites “security experts” — only a single, Democrat-tied security firm — in making the authoritative claim.

The article gets straight to the point. The first paragraph reads: “With President Trump facing an impeachment trial over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, Russian military hackers have been boring into the Ukrainian gas company at the center of the affair, according to security experts.”

“The attacks were very successful,” Oren Falkowitz, who was the source for the hacking claim, told The New York Times. Falkowitz, who openly disdains President Trump (check out his Twitter page), runs a company called Area 1 Security. He has provided business services to several Democrat contenders for president during the primaries.

Public records show Falkowitz donated to Democrat Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker during the primaries. A National Security Agency employee under the Bush and Obama administrations, Falkowitz founded Area 1 with a man who used to be a top executive at Crowdstrike, which authored the infamous report claiming the Democratic National Committee was hacked by the Russians in 2016.

The Times also quotes an unnamed “American security official,” who the “Paper of Record” says told them “the Russian attacks on Burisma appear to be running parallel to an effort by Russian spies in Ukraine to dig up information in the analog world that could embarrass the Bidens.”

As “evidence” that the GRU (a Russian military intelligence agency) hacked Burisma, The Times did not supply anything. Even The Washington Post did not report on the story as if it was verified. The Washington Post reached out to Fireye, another cybersecurity firm, which “could not validate” the claim that Burisma was breached by the GRU.

Area 1’s five-page report on the purported hack of Burisma does not deliver any verifiable information to conclude that the Russians hacked the organization. The report summarized that the supposed phishing attack involved “tactics, techniques and procedures” used by the GRU, and that was enough to identify this apparent intrusion as evidence that Russia was behind it.

Besides the fact that there is zero evidence for the hack, there are many reasons the story is incredibly sketchy. First, as noted above, The New York Times article was published just one month after the FBI reportedly seized the materials on Hunter Biden’s laptop, which occurred in December 2019.

Also, the timeline doesn’t add up. Hunter Biden resigned from the board of Burisma in April 2019, months before his former company was allegedly hacked.

Additionally, Burisma is not exactly an anti-Kremlin outfit. In fact, the shadowy energy company has several ties to Moscow. Burisma was founded by Mykola Zlochevsky, who was a top Ukrainian official under ex-president Viktor Yanukovych, who is widely considered a stooge for the Kremlin. Yanukovych has since fled to Moscow.

Burisma was a creation of Ukraine’s pro-Kremlin Viktor Yanukovych regime. Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia in February 2014. Burisma, under its Yanukovych-era leadership, appointed Hunter Biden to the board in April 2014. @JackPosobiec https://t.co/UgnR0xH8LX — J Michael Waller (@JMichaelWaller) October 18, 2020

The “Russian disinformation” angle concerning the Hunter Biden emails was sketched by The New York Times. It has absolutely zero supporting evidence and no basis in reality.

Biden Lied When He Said He Doesn’t Oppose Fracking. Here’s The Proof,"Democratic Presidential nominee Joe Biden falsely claimed he’s never opposed fracking during Thursday night’s final presidential debate.

“I never said I oppose fracking,” Biden said.

President Donald Trump, however, pushed him on the issue, saying that Biden “said it on tape.”

Despite Trump’s correct announcement, Biden continued to qualify his statements on fracking after moderator Kristen Welker asked the former vice president to clarify.

“I do rule out banning fracking because we need other industries to get ultimately to complete zero omissions by 2025,” he said.

Trump, however, continued to point out Biden’s fracking flip-flop.

“Excuse me — he was against fracking. He said it,” Trump pointed out. “I will show it to you tomorrow. Until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania. But you know what, Pennsylvania, he will be against it very soon because his party is against it.”

“Fracking on federal land I said. No fracking on federal land,” Biden continued, but his efforts to scrub his previous statements were made in vain.

Despite Biden and his vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris’s insistence that Biden never said he opposed fracking, Biden has repeatedly condemned fracking and the fossil fuels industry.

“We would work it out. We would make sure it’s eliminated,” Biden said about coal and fracking from the Democratic presidential debate stage just a few months ago.

Harris, a proud co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, which would ban fracking, has also been vocal about her position.

Biden’s opinions on fracking, as Trump noted during the debate, only recently changed on the campaign trail in Pittsburgh.

As Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler recently noted in an interview with The Federalist, Biden could claim that he’s against “banning” fracking and still deal serious harm to the oil and gas industry through massive regulations.

“I’ve heard him talking about fracking multiple times, and every time it seems a little different,” Wheeler said. “But you don’t have to ban something if you regulate it to death. And the Obama administration was regulating it to death.”

Hypocrisy On Biden Corruption Versus Spygate Proves Big Media Is Evil,"Big media’s divergent handling of the Steele dossier and the Hunter Biden email stories proves that the corrupt press is not just the enemy of the people, but the enemy of truth, freedom, and our constitutional republic.

For nearly four years, big media peddled Russia collusion as reality-based and the Christopher Steele “dossier” it rested upon as “mostly verified” or “fake but accurate.” Relying on unnamed sources, inuendo, and illegal leaks, the press played a constant refrain of Russia, Russia, Russia, while promising a smoking gun would soon emerge from Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation.

At the same time, when the Republican head of the House Intelligence Committee at the time, Devin Nunes, released a memorandum detailing the abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court as part of the Russia collusion “investigation,” the media portrayed the memo as resting on “shaky grounds” and designed solely to undermine the special counsel investigation, which itself was launched as a result of a leak from former FBI Director James Comey.

Conversely, when Democrats like Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., lied to the American public about Russia collusion, the media portrayed his assertions as infallible. Even Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s report on FISA abuse did not compel corporate media to change course.

To this day, the majority of Americans likely have no idea that “Spygate” actually occurred. Heck, just two months ago, CNN’s Jim Acosta displayed his ignorance of the facts, responding to Trump’s complaints that the Obama administration had spied on his campaign. “That is just not true. That did not happen, it has not been proven,” Acosta intoned on TV.

Yes, Jim, it has been proven true.

While U.S. Attorney John Durham’s investigation into the entire Russian collusion hoax remains ongoing, much more Democrat malfeasance has already been proven true as well. The average American might not know it, though, given the corrupt mainstream press’s penchant for putting a lid on news that proves Trump was right.

When news broke that Steele’s primary sub-source had been investigated for being a Russian agent, there was scant mention of the development, even though it suggested the Steele dossier Democrats used might have been Russian disinformation. CIA Director John Brennan briefed then-President Obama on Russian intelligence claiming that on July 28, 2016, Hillary Clinton approved vilifying Trump by claiming Russian interference in the election. That major story was likewise a news blip in the election-year cycle.

In short, corporate media ignored, downplayed, or spun the biggest, most widespread political scandal in our country’s history, involving the Obama-Biden administration’s spying on a political enemy, with Russian-provided fake intelligence bought and paid for by Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.

Now, big media is ignoring, downplaying, or spinning evidence suggesting the second biggest political-corruption scandal in our country’s history. They are ignoring evidence that former Vice President Biden knowingly helped his son Hunter, and Hunter’s “business” partners, sell access and influence to foreign officials and businesses, and possibly received a kick-back of the payouts.

The evidence of the Bidens’ corruption comes not from unverified and unnamed sources, but from emails and texts recovered from a laptop left at a Delaware computer store, and emails provided by Hunter’s former business partner. The corporate press, however, pretends those emails and texts can’t be relied upon because they haven’t personally verified them. But others have. In addition, salacious videos and photographs of Hunter Biden have been recovered from the laptop, providing excellent evidence of its authenticity.

Hunter and Joe Biden also have not disputed the emails’ validity—something very easy to do. Secret Service records have also corroborated many of the travel details included in the emails.

While the evidence overwhelmingly confirms the authenticity of the emails and text messages, the fake news instead runs with intelligence official-rejected claims that the corruption scandal is Russian disinformation, pushed by none other than Russia-collusion clown Schiff! Not only is there no evidence the emails and text messages are “Russian disinformation,” Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe—who, unlike Schiff, has access to the actual intelligence—has stated unequivocally that “the laptop is not part of a Russian disinformation campaign targeting Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.” FBI and Justice Department officials have also reportedly agreed with Ratcliffe’s assessment.

If the emails are authentic, as all the evidence to date indicates, then they cannot possibly be Russian disinformation. They must be truth. And that truth indicates corruption that pierces to the heart of our democratic republic: elected officials selling access to government decisionmakers to benefit their families and themselves.

While Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed to the public that he has never “discussed his son Hunter’s overseas business activity with Hunter ‘or with anyone else,’” emails indicate Hunter introduced his then-vice president father to a senior adviser to the Ukrainian company Burisma. At that very time, Burisma, which was under investigation in Ukraine for corruption, “was showering Hunter with upwards of $50,000 a month in excess compensation.”

The elder Biden also later bragged about causing Ukraine to fire the prosecutor investigating corruption at Burisma by threatening to withhold a billion dollars in loans unless he was axed. “Well, son of a b-tch. (Laughter.) He got fired,” Biden postscripted the incident at a public event.

The hard drive evidence goes even further, suggesting Hunter may have even served as the bag man for the political family: “A text recovered from the hard drive also suggests the former vice president may have received a cut of Hunter’s ‘earnings.’ ‘I Hope you all cal do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family Fro 30 years,’” a screenshot of a text from January 2019 to Hunter’s daughter read. “It’s really hard. But don’t worry unlike Pop I won’t make you give me half your salary.”

Other emails indicate Ukraine was not the only target of the family shakedown. “Subsequent reporting from the Post confirmed by Fox News later revealed that Chinese businessmen with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party were offering Hunter Biden $10 million a year for ‘introductions alone.’” Again, a Hunter email indicates Joe Biden was to receive a share of the proceeds—here a 10 percent cut of the compensation package.

The evidence that Democratic presidential candidate Biden was complicit in his son’s pay-to-play scheme is solid, and the email and texts indicating the long-time politician received a cut of the proceeds even more damning. But corporate media doesn’t care. Biden is a means for them to dump Trump.

Ignoring this story goes beyond protecting corrupt politicians. Should Joe Biden win the election, U.S. national security is gravely at risk because he is clearly compromised. “Every country, every foreign politician or political faction, and every corrupt oligarch or business that paid for access has the emails, notes, receipts, itineraries, fund transfers, and maybe even photographs or recordings,” which is a fatal lever over our potential commander-in-chief.

If he becomes president, Joe Biden’s apparent corruption puts America and Americans at serious risk. If that happens, the fault will not merely lay at his feet, but at the door of every “journalist” who ignored the evidence to avoid a repeat of 2016’s election results.

Here’s Everything You Need To Know About Joe Biden’s Latest Scandals,"Former Vice President Joe Biden will take the debate stage for the final time tonight as new questions about his son’s overseas business ventures upend the Democratic nominee’s campaign less than two weeks before election day.

Last week, the New York Post began running a series of exposés expanding the public scope of Biden family corruption based on material from a laptop retrieved from a Delaware repair shop. The computer, suspected of belonging to Hunter Biden, was first found by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who then turned its contents over to the authorities and the Post.

Days later, the diligent reporters at the Post began publishing its contents. They broke the internet with earthshattering revelations and not only blew back the curtain on the Biden family’s corruption but also exposed Big Tech and mass media pushing everything in their power to prevent the “October surprise” from undermining their preferred presidential candidate’s campaign.

Here’s everything you need to know about the bombshells altering the dynamics of an already contentious race two weeks out.

Ukraine

Questions about the former vice president’s son’s overseas business activity had been present for years but attracted wider attention over last fall’s sham impeachment when Democrats went nuclear to protect their presidential frontrunner from close scrutiny. The Democratic witch trial ultimately backfired with Republicans emerging triumphantly from the partisan proceedings, during which important information emerged that pivoted the focus back on Biden.

In 2014, Hunter Biden was added to the board of Burisma, a notoriously corrupt Ukrainian energy firm that shelled out upwards of $50,000 a month to the vice president’s son despite his lack of any prior experience in the industry. At that time, Joe Biden was serving as the “public face” of White House policy towards Ukraine. Less than a year later, Joe Biden pressured for the firing of Ukrainian Prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who had plans to investigate Hunter Biden and the firm showering the younger Biden in excess compensation.

Joe Biden went on to brag about the role he played in Shokin’s ousting during a 2018 event with the publication Foreign Affairs. Biden said he threatened to withhold $1 billion in loans to the Ukrainian government if they did not fire the prosecutor looking into Burisma.

“I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in’ — I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,'” Biden recalled telling the Ukrainian president at the time. “Well son of a b-tch, he got fired.”

In September, Senate investigators released a long-anticipated report wrapping up a more than three-year investigation into the Biden family’s conflicts of interest while in the upper echelons of government. The Senate’s findings include an alleged $7 million bribe that Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky paid to Ukrainian officials to shut down an investigation of the firm following Hunter Biden’s hiring. The payment set off red flags in the State Department and the Justice Department, which referred it to the FBI.

U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, the State Department’s top official in Ukraine, had previously told lawmakers he learned of Hunter Biden’s lucrative board position around the same time and raised his discomfort over the conflict of interest with the vice president’s office. Kent reported he was dismissed by White House staff.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent told House members during a private deposition last year. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time… That was the end of that conversation.”

Since jumping into the presidential race last year, former Vice President Biden has vehemently denied ever discussing his son’s overseas business ventures with his son, “or with anyone else,” and even fat-shamed an Iowa voter pressing him on the issue during a December town hall.

Less than three weeks before the general election 10 months later, the New York Post dropped its first bombshell report on Oct. 14 revealing emails that contradict Joe Biden’s repeated denials of discussing his son’s business. The emails show that Hunter Biden introduced his vice president father to a Burisma senior adviser named Vadym Pozharski and the three had an in-person meeting.

“Thank you for inviting me to DC and giving me an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together,” Pozharskyi wrote in an email to Hunter.

Yet throughout the entire election, the former vice president maintained, “I don’t discuss business with my son.”

Hunter Biden’s business in Ukraine, however, only tells half the developing story of the Biden family’s apparent pay-to-play dealings.

China

Hunter Biden’s 2013 trip to China aboard Air Force Two with his vice president father has also long been an area of suspicion about Biden’s overseas business dealings.

It was in Beijing that Hunter Biden participated in a series of meetings with Chinese businessmen building a global private equity firm. What happened shortly after the trip raised more questions about the purpose of Hunter Biden’s presence on the government-sponsored trip, during which Shanghai authorities approved a Chinese business license for the firm known as BHR.

Hunter Biden served as one of BHR’s nine directors. A Wall Street Journal analysis shows the firm channeled at least $2.5 billion into automotive, energy, mining, and technology deals on behalf of its investors, prioritizing overseas projects. One of those projects included a joint acquisition of the Michigan motor company Henniges in 2015, marking “the biggest Chinese investment into U.S. automotive manufacturing assets to date.”

One of Hunter Biden’s Chinese business partners came to include Ye Jianming, the founder of CEFC China Energy Co. Ltd (CEFC), which went bankrupt earlier this year. Senate investigators revealed in their September report that Ye held “significant connections” to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and previous affiliations with the People’s Liberation Party. The Senate report also revealed that Ye engaged in financial transactions with Joe Biden’s brother, James Biden, expanding the Biden family’s web of conflicting interests.

According to Senate, Ye and his associate Gongwen Dong provided Hunter Biden, James Biden, and James’ wife Sara Biden a $100,000 shopping spree that included extravagant items ranging from airplane tickets to Apple products. The transaction was flagged as potential criminal activity.

Reporting from the New York Post last week offered greater insight into the details of Ye and Hunter Biden’s working relationship. A second round of emails published by the Post on Oct. 15 shows Ye was offering Hunter Biden $10 million a year for “introductions alone.” Fox News confirmed the authenticity of the Post’s emails highlighting the lucrative offer, adding that sources with intimate knowledge of the potential contract said Joe Biden was slated to be dealt 10 percent of the cut funneled through Hunter.

Big Media Attempt to Delegitimize Blockbuster Revelations

While any new minor detail in President Donald Trump’s many media-manufactured scandals would immediately make front-page news and spike to the top trending subjects across online platforms, fresh reporting on the Biden family’s corruption scandals have been banned by social media, ignored by legacy outlets, and dismissed as right-wing conspiracies. This is the same media that exhaustively amplified every minor detail in the never-ending Russia hoax accusing Trump of being a Kremlin agent with an unverified and later debunked “dossier” that turned out to be Democrat-funded opposition research infected by Russian disinformation.

The Post’s blockbuster reporting on Hunter Biden’s apparent emails was immediately subjected to online censorship from Facebook and Twitter weaponizing their monopoly power over the 21st-century public square to suppress compromising information on their favored presidential candidate.

Twitter blocked the URL linking to the Post’s stories entirely and locked one of the nation’s oldest papers out of its own account. The social media giant responded to the wave of criticism that ensued by claiming the Post’s story violated the company’s rules on hacked content, a standard apparently selectively applied to stories it doesn’t like. Here are 11 other hacks, leaks and hoaxes outlined by Federalist Executive Editor Joy Pullmann that Twitter and Facebook didn’t censor because they hurt Trump.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey apologized for the company’s PR disaster. Twitter then proceeded to censor the Post’s second major story the very next day that exposed Hunter Biden’s lucrative Chinese deals. As of Thursday morning, the Twitter account for the paper founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1801 remained suspended.

This CCP rep has access to his Twitter account, however, the @nypost has been locked out of ours for 8 days. https://t.co/kfq1zRhefg — Emma-Jo Morris (@EmmaJoNYC) October 22, 2020

Facebook cited a similarly weak excuse to preemptively censor the New York Post’s reporting, claiming that before it could be shared, it first needed to face the company’s third-party fact-checkers in a decision announced by Facebook spokesperson and former Democratic staffer Andy Stone.

Holy bleeping bleep. Facebook explicitly admitting it is protecting Biden — and interfering in the presidential election — by censoring media outlets and limiting discussion of today's breaking news about Biden's engagement with Burisma. https://t.co/nF07qqyc5J — Mollie (@MZHemingway) October 14, 2020

The Biden campaign hasn’t disputed the authenticity of the laptop’s emails.

The New York Post story dropped eight days ago. The Biden campaign has still not disputed a single fact in the story. — David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) October 22, 2020

Giuliani told the New York Times he gave the laptop information to the Post instead of another outlet because others “would spend all the time they could to try to contradict it before they put it out.”

He was right of course. The New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN completely ignored the story for hours after it was published. ABC, CBS, and NBC combined dedicated less than 15 minutes to the stories over 51 total hours of news programming. Former Clinton White House Communications Director George Stephanopoulos refused to ask Joe Biden a single question about the Post’s bombshell revelations in last week’s prime time town hall.

When Biden did field a question about the scandals plaguing his campaign in the final days to the election, the former vice president became combative and attacked the press.

I asked Joe Biden: What is your response to the NYPost story about your son, sir? He called it a “smear campaign” and then went after me. “I know you’d ask it. I have no response, it’s another smear campaign, right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask.” pic.twitter.com/Eo6VD4TqxD — Bo Erickson CBS (@BoKnowsNews) October 17, 2020

Over the weekend, reporters were back to tossing softball questions, such as asking the Democratic candidate what kind of ice cream he bought.

On Monday, Biden called a 72-hour lid, or temporary cessation of campaigning, to avoid taking any more questions.

When the mainstream media did cover the Biden scandals, it attempted to delegitimize the New York Post’s reporting as taking the bait of a Russian operation to interfere in the upcoming election, a play by Democrats desperate to derail the Senate investigation into Biden earlier this year.

“A tabloid got a trove of data on Hunter Biden from Rudy Giuliani. Now the FBI is probing a possible disinformation campaign,” headlined USA Today.

“Is the Trump Campaign Colluding with Russia Again?” titled an op-ed in The New York Times.

“We know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on CNN. Top intelligence officials quickly said that statement is false.

“nothing to see here. move along.” pic.twitter.com/FGYj4NEqxh — Logan Hall (@loganclarkhall) October 14, 2020

Claims that content found on Hunter Biden’s laptop stem from a Russian interference operation were promptly debunked by the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Department of National Intelligence, and the Department of State.

“Let me be clear,” DNI Director John Ratcliffe said on Monday during an appearance on Fox Business. “The intelligence community doesn’t believe that because there is no intelligence that supports that.”

It's almost like Adam Schiff, the Dems & the media are all repeating false propaganda about ""Russian disinfo"" w/ ZERO EVIDENCE, to hide Joe Biden's corruption from the American people. “Hunter Biden’s laptop is NOT part of some Russian disinformation campaign.” – @DNI_Ratcliffe pic.twitter.com/BTuDo5uQC9 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 19, 2020

Secret Service records released by Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin Tuesday night also corroborated travel details outlined in the emails reported by the New York Post.

On Wednesday, Fox News reported that the Justice Department seized Hunter Biden’s laptop as part of a federal investigation into money laundering.

Biden Associate Confirms Joe Biden Stood To Rake In Millions From China,"One of Hunter Biden’s business partners has come forward to corroborate the legitimacy of new reporting that shows former Vice President Joe Biden stood to rake in millions from Chinese businessmen through his son Hunter serving as the conduit.

In a statement emailed to The Federalist and other news organizations, Tony Bobulinski, a former Biden partner, confirmed he was a recipient of an email published by the New York Post last week, dated May 13, 2017, showing Hunter Biden was offered a contract worth $3 million a year for “introductions alone.” The same email included an obscure note to setting aside 10 percent for “the big guy,” which Fox News reported was a reference for Joe Biden which has now been corroborated by Bobulinski.

https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/1319264716636753920?s=20

“Hunter Biden called his dad ‘the Big Guy’ or ‘my Chairman,’ and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing,” wrote Bobulinsky, who was recruited to serve as the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings in partnership with the Chinese firm CEFC led by Ye Jianming by Hunter Biden.

Statement from Hunter Biden associate Lt. Tony Bobulinsky obtained by @FDRLST: “I’ve seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I’ve seen firsthand that that’s not true.” pic.twitter.com/6Ms24AA8KX — Tristan Justice (@JusticeTristan) October 22, 2020

A Senate report released last month revealed Ye and his associates held extensive ties with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Bobulinski also confirmed earlier New York Post reporting that Joe Biden had been lying when the Democratic candidate repeatedly denied having discussed business with his son, “or with anyone else.” Joe Biden even went as far as to fat-shame an Iowa voter for pressing the former vice president on the apparent conflicts of interest during a December town hall.

“I’ve seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business,” Bobulinski wrote. “I’ve seen firsthand that that’s not true, because it wasn’t just Hunter’s business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line.”

Bobulinski continued, saying the Chinese were interested less in healthy financial returns on investment than they were “political or influence investment.”

Bobulinski said he had been contacted by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Finance Committee Wednesday afternoon and intends to produce the requested documents “in the immediate future.”

The statement comes as Democrats, Big Tech and mass media attempt to dismiss and delegitimize the bombshell revelations based on content found on a laptop threatening to undermine the Biden campaign less than two weeks until election day.

While Biden allies have charged that the laptop recovered from a Delaware repair shop is Russian disinformation, theories of Russian election interference surrounding the computer have been debunked by the Department of National Intelligence, the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the FBI.

"If The Debate Moderator Won’t Ask Biden Tough Questions, Trump Should","Heading into the second and final presidential debate tonight, with less than two weeks until Election Day, voters deserve some straight answers from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. And if debate moderator Kristen Welker of NBC News won’t ask Biden the tough questions — and we all know she won’t — then President Trump should.

First and foremost, Trump should ask Biden about the trove of emails uncovered last week by the New York Post. Earlier this week, Trump’s campaign said that if the media didn’t ask Biden about this, Trump would, “and there will be no escape for Biden.”

The emails expose a massive foreign corruption scheme, showing how the younger Biden was profiting off his family name in a series of overseas business deals that appear to have involved his father. The elder Biden has so far refused to answer any questions about the substance of those emails, instead angrily attacking anyone who brings up the Post’s reporting and claiming it’s all part of a “smear campaign” against him and his family. Last year Biden insisted, “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”

But now, that’s not good enough. Biden managed to get through a town hall last week without having to talk about the emails because no one asked him about it, but he shouldn’t get off so easy in Thursday’s debate. Trump might point out that Biden really should address the issue now, given that a Washington Examiner/YouGov poll out Wednesday found a plurality of voters say that Biden “has not been honest about his son Hunter’s business activities in foreign countries.”

If Biden’s telling the truth, that he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings, then it should be easy to answer a few simple questions and clear things up. Toward that end, Trump should ask him about a May 13, 2017, email, since corroborated by Fox News, that discusses “renumeration packages” for six people as part of a deal with a now-bankrupt Chinese energy firm. The email mentions an equity split, referencing “20” for “H” and “10 held by H for the big guy?”

Obvious questions for Biden might be: Are you “the big guy” referenced in this email? Did your son ever discuss with you a deal with this Chinese energy firm? Did you ever receive payments from this deal your son made? How about for any other deals your son made?

Another important email uncovered in the Post’s reporting is from Vadym Pozharskyi, a top executive at the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, which reportedly paid Hunter Biden $50,000 a month to sit on its board despite his lack of experience or qualifications. The April 2015 email thanks Hunter for introducing Pozharskyi to then-Vice President Joe Biden.

At the time, Biden was the Obama administration’s point-man in Ukraine, and he later pressured the Ukrainian president to fire a prosecutor named Victor Shokin who was investigating Burisma and had just seized property from Burisma’s owner. In 2018, Biden bragged that he got Shokin fired by threatening to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee to Ukraine.

So, more obvious questions for Biden might be: did you ever meet Pozharskyi? What did you discuss? Who else was at the meeting?

The Biden campaign has since claimed that the official schedule of the then-vice president shows no such meeting, but that doesn’t mean an unofficial meeting didn’t take place. Voters deserve a straight answer directly from Biden on this point. Did he meet with Pozharskyi or not? If so, how could it be true that the former vice president never spoke to his son about overseas business dealings?

This is important because an earlier email, also uncovered by the Post, shows Pozharskyi asking Hunter Biden for “advice on how you could use your influence” on Burisma’s behalf.

We all know that Hunter Biden’s career is based on him being Joe Biden’s son and having access to his father. He admitted as much in that ABC News interview with Amy Robach last year, saying, “It is impossible for me to be on any of the boards that I just mentioned without saying that I’m the son of the vice president of the United States.”

So maybe Trump could skip all the aforementioned questions and simply ask Biden: How do you think your son makes money?

Will Biden Pack the Supreme Court?

The Hunter Biden emails aren’t the only subject about which voters need answers from Biden. Trump should also demand that Biden give a clear answer about his position on packing the Supreme Court. Biden’s ongoing refusal to answer this is unacceptable. Earlier this month, he said he would wait until after the Nov. 3 election to state his position, then last week lamely said during a town hall that his response will depend on whether Senate Republicans “rush” the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett.

Sorry, that doesn’t cut it. The future of the Supreme Court is a major issue for some voters on the right and the left. They deserve to know Biden’s plans. It’s like saying you’ll reveal your tax plan or your immigration plan after you get elected. That’s not how it works, and Biden knows it.

The question itself is simple enough: Do you support adding additional justices to the Supreme Court? The answer should also be simple: “yes” or “no.” Biden’s mealy-mouthed response at the town hall, “I’m open to considering what happens,” is a non-answer and Trump shouldn’t let him get away with it.

In the past, Biden has suggested he opposes court-packing, but recently he’s been dodging the question, acting as if his position on an issue that’s vitally important to millions of American voters is somehow a “distraction.” It’s not a distraction. Given the growing importance, rightly or wrongly, of Supreme Court decisions to the lives of ordinary Americans, voters need to know whether the Democratic presidential nominee supports turning the court into a partisan institution by packing it with justices that will support Democratic schemes—many of which have not been realized because the Supreme Court is standing in the way, for now.

Trump shouldn’t let this go. If Biden again brings up the impending Barrett confirmation, Trump should interject: “Assuming Barrett is confirmed, which will happen in a few days, do you support court-packing? Yes or no.”

Can Anyone Get a Straight Answer Out of Biden?

Biden has made a big deal about claiming Trump has botched the coronavirus response, but he’s never been forced to give a clear answer on what, if anything, he’d have done differently. The only substantive thing Biden has said about his coronavirus “plan” that differs from what the Trump administration has done is that he would impose a “mask mandate.”

Okay, Biden, so besides your national mask mandate, exactly how would your federal coronavirus response plan differ from the Trump administration’s? Also, can you explain what you mean by a “mask mandate,” and how something like would be implemented and enforced at the federal level?

There are plenty of other questions Trump might ask that the moderator never will. Does Biden support Trump’s relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem? Would he undo it? Does he support the deals the Trump administration has brokered between Israel and its Arab neighbors? Would he continue that work or roll it back for the sake of reviving the Iran nuclear deal?

On and on we could go. The truth is, the reason so many questions remain unanswered by Biden is that the press won’t ask him anything substantive. So here we are, two weeks from a presidential election, relying on the sitting president to grill his opponent during a debate for answers to basic questions.

Joe Biden Finally Admitted He Wants To End The Oil Industry,"Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden admitted during Thursday night’s final presidential debate that he going to end the oil industry if elected president.

“Would you close down the oil industry?” President Donald Trump pressed just before their closing statements.

“I would transition from the oil industry, yes,” Biden replied.

When asked by debate moderator Kristen Welker to clarify his statement, Biden claimed that he wants to shut down the oil industry because it “pollutes significantly” and needs to be “replaced by renewable energy over time.”

“That’s a big statement,” Trump said, slamming Biden for his bold proclamation.

“That may be the biggest statement in terms of business,” Trump said “Basically what he is saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Ohio?”

Biden then criticized Trump for subsidizing the oil industry.

“I stopped giving the oil industry federal subsidies,” Biden said. “He won’t give federal subsidies to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry?”

“We actually do give solar and wind,” Trump said, correcting Biden.

Earlier in the debate, Biden lied about banning fracking, claiming that he has never opposed it.

“I do rule out banning fracking because we need other industries to get ultimately to complete zero omissions by 2025,” he said.

“Fracking on federal land I said. No fracking on federal land,” Biden continued, but his efforts to scrub his previous statements were made in vain.

Trump, however, fact-checked Biden on the debate stage over his comments

“Excuse me — he was against fracking. He said it,” Trump pointed out. “I will show it to you tomorrow. Until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania. But you know what, Pennsylvania, he will be against it very soon because his party is against it.”

Trump is correct. Despite Biden’s claims, both he and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris have expressed interest in banning fracking in the past.

As Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler recently noted in an interview with The Federalist, Biden could claim that he’s against “banning” fracking and still cause serious harm to the oil and gas industry through massive regulations.

“I’ve heard him talking about fracking multiple times, and every time it seems a little different,” Wheeler said. “But you don’t have to ban something if you regulate it to death. And the Obama administration was regulating it to death.”

GOP Senators Chasing People And Docs To Verify Hunter Biden Emails,"Former Hunter Biden business associate Tony Bobulinski will be interviewed Friday by U.S. Sens. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. The interview follows the release of “documents regarding his business arrangements with Hunter Biden and others” from Bobulinski to the senators and their committees.

Bobulinski recently confirmed to The Federalist and others the authenticity of one of the emails featured in The New York Post’s bombshell reporting showing Hunter used his father’s position as vice president to leverage financial gain for his family.

The email, dated May 13, 2017, shows an offer for a contract worth $3 million a year for Hunter based on “introductions alone.” The email also outlined a plan to set aside 10 percent for “the big guy,” which Fox News reported was a reference for Joe Biden. Bobulinski confirmed that fact as well.

In addition to Bobulinski’s documents and upcoming interview, Johnson and Grassley also sent letters to Hunter Biden, James Biden, James Gilliar, and Rob Walker, requesting “bank records, wire transfers, account balances, gifts, business transactions, travel records, and communications about transactions” associated with a number of people named in the Post’s reported scandal, including Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden.

The letters also request information about “transactions related to business in Romania, China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Czech Republic, or any other countries.”

“According to recent reports that published emails allegedly from Hunter Biden’s laptop, the Committees have identified you as an individual involved in one or more of these business arrangements or financial transactions with Mr. Biden,” the letters say.

According to both senators, aside from Bobulinski, none of the recipients of the letter have “produced responsive documents to the Chairmen.”

“As part of the committees’ efforts to validate the authenticity of recently publicly released emails involving the Biden family’s international financial entanglements, we sent letters to five individuals identified in the emails. Those letters were sent yesterday, and the deadline is October 23, 2020,” the chairmen stated. “So far, the committees have received a response only from Mr. Tony Bobulinski, who appears to be willing to fully cooperate with our investigation. In fact, Mr. Bobulinski has already agreed to appear for an informal interview by the committees tomorrow, Friday, October 23, 2020.”

Johnson and Grassley released a report in late September “that revealed millions of dollars in questionable financial transactions between Hunter Biden and his associates and foreign individuals, including the wife of the former mayor of Moscow and individuals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party.”

The report followed an investigation into “potential conflicts of interest” stemming from Hunter Biden’s involvement with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma during Joe Biden’s time as vice president handling Ukraine policy for the Obama administration.

Would Joe Biden Institute Systemic Racism In Our Legal System?,"The prospects for justice as the Founders envisioned it under a prospective Biden-Harris presidential administration are poor. On matters of race, in particular, the injustice the ticket is poised to sow could lead to untold damage to the country.

Candidate Joe Biden has repeatedly refused to definitively answer whether he would pack the Supreme Court — which would rubberstamp his radically left agenda. Running mate Kamala Harris had a tyrannical reign as California’s top cop. Neither of these bodes well for equal justice should the two win.

The threat is heightened given a recent report indicating that Biden is also considering at least three individuals for U.S. attorney general with checkered records on adherence to the rule of law: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who punctuated his disastrous, deadly, and dictatorial coronavirus response by threatening to banish Jews from their synagogues; former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who played a leading role in Spygate and was later fired for rank insubordination; and a former Georgia state Rep. Stacey Abrams, who explicitly embraces identity politics, and has yet to concede a legitimate election two years after her defeat.

No matter who a potential President Joe Biden would tap to head the Department of Justice, among their most consequential likely mandates will be implementing an “anti-racist” agenda that is likely to undermine the stated mission of the office and tear at the fabric of our society.

A little-noticed passage of the Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders Unity Agenda, released this summer, makes this clear. The Agenda’s Economic Unity Task Force Recommendations begins with a section titled “Racial Equity.” Its authors assert:

We need a comprehensive agenda for communities of color with ambition that matches the scale of the challenge and with recognition that race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities. We need proactive anti-discrimination detection and enforcement. On day one, we are committed to taking anti-racist actions for equity across our institutions, including in the areas of education, climate change, criminal justice, immigration, and health care, among others.

“Anti-racist” policy then would undoubtedly alter the justice system, with which each of these areas interacts. The 2020 Democrat Party Platform codifies this view with a similar language. In it, the party “recognize[s] that race-neutral policies are not sufficient to rectify race-based disparities. We will take a comprehensive approach to embed racial justice in every element of our governing agenda.”

Biden was ahead of the curve. Several weeks before the release of the Biden-Sanders Unity Agenda, which predated the party platform, he tweeted his plan for “Black America,” with a note that “Race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities.” The notion that disparities are race-based, and that race-neutral policies — that is, policies rooted in colorblindness — are insufficient to deal with such differences, emanates from anti-racism, which puts critical race theory on steroids.

By one definition, critical race theory “combines progressive political struggles for racial justice with critiques of the conventional legal and scholarly norms which are themselves viewed as part of the illegitimate hierarchies that need to be changed.” Critical race theorists consider the law a tool of white supremacy and privilege and therefore seek to remedy it by tailoring law to standards of racial and social justice.

Anti-racists take a wider view. Their leading exponents argue that America consists of two camps: So-called anti-racists, who accept the proposition that not just the law but all of America is systemically racist, that all inequities can be explained by the American system, and who therefore devote themselves to overturning the American system, and racists — everyone else.

In other words, this is a revolutionary ideology that seeks to foment an existential racial struggle leading to an “anti-racist” triumph. It manifested itself in the form of the foot soldiers flooding our streets this summer.

Ibram X. Kendi, the author of The New York Times bestselling “How to be an Antiracist” and putative leader of the anti-racist movement, reduces all differences in societal outcomes to race. In Kendi’s view, “there’s only two causes of racial inequity: either there’s something wrong with people, or there’s something wrong with power and policy.”

The Biden campaign seems to channel Kendi when it says “Race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities.” It explicitly calls for “anti-racist action” via the Biden-Sanders Unity Agenda. The question is, to what end? Kendi has an answer. He believes that discrimination is an acceptable policy for ensuring societal outcomes comport with a society’s racial makeup. He states:

The defining question is whether the discrimination is creating equity or inequity. If discrimination is creating equity, then it is antiracist. If discrimination is creating inequity, then it is racist. . . . The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.

Kendi calls for America to pass a constitutional amendment that “constitutionalize[s] the idea that a racial inequity is caused by a racist policy.” The amendment would establish a Department of Anti-Racism “comprised of formally trained experts on racism and no political appointees,” who would:

Preclear all local, state and federal public policies to ensure they won’t yield racial inequity, monitor those policies, investigate private racist policies when racial inequity surfaces, and monitor public officials for expressions of racist ideas. The DOA would be empowered with disciplinary tools to wield over and against policymakers and public officials who do not voluntarily change their racist policy and ideas.

Is this what the Biden-Sanders Unity Agenda drafters were referring to when they spoke of “proactive anti-discrimination detection and enforcement?”

As Coleman Hughes rightly concludes in his devastating review of “How to be an Antiracist,” Kendi’s amendment is “openly totalitarian.” While it would corrode the rule of law, violating the constitutional amendments along which it would reside, its practical consequences would be equally grave. It would unleash a Woke Gestapo on society.

It would pit peoples of different races against each other by explicitly privileging one over another based on skin color, rather than treating all individuals as equals in the eyes of the law. It would undermine liberty and justice for everyone.

Given that they have clearly been influenced by this kind of critical race theory, what do Biden and his staffers make of Kendi’s views? Are they willing to dutifully put the pseudo-philosophy they have embraced into practice? The answer is most likely yes.

Already, the Biden agenda supports de-policing black communities to the detriment of law-abiding black citizens, robbing blacks of prosperity through imposing all manner of anti-capitalist economic policies, and instituting an agenda that at core reflects a condescending paternalism towards blacks that is disempowering, demoralizing, and ultimately destructive.

In the first presidential debate, President Donald Trump was asked about his opposition to critical race theory. Fairness demands that candidate Biden be asked, similarly: “Will you support Kendi’s critical race theory amendment to the Constitution? If not, will you implement critical race policies, and what policies specifically will that consist of?”

If Americans still believe in equal rights for all, and special privileges for none — of justice blind to color and all else but the merits — then they must hear the former vice president’s answers to these questions.

Best Tweets Of The Last 2020 Presidential Debate,"Donald Trump and Joe Biden met last night in Nashville the final debate of the 2020 campaign. It was a tough timeslot, up against a Thursday Night Football game between two teams with a combined record of 2-9-1. If you couldn’t turn away from that riveting NFC East action, don’t worry: your pals at The Federalist gathered the best tweets of the night.

Get Busy Living Or Get Busy Dying

After the raucous first debate and the canceled second one, there was speculation that this one would go off the rails early.

I hope Trump rages so hard he won’t need the mic — Kassy Dillon (@KassyDillon) October 23, 2020

Instead, things were actually pretty calm.

Trump sounds like he practiced. — Andrew Yang🧢🇺🇸 (@AndrewYang) October 23, 2020

30 seconds in, and it’s obvious Trump is READY. — Kylee Zempel (@kyleezempel) October 23, 2020

Trump taking notes as Biden speaks instead of interrupting — Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) October 23, 2020

We started out with the same thing we always do in 2020: talking about the coronavirus.

Trump said he had a plan and the vaccines were around the corner.

Trump on COVID “I can tell you from personal experience” re what some say is a cure. Lemonade out of lemons! — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) October 23, 2020



Biden said Trump is personally responsible for every death, but that he’ll fix it.

Joe Biden asserts that if he is elected, he’ll push to make all Americans “wears masks all the time.” Yikes.#Debates2020 — Jeff Jacoby (@Jeff_Jacoby) October 23, 2020

It got kind of dark.

Biden predicts a “dark winter” of Covid. Trump says it won’t be. — Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) October 23, 2020

The contrast was noticeable.

Biden: “We’re about to go into a dark winter.”

Trump: “We’re opening up our country.” — Amie Parnes (@amieparnes) October 23, 2020

Joe Biden is now implying that President Trump barred visitors from China too late. Trump says, “Joe has a thing about living in a basement.” I bet there will still be lots of memorable moments even if there aren’t interruptions. — Kelly Jane Torrance (@KJTorrance) October 23, 2020

Trump: “Learn to live.” Biden: “Learn to die.” That’s the choice, nicely distilled by Joe Biden. I choose to learn to live. What about you? — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) October 23, 2020

But they actually let each other speak.

10 minutes without interruption!!! pic.twitter.com/PUPMyv058R — Evan Siegfried (@evansiegfried) October 23, 2020

Trump is way more disciplined than I think I’ve ever seen him and I am not sure I am comfortable with it. #Debates2020 — Joe Cunningham (@JoePCunningham) October 23, 2020

Did Trump just say “thank you, I appreciate that” to the moderator?! — Drew ‘Full, Fair and Contextual’ Holden (@DrewHolden360) October 23, 2020

Where has this guy been for the last 4 years? He’s even responding to attacks that would usually set him off calmly. it’s crazy he couldn’t do this before. — (((AG))) (@AGHamilton29) October 23, 2020



The China Trade

There was a bit of bickering as the conversation moved to foreign policy, but moderator Kristen Welker kept it moving.

Welker: hey, grandpas, can we talk about foreign policy? — Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) October 23, 2020

They both tried to sound tough on everyone.

Biden suggests Trump should be “more outspoken with the Iranians.” The man droned General Soleimani, which Biden was against. — Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) October 23, 2020

Sounds empty when Biden threatens Iran after Biden sent Iran pallets of cash.🤷♀️ — Liz Wheeler (@Liz_Wheeler) October 23, 2020

Biden still running with the “bounties in Afghanistan” story which has fewer on-the-record sources than the Hunter Biden story. — Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) October 23, 2020

Inexplicably, Biden brought up the story about his son’s missing laptop.

JOE BIDEN BROUGHT UP THE STORY FROM GIULIANI — Heather Champion ™️ (@winningatmylife) October 23, 2020

Biden says Rudy Giuliani is “being used as a Russian pawn.” — Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) October 23, 2020

Trump brings up the Hunter Biden emails. Now the media will HAVE to cover the issue. — Jeff Jacoby (@Jeff_Jacoby) October 23, 2020

Biden will not even concede that Hunter’s foreign business dealings do not even rise to the level of “unethical” — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) October 23, 2020

Joe Biden did not deny the contents of the emails, did not deny that he was “the big guy,” did not address the fact that his family made money from our adversaries which at the minimum creates the appearance of corruption and opens Joe Biden up to compromise. #Debates2020 — Benjamin Weingarten (@bhweingarten) October 23, 2020

Biden: “My son has not made money… from China.” Um, Hunter admitted to taking a 2.8-carat diamond from a Chinese executive: https://t.co/ePIL3FW031 — Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) October 23, 2020

Biden responded to the accusations (which he raised) by noting Trump’s years-long refusal to release his tax returns. Trump gave the usual run-around.

Trump has spent *5 years* saying he will release his tax returns soon… that day is never coming. — Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) October 23, 2020

They talked more about Red China.

Biden: “What I would do is make China play by the rules.” Sure, but HOW? — Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) October 23, 2020

Biden can’t remember Kim Jung Un’s name. — Courtney Shadegg (@CShadegg) October 23, 2020

He tried to pull the usual “I know regular people” lines that politicians love.

Trump openly mocks Biden for doing the “typical politician” thing of trying to change the subject from his family to the average kitchen-table family. This is Trump at, simultaneously, his best & worst, breaking the fourth wall on political conventions like the Kool-Aid man. — Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) October 23, 2020

Trump’s kinda got Biden on the pre-packaged middle class family line. #Debates2020 — Krystal Ball (@krystalball) October 23, 2020

Trump said it’s good to have good relations with other world leaders. Biden’s counterpoint: Hitler.

Trump: “Having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.”

Biden responded by saying something super dumb about Hitler. — Robby Soave (@robbysoave) October 23, 2020

Biden employs Godwin’s Law. It’s like Trump caught the golden snitch. Debate over. — Larry O’Connor (@LarryOConnor) October 23, 2020

If You Like Your Insurance, You Can Keep Your Insurance

We moved on to healthcare, where Biden not only promised that no one would lose their insurance under his plam, but also claimed no one lost it under Obamacare.

Uh, Joe; I lost my healthcare under Obamacare #Debates2020 — Mark Noonan (@Mark_E_Noonan) October 23, 2020

Joe Biden is lying. My family is one of millions that lost our health insurance because of Obamacare. — Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) October 23, 2020

He promised everything good about Obamacare, but none of the bad.

It’s Obamacare, but it’s not Obamacare. Got it. — Kai Ryssdal (@kairyssdal) October 23, 2020

It had a wildly original title.

“Bidencare” Yep, run with that, Joe. — Amy 🐘🦙 (@WaltzingMtilda) October 23, 2020

Do I have to let him sniff me if I get Biden Care? — Bridget Phetasy (@BridgetPhetasy) October 23, 2020

Biden Care is an assisted living community — Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) October 23, 2020



Biden’s plans for the rest of the economy were also announced.

Joe Biden is basically saying the federal government should bail out every entity in the United States. No matter how poorly run. — Kyle Smith (@rkylesmith) October 23, 2020

Joe thinks a minimum wage hike *helps* small business? — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) October 23, 2020

Watching Biden in this debate reminds me of watching England in the World Cup. It’s absolute agony. — Andrew Sullivan (@sullydish) October 23, 2020

Trump touted his own record and decried socialism.

With a quick detour into whether Joe Biden is actually from Scranton.

“Who Built The Cages, Joe?”

Welker asked Trump about illegal immigrant children who were separated from their parents. He talked about how Obama built the cages. It seemed like a tangent, but he wrong-footed Biden when the former VP refused to answer Trump’s question.

“Who built the cages, Joe?” — Jenna Ellis (@JennaEllisEsq) October 23, 2020

“Who built the cages, Joe?” might be the quote of the night. — jon gabriel (@exjon) October 23, 2020



Biden would not answer, but he did make some other big promises about illegal immigration.

Biden says in his first 100 days he will put a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants before Congress — Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) October 23, 2020



He also spoke in favor of the infamous “catch-and-release policy,” in which people arrested for illegal entry into the United States were released, as long as they really promised to come to court. Trump painted the plan as a naive failure.

Does Biden really want to claim that illegal immigrants reliably show up for hearings? Oof — Gregg Nunziata (@greggnunziata) October 23, 2020

The Next Abraham Lincoln

The usual race question arose in the final few minutes, with the usual results.

I don’t know why when a moderator brings up black American families 90 percent of the talk is about criminals. — Kyle Smith (@rkylesmith) October 23, 2020

Biden calls: The Proud Boys the “the poor boys.” I am a poor boy too, pah rump pum pum pum! — Spooky, Sapphic, Alison 🎃👻 🏳️🌈 (@RealAlisonPoole) October 23, 2020

No one:

Trump & Biden, discussing civil rights: pic.twitter.com/DnWgADWGrG — Madeline Fry Schultz (@madelineefry) October 23, 2020

Biden admits his 1994 Crime Bill, which had a disastrous impact on communities of color, was “a mistake.” Gee, thanks. And it is one you then didn’t correct for the next 26 years. And you want us to vote for you?! — pipermcq (@pipermcq) October 23, 2020



But probably Trump’s best moment of the night was when he reprised one of his greatest hits of 2016: as Biden promises to do this and that, Trump asks, “why in 47 years haven’t you done it already?”

Trump just hammering Biden on doing nothing for eight years. “You are all talk and no action.” — Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) October 23, 2020

Trump hit his stride with “why didn’t you get it done” but isn’t including his 35 years as a Senator and should have been hammering this all campaign. He hasn’t. — Stephen L. Miller (@redsteeze) October 23, 2020



Nothing Green Can Stay

There was an environment question, because reporters are interested in that, but it was crammed in at the end, because no one else is.

Why do we never talk about nuclear energy when we talk about environmental policy and climate change — Melissa Chen (@MsMelChen) October 23, 2020

If climate change is an existential threat, we should be willing to sacrifice to meet that threat. But Democrats will tell us that there is no cost and only economic growth in a green new deal. — Gregg Nunziata (@greggnunziata) October 23, 2020

Trump said Biden and the Green New Deal would make us live in houses with teeny tiny windows and that windmills would kill the birds.

Trump is anti birds running into windmills, but in favor of birds flying into large Windows. We need more bird polling. — Bob Timmermann (@bobtimmermann) October 23, 2020

They fought over whether Joe would ban fracking. (Biden has said he would ban fracking.)

Then Biden went even further: he’ll ban oil!

Biden almost got out of this exchange until Trump caught him & got him to say he was transitioning away from the oil industry. This is where Dem enviro policy slams into Biden’s old-timey blue collar guy ethos. — Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) October 23, 2020

Trump just got Biden to say he wants to end the oil industry. Wild. — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) October 23, 2020

Biden is going to turn Hunter over the FBI tomorrow to get the news off saying he’s ending the oil industry. — Stephen L. Miller (@redsteeze) October 23, 2020



The oil industry wasn’t ended, but the debate was. It…wasn’t terrible?

Bombshell Texts Show Effort To Hide Joe Biden's Involvement In Hunter's Business Deals,"Explosive texts from a Biden family business associate discuss how to conceal the involvement of former Vice President Joe Biden in a deal being planned with a Chinese Communist government-linked firm. Biden has repeatedly claimed that he knew nothing about any of Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.

“Don’t mention Joe being involved, it’s only when you are face to face,” reads a text from Hunter Biden’s business partner to another business associate. The two are discussing putting together a deal between SinoHawk, which was a Biden family company reportedly named in part for China and in part for Beau Biden’s favorite animal.

The text exchange is between James Gilliar, who is a business partner of Hunter Biden’s, and Tony Bobulinski, a retired Navy lieutenant, who was the CEO of SinoHawk.

Later in the 2017 exchange, they discuss Hunter’s role in a 2020 Joe Biden presidential campaign.

The texts are part of a massive tranche of messages, e-mails, and company documents that Bobulinski handed over to reporters in recent days. Bobulinski said on Thursday that he had handed over all of his records to Senate investigators as well as the FBI.

One e-mail details how different Biden family associates would benefit from the deal, including 20 percent for Hunter Biden, 10 percent for James Biden, and 10 percent to be held by Hunter Biden on behalf of “the big guy,” who Bobulinski says was Joe himself. Later contract documents eventually kept Hunter’s disclosed stake at 20 percent and bumped up the stake for James Biden–Joe Biden’s brother–to 20 percent despite James having little to do with the work involved in the deal. It is not known whether the 10 percent to be held for “the big guy” was provided to James Biden rather than Hunter Biden.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Biden claimed in September 2019 while campaigning in Iowa.

At a press conference on Thursday night, Bobulinski claimed he witnessed otherwise. The texts claim that Joe Biden met with Bobulinski in on the evening of May 2, 2017, to discuss ongoing deal discussions with the Chinese energy company.

A text from Bobulinski to Jim Biden reads, “Great to meet you and spend some time together, please thank Joe for his time, was great to talk thx Tony B”:

Contemporaneous media reporting in May of 2017 shows that Biden spoke at a large financial convention at the Beverly Hilton on May 3, the morning after he met with Hunter, James Biden, and Tony Bobulinski at the hotel.

Neither Joe Biden nor his campaign have specifically disputed the authenticity of underlying facts discussed in any of the texts, e-mails, and contracts disclosed by Bobulinski. Instead, the campaign has claimed, without evidence, that the Russians are responsible for Hunter Biden’s business partner and a Biden family insider releasing evidence of Joe Biden’s participation in Hunter’s overseas business dealings.

Earlier this week, the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said there was no evidence whatsoever that records released this week about Joe and Hunter Biden were the result of so-called Russian disinformation.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/23/dont-mention-joe-being-involved-bombshell-texts-show-effort-to-hide-joe-bidens-involvement-in-hunters-business-deals/,2020-10-23
Left Warns Biden: Stop Talking About A Fracking Ban,"Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden said he wants to ban fracking and the left is panicking.

While Biden has since denied ever claiming that he wants to ban fracking, saying at Thursday night’s third presidential debate, “I never said I oppose fracking,” the evidence is clear.

https://twitter.com/abigailmarone/status/1300515217730867200?s=20

In addition to completely denying his previous statements, Biden also boldly proclaimed that he would effectively end the oil industry.

“Would you close down the oil industry?” President Donald Trump pressed just before their closing statements.

“I would transition from the oil industry, yes,” Biden replied.

Biden’s unstable and ever-shifting stance on fossil fuels is taking an effect on his voters, especially those in key states such as Pennslyvania with large oil and gas industries, and it’s making the Democrats and their institutions nervous.

A poll signaling a “significant movement away from a fracking ban, support for which dropped seven points, from 46 percent before the debates to 39 percent after them” prompted the leftist publication The Nation to publish an article urging Biden to “stop talking about fracking.”

“While Data for Progress has observed that voters, in fact, support Biden’s plan for a massive investment in clean-energy jobs and do not believe Trump and Republicans’ Green New Deal smears, a key sticking point on the issue of fracking remains,” the article reads.

The article, clearly attempting to cover for Biden by excluding facts, also echoed the weak defenses promoted by the Biden Campaign, Democrats, and the mainstream media in claiming, “Biden and Harris have made it clear on multiple occasions that they would not ban fracking,” even though they have stated otherwise multiple times.

The mainstream media’s coverup of Biden’s comments also signals that his stance and delivery on fracking is a losing one.

While CNN presented what appeared to be an accurate fact-check on Biden’s flip-flop on fracking, the conclusion they reached was that Biden merely made “anti-fracking comments” during the Democratic primaries.

Instead of showing the countless other examples of Biden’s fracking contradictions, they instead tried to make an open and shut case of Biden’s comments, sweeping them under the rug with a half-hearted fact-check.

I don’t believe my eyes. @CNN actually fact-checked Biden’s stance on #fracking: ""Trump is correct. Biden did make anti-fracking comments during the Democratic primary in 2020. Trump was not lying."" pic.twitter.com/6F0JD53Qxe — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) October 23, 2020

Twitter also featured the issue on its moments page, citing the Biden Campaign’s clean up statement after Biden’s opposition to fracking resurfaced at the debate.

VP Nominee Kamala Harris also tried to defend Biden following the debate, claiming that Trump takes things out of context.

“Joe Biden is not going to ban fracking,” Harris said.

“What Joe was talking about was banning subsidies,” she added, ignoring her own anti-fossil fuel track record.

"The Press Is Desperate To Help Biden, Even If It Means A Media Blackout","It’s hard to imagine a media establishment more corrupt and insular than the American political press, which refuses to cover one of the biggest political stories of the 2020 presidential election unfolding just weeks before Election Day. Despite the best efforts of the corporate media and Big Tech, the story of Hunter Biden’s emails keeps getting out there, and with each passing day it gets worse for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

Of course, the story is not just about the younger Biden’s emails anymore. It’s about the extent of Joe Biden’s role in what can only be described as a massive foreign corruption scheme worth tens of millions of dollars.

On Thursday morning, news broke that one of Hunter Biden’s former business partners, Tony Bobulinski, whose name appears in the trove of emails uncovered by the New York Post last week, verified the authenticity of those emails, which include details about a lucrative deal in May 2017 with a Chinese energy firm that appears to have included the elder Biden as an equity partner.

If Joe Biden was accepting millions in influence payments from China, well, that’s the biggest story of the election cycle. Biden has repeatedly claimed that he never discussed business with his son. If the emails are authentic, as they now appear to be, then Biden has been lying. Indeed, according to Bobulinski, Hunter Biden frequently asked his father “for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing.”

You would think this would be the sort of thing a robust political press exists to cover, especially in the run-up to a national election. But instead, we have a near-total media blackout on the story—more than a blackout, in fact. Some major outlets are trying to justify ignoring the story, and in the process making their complicity and bias all the more apparent.

NPR indulged in a bit of Soviet-level propaganda on Thursday, devoting part of its weekly newsletter from the public editor to a tortured justification of why it’s not covering the Biden story. Kelly McBride first floats the debunked conspiracy theory that the Post’s story is really just Russian disinformation, then asserts without evidence that the provenance of the emails is “suspect,” then trash-talks the Post a little, then says the reason NPR listeners haven’t heard much about the Post’s reporting is that “the assertions don’t amount to much.”

She goes on to quote managing editor for news Terence Samuels on the matter: “We don’t want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories, and we don’t want to waste the listeners’ and readers’ time on stories that are just pure distractions. And quite frankly, that’s where we ended up, this was … a politically driven event and we decided to treat it that way.”

Bad timing for NPR that Bobulinski’s corroboration of the Post’s reporting appeared on the same day. But don’t expect a walk-back from the public editor, or any NPR editor, ever. And certainly don’t expect the news outlet to, you know, report any actual news about Joe Biden’s overseas business deals, no matter what other evidence comes to light.

How can I be so sure? Well, look at the other big media debacle that dropped Thursday. The Trump White House wisely decided to post footage from the president’s sit-down interview with Lesley Stahl of “60 Minutes” after the interview went off the rails.

First, Stahl interrupted Trump when he said Biden was in the middle of a scandal related to his family’s overseas business deals. “He’s not,” Stahl said. “He’s not. No.”

Then, when Trump said an even bigger scandal is the way the FBI spied on his campaign, Stahl claims, “There’s no real evidence of that,” and says, “This is ‘60 Minutes,’ and we can’t put on things that we can’t verify.”

President Trump says on 60 Minutes that ""they spied on my campaign and they got caught."" Lesley Stahl says ""There's no real evidence of that."" pic.twitter.com/oLJoXr5apo — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) October 22, 2020

Of course, Stahl knows as well as the rest of us do that not only did the FBI spy on Trump’s campaign, it used the Steele dossier, which was opposition research paid for by Hillary Clinton’s campaign, in order to get a FISA warrant to do so — and in the process lied to the FISA court about the dossier.

No wonder Trump seemed flabbergasted that Stahl would pretend there’s no “evidence” that the FBI spied on Trump’s campaign, and no wonder he cut the interview short.

What we’re witnessing right now should disturb every American. The news media has abandoned all pretext of covering the news. They are all-in for Joe Biden and will do anything and say anything to help him win — even if it means ignoring the biggest political story of the election, no matter how much more evidence of Biden’s corruption piles up between now and Election Day.

Media Ignore U.S. Intel To Call Biden Bombshells 'Russian Misinformation',"On Saturday, the Washington Post published a “perspective” calling on media to label Joe Biden’s scandals “foreign misinformation” even though top U.S. intelligence officials went on record days before to call that claim utterly false.

“We must treat the Hunter Biden leaks as if they were a foreign intelligence operation – even if they probably aren’t,” wrote Johns Hopkins University Professor Thomas Rid.

In the 12 days since the New York Post dropped its first blockbuster story exposing content from a Delaware computer suspected of belonging to Hunter Biden, that’s exactly what the media has done, with the help of Big Tech.

Immediately after the Post published its first in a series of exposés on the Biden laptop showing that Joe Biden had been lying about never discussing business with his son “or with anyone else,” Twitter and Facebook weaponized their monopoly over the digital public square to suppress the reporting. CNN, the Washington Post, and The New York Times, which would typically deploy their full resources to any minor revelation from the Trump White House without scrutiny, took hours to publish anything related to the Hunter Biden emails.

Any time legacy media drops a supposed ""bombshell"" on Trump, it immediately hits the front pages. Still waiting on NYT, WaPo, and CNN however to write anything on the @nypost's actual bombshell on Joe Biden lying about what he knew of his son's overseas business interests. pic.twitter.com/amcilH0cv0 — Tristan Justice (@JusticeTristan) October 14, 2020

ABC, CBS, and NBC gave the bombshell stories less than 15 minutes of coverage between the three networks out of 51 hours of news programming in the days after the news broke.

When the nation’s legacy outlets finally did offer the Biden scandals more attention, the coverage characterized the New York Post’s reporting as Russian disinformation.

US media outlets outside of right-wing sites were desperate not to report the Hunter emails and to block their reporters from doing so. So they just started printing that it was ""Russian disinformation,"" knowing there was no basis for that, until they could figure out what to do. — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 25, 2020

“A tabloid got a trove of data on Hunter Biden from Rudy Giuliani. Now the FBI is probing a possible disinformation campaign,” headlined USA Today.

“Is the Trump Campaign Colluding with Russia Again?” titled an op-ed by a New York Times columnist.

National Public Radio (NPR) was far more direct, telling readers outright that the taxpayer-funded outlet just wasn’t going to cover the Biden stories because its leftist editors believe it “doesn’t amount to much.”

Here’s a screenshot of what came up when independent journalist Matt Taibbi searched for information regarding Biden and Ukraine. Google results were littered with “fact-checks” from mainstream outlets as opposed to the exhaustive reporting offered to any of the other media-manufactured scandals to plague Trump in the last four years.

By early last week, the myth of Russian disinformation peddled by a media desperate to avoid compromising information on their preferred presidential candidate had been debunked by the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Department of National Intelligence, and the Department of State.

That hasn’t stopped legacy outlets, however, from denying even the potential that the reporting about the recovered Delaware laptop may possess legitimacy. The Biden campaign still has not refuted the authenticity of the content found on the laptop hard drive.

“It can’t be verified,” CBS’s Lesley Stahl told President Donald Trump during their interview for Sunday’s “60 Minutes,” which was preemptively released by the White House. “It can’t be verified.”

“What can’t be verified?” a justifiably confused Trump responded.

“The laptop!”

Days later, CNN’s Christiane Amanpour deployed the same strategy to dismiss the reporting on Biden’s laptop as Russian disinformation.

“Are you comfortable with the president of the United States being close to a person like Rudy Giuliani who says also that he is not bothered whether any of the information comes from Russian hacking?” Amanpour asked Republican National Committee spokeswoman Elizabeth Harrington.

“Are you comfortable that CNN used Russian disinformation from a Russian asset to leak it to subvert the peaceful transfer of power?” Harrington shot back. “That reporting on the [Steele] dossier – which was complete verified Russian disinformation – is it not? Is it not? … Everything that Democrats accuse us of doing is what they themselves did.”

Amanpour brushed off Harrington’s criticism, arguing it was the U.S. government making claims that Giuliani, who handed the Delaware computer over to the New York Post, had met with someone suspected of being a foreign asset.

“You know what also the United States government says?” Harrington said. “The FBI says this laptop is not Russian disinformation. So what are you talking about here? This laptop is real.”

Amanpour responded by claiming that reporting means ignoring on-the-record statements from all the nation’s top intelligence agencies to float unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.

“I’m a journalist, and a reporter and I follow the facts. And there has never been any issues in terms of corruption,” Amanpour said of the Biden family.

“How do you know that?” Harrington challenged.

“I’m talking about reporting, and any evidence,” Amanpour said.

When Harrington called on Amanpour and the rest of the media to start doing journalism by engaging in rigorous digging and verification, Amanpour scoffed.

“No! We’re not going to do your work for you.”

Tucker Carlson’s Entire Tuesday Night Show To Feature Interview Of Biden Whistleblower Tony Bobulinski,"Fox News’ Tucker Carlson will be dedicating his entire prime time program Tuesday night to a one-hour interview with Biden family whistleblower Tony Bobulinski.

Carlson announced the programming Monday afternoon.

Tony Bobulinski says he met with Joe Biden about China. The media have suppressed the story, but it’s real and it matters. Voters have a right to know the details. Bobulinski sits for an extended interview Tuesday night at 8p ET on #FoxNews — Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) October 26, 2020

The Federalist confirmed with sources familiar with the plans that Bobulinski, a retired Navy lieutenant and Biden associate, will be airing tapes of Biden operatives begging Bobulinski to remain quiet as former Vice President Joe Biden nears the finish line to the White House next week.

https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/1320817615682633728?s=20

Bobulinski first came forward last week with a public statement emailed to The Federalist and other outlets going on-the-record to corroborate incriminating claims to surface from the New York Post the week prior and the long-anticipated Senate report published in September on the Biden family’s potentially criminal business activity.

“Hunter Biden called his dad ‘the Big Guy’ or ‘my Chairman,’ and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing,” wrote Bobulinski, confirming that the identity of “the Big Guy’ in a May 17, 2017 email published in the New York Post is indeed a reference to Joe Biden. The same email showed Hunter Biden was being offered a $3 million a year contract from a Chinese businessman with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for “introductions alone,” and 10 percent was flagged to be set aside for “the Big Guy.”

On Friday, The Federalist published explosive text messages from a Biden business associate instructing Bobulinski to conceal Joe Biden’s involvement with deals related to the CCP-linked firm.

“Don’t mention Joe being involved, it’s only when you are face to face,” wrote James Gilliar.

Joe Biden had previously denied ever discussing business with his son, “or with anyone else,” during the tenure of the entire presidential campaign, including the primaries going as far as to even fat-shame an Iowa voter for bringing it up. Such claims had also been contradicted in the New York Post’s first tranche of reporting from a Delaware laptop suspected of belonging to Hunter Biden.

The FBI, which has also reportedly seized Hunter Biden’s laptop over the course of a federal money laundering investigation sought to interview Bobulinski last week.

Carlson’s program airs at 8 p.m. eastern on the Fox News Channel.

Biden Family Whistleblower: Joe Biden Is ‘Compromised’ By Communist China,"Biden family business partner-turned-whistleblower Tony Bobulinski told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson Tuesday night that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is “compromised” by communist China.

“If Joe Biden is elected president, which could very well happen,” Carlson said, “how does this constrain his ability to deal with China?”

“So I think Joe Biden and the Biden family is compromised,” Bobulinski said. “I just don’t see, given the history here and the facts, how Joe can’t be influenced in some manner based on the history that they have here with CEFC,” a Chinese energy company.

Bobulinski to #Tucker: ""So, I think Joe Biden and the Biden family are compromised. Obviously, I've referenced that I've held a Q clearance. You're briefed on a compromise and who you're able to talk with and deal and do business with…."" pic.twitter.com/DG7oXIndsF — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) October 28, 2020

Bobulinski’s comments came during a blockbuster interview in which Carlson dedicated the entire prime-time hour to Bobulinski outlining the Biden family’s conflicts of interest and potential criminal business activity.

The former Biden business partner, who was recruited by Hunter Biden to serve as the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings in partnership with the Chinese firm CEFC led by Ye Jianming, described in detail how Joe Biden was intimately involved with his son’s overseas business ventures raking in cash for the entire family.

Bobulinski first came forward last week with a public statement sent to The Federalist and other outlets offering on-the-record testimony to confirm incriminating claims surfacing from a Delaware laptop obtained by the New York Post and federal law enforcement. Bobulinski reiterated last week’s statements on Carlson’s program Tuesday night.

https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/1321245932890001411?s=20

“Hunter Biden called his dad ‘the Big Guy’ or ‘my Chairman,’ and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing,” wrote Bobulinski, substantiating that the identity of “the Big Guy” in a May 17, 2017, email published in the New York Post earlier this month is a reference to Joe Biden. The same email showed Hunter Biden was being offered a $3 million-a-year contract from a Ye who possessed deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party for “introductions alone,” where 10 percent was flagged to be set aside for “the Big Guy.”

On Friday, The Federalist published explosive text messages from a Biden business associate instructing Bobulinski to conceal Joe Biden’s involvement with deals related to the CCP-linked firm.

“Don’t mention Joe being involved, it’s only when you are face to face,” wrote James Gilliar.

This is maybe THE clip from this interview. Bobulinski to #Tucker: ""I remember looking at Jim Biden in saying how are you guys getting away with this? Like, aren't you concerned? And he looked at me and he laughed a little bit and said. 'plausible deniability.'"" pic.twitter.com/GMDL1JNZtB — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) October 28, 2020

Throughout the entire presidential campaign, Joe Biden has denied ever discussing business with his son, “or with anyone else,” and the former vice president even fat-shamed an Iowa voter for bringing it up. Such claims had also been contradicted in the New York Post’s first tranche of reporting from the laptop evidently belonging to Hunter Biden.

The FBI has also reportedly seized Hunter Biden’s laptop over the course of a federal money-laundering investigation and reportedly interviewed Bobulinski Friday.

Biden Whistleblower Tony Bobulinski: Joe Biden’s Claim That He Knew Nothing About Hunter Biden’s China Deals Is A ‘Blatant Lie’,"Tony Bobulinski, a former Naval officer and ex-Biden family business associate who provided documentation and testimony that the Biden family was deeply involved in foreign business dealings with China, said that former Vice President Joe Biden is lying about his knowledge of his son’s business deals.

“This is a company with direct connections to the communist government of China,” said Fox News’ Tucker Carlson during an interview with Bobulinski Tuesday. “So the former vice president has said he had no knowledge whatsoever of his son’s business dealings and was not involved in them at all? But this sounds like direct involvement.”

“That’s a blatant lie when he states that,” Bobulinski said. “It’s a blatant lie.”

Bobulinski joined Carlson on Fox News prime time to discuss his role in the Biden family’s potentially incriminating business affairs and explain why he decided to come forward to clear his name.

Despite Joe Biden’s denial that he had never discussed business with his son, “or with anyone else,” Bobulinski said the American people deserve to know that the Biden family was completely in on the deal.

“I believe the American people should see this fact,” Bobulinski said. “I would much prefer the Biden family go on record and define these facts for the American people and globe versus me sitting here having a discussion with you on it.”

Bobulinski expressed further frustration at Joe Biden’s public lying after the former associate attended the third and final presidential debate last week as a guest of President Donald Trump.

“In that debate, [Biden] made a specific statement around questions around this from the president, and I’ll be honest with you, I almost stood up and screamed ‘liar’ and walked out because I was shocked that after four days that they prepped for this that the Biden family is taking that position to the world,” Bobulinski said.

“Once again, I’m irrelevant in this discussion,” Bobulinski added. “I just was brought in to run this company and have been exposed to all of this fact.”

Bobulinski confirmed last week in a public statement emailed to The Federalist and other outlets the incriminating claims published by the New York Post. He also corroborated a Senate report published in September on the Biden family’s potentially criminal business activity.

“Hunter Biden called his dad ‘the Big Guy’ or ‘my Chairman,’ and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing,” wrote Bobulinski, substantiating that the identity of “the Big Guy’ in a May 17, 2017, email published in the New York Post is a reference to holding 10 percent for Joe Biden.

It was in this email that a Chinese businessman with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party offered Hunter Biden $3 million a year for “introductions alone.”

The Federalist also published text messages from a Biden business associate instructing Bobulinski to cover up Joe Biden’s involvement with deals related to the Chinese Communist Party-linked firm.

“Don’t mention Joe being involved, it’s only when you are face to face,” wrote James Gilliar.

Former Goldman Sachs VP Shells Out Big Bucks For Biden,"Former Goldman Sachs President Harvey Schwartz contributed $100,000 to one of Joe Biden’s joint fundraising committees three weeks ago.

Schwartz’s name appears on a Federal Election Commission filing for donations to the “Biden Action Fund,” which raises money for Biden’s campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and state parties.

Schwartz retired from Goldman Sachs in 2018 after being its president for approximately a year. Prior to that role, he was Goldman’s chief financial officer.

According to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, Schwartz’s contribution to the 2020 Democratic nominee this month was the biggest political donation he has ever made. This is also one of the largest donations to the “Biden Action Fund” during the first two weeks of October. Schwartz declined to comment to CNBC when asked about the six-figure investment.

The donation is the latest example of big money coming from Wall Street to support Biden. While Biden has tried to play himself off as the people’s candidate, it is clear he is really the one profiting off the securities and investment industry. People in the financial industry have given well more than $50 million to back Biden, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, compared with some $10 million for President Donald Trump.

CNBC reported that going into the final two weeks of the election, Biden, the DNC, and their joint fundraising committees had more than $330 million on hand, while Trump, the Republican National Committee, and their joint fundraising committees had more than $220 million.

During the last presidential debate, President Trump slammed Joe Biden after the former vice president appeared to suggest Trump had been in contact with stock traders seeking to profit off the market’s collapse in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

“You’re the one that takes all the money from Wall Street, I don’t take it,” Trump fired back at Biden. “As president, and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America — I would blow away every record, but I don’t want to do that, because it puts me in a bad position.”

Trump continued: “And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn’t be bringing up Wall Street, because you’re the one who takes money from Wall Street, not me.”

Indeed, Biden has taken far more donations from Wall Street than President Trump has. Yet the Democratic nominee continues to push a false narrative. During a CNN drive-in town hall last month Biden characterized his campaign as a righteous one for the working-class people of Scranton, Pennsylvania, against the affluent executives in Manhattan profiting off middle American labor.

Joe Biden characterizes his campaign as a campaign between Scranton and Park Avenue. ""All that Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street. All he thinks about is the stock market."" https://t.co/pV99Ho0FH1 #BidenTownHall pic.twitter.com/sGGWL5mv89 — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 18, 2020

Trump responded on Twitter, writing, “Joe Biden says this is a race between Scranton and Park Avenue. This is a race between Scranton and China. Joe Biden betrayed Scranton, and America, to China and foreign countries. I will always put America First!”

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1307091105188589574?s=20

It seems that in more ways than one, Trump’s tweet rings true. The recent bombshell New York Post articles exposed corruption in the Biden family when it was reported that Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, pursued business deals with one of China’s largest energy companies in an attempt to cash in “for me and my family.” One of Hunter Biden’s business partners even came forward last week to corroborate the legitimacy of new reporting that shows the former vice president stood to rake in millions from Chinese businessmen with his son as the conduit.

How The Biden Scandal Exposed The Corporate Press's Corruption,"It’s hard to read Anne Applebaum’s recent article on the Hunter Biden scandal at The Atlantic without guffawing at the outlandishness of her argument, which is that the whole thing amounts to a shadowy “psy-op” that’s too complicated to understand—a “miasma” conjured up by unreliable Fox News characters trying to create a “foggy world in which misdeeds might have taken place, and in which corruption might have happened.”

Applebaum’s approach is emblematic of the mainstream media’s collective refusal to cover the Hunter Biden story. She spends zero time discussing the actual facts that have come to light through the reporting of the New York Post and a handful of other news outlets, and instead opens her essay with a lengthy anecdote about herself that serves as an ad hominem attack on a reporter she dislikes.

We are meant to understand that this reporter, Matthew Tyrmand, is a creep, not a real journalist, and not to be trusted. For this reason, Applebaum tells us, you can ignore the trove of emails Tyrmand got from an erstwhile business partner of Hunter Biden’s that implicates former Vice President Joe Biden in foreign influence-peddling schemes similar to those uncovered by the Post.

The idea is to disparage the source of the information rather than grapple with what the information reveals. This of course has been the media’s posture toward the Post’s reporting from the outset: pay no mind to the laptop or the emails, uniformly referred to as “documents of questionable provenance,” because it all came from Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon, and they aren’t trustworthy. Real journalists, you see, only investigate and report on information that’s verified and trustworthy — you know, like the Steele dossier.

Hence Applebaum makes no mention of Tony Bobulinski, Hunter’s former business partner who came forward last week claiming he met with Joe Biden about China, that Biden is indeed “the big guy” referenced in an email about a proposed equity split in a deal with CEFC China Energy, a Shanghai-based conglomerate. She makes no mention of the text messages between Bobulinski and James Gilliar, another Hunter associate, that clearly show the deal was an influence-peddling scheme that relied on the Biden name. She makes no mention of a recent Senate report detailing millions in payments from CEFC to a company controlled by Hunter and James Biden, Joe’s brother.

All of this, writes Applebaum, is just noise. Smart people who “live outside the Fox News bubble” do not “need to learn any of this stuff” — it’s all just a vague conspiracy theory meant to rile up the unwashed rubes. Pay it no mind.

You might expect this from a writer whose latest book is about how she lost all her friends because they went crazy — a writer, that is, whose elite sense of European morality led her to the conclusion that Roger Scruton was a fascist for supporting Brexit but the arrest of Roman Polanski for raping a drugged 13-year-old was “outrageous.” Yet Applebaum’s aggressive incuriosity about the Hunter Biden story is typical of top writers and reporters at America’s most prestigious outlets.

As Matt Taibbi noted last week, the dogged refusal of the mainstream press to cover the story, together with Twitter and Facebook’s decision to block access to the Post’s reporting, might prove to be a bigger scandal than whatever Hunter and his dad were up to in China. Information about the Biden scandal has been so politicized, writes Taibbi, that American audiences can hardly look up anything about Hunter and China without running into “thickets of propagandistic contextualizing” — fact-checks and explainers and op-eds that keep readers away from what substantive reporting does exist, lest they come to their own conclusions about the Biden family business.

But suppression and distraction can only go so far, even when big media and big tech join forces. The longer the Hunter Biden story is out there, the more one can see a kind of psychosis developing in the American press. After weeks of insinuating, without evidence, that the Hunter Biden emails are just “Russian disinformation” and therefore not worthy of serious coverage, the media circulated a Reuters report on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin said there’s “nothing criminal” about Hunter Biden’s business deals. Apparently, if it comes straight from Putin’s mouth it can’t be disinformation.

The American people are not helpless rubes, and they smell a rat. For as much as big media and big tech are trying to control what audiences see and hear, for as much as they try to keep unwanted or counter-narrative information out of the public square, they can’t quite do it.

Twitter and Facebook’s efforts to suppress the Post’s reporting haven’t stopped the story from spreading. Other outlets, including The Federalist, have picked up the story despite the mainstream media’s ongoing refusal to touch it. Joe Biden felt the need to address the issue in last week’s presidential debate. On Tuesday, Tucker Carlson will devote his entire show — one of the most-watched cable news show in the country — to a lengthy interview with Bobulinksi.

One way or another, information about Hunter Biden’s shady foreign business deals, and Joe Biden’s role in them, is getting out there. That bell can’t be un-rung.

But what the facts eventually reveal is perhaps less consequential than what the media and big tech have already revealed by their reaction to the facts: they don’t care much for them, especially if they’re the wrong kind of facts from the wrong kind of people—the sort of people, dear reader, who might be able to pull the wool over your eyes, but would never fool someone as smart as Anne Applebaum.

Where Is Hunter Biden’s Money?,"Since the New York Post’s revelations that communication on Hunter Biden’s reported laptop detailed attempts to secure compensation from Ukrainian and Chinese energy firms, candidate Joe Biden has avoided commenting on the matter, other than labeling the story “another smear campaign.”

Despite Biden’s general protestation, his campaign has not denied the authenticity of the emails, nor of a text from Hunter in which he apparently expressed frustration at having to “pay for everything for this entire family for thirty years,” and telling his daughter, “It’s really hard, but don’t worry, unlike pop, I won’t make you give me half your salary.”

It’s not clear what these and other similar communications recovered from the laptop mean, and whether they implicate Joe Biden for certain, although a former business associate of Hunter Biden’s says they do. Regardless, emails from the laptop reveal Hunter has been quite busy working for the family.

One email from the laptop dated April 13, 2014, provides a glimpse into Hunter’s alleged world of foreign deal-making, using his father as leverage, as he negotiates a new agreement with the Ukrainian oil company Burisma that “should begin now — not after the upcoming visit of my guy,” and stating a requirement for “a retainer in the range of 25k p/m with additional fees where appropriate.” He also clarified that this would be in addition to compensation already agreed to for his board participation.

Another email dated May 13, 2017, contains a discussion of “remuneration packages” for a deal with CEFC China Energy Co. including equity splits of “20” for “H” and “10 held by H for the big guy?” — numbers representing percentage shares expected.

Later in August, Hunter Biden was apparently working another CEFC deal that was to pay him more than $10 million per year “for introductions alone.” According to the Hunter Biden business associate, Tony Bobulinski, “The big guy,” “my guy,” and “chairman” all were names that Hunter used for his father.

“Hunter Biden called his dad ‘the Big Guy’ or ‘my Chairman,’ and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing,” wrote Bobulinski, confirming that the identity of “the Big Guy” in a May 17, 2017 email published in the New York Post earlier this month is a reference to Joe Biden. The same email showed Hunter Biden was being offered a $3 million a year contract from a Ye who possesses deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party for “introductions alone” where 10 percent was flagged to be set aside for “the Big Guy.”

If this is true, it all adds up to a lot of money. While questions abound over what a guy with no experience in the energy sector did to earn such compensation — and how his influential father may have helped in that regard — another key question deserves an answer: “Where’s Hunter’s money?”

Truly, it’s a critical question as we fit the pieces of the puzzle together and seek to learn if any of it ended up in Joe Biden’s pocket. If Joe Biden did indeed receive money from his son, as these emails and texts suggest, then if it was handled according to legal technicalities, it must have flowed through his tax returns.

In the media buzz surrounding President Donald Trump’s tax returns, Joe Biden’s tax returns have largely escaped scrutiny. Joe Biden earned almost twice as much in 2017 as in the prior 19 years combined.

While former Vice President Biden did release his federal tax returns from 2016 to 2019, these are essentially shell documents with no detail regarding the majority of his income earned since leaving office. In total, $13.5 million of the Biden couple’s $17.0 million flowed to their tax returns via upstream S Corporations: CelticCapri Corp (his), and Giacoppa Corp (hers), with over 90 percent from his entity.

It was reported that their S Corporations were set up in the weeks after Joe Biden left office, to collect income from their book deal with Flatiron Books (a division of Macmillan), a contract that required two books from Joe Biden and one from his wife. Financial terms were not disclosed, but Joe Biden’s public financial disclosures do provide detail of $4.2 million of revenue from 53 book tours and speaking engagements over the period since his memoir, “Promise Me, Dad,” was published in late 2017.

While his financial disclosures reasonably support the $2.7 million of net income reported by CelticCapri in 2018, a notable $8.7 million gap exists between its $9.5 million net income in 2017 and the $809,709 of disclosed income in that year from book tour and related speaking events. Since his disclosure covers only part of 2017, we lack the insight into other income that may explain it.

For a book deal that Publisher’s Weekly estimated at $8 million, it’s possible Biden received a substantial advance from publisher Macmillan. Ultimately, his new book sold about 300,000 copies. His wife’s book sales reported 7,000 copies sold and an eye-popping $1.2 million of net income reported from Giacoppa. The commitment for the third book remains unfulfilled.

So, how much revenue came into CelticCapri in 2017, and how many expenses were paid to yield $9.5 million net income? Did sources flow through it that have not been disclosed?

Prior news reports rationalized the Bidens’ use of S Corps as a means of reducing their Social Security and Medicare taxes, a not uncommon tactic of taxpayers with substantial income from non-W-2 sources. At this time, however, we can’t determine if any foreign income was reported through CelticCapri. Its tax returns are protected by state and federal financial privacy and disclosure laws, which require the consent of the filer to be released.

We also don’t know how much income from foreign sources has flowed through Hunter Biden’s bank accounts. We do know some of the content of the emails on that laptop was verified by a recipient. We do have a statement from Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe that the emails are not the work of a foreign disinformation campaign.

Furthermore, multiple law enforcement sources recently confirmed that the FBI seized Hunter Biden’s laptop in late 2019 as part of a federal money-laundering investigation, although the agency declined to move forward reportedly based on how the material was obtained. As such, the need for the Department of Justice to take a look at his accounts and those of his associates becomes clear.

Tellingly, later in that aforementioned emailed from April 13, 2014, Hunter included a list of 22 bullet points for his business partner, Devon Archer, including, “Buy a cell phone from a 7/11 or CVS tmrw and ill do the same,” noting, “we need to have a plan on how we develop a corporate entity or LLP that allows us to draw on funds generated here to free us from existing (under-producing current commitments) and to build our own investment and expansion strategy.” Managing the flow of money can be difficult for those who feel the need to use “burner” phones.

Voters deserve to know if a candidate for the American presidency was involved in any of this. Will a media never shy in seeking to know what’s “hidden” in a president’s tax returns now demonstrate enough curiosity to ask a few questions of Joe Biden?

Voters deserve to know if Biden still stands by his statement that he “never discussed” his son’s business dealings. Voters deserve to know if he did or did not exert influence on behalf of foreign companies who paid his son. Voters deserve to know if Biden was aware of the amount of Hunter’s foreign earnings.

One question rises above all: “Where is Hunter’s money?”

"On Biden Corruption, Democrats Reap Consequences Of Gentle Primary","In a healthy Democratic Party, Joe Biden’s primary opponents would have cared about his family’s documented habit of trading on their powerful last name, almost certainly with the former vice president’s knowledge. People can disagree over the scale of the corruption, whether it reflects only on Hunter and James or on Joe as well, but it’s unequivocal that influence peddling has been a steady pursuit for the Bidens.

Even as the corporate media downplays recent revelations about Hunter, The New York Times reported new documents from Tony Bubulinski that “show that the countries that Hunter Biden, James Biden and their associates planned to target for deals overlapped with nations where Joe Biden had previously been involved as vice president.”

“The records make clear that Hunter Biden saw the family name as a valuable asset, angrily citing his ‘family’s brand’ as a reason he is valuable to the proposed venture,” the Times noted. That name trading seems to have been explicit in some cases, as even Ben Smith of the Times tweeted on Tuesday.

Here’s part of an NBC News report from last October:

[A]s he accompanied his father to China, Hunter Biden was forming a Chinese private equity fund that associates said at the time was planning to raise big money, including from China. Hunter Biden has acknowledged meeting with Jonathan Li, a Chinese banker and his partner in the fund during the trip, although his spokesman says it was a social visit. The Chinese business license that brought the new fund into existence was issued by Shanghai authorities 10 days after the trip, with Hunter Biden a member of the board.

Hunter Biden took Air Force Two to meet with a Chinese banker who also happened to be his business partner, and 10 days later their fund’s license was approved, but we’re supposed to believe it was a “social visit”? And we’re supposed to believe the veep had no clue his son was meeting with business partners on their trip to China?

Crucially, we know Joe Biden lied about his knowledge of Hunter’s overseas business. There is, unfortunately, even some evidence he received financial benefits from it. The lie alone is reason for suspicion.

The point is that Democrats were negligent not to press this issue during the primaries. The evidence had been clearly reported by The New York Times, NBC, and other major outlets.

We’re certainly learning more now about Hunter’s work in places like Ukraine and China, but his intent to make money off the Biden name in either country was known to Democrats and media while his father was running in the primary. Curiously, however, Biden’s opponents pretty much ignored the entire story. This is incredible given that merely demonstrating Biden’s knowledge of the dealings would have been damning.

It’s also incredible given that Biden was competing against a slate of staunch, allegedly anti-establishment progressives who decried the influence of money in politics. Meanwhile, the son of their opponent, who happened to be the former vice president, was caught selling access to his father’s administration, raking in hefty sums based on this perceived ability to influence policy for a fee. Beyond being a powerful campaign attack, the issue raises serious questions about Joe Biden’s commitment to ethical conduct.

But nobody wanted to touch it. The negligence was so glaring that even Ezra Klein wrote a story last October headlined, “Sorry, but Democrats need to talk about Hunter Biden.”

“Democrats are afraid to talk about Hunter Biden. Trump won’t be,” said the subheading. In the piece, Klein argued, “Biden’s vulnerability here needs to be tested in the primary, when Democrats have other choices, rather than in the general, when they won’t.”

The New York Times described the Democratic field as “Tiptoeing Around Hunter Biden,” listing the gentle rebukes and firm disinterest Joe’s opponents mustered. So why the silence?

Writing in CNBC last December, Jake Novak contended, “It’s not a mystery why the Democrats who supposedly want to defeat Joe Biden for the nomination are so quiet about all this. They clearly don’t want to be seen as advancing President Trump’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate the Hunter Biden deal.”

I think that’s correct. With the possibility that Biden would win the primary, the other candidates were also probably terrified of being cannibalized for damaging him beyond viability in the general election.

The result, however, is the second cycle in a row in which the Democratic Party has failed to use the primary process to vet its perceived frontrunner, which means it’s also the second cycle in a row in which Democrats have nominated an entrenched career politician weighed down by the baggage of corruption. This is exactly what happened in 2016, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) refused to really take off his gloves against Clinton, leaving the party ill-equipped for the general election.

As Klein predicted last year, Biden’s baggage hampers Democrats’ ability to knock the president over questions about his business too. As a self-styled enemy of the political establishment, Sanders alone should have torched Clinton and Biden over these issues.

It’s bad politics, sure. But it’s also an incredible disservice to voters, and this time it’s not merely the fault of the party’s establishment. Of course, finding a clean politician in a field of people vying for the presidency is like looking for a needle in a haystack. That’s still no excuse to leave the issue off the table.

I agree with Sen. Ted Cruz’s, R-Texas, assessment of the new email release. “I don’t think it moves a single voter,” he told Axios this week. I think that’s also probably true of Trump’s tax returns. On the right, voters’ cost-benefit-analysis is that any allegations of corruption against Trump are secondary to his policies and attitudes. On the left, honest voters admit allegations of corruption against Biden are secondary to his ability to oust Trump.

In a way, it’s fitting that Biden is running to “Build Back Better,” channeling nostalgia for the bipartisan glad-handing and smoke-filled backrooms of yore. If Democrats truly abhor the alleged corruption they’ve spent four years decrying, you’d think they might have shown a little more interest in following the money straight to Hunter.

Report: FBI Actively Investigating ‘Hunter Biden And His Associates’ For Money-Laundering,"The Department of Justice took the rare step to confirm the existence of an ongoing investigation Thursday, confirming to Sinclair that the FBI is still conducting a federal money-laundering probe into the Biden family.

EXCLUSIVE: A @TheJusticeDept official confirms that in 2019, the @FBI opened up a criminal investigation into ""Hunter Biden and his associates,"" focused on allegations of money-laundering, and that it remains open and active today. More very soon on your @WeAreSinclair stations. — James Rosen (@JamesRosenTV) October 29, 2020

Accoridng to Sinclair’s James Rose, a former Fox News correspondent, former Biden business associate-turned-whistleblower named Tony Bobulinski was interviewed by the FBI for five hours on Friday.

EXCLUSIVE: Tony Bobulinski tells @WeAreSinclair he was questioned by six @FBI agents, with counsel present, for five hours on October 23, listing him as a ""material witness"" in an ongoing investigation focused on Hunter Biden and his associates. His cell phones were examined. pic.twitter.com/5lPzRTREJN — James Rosen (@JamesRosenTV) October 29, 2020

The report comes the same week Bobulinski said Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was “compromised” by the Chinese Communist Party.

“I think Joe Biden and the Biden family is compromised,” Bobulinski said on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” after Carlson dedicated the entire prime-time hour to outlining the Biden family’s financial schemes of selling American political influence by leveraging Joe Biden’s name to take in foreign cash.

Bobulinski to #Tucker: ""So, I think Joe Biden and the Biden family are compromised. Obviously, I've referenced that I've held a Q clearance. You're briefed on a compromise and who you're able to talk with and deal and do business with…."" pic.twitter.com/DG7oXIndsF — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) October 28, 2020

While Joe Biden has vehemently denied discussing his son’s potentially criminal overseas business ventures with Hunter, “or with anyone else,” throughout the entire presidential campaign, Bobulinski went on record to corroborate New York Post reporting earlier this month, which included evidence contradicting the Democrat’s claims.

“That’s a blatant lie when he states that,” Bobulinski said. “It’s a blatant lie.”

Fox News previously confirmed with the FBI that the agency had opened an investigation that involved seizing Hunter Biden’s suspected laptop found abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop, which exposed incriminating details of the Biden family’s business activity. Whether the investigation had been ongoing, however, had remained an open question until Thursday.

The New York Post first began publishing a series of exposés based on the content found on the computer’s hard drive that included emails showing Hunter Biden was offered a $3 million-a-year contract with 10 percent set aside for “The Big Guy,” later found by Fox News and corroborated by Bobulinski to be referring to Joe Biden.

Joe Biden’s Greatest Legacy On China Is Selling It American Industry,"It is no secret that Donald Trump has taken a strident, pro-America approach to China since well before he was elected president. The contrast with his 2020 challenger, Joe Biden, couldn’t be more striking. In an interview with “60 Minutes” Sunday, Biden told correspondent Norah O’Donnell that China was merely our “biggest competitor” and not a current threat to the United States.

As President Barack Obama’s former “point man for China,” Biden has repeatedly downplayed the threats from the communist country. Arguably, his latest comments are a modest strengthening of his resolve toward China since last May, when on the campaign trail in Iowa City, Biden said China was “not competition” for the United States. In remarks widely criticized at the time, Biden panned Trump, saying, “China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. … I mean, you know, they’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They’re not competition for us.”

Did Hunter Facilitate the Sale of Sensitive Tech to China?

As Trump finishes his final campaign push in the Midwest, he is sure to repeat some version of the claim he’s made from the stage countless times: Biden spent his entire career selling jobs to China. From the stage in Michigan just this week, the president claimed Biden’s policies were “fueling the rise of China on the backs of Michigan workers.” Muddying the waters are the more recent revelations of how Biden’s disgraced son Hunter facilitated and continues to profit from the sale of a Michigan automotive company, with sensitive dual-use technology, to communist China.

The similarity of the Chinese J-31 fighter to the U.S. F-35, a multibillion-dollar integrated weapon system that builds on decades of U.S. air dominance, is not by accident. After the Chinese stole F-35 design data in the early days of the Obama administration, they knew what to build. It wasn’t until they acquired Henniges Automotive’s vibration dampening technology, however, that they knew how to build critical elements of it, thanks to the deal reportedly brokered by Hunter Biden that gave them control of the technology.

In the 1980s when the Soviet Union purloined the plans for the American F-15 and leveraged them into what would become the Su-27, it was considered espionage. When China did something similar under Obama’s watch, it was largely waved off as “just business” and a little friendly competition between global superpowers.

Did Joe Profit from Hunter’s China Business?

Joe Biden’s September 2019 claim that “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings” prompted skepticism among his opponents at the time, but the Biden camp has only doubled down on the claim since and with increasing resolve. As more and more of Hunter Biden’s business emails and other correspondence have been released, the skepticism appears to have been warranted, particularly with the disclosure of texts between Biden business associates clarifying the rules of dealing with the Bidens: “Don’t mention Joe being involved, it’s only when you are face to face.”

It remains to be seen if future disclosures from Hunter’s abandoned laptop will result in a “smoking gun” that implicates the former vice president in a scheme to abuse the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States’ (CFIUS) review process on behalf of Hunter’s Chinese business partners. While Hunter’s responsibilities clearly included shepherding the transaction through the government review process, it is likewise an open question whether Hunter used his influence and connections to sway the decision-making process related to Henniges Automotive on behalf of his own business venture and clients. It’s certainly a reasonable question given the known facts.

The Henniges deal is just the tip of the iceberg. When Trump accused the Obama-Biden administration of selling U.S. manufacturing to China, he wasn’t exaggerating.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States was created in 1988 and authorizes the president to review “any merger, acquisition, or takeover … by or with any foreign person which could result in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States.” The CFIUS review process is opaque and has mandatory confidentiality requirements to protect the private information of U.S. businesses, so it is difficult to determine exactly what types of transactions have been allowed, or if Hunter Biden and his associates facilitated any other transactions.

According to the U.S. Treasury’s reporting to Congress, however, the number of annual CFIUS-covered transactions “sustained [an] upward trend” during the Obama administration, with 942 covered transactions from 2009-2016. Nearly three-quarters were from the manufacturing or finance, information, and services sectors.

China was the “acquirer home county” with the most transactions during this period, and its shopping spree continued until 2017 when the Trump administration blocked the acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor. China’s number of transactions more than halved over the next two years under President Trump, with Japan finally taking the top spot starting in 2019.

Also interesting to note is that CFIUS only covers a voluntary review of transactions that would result in foreign control of a U.S. business. It wasn’t until Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rep. Rob Pittenger, R-NC, pushed through the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 that certain transactions had mandatory review. Additionally, a much broader list of review triggers was established, including non-controlling interest investments resulting in a foreign actor getting rights to or involvement in critical technologies, and greater clarifications on what type of technologies should be protected from transfer to foreign governments.

The Candidates’ Approaches to China Couldn’t Be Clearer

The Trump administration’s approach to China and implementation of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act represent another of the president’s significant and unheralded accomplishments and has significantly improved our ability to protect critical technologies. It is also a stark contrast to the view of China as friend and partner that has driven Biden’s approach to the nascent superpower.

On May 9, 2011, when China was actively committing espionage on a grand scale to steal U.S. military secrets about the F-35 and other systems, as Vice President Biden addressed the opening session of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, saying:

That’s why it’s so critically important we talk to one another honestly. We should be realistic; we won’t always be able to work together. In some areas we have vigorous disagreement. In some we’ll have vigorous competition. In still others we’ll have vigorous collaboration.

Vigorous collaboration? C’mon, man.

"No Matter Who Wins On Tuesday, There Will Be No ‘Return To Normalcy’","One of the animating ideas behind former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign is that a Biden presidency will be a “return to normalcy.” It is a pitch that relies not only on the assumption that the Trump era is not normal, but that President Trump has weakened our institutions and undermined norms, and that the cure for what ails America is a return to the halcyon days of Obama and Biden.

Most of that is pure fantasy, but the Biden campaign at least has this right: the Trump era is not normal. But the Trump era’s abnormality is not a passing thing, a clock that can be wound back. Trump’s presidency inaugurated a populist era on both the right and the left. It is the new normal, no matter who wins the White House.

In fact, a Biden administration would accelerate this change, and by comparison might even make the Trump presidency seem quiescent. Setting aside the impossibility of normalcy during a global pandemic, there is nothing normal about what Biden and the Democrats are proposing to do if they gain power.

Packing the U.S. Supreme Court is not normal. Creating new states as a way to pack the Senate is not normal. Abolishing the Electoral College is not normal. Establishing a South African-style “Truth and Reconciliation Commission” is not normal. Codifying Roe v. Wade into law and forcing taxpayers to pay for abortions is not normal. A ban on fracking—or, as Biden likes to put it, “transitioning out of fossil fuels”—is not normal. Passing any version of the Green New Deal is not normal. Raising the top income tax rate to a level not seen since the Carter administration is not normal.

These things are radical, and Democrats broadly support all of them. Biden has been disingenuously cagey about some of his plans, like whether he would try to pack the Supreme Court, but often he has been candid about going along with the leftward lurch of his party, like his abrupt about-face on taxpayer funding for abortions.

Part of Biden’s schtick has been to style himself a pragmatist and a moderate—a working-class Catholic kid from Scranton, Obama’s steady right-hand man, no malarkey! His defensiveness about the riots this summer is a case in point. In a speech back in August, after months of widespread rioting with hardly a peep from Democratic leaders, Biden said, “Do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters? Really?”

It was a weak attempt to hide the plain truth: Biden and Democrats were hesitant to criticize anything about the protests or the Black Lives Matter movement because that is their party’s base now. Any law-and-order posturing on Biden’s part was a feeble attempt to hide a radical agenda espoused by BLM and left-wing Democrats, far to the left of Biden’s old boss and alien to whatever moderate pragmatism Biden once espoused.

You Can’t Repeat the Past

Beyond the question of whether a Biden presidency would be normal is a larger question of whether American politics can ever go back to anything resembling normalcy. A few weeks ago, Peggy Noonan wrote a profoundly myopic and misty-eyed column arguing that if Biden wins in a landslide on November 3, it will be because “he is normal. And people miss normal so much.”

Do they? Normal is what voters rejected when they elected Trump president. Normal is what Democrats rejected by twice elevating Sen. Bernie Sanders, forcing Biden to negotiate the party’s platform with avowed socialists. The choice of Biden as the Democrats’ nominee should be understood as a rejection of the status quo because, as Rep. Pramila Jayapal said, he “is moveable” on issues—Biden can be and has been bullied by the left. It is one of the reasons he got the nomination.

Amid the ongoing pandemic Americans might want normalcy in their personal and professional lives—they want to get back to work and get their kids back to school—but that should not be confused with a desire for normalcy in politics. The good old days of the elite establishment running things as they see fit, enriching themselves and their friends, telling voters one thing and doing another, are over.

This is hard for the establishment to accept, which is why lately we have seen Noonan-style nostalgia in predictions about the future leadership of the GOP if Trump loses. Will Ben Sasse emerge as the party’s leader? Nikki Haley? Maybe John Kasich or Marco Rubio will come roaring back to the national stage

No. As Abraham Lincoln said a few weeks before he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, “The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.” The plain fact is that the future of American politics will not be marked by a return to an era of establishment rule because the establishment has failed.

Our institutions are not weak because of Trump, they are weak because our elites failed to maintain them. Our norms have not been undermined by Trump, they have been undermined by ordinary Americans who came to realize those norms were merely a cover for rank hypocrisy from our leaders. All of this has been decades in the making, and now it has come to pass.

And none of it can be wiped away by an election. The bell that sounded with Trump’s election four years ago, heralding a new populist era in American, cannot be un-rung.

That’s why Biden has had to repudiate much of his 47-year career in politics. That is why he selected the hardest-left Democrat in the Senate as his running mate. That is why he and other Democratic leaders were so timid in speaking out against violent protests and rioting throughout the summer. That is why his presidency, should he win, will not be a return to normalcy.

The new normal is right in front of us, right now: populist right versus populist left. Choose your fighter.

‘Smoking Gun’ Hunter Biden Email Confirmed With Forensic Analysis,"A forensic analysis of an email showing former Vice President Joe Biden intimately involved in his son’s overseas business ventures has confirmed its authenticity, according to the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The email dated Apr. 17, 2015 was first published by the New York Post in a series of exposés stemming from an abandoned Delaware laptop retrieved by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani who then handed the contents over to the Post, and later the Daily Caller.

On Thursday, the Caller reported the results of a forensic analysis ordered on the computer’s content, including the email contradicting Joe Biden’s repeated claims of never having discussed his son Hunter Biden’s potentially criminal business dealings with either Hunter, “or with anyone else.” According to the email however, Hunter Biden actually introduced his vice president father to a senior adviser to Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company that was showering Hunter with upwards of $50,000 a month in excess compensation for a board position, despite no prior experience in the industry.

“Thank you for inviting me to DC and giving me an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together,” wrote the Burisma official.

Upon receiving the contents of the laptop evidently belonging to Hunter Biden, the Caller provided cybersecurity expert and founder of Errata Security Robert Graham with the email and its metadata to order a forensic analysis. Graham, the Caller reported, found the message “absolutely verified beyond a shadow of a doubt” by merely testing contents against a unique DKIM signature.

“Graham used the DKIM signature within the email to verify with a private key on Google’s servers that the sender, recipient, subject, data and body of the message that the DCNF obtained from Giuliani were unchanged from when the email was originally sent in April 2015,” the Caller wrote. “Graham said the only way the email could have been faked is if someone hacked into Google’s servers, found the private key and used it to reverse engineer the email’s DKIM signature.”

The Caller’s report comes as mass media has sought to delegitimize, if not entirely ignore, the bombshell reporting implicating its preferred presidential candidate in his son’s overseas business ventures. The Biden campaign has refrained from disputing the authenticity of the laptop’s content. The campaign instead has chalked up the latest revelations as part of a Russian disinformation campaign, a claim that has been debunked by the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Department of National Intelligence, and the Department of State.

Earlier this week, a former Biden business partner-turned whistleblower, Tony Bobulinski, sat down with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson and outlined Joe Biden’s extensive involvement in his son’s ventures and called it a “blatant lie,” whenever Joe claimed anything otherwise.

“That’s a blatant lie when he states that,” Bobulinski said. “It’s a blatant lie.”

Bobulinski also charged Joe Biden with being “compromised” by the Chinese Communist Party.

“I think Joe Biden and the Biden family is compromised,” Bobulinski said a week before the presidential election.

True to form, legacy outlets implemented a blackout of Bobulinski’s bombshell interview.

On Thursday, the Department of Justice took the rare step to confirm the existence of an ongoing money laundering investigation into Hunter Biden that included a five-hour interview with Bobulinski last week. Fox News reported earlier this month that the FBI had also taken possession of Hunter Biden’s suspected laptop offering further credence to its authenticity.

John Piper's Case Against Trump Is Intellectually And Morally Bankrupt,"John Piper, in an article last week exploring “Paths to Ruin” in the 2020 election, didn’t so much tell Christians who to vote for as much as he projected guilt and shame onto those who support Donald Trump for president. Piper is “baffled” that Christians could think one candidate’s immoral character is less deadly than another candidate’s pro-abortion policies.

The famed pastor and theologian’s purported purpose in writing the article was “to point to a perspective that seems to be neglected.” His musings, however, are far from a “neglected” perspective. They fill every column of NeverTrumper David French and litter the smooth rhetoric of Democratic Mayor Pete Buttigieg — and they merit a response, especially coming from such an influential evangelical figure.

Piper’s article was not explicitly about Trump and Joe Biden. In a tweet, he later declared he would not be casting his vote for either of the two men. Still, the implications of his writing weren’t ambiguous. He set up a clear dichotomy: One candidate displays the character traits of pride, vulgarity, and sexual immorality, and the other candidate supports the policies of abortion, LGBT, and socialism. I wonder who he could be talking about.

Piper later removes all doubt he’s contrasting Trump and Biden when he brings up the appointment of judges, one of Trump’s most notable accomplishments, and when he refers to the societal “infection” of the “last five years,” which is when Trump entered the political arena.

I’m “baffled,” Piper said, “that so many Christians consider the sins of unrepentant sexual immorality (porneia), unrepentant boastfulness (alazoneia), unrepentant vulgarity (aischrologia), unrepentant factiousness (dichostasiai), and the like, to be only toxic for our nation, while policies that endorse baby-killing, sex-switching, freedom-limiting, and socialistic overreach are viewed as deadly.”

His argument boils down to this: It’s crazy for Christians to think Trump’s sins are less serious than Biden’s policies.

Piper Compares Apples and Oranges

Piper’s framing is at best problematic and at worst intellectually dishonest, for he doesn’t make an appropriate comparison. Piper doesn’t juxtapose Trump’s character with Biden’s character or Trump’s policies with Biden’s policies. Instead, he compares Trump’s immoral character with Biden’s immoral policies.

It’s here that he finds himself “baffled” that Christians don’t take Trump’s character seriously. Many Christians, however, refuse to equate these two unequal realms. Character should be weighed against character, and policy against policy. Piper’s value judgment comes at the disposal of Trump’s policy victories, many of which are advantageous to those pursuing godliness, and at the oversight of Biden’s demonstrably depraved character.

Perhaps Piper compares Trump’s character with Biden’s policies because his analysis is based on typical media characterizations rather than the men’s actual merits. In Piper’s article, Trump’s character is a caricature, and Biden’s character isn’t covered at all — on par with the mainstream portrayal. Although Piper insists it’s OK to disagree with him and concludes he will vote for neither candidate, his entire piece maintains the same flavor: condemnation for Trump and implicit commendation for Biden.

Everything Comes Back to Trump’s Sins

In one section, Piper signals he is about to cover the left’s errors when he asks, “Where does the wickedness of defending child-killing come from?”

Just as fast as he pivots to Biden’s pro-death policies, he returns again to Trump’s character. This “wickedness,” Piper says, “comes from hearts that are insubordinate to God. In other words, it comes from the very character that so many Christian leaders are treating as comparatively innocuous, because they think Roe and SCOTUS and Planned Parenthood are more pivotal, more decisive, battlegrounds.”

This is interesting. It reveals that Piper does, in fact, see a connection between character and policy. Instead of exploring the depths of Biden’s character unto death here, however, Piper immediately uses this as another opportunity to dunk on Christian Trump supporters for valuing pro-life policies too highly.

“I think Roe is an evil decision. I think Planned Parenthood is a code name for baby-killing and (historically at least) ethnic cleansing. And I think it is baffling and presumptuous to assume that pro-abortion policies kill more people than a culture-saturating, pro-self pride,” Piper says. “When a leader models self-absorbed, self-exalting boastfulness, he models the most deadly behavior in the world. He points his nation to destruction. Destruction of more kinds than we can imagine.”

Notice once again that Piper isn’t using the discussion about Biden’s policy as a doorway to talking about the sinful hearts that led to those policies. Instead, he repeatedly juxtaposes the Biden, pro-abortion crowd with the evil character of the other side: Over here is Biden supporting baby-killing. And over here is Trump being self-absorbed and boastful. And Christians are nuts if they think the intentional killing of babies in the womb is more lethal than a single narcissist. It’s absurd.

If Piper Wants to Talk About Character, Consider Biden’s

Equally absurd, however, is that Piper overlooks or denies that the “pro-self pride” of which he speaks is manifested just as strongly in the party that champions pro-abortion policies. This is true based on what Piper himself acknowledges: Pro-death policies come from hearts that are insubordinate to God. Biden’s pro-death policies don’t appear ex nihilo. They are the natural byproduct of his abysmal character and wicked heart.

The Christian voter’s choice, then, is not between one man of bad character, Trump, and another of bad policy, Biden. It is a choice between a man with poor character and another man with both poor character and deadly policies.

Consider the sins Piper highlights as being biblically deadly: “unrepentant sexual immorality (porneia), unrepentant boastfulness (alazoneia), unrepentant vulgarity (aischrologia), unrepentant factiousness (dichostasiai).” Now, Trump, a presumably unregenerate man, does display these qualities, among admirable traits. But is Biden above them?

We’re talking about a man who was also accused of sexual assault (porneia), who has spent an entire campaign boasting about his political accomplishments of the last 47 years (alazoneia), who told a voter he was “full of sh-t” and insulted others (aischrologia), and who repeatedly divides people into factions, specifically stoking racial strife (dichostasiai). This is just from the list Piper provided, and is to say nothing of Biden’s character as it relates to habitual lying, exploiting his positions of influence for personal gain, undermining God’s design for marriage and families, attacking people of faith, and instilling fear to obtain power, just to name a few of the many more obvious strikes against Biden’s character. For an example of “bad company [that] corrupts good character,” look no further than the woman he chose as his running mate.

It is conceivable that a Christian could say that she could not in good conscience vote for Trump because of his character. But what is truly baffling, to use Piper’s word, is that a Christian could, with intellectual honesty, say that Biden’s character is better.

Are Conservative Values ‘Baffling’?

In a final blow to the religious right, Piper trivializes their deeply held convictions to two simple catch-phrases: “freedom and life.” He writes:

Freedom and life are precious. We all want to live and be free to pursue happiness. But if our freedoms, and even our lives, are threatened or taken, the essence of our identity in Christ, the certainty of our everlasting joy with Christ, and the holiness and love for which we have been saved by Christ — none of these is lost with the loss of life and freedom. Therefore, Christians communicate a falsehood to unbelievers (who are also baffled!) when we act as if policies and laws that protect life and freedom are more precious than being a certain kind of person. The church is paying dearly, and will continue to pay, for our communicating this falsehood year after year. Is it not baffling, then, that so many Christians seem to be sure that they are saving human lives and freedoms by treating as minimal the destructive effects of the spreading gangrene of high-profile, high-handed, culture-shaping sin?

It is only “baffling” if one first reduces conservatives to pro-life freedom-lovers and then decides human life and freedom are dispensable. Freedom and life, however, are not abstract, and they are not simply a means to accomplish earthly goals or gain temporal wealth. Freedom and life are part of our Imago Dei. They are gifts from God that we are to steward, and we use them in myriad ways to advance God’s kingdom.

So is it “baffling” that a Christian would think God-given sex distinctions are important? Is it baffling that a believer would want to protect his family against the racially charged attacks of a violent mob? Is it baffling that a Christian would desire that his children learn truth, rather than government-sanctioned doctrine — not walking in the counsel of the ungodly? It is baffling that a Christian would desire for men to keep the hard-earned fruits of their labor, giving charitably to the poor and needy? Is it baffling that a believer would value the biblical family structure over the state? Of course, it’s not.

Furthermore, if Piper believes this immoral gangrene that spreads throughout our country is a result of one unregenerate man instead of the result of the wickedness in the hearts of every sinful citizen, he is a fool.

Vote with a Clear Conscience

Piper leaves us with an important question, one that all Christian Americans should ask regardless of who is in office and whether it is an election year: “Have you inadvertently created the mindset that the greatest issue in life is saving America and its earthly benefits?”

Eternity is more important than Election Day, but it is wrong to assume that Christians who would maintain a zeal for the preservation of the freest country on Earth would do so at the expense of eternal joys. It is likewise wrong to assume that the two cannot go hand in hand, for to save America and her benefits is to perpetuate a cultural climate in which the gospel can go forth freely, family structures are prized, children learn truth, and life is valued.

It should baffle no one that I will be casting my vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 3, and my conscience is clear.

"Yes, Media Are Rigging Election Against Half The Country. Here's How","Even if Donald Trump had lost the 2016 election, instead of won it in a surprise, the media’s coverage of his campaign and supporters would have been a horrific failure. They presented that race as unwinnable for Trump and as if his support was inexplicable.

Their response to their 2016 failures has been not to improve their journalism in any way, shape, or form, but to decide that they didn’t do enough to bias that election in their preferred direction. Their nearly four-year temper tantrum has resulted in far worse 2020 campaign coverage than even the depths of their 2016 coverage. It’s as if they looked to the Candy Crowley debate in 2012, when she went out of her way to back Barack Obama when he said something false, and viewed it as a model, not an embarrassment.

Once again, regardless of the outcome next week, Big Media is actively at war with half of the American people and are desperately working to rig an election against them. Here are just five ways they’re doing that.

1. Refusing to Do Journalism on Joe Biden

On October 14, the New York Post published a story about how Hunter Biden had introduced his father to a top Ukrainian businessman. This contradicted Joe Biden’s oft-repeated claim to have had no knowledge whatsoever about his son’s overseas business affairs.

Hunter Biden was paid handsomely by Burisma, a Ukrainian energy concern, while his father was vice president. Hunter had no business acumen or relevant experience in the energy sector, but was paid millions of dollars by Burisma at the time his father was in charge of U.S. policy toward Ukraine.

The story was sourced to a laptop computer allegedly left by Hunter at a Wilmington computer repair store. Big Tech moved immediately to squash the blockbuster story on both Twitter and Facebook. Twitter has banned the New York Post from tweeting and Facebook publicly announced they were suppressing the story, pending journalistic fact checks.

It’s been more than two weeks since Facebook announced it was suppressing the story pending fact checks. It has not shared who it tasked with the fact checks, and the only journalistic checks on the information have confirmed the story. One of the recipients of an email found on the laptop confirmed it was real, on the record. Government officials said it was not Russian disinformation. No information has come to light to suggest it was Russian disinformation. And last night, the key email in question was verified as legitimate by a cyber expert who was given access to the metadata for the email.

Other media outlets participated in the coordinated effort to squash the story, either by ignoring it completely or by claiming it wasn’t a big deal. Few to no media outlets defended the New York Post.

Partly as a result of the New York Post’s story and partly as a result of a Senate report showcasing Hunter Biden’s questionable overseas financial dealings, a former business associate of Hunter Biden’s named Tony Bobulinski came forward with more details about the Biden family’s problematic overseas relationships.

Armed with reams of documents, texts, emails, messages, and voicemails, Bobulinski said that Joe Biden had lied when he claimed he had no knowledge of Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings. Bobulinski recounted two in-person meetings with Joe Biden. Bobulinski, a retired Navy veteran, would go on to describe how Biden family members and associates plotted to keep Joe’s involvement off the books, and provide paperwork, texts, emails, documents, and audio files to substantiate his claims.

Last night, Sinclair’s James Rosen reported that the FBI had opened an investigation into Hunter Biden and his associates last year to investigate allegations of money laundering. The investigation is ongoing, Rosen reported. Bobulinski was interviewed as a “material witness” to the investigation in recent days.

The media blackout of any story that might harm their preferred candidate has extended even to this explosive news. Keep in mind, President Trump was impeached for expressing concern about Hunter Biden’s possible corruption in Ukraine at the same time the FBI was investigating Hunter Biden for money laundering.

There is no question that this story is journalistically significant, and dramatically more substantiated than the Trump-Russia collusion hoax that the media promulgated for years. In that story, the media ran wild with ridiculous and preposterous allegations with no evidence. Here, a family firm CEO with documentation to support his claims has been viewed by a corrupt media as not worthy of spending time on. GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel summarized how bad the propaganda situation is with major media:

2. Slavish Devotion to Obviously Wrong Polling

Another way corporate media have been rigging the election has been through their polling narratives. For months, the media have been relentlessly pushing a narrative that Trump can not win the 2020 election. They almost seem to be in a contest to see who can make the most outrageous claim about a given state.

In 2016, the Real Clear Politics average of polls of Wisconsin showed that Hillary Clinton would defeat Donald Trump by 6.5 points. In fact, she lost that state to Trump, narrowly. You would think that this result, and the result in general, might produce some humility on the part of media pollsters.

In its final 2016 poll, Marquette reported that Clinton would win by six points. This week, that same pollster reported Biden would win by five points. By comparison, the Washington Post and ABC News dropped a poll claiming that Biden was going to win by 17 points. Even their previous poll gave Biden “only” a six-point lead. Marquette’s previous poll advantage was the same as their more recent advantage.

Guess which poll got massive media coverage.

One shouldn’t always assume polls are wrong, but if anyone learned anything from 2016 and 2018, it’s that polls are not always right. In 2018, for example, Fox News’ closing poll in the Indiana Senate race placed Democrat Joe Donnelly safely ahead by a 7-point margin. He lost to Republican Mike Braun by 6 points, 13 points off from what the final poll indicated. That poll result, which turned out to be very false, contributed to a narrative that the night would be a bloodbath for Republicans. While Republicans lost the House, they actually gained Senate seats, such as in Indiana.

Pundits talk as if polls are always right, but if they were, pundits wouldn’t have jobs. Everyone can read a poll and see what it says. The entire point of punditry should be to look at the entire universe of information, of which polls are a part, and try to see what world looks like with mosaic of information. Too many beltway folks go out of their way to ignore everything that’s not a poll.

That is a particular problem because some polls have at times seemed to become a vehicle to express deep-seated media bias in favor of particular candidates — in the hopes that the polls might move public opinion rather than reflect it.

3. Hiding Trump’s Accomplishments and Enthusiasm

Maybe ABC and the Post are correct and Trump is going to lose Wisconsin by 17 points and Biden will lead the most epic landslide in history. It’s certainly a possibility. But while the media are obsessing over horse-race polls, they are downplaying both Trump’s record of accomplishment and the enthusiasm he has from voters.

Trump’s biggest success in his first term has been his foreign policy agenda. While the elites predicted literal nuclear annihilation if he were elected, his presidency has been one of peace agreements and avoiding war when other presidents would have invaded.

He has worked against powerful military-industrial interests to end the Afghanistan War. He successfully eroded ISIS’s territorial gains. He rewrote trade deals. Peace agreements have sprung up in the Middle East between Israel and various Arab nations.

Trump has tried to get countries to be more invested in their own defense, rather than relying mostly on U.S. power. That has led to these peace agreements and arms deals in the Middle East but also an increase in defense spending from North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries. Trump has also massively reoriented the country’s posture toward China as part of an effort to deal with a growing threat there.

The media responded to these successes by hiding them, constantly. In the two debates between Trump and Biden, virtually no foreign policy questions were asked.

Much of Trump’s presidency was marked by significant growth of the economy. Even after the global pandemic, which has wreaked havoc throughout the world, yesterday’s explosive gross domestic product (GDP) numbers came in greater than expected. The media responded by burying the story as much as possible, worried it would help Trump.

Third-quarter GDP was up 33.1 percent, nearly double the previous growth record set in the first quarter of 1950. The Washington Post treated it like this almost unbelievable record was bad news, and didn’t use the annualized rate of 33.1 percent but the seemingly less impressive smaller number for the quarter. “U.S. economy grew by a record 7.4 percent from July to September, but the data is complicated,” was their headline. When second-quarter GDP fell by an annualized rate of 31.7 percent, the headline said that, instead of the lower 9 percent figure for the quarter. CNN and MSNBC simply blocked the historic news from airing on their prime time shows.

Republican voters are unified like they have been rarely before. Is that evidenced in any way in the media coverage? Or does nearly every media outlet constantly trot out a member of the tired and sad cabal of NeverTrumpist Republicans to suggest the opposite?

Trump’s rallies are brimming with enthusiasm, even during a pandemic, while Biden struggles to get even small crowds in attendance. When Trump held a wild and vibrant rally in Omaha this week, nearly all media coverage focused on how the logistics team had been unable to transport all the attendees in a timely fashion.

The Republican National Convention was a huge hit in part because it served as a fact check of the media narrative in recent years. Simply by highlighting a track record of domestic and foreign policy successes, viewers were reminded of how false the narrative about the first term of the Trump administration has been.

4. Peddling Obviously Fake Narratives

This week saw the news that the supposedly high-ranking “Anonymous” government official that published a 2018 New York Times op-ed about secretly undermining a president he personally disagreed with was in fact a 30-year-old mid-level bureaucrat nobody had ever heard of. The fake narrative that the New York Times knowingly promulgated roiled the administration for months, if not years, as high-level cabinet officials took turns denying that they were secretly and unconstitutionally undermining the elected president of the United States.

Miles Taylor was the Homeland Security Department policy analyst who turned out to have written the op-ed and a best-selling book about how he and other Resistance members put their personal political preferences over the ones chosen by the voting populace when they elected Trump president.

That little op-ed was nothing compared to the preposterously false Russia collusion hoax that the media promulgated for years thanks to dubious and selective leaks from politically motivated sources. For years, major media pushed the idea that Trump had won the 2016 election not because he won the Electoral College but because he had conspired with Russia — yes, Russia — to steal the 2016 election.

A coordinated leak campaign to hamstring the transition and, then, the administration was orchestrated and spun into a special counsel probe that brought the administration to a near standstill. In the end, none of the media’s promised collusion was found by the special counsel. The media pretended that they’d never been as credulous of their Russia collusion hoax as they had been and have never apologized or admitted error for what they did.

In fact, they just moved on to other hoaxes. One they cling to was formed by people using The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg to filter it into a damaging story. Goldberg was also used by similar officials to push false and discredited claims about the need to invade Iraq and cleanse it of weapons of mass destruction — that they turned out not to have.

Goldberg granted anonymity to four sources so they could claim that the public persona of Trump as a military-loving enthusiast was false. In fact, they said, he had personally chosen not to visit a World War I cemetery in France one day because he thought the people buried there were losers.

Now, as it turns out, there is contemporaneous evidence that it was John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff and the man Goldberg and his allies intimated was behind the story, who put a stop to the trip because of weather concerns. Further, more than a dozen eyewitnesses to the meetings where the cancellation was discussed went on the record to dispute the anonymous allegations.

There was never even a scintilla of evidence put out in support of Goldberg’s charge. Yet the story entered the public consciousness, became a major theme of Democratic ads, and continues to be mentioned by Biden on the few occasions he speaks publicly.

5. Cheering on Suppression of Speech by Enemies

When Jack Dorsey and his Twitter employees suspended the account of the New York Post, other media outlets could have sounded the alarm about the violations of this country’s spirit of a free press. Instead, they stayed more or less silent. CNN’s Jake Tapper, who has no problem opining daily about his seething hatred of Trump officials, mentioned the Post’s suspensions but refused to take sides about it. Others didn’t even go that far.

Twitter and Facebook have been openly meddling in the 2020 election by censoring political opponents, suppressing their supporters, limiting the distribution of articles and arguments in their favor, and other draconian efforts. The media have more or less cheered them on.

NeverTrumpers, and their more traditional Democratic media colleagues, seem to think that so long as they are protected by social media companies — and there is no reason to think they won’t be — that censorship of non-leftist media is not anything they will fight. Some openly support bans on anyone they politically disagree with. Failure to defend journalists who are actually under attack — as opposed to those who are merely criticized — is a hallmark of many in the media.

David Daleiden, an undercover journalist who showed that Planned Parenthood was engaged in trafficking of unborn baby body parts, had his entire life upended by Kamala Harris prosecuting him for his journalism. Journalists didn’t think it worthy of coverage, even though many think she could be president within a matter of months.

Will They Succeed?

The media are doing everything in their power to make sure that their preferred candidate wins — and that their arch enemy Trump loses. They’re coddling Biden, refusing to ask him any hard questions about his policies, his plans, or his family being investigated for money laundering. As a friend told my husband, “It’s like watching someone make sure a three-year-old wins CandyLand.”

They’ve gone overtime to influence public opinion with their emphasis on polls, despite the problems with those polls. They’ve hidden Trump accomplishments and enthusiasm. They’ve pushed outlandish conspiracy theories that many Americans believe to this day. And they’ve encouraged social media companies to suppress conservative arguments.

Will that be enough for them to win the day? People will find out next week. But the half of the country that the media are rigging the game against can’t be happy about what they’ve seen this year. And nobody who cares about a free and functioning country should tolerate what they’ve done.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/30/yes-media-are-rigging-election-against-half-the-country-heres-how/,2020-10-30
7 Times Hollywood Celebs Utterly Failed To Rally Enthusiasm For Biden,"Hollywood elites tried desperately to inspire Americans to vote for Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden this election cycle. Despite a predicted Biden blow out, Tuesday’s narrow results showed their cringe-worthy attempts ultimately fell flat.

It turns out, woke celebrities are not as likable as they think they are. Or, maybe Trump’s base is made up of working class folks, who care more about jobs and sending their kids to school than who Chrissy Teigen or Chelsea Handler says they should vote for.

In an election cycle filled with frenzied appeals to middle American voters, here are the best celebrity fails:

1. Pro-Fracking Lady Gaga Campaigns For Biden In PA

Lady Gaga inexplicably posted a video wearing camo next to a truck and drinking a beer to announce she would be in Pennsylvania with Joe Biden in the last days of his campaign. The bizarre video was widely derided for mocking and stereotyping Trump voters.

It was also quickly seized upon by the Trump campaign, who pointed out what the clueless, celebrity obsessed Biden campaign should have known: That Lady Gaga was a well-known anti-fracking activist and member of a celebrity group whose aim was to shut down the industry. In a scathing press release, the Trump campaign ridiculed Biden for both trying to back track (and lie) about his anti-fracking comments while campaigning with Lady Gaga. “Nothing exposes Joe Biden’s disdain for the forgotten working men and women of Pennsylvania like campaigning with anti-fracking activist Lady Gaga.”

The president, also trolled with a tweet, “Just learned that Sleepy Joe Biden is campaigning in Pennsylvania with Lady Gaga, a proud member of ‘Artists Against Fracking.’ This is more proof that he would ban Fracking and skyrocket your energy prices…”

2. No One Shows At Biden Rally With Bon Jovi

Bon Jovi was another high-profile celebrity who campaigned for Biden in Pennsylvania with former President Barack Obama. The rock legend, flanked by one of the Democratic party’s most popular and historic figure, should have inspired droves of fans. However, the aging boomer duo drew an embarrassingly small crowd. Facebook and Twitter were replete with pictures from the event, laughing at the “12 people and 7 pumpkins,” that turned out to hear from the aging rocker and politician.

https://www.facebook.com/margie.jones.946/posts/10221343662014196

More embarrassing still was the fact that big tech “independent fact-checkers” were enlisted to provide cover for the sad event, lest anyone dare to compare it to Donald Trump’s massive rallies. If you needed proof that the Biden campaign was sensitive about the enthusiasm gap between the candidates, censors flagged posts to confirm that there were “230 cars” at the pitiful Bon Jovi event. Compare that to the 97-mile Trump car rally in Arizona that week, organized organically by supporters, not the Trump campaign.

3. Taylor Swift Sings SJW Anthem

Taylor Swift released an obnoxious Biden campaign video titled “Only The Young,” in which she croons, “You go to class, scared wondering where the best hiding spot would be. And the big bad man and his big bad clan, their hands are stained with red. Oh, how quickly, they forget.” The emotionally charged music video features screaming social justice warriors, crying Mexican children, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett cast as a villain, cops pushing down an old man, protesters dressed as handmaids, and much more.

Up there's the finish line.

Our future is worth our fight. Thank you, @taylorswift13, for voicing what #OnlyTheYoung can do. Let’s run! pic.twitter.com/q4EAJwwzqG — Eric Swalwell (@ericswalwell) October 30, 2020

Ironically, the video could just as easily be used by the Trump campaign: vote against this!

4. SNL Fails to be Funny

In recent years, “Saturday Night Live” has declined into the unfunny genre of “activist comedy.” SNL is supposed to have the best comedy writers in the country, yet their jokes this past election cycle were so blatantly partisan, it rendered them predictable and most importantly, unfunny. There was a time when SNL actually followed the comedy golden rule, that “When comedy isn’t at all dangerous, it’s boring.”

Now, SNL stays as safe as possible, only joking within the bounds of what’s acceptable among America’s woke elites. This means jabbing at Trump and leaving Biden, an easily mockable figure, unscathed after every sketch.

In fact, when it was announced that Jim Carrey would play Joe Biden, Jeff Daniels, Carrey’s “Dumb and Dumber” costar told Stephen Colbert he urged Carrey to “go easy” on Biden. “We need him,” Daniels told Carrey.

5. Chelsea Handler Sells Sex For Biden Votes

Of course, we can never forget Chelsea Handler, who offered her ex-boyfriend “50 Cent” sexual favors if he didn’t vote for Donald Trump. The rapper made headlines when he endorsed President Trump after seeing Joe Biden’s tax plan, and posting to Instagram, “VOTE ForTRUMP.”

Handler’s morally and legally questionable comments got worse when she told “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon that she “had to remind her ex that he was a black person so he can’t vote for Donald Trump.”

The woke white comedian explained it was somehow her duty to set 50 Cent straight on account of his skin color: “He shouldn’t be influencing an entire swath of people who may listen to him because he’s worried about his own personal pocketbook.” It was a fitting comment given Biden echoed the same racist sentiment to black radio host Charlamagne tha God, saying “if you don’t vote for me, you ain’t black.”

6. The Telethon DNC Convention Was A Total Fail

The most cringe-inducing and poorly produced convention in recent history was the celebrity-heavy 2020 Democratic National Convention. Despite all the Hollywood “talent” the DNC enlisted, it was unwatchable and looked like a cheap telethon.

One of the signature DNC celebrity speakers included 18-year-old Billie Eilish. The 18-year-old pop star could not have sounded more bored as she assured America in monotone that President Trump is “destroying our country.” The teen droned on, using as little passion as humanly possible, adding, “We all have to vote like our lives and the world depends on it because they do.”

Meanwhile, the RNC Convention, featuring everyday working Americans was a beautifully produced and imminently must-see evening event, once again proving that average Americans are more interesting than spoiled elitist celebrities waxing on about income inequality.

7. Celebrities Get Naked For Mail-In Votes

Celebs like Sarah Silverman, Mark Ruffalo, Chelsea Handler, Naomi Campbell, Josh Gad, and Chris Rock stripped down in a video to explain how to properly fill out and submit mail-in-ballots, which were widely pushed by Democrats, to avoid “naked” ballots, when your voter card isn’t placed in the right number of envelopes (in certain states). The video was desperate, wince-worthy, and condescending.

This election proved that there is a deep divide between America’s elites and the populist movement of Trump supporters, which was exemplified this week by the widely incorrect pollsters. Even with every single big name star throwing their support behind Biden, regular folks still voted in large numbers for Trump. People are voting based on economics, not “intersectionality” and woke identity politics that reigns supreme in Hollywood.

Under the leadership of Donald Trump, the Republican party has become the party of the working class and Americans who unashamedly love their country. Out of touch celebrities, no matter how much they try, can’t stop the American electorate from voting in their best interest.

3 Reasons Election Forecasts Made False Projections Favoring Joe Biden,"Forecasts of this presidential election were missing economics. As I wrote the week before the election, the missing economics fit into three categories: information aggregation, voter incentives to tell the truth, and voter incentives to participate in the general election.

As of the week before the election, the RealClearPolitics poll average was Biden +7.9 (51.4-43.5) percent nationally and +3.1 (48.9-45.9) in the top battleground states (Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Arizona). Based on a very similar data set, FiveThirtyEight put Biden’s chance of winning at 90 percent while The Economist put it at 96 percent. FiveThirtyEight and The Economist forecasted that Biden would win with a margin of 156 and 162 electoral votes, respectively.

The election turned out to be much closer than indicated by the forecasts and RCP averages (hereafter, “the forecasters”). Two days after the election, Donald Trump still had a path to victory in the Electoral College, albeit unlikely. Biden’s national popular vote lead is only 2.5 percent. As of Thursday of election week, Biden actually had 0.9 percent fewer combined votes than Trump did in RCP’s top battleground states. This departure between real-world results and the forecasts is due at least in part to a failure to use economic reasoning and methods.

Information Aggregation

The information aggregation methods forecasters used are inferior to alternatives that have been well-studied and readily available, and that better reflect results on the economics of information. The methods forecasters used in this election cycle were often more than 10 percentage points more favorable to Biden than the alternatives. I have not seen any explanation from the forecasters why the alternatives are not part of their forecasts.

U.S. voters are heterogeneous and scattered over millions of square miles. One of the challenges for an election forecaster is to assemble or reweight a polling sample that is representative of those who actually vote. For this purpose, the polls used by the forecasters do some reweighting of their samples by demographics.

Most famously, less-educated voters are often (but not always) upweighted, given that their relative propensity to vote in recent years has exceeded their relative propensity to participate in polls. Other demographic variables sometimes used for these purposes are voter registration and voting history.

The polls used by the forecasters contact potential voters by landline, cell phone, and internet and ask them, “Who do you think you will vote for in the election for president?” (emphasis added). These polls ask other questions about the election, but the answers to these questions are not part of the aforementioned averages or forecasts.

As recently as a few years ago, it was well known that another poll question has a much better track record at predicting election outcomes: “Who do you think will be elected president in November?” This “expectation” question is included in some of the polls used by the forecasters but, as far as I can tell, is not any part of the forecast.

David Rothschild and Justin Wolfers found in 2012 that the optimal forecasting weight on the expectations question is about nine times the weight on the own-vote question. Furthermore, the optimal weight on voter expectations is, they said, even greater when: (1) “voters are embedded in heterogeneous … social networks,” (2) “they don’t rely too much on common information,” and (3) “small samples are involved.” Two of the three of their criteria describe 2020 voters even better than they described voters in the past.

A couple of pollsters expressed interest in voter expectations and found them to deviate significantly from the own-vote intentions that are the foundation of election forecasts. The USC Dornsife poll (seven-day window ending Oct. 29) found Biden leading by 11.6 in own-vote intentions but only 2.1 points in election expectations — a significant gap.

When respondents were asked about how they expected their social contacts to vote, Biden led by a lot less (5.3 points). The Fox News poll found Biden winning by 10 points on the own-vote question but losing by 9 points on “do you think more of your neighbors are voting for Joe Biden or Donald Trump?”

In other words, the foundational own-vote question differed from the other questions by 6 to 19 percentage points, which is several multiples of the RCP battleground average Biden-Trump gap of 3 percentage points.

The Economist forecaster Andrew Gelman, not an economist but an eminent Bayesian statistician, is now rather disingenuously shifting all the blame onto pollsters for assembling skewed samples. Arguably most of his forecast error came instead from his seemingly arbitrary choice of which questions to use from the polls. Gelman has claimed that own-vote questions are better forecasters than expectation questions, which is a respectable conclusion but no reason to completely ignore the expectation questions instead of assigning them somewhat less weight.

Gallup, which does not even ask the own-vote intention question, found that 56 percent of Americans expect Trump to win. During the days before the election, betting markets were putting Trump’s chances at about 34 percent. Both of these are far different from the election forecasts built on own-vote polls.

Betting markets are rich enough to allow bets on the electoral margin of victory. The most expensive contracts were Biden 150-209 and Trump 60-99. One of these coincides with the election forecasts, but the other is wildly different. In other words, betting markets seemed to put significant probability on the event that the polls used by the forecasters were way off in Biden’s favor.

Voter Incentive: Social Desirability

The incentives to truthfully participate in polls are different from those to participate in the general election, and these differences correlate with political affiliation.

One of the potential incentives is “social desirability.” A Cato poll found that 62 percent of Americans “say the political climate these days prevents them from saying things they believe because others might find them offensive.”

Trump is the Bad Orange Man to many. Biden is the overwhelming choice among the rich and famous, many of whom blamed Trump’s 2016 victory on his allegedly deplorable racist supporters. More recently, looting has become more common and might be related to antiracism in the minds of some voters. This suggests that some fraction of Trump supporters would not acknowledge their support for him — the “shy Trump voter” — especially in Democratic communities.

The quantitative question, of course, is the magnitude of the effect of shy-Trump and shy-Biden voters on poll results relative to election results. I have been amazed how little effort the forecasters put into assessing this magnitude and applying a correction.

Nate Silver dismissed the shy-Trump voter theory by transforming it into a straw man that a huge red wave is coming, which he says is contradicted by early-voting data. In the past, he did nothing more than take the difference between the results of phone polls and internet polls (note that Biden’s edge is 2 percentage points more in phone surveys, which is not negligible and is in the expected direction).

Social desirability bias is one of the reasons pollsters have fielded the voter-expectation and voter-neighbors questions. Silver says this approach is “stupid” because it deviates from “the shy-Trump voter narrative.” In other words, he does not have a real argument.

Another step, taken by the renegade pollsters Democracy Institute and Trafalgar, is to repeatedly assure respondents that their responses are fully confidential. They assert that the assurances affect the poll results, although I have not seen estimates of the magnitude. In any case, the renegades can be proud of the accuracy of their much-maligned forecasts of the 2020 election.

Voter Incentive: Turnout

Voting in person or by mail is different than picking up the phone or opening an email to begin an online survey. The difference is particularly stark during a pandemic. I do not see that forecasters were accounting for any relationship between the difference and political affiliation.

Republicans are doing much less to withdraw from normal activities in an effort to protect themselves from COVID-19. Gallup found that more than 77 percent of Democrats worried about getting the coronavirus whereas less than 29 percent of Republicans worried about that. More than 70 percent of Democrats were avoiding going to public places as compared to less than 38 percent of Republicans. Meanwhile, confirmed cases were surging in the Midwest as the election neared. A widely televised expert even went so far as to say that Midwesterners would not be adequately protected by a cloth mask and that going out in public required an N-95 mask instead.

In short, COVID-19 surges create a perceived cost of in-person voting that is likely greater for Democrats than Republicans. Some will switch to voting by mail, but perhaps others will not vote at all. I do not have an estimate of the magnitude of this effect.

Overall, economics by itself suggested, before Election Day, that the widely cited polls were exaggerating Biden’s electoral advantage. I am no polling expert and could not assess the amount of these polling biases. Betting markets and other methods of information aggregation did not show as much optimism for Biden as did the election forecasters.

These markets appeared to put significant probability mass on the event that Biden’s election results would be far worse than his polling results. Indeed, Election Day showed us all that Biden’s lead had been wildly exaggerated.

Biden’s Performance In Milwaukee County Raises Questions About Wisconsin Votes,"Unofficial tallies show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden leading in Wisconsin by razor-thin margins, four years after president Trump won the state by less than a percentage point.

In 2008, Barack Obama received 316,916 votes in Milwaukee County. In 2016, Hilary Clinton won only 288,822 votes there. But in 2020 Biden outperformed them both, receiving 317,251 votes countywide and besting Obama’s share of the vote by nearly two points .

However, voter anomalies in Milwaukee County, the largest county in the state, do raise some questions. Specifically, how did Biden outperform former President Barack Obama’s 2008 performance in the county, in an election that saw the highest voter turnout in 40 years?

Others have called into question disparities in Wisconsin’s high voter turnout when compared to other election cycles. This too can be explained by same-day voter registration in an election that saw record turnout nationwide.

On election night , Wisconsin was too close to call, but President Trump was ahead by comfortable margins, defying the predictions of corporate media pollsters who prepared America for a Biden blowout in the Badger State. Pollsters’ predictions ranged from 17 to five-point margins for Joe Biden. By early Wednesday morning, Biden had been pushed over the edge by a “ballot dump” of mail-in votes. While some have alleged that this ballot dump points to fraud, even Republican Party officials say they were prepared for 160,000 mail-in votes to be counted after the polls closed.

What makes this suspicious is that the county is shrinking. The Census Bureau population estimates show that in the last 10 years, thousands of metro Milwaukee residents have left the area for other parts of the state and country. As the Milwaukee Sentinel put it, “We’re lagging in a key metric that often reflects the vitality and desirability of a metro area: population growth.” The City of Milwaukee, which makes up about 60 percent of the county’s population, saw the number of registered voter decline by more than 26,700 from 2008 to 2020.

While it’s true that Obama in 2008 won about 18,000 more votes than Biden in the City of Milwaukee itself, one would also expect the countywide vote total for Biden to be less than Obama. Obama was a historic figure that motivated record numbers of blacks to vote in 2008. In addition, he had one of the most robust and successful campaigns in American history. His ground game and get-out-the-vote efforts were unprecedented, utilizing door knocking, canvassing, and phone banking. Not surprisingly, in no small part because of the black vote in Milwaukee County, he won the state of Wisconsin handily by a 6.9-percent margin.

By contrast, Biden’s campaign has never come close to the enthusiasm of Obama’s, and he faced an equally obvious enthusiasm gap compared to his 2020 challenger, President Trump, whose devoted supporters swarmed to his events despite a pandemic, and staged numerous non-campaign-directed boat, car, and ATV rallies throughout the state.

What makes Biden’s vote increase over Obama’s in Milwaukee County even more suspicious is that because of Biden’s decision to rarely leave his basement for fear of COVID-19, the Biden campaign had no ground game in Wisconsin and other key battleground states. No door-knocking, no volunteer phone-banking, virtually no activity at his anemic campaign offices. Biden staffers were running an almost exclusively digital campaign, sometimes based out of other states. Moreover, the much-anticipated Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee was upended by COVID-19, and Biden came to Wisconsin a total of only two times as the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee.

What’s more, Biden has a history of making wildly racist comments. He wrote the 1994 crime bill, which is widely considered to have been discriminatory against black Americans, and during the campaign he made several insensitive and significant blunders, including telling black radio icon, Charlamagne tha God, “If you don’t vote for me, you ain’t black.” Given all of this, it’s odd that Biden got more votes in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin’s most populous black county, than Obama, the first black major-party presidential candidate in American history.

The numbers in Milwaukee County suggest something fishy is happening in Wisconsin, and the Trump campaign is right to call for a recount.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/11/06/bidens-performance-in-milwaukee-county-raises-questions-about-wisconsin-votes/,2020-11-06
"If Americans Can No Longer Trust Our Elections, We’re In Big Trouble","The polls from the major networks and universities promised a blue wave. President Trump was down by at least 10 points nationally, and by nearly that much or more in the major swing states. The few pollsters, including Trafalgar, who got 2016 and 2018 right and called 2020 a close race, were widely ridiculed.

Nate Silver, a leftwing poll analyst, was chief among the critics. Silver gave former Vice President Joe Biden a nearly 70 percent chance of winning Florida.

Immediately on Election Day, turnout looked good for the GOP. Trump won Florida decisively and by 8:30 p.m. Central Time, and made huge inroads in urban areas. While Hillary Clinton won Miami-Dade County by 30 points in 2016, the 2020 Trump ticket was down only single digits in the county.

That’s because Trump made significant gains among nonwhite Americans, and according to exit polls had the second-highest nonwhite share of the vote of any Republican since 1976. Cuban Americans are a big reason for Trump decisively winning Florida, but Trump’s gains with minority voters are a nationwide trend. The flipside was lower black and Hispanic turnout for Democrats—except for several major Democratic cities in contested swing states.

In other words, a significant margin of minority voters who didn’t defect to Trump decided not to vote. Indeed, a Bloomberg article days before the election cited anonymous Biden officials who said the campaign was worried about black and Hispanic turnout due to a lack of a ground game in these traditionally Democratic strongholds. But the warnings had gone unheeded.

Instead, the campaign hoped to make up these lost minority votes with gains in the suburbs, particularly among white women. In the end, Trump gained among white women compared to 2016, and only appeared to marginally lose votes from white men—many of which may have been upper-class suburban white men.

Back to Election Night

On election night, Trump’s decisive win in Florida was a bellwether to punters in the betting markets. The Trump campaign also seemed to outperform Election Day voting in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, especially given the turnout seen in Florida. A shy Trump vote did exist, especially in the suburbs among women, and the GOP was morphing into a working-class, increasingly multiracial party. Betting odds swung in Trump’s favor, peaking at around 85 percent.

That’s when things went south for the Trump campaign. In a yet unexplained move, states including Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin stopped releasing vote counts on election night. Fact-checkers have noted that these states didn’t stop counting—fair enough—but not why they stopped releasing the results of their counting.

Come 4 a.m. the next morning, huge amounts of fresh Biden votes were reported. Trump’s betting odds plummeted, and days later the media declared Biden to be the president-elect.

Except 70 percent of Trump voters, who comprise half the country, are convinced of massive election fraud. Yet corporate media has no intention of investigating claims of fraud. Instead, it has pivoted from saying there is “no evidence” of fraud, to saying that not enough evidence exists to overturn the results.

Contrary to the hope of Trump supporters, the courts will probably be powerless to sort these issues out. This is an incredibly dangerous moment for the country and may be a pivotal point in the future of America’s democratic republic. Did we just cross the Rubicon?

The Morning After

Before all else, we must go to the source of distrust over this election. Whereas Florida finished counting votes on election night, and has a system that knows roughly how many votes are outstanding and will be counted before election night is over, in key states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin an unknown number of ballots could come in at the last second. And they did.

For that, thank Democrat lawsuits to overturn state voting laws at the last second, using COVID as a pretext. For those who doubt that the suits were nakedly political, note that they looked like a wish list based on a bill Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi authored in 2019 to accomplish nationwide mail-in voting.

Many of the suits were quarterbacked by former Hillary Clinton campaign attorney Marc Elias, who was involved in manufacturing Russiagate’s Christopher Steele “dossier.” Like most things rotten in this country, particular blame should be placed on the courts that decided bureaucrats could unilaterally rewrite state laws to turn absentee voting into mail-in voting.

There was no good reason to remove requirements that absentee ballots arrive before the end of Election Day, nor to allow the fraud-welcoming practice of “ballot-harvesting.” The John Roberts Supreme Court stood idly by and let lower courts rip up longstanding state election law. Democrats and the media complain that the legislatures should have acquiesced and affirmed this judicial tyranny by changing the law to allow ballots to be counted before Election Day. That would have only put the legislature’s seal of approval on a mess that the courts stupidly created.

Mail-In Balloting Is an Easier Fraud Mark

Regardless of the existence or level of fraud in the 2020 election, it is a fact that mail-in balloting opens elections to the likelihood of massive fraud and chaos. First, there’s an easy opportunity for cheating, given the unknown number of ballots that can come in. Because ballots can be accepted after election day, an unscrupulous faction that lags in earlier counting can come up with the votes to make the difference.

Second, there’s less accountability for election officials. In a normal election, it is possible to immediately tell how many votes are cast and from where—once the votes are cast, all that’s left is to count the votes, because officials know by ward and precinct how many votes are in and what type have been cast (are the votes early in-person, absentee, or election day in-person?). Not so for mail-in voting.

One can have a recount, but that will only recount the same bad ballots.

Then, once the counting starts, mail-in voting brings problems of a haphazard chain of custody and reduced controls over voter-eligibility verification. All this is why one can have a recount, but that will only recount the same bad ballots.

The obvious problems with mail-in voting are not a rightwing conspiracy. France banned mail-in voting in the 1970s for these very reasons. In a recent New Jersey mail-in election, about 20 percent of the ballots cast were found to be fraudulent. A local New York election this year saw huge delays in processing ballots. A 2012 article in the New York Times warns that regular old absentee voting could screw up the electoral process, let alone allowing ballots to come in after election day.

Independent left-leaning journalist Glenn Greenwald writes Georgia had an 80 percent chance to go for Trump on election night, ostensibly because of a good Republican turnout. But so many ballots came in for Biden the next morning that the state ostensibly swung to Biden’s favor, due to major Democratic turnout in the Democratic stronghold of Fulton County.

This doesn’t prove fraud, but Greenwald calls this seesaw process in which many areas are counting votes nearly a week after the election a “disgrace.” “Distrust in U.S. outcomes [under such a system] is dangerous but rational,” writes Greenwald.

‘No Evidence’ of Any Fraud?

The media, Democrats, and many establishment Republicans have reflexively repeated that “no evidence” of fraud existed. Yet evidence does exist. The stories coming out of major vote-counting centers are shocking, and only add to the distrust. Dozens upon dozens of witnesses have signed affidavits attesting wrongdoing or highly inappropriate behavior from officials who are supposed to be impartial.

Detroit poll challengers have signed affidavits, under penalty of perjury, that they saw election workers counting ballots for non-eligible voters, and the double counting of voters. These persons say they were harassed constantly, and that election workers and Democratic operatives would get in their faces and start screaming if they raised a concern.

Federal agents threatened one of these whistleblowers, in an effort to get him to recant his story.

Some “election workers” appeared to be AFL-CIO activists. If concerns were raised, GOP poll challengers said, they were ushered from the room by the police and the entire room would cheer. They say election workers’ goal was to get as many GOP poll challengers as possible kicked out of that room.

Poll challengers also allege that they were pushed out of the room when the military ballots came in. Workers were sent to lunch; Democrats ate inside the building and the Republicans ate outside the area where votes were being counted, and the doors were locked so Republicans couldn’t get back in.

Irregularities alleged by these challengers aside from counting ineligible voters include ballots being dropped off by random vehicles, including a Mercedes Benz and a Ferrari, or arriving after the cutoff period. A sworn affidavit claims ballots were being “fraudulently and manually entered” when the person had no information and the birthdate was simply put as “1/1/1900.” Another Detroit GOP poll challenger says she witnessed names on ballots not coming up in the system but being counted nonetheless. When she raised concerns, she says she was kicked out.

Sworn affidavits by several U.S. Postal Service employees, in at least Pennsylvania and Michigan, along with a city employee from Detroit, alleged they were asked to backdate ballots (make ballots appear as if they were sent on election day) by their superiors. It was later revealed that federal agents threatened one of these whistleblowers, in an effort to get him to recant his story. A Clark County Nevada elections department employee says that his coworkers fabricated proof of residence data to allow ineligible voters.

In Philadelphia, GOP poll challengers had to sue to be allowed to observe what election workers were doing. Democratic state officials counter-sued to stop the access. While GOP poll challengers were moved forward in the room, the vote counters were moved further away, a mockery of state law that allows oversight of this process.

Photos of Philly vote counters show several women wearing Biden masks. A Trump campaign lawsuit has a sworn affidavit from a person who says he or she saw USB drives being delivered to the back of the room where voting machines were housed, and where observers were restricted.

In Philadelphia, GOP poll challengers had to sue to be allowed to observe what election workers were doing.

Meanwhile, the Georgia GOP state party chair claims Fulton County election officials told his observers to go home on election night because they were closing up, but then continued to count ballots “in secret.” In Wisconsin, election clerks allegedly altered “thousands” of absentee ballots to make them eligible.

Add to this multiple videos of what appears to be poll workers throwing away Trump ballots, and at least a handful of examples of dead persons voting. A conservative pollster, Richard Baris, claims to have found evidence of 10,000 deceased persons voting in Michigan. Others also claimed to have found thousands of dead voters in that state.

Meanwhile, Pennsylvania far exceeded its record for 90-year-olds registering to vote. In Nevada, multiple witnesses signed sworn affidavits that they saw a “Biden-Harris” van filling out loads of ballots.

Yes, Republicans have at least anecdotal evidence of fraud, although in one sense the media is right: these anecdotes are not evidence enough to overturn the election. That’s because there’s no way to quantify any of this evidence into an actual number of bad votes, even assuming all these claims are well-founded.

Then There Are the Statistical Anomalies

There’s more than anecdotal evidence, however. Observers and experts pointed out plenty of statistical anomalies. Some may turn out to be innocuous, or easily explainable. Others have been less well-explained.

First, Republicans took issue with the massive vote dumps for Biden that occurred overnight, in which Biden was getting nearly 100 percent of the vote. One of these was attributed to an extra zero and human error.

Michigan added almost 150,000 votes in one instance, all of which were for Biden except for about 6,000.

Silver tweeted that around 27,000 votes out of Philadelphia went “all for Biden.” In the face of obvious wonderment of how Biden could get 100 percent of such a large share of votes, Silver was quick to claim that election officials “unintentionally enter vote updates one candidate at a time, rather than entering all candidates together.” Maybe, but when votes stop getting reported and reporting starts coming in early in the morning with nearly 100 percent of votes coming in for Biden that justifiably raised eyebrows.

On a graph, these vote dumps in Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Pennsylvania resulted in Biden quickly jumping above Trump, and the odds of a Trump win plummeting. Michigan added almost 150,000 votes in one instance, all of which were for Biden except for about 6,000.

On election night, Trump led in Pennsylvania by almost 800,000 votes. The next morning, Trump’s lead shrunk to less than 100,000. Later, ballots found, including those apparently lingering with the U.S. Postal Service, supposedly put Biden over the edge.

Biden received an unbelievable amount of the mail-in share in Pennsylvania and Michigan.

Biden’s advantage in mail-in voting was to be expected, but the magnitude of the spikes for Biden in these select states is worth scrutiny. According to ballot requests across the country, GOP voters voted by mail too, just not with the same intensity as Democratic voters.

But while Trump received a reasonable share of the mail-in or absentee votes in places like Ohio, Biden received an unbelievable amount of the mail-in share in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Biden’s Pennsylvania mail-in total, excluding about 90,000 mail-in votes from libertarians and those with no party affiliation, equates to winning all the Democratic and Independent mail-in votes, and 9 percent of the GOP mail-in votes.

Said differently, Biden is up 60 points in absentee or mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania, and up by almost 40 points in Michigan. That’s not Biden receiving 60 percent of mail-in votes in Pennsylvania. That’s Biden receiving 80 percent of the mail-in vote. Comparably, Biden was only up single digits in absentee voting in most other battleground states. Biden’s mail-in advantage was 15 points in Ohio and 5 points in Minnesota.

There’s no reason to think Pennsylvania and Michigan should be outliers to national mail-in voting trends. Despite several comments by the president, the Trump campaign ground game in these states encouraged mail-in voting. In Michigan and Wisconsin, according to NBC News, Republicans actually led Democrats in mail-in ballots requested and returned. Yet the vast majority of the ballots that were counted after election day in these states were for Biden.

A Weird, Asymmetric Surge in Only Some Cities

No, this Biden surge in cities wasn’t driven by the suburbs abandoning Trump—Trump didn’t lose the suburbs any more than he lost them in 2016, and losses there were more than replaced by gains in working-class areas. These Biden votes were entirely driven by massive turnout in select Democratic strongholds in swing states. As mentioned before, this turnout was not consistent across the country. In parts of these cities, there was more turnout than registered voters.

Biden only had a net gain of 4,000 votes compared to Hillary Clinton in 2016 in Cuyahoga County (Cleveland), Ohio. Yet Biden had a net gain of almost 70,000 in Wayne County (Detroit), Michigan. In Minneapolis, Democrats bragged of 88 percent turnout—extremely high relative to the rest of the country and the state.

These Biden votes were entirely driven by massive turnout in select Democratic strongholds in swing states.

Biden also outperformed past Democrats in places like Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, where the population is declining. Barack Obama received 233,000 votes in the county in 2012, while Biden received 313,000 votes. In Georgia, a handful of counties had massively higher margins in terms of Biden votes compared to what Hillary Clinton received in 2016—totaling a net gain of more than 200,000 votes.

It was alleged by some conservatives that Wisconsin had an unreal amount of statewide turnout. That isn’t the case, but Milwaukee County did have sky-high turnout. In Milwaukee, Biden received more votes than Obama did in 2008, even though the population has declined by around 10 percent since that time. Milwaukee “updated” voting data for its wards after a newspaper pointed out that seven wards had more voters than registered voters, and showing turnout well above 100 percent.

Another oddity was the large number of Biden-only ballots with no votes down-ballot in these swing states, where courts had canned existing election law (including Georgia). For example, the difference between Trump and the GOP Senate candidates in Georgia was around 1,000 votes. But Biden received nearly 100,000 more votes than the Democratic Senate candidates. Some of these were split tickets, but the numbers suggest a huge amount of Biden-only ballots.

In Michigan, Trump received 7,000 more votes than the GOP Senate candidate. But Biden received 70,000 more votes than the Democratic Senate candidate. Apparently, 450,000 ballots in swing states had only a mark for Biden with no down-ballot votes. This amounts to a massive increase in ballots cast for only the presidential candidate in these states relative to history, and ballots like this were overwhelmingly of the mail-in variety.

Ticket-Splitting Was Low, and Congress Trended Red

Anti-Trump establishmentarians claimed everything was attributed to ticket splitting—surely a projection of their views onto the people of Middle America. But ticket splitting was normal, minimal, and went both ways. In fact, this year ticket-splitting nearly hit a historic low. If anything, Trump outperformed the GOP senatorial candidates in states like Michigan and Arizona. Either way, ticket splitting doesn’t explain all the votes for Biden with no down-ballot votes.

Another headscratcher is that, in what was supposed to be a blue-wave election, Democrats beat no Republican incumbents. They also lost around 10 seats (possibly more), and all but one of the nearly 30 races considered competitive.

Why does this matter for the presidential election? The only place Democrats were turning out to vote was in Democrat-run cities in swing states where election laws were thrown out. Again, contrary to the narrative from some establishment types, this wasn’t Republicans outperforming Trump. In the House Democratic campaign committee’s own panicked words, House Republicans were buoyed by Trump.

Republicans are more or less tied with Democrats in the national House popular vote. Trump had at least 1.5 million more votes than House Republicans, while Biden had 5.5 million more votes than House Democrats.

Big Ballot Dumps Trended Biden

Other statistical anomalies have been noticed. In Milwaukee, the number of ballots that were reported in a single batch was highly correlated with Biden receiving the vast majority of the votes—meaning, larger reports of ballots skewed heavily for Biden over smaller reports. This doesn’t prove anything nefarious, but it is an oddity nonetheless.

Biden votes appeared to surge later in areas of Milwaukee where Biden was not performing well. Although this could simply be due to unaccounted-for votes coming in, the phenomenon appears concentrated among wards where Democrats were underperforming, not where Democratic voters were most prevalent.

Ballots in Pennsylvania are also alleged to have arrived before they were sent, arrived the same day, or arrived just one day after being mailed out right before Election Day. A data analyst calls these instances of “fast traveling” ballots suspicious. The share of these fast-traveling ballots as a percent of overall mail-in ballots was incredibly high in Pennsylvania, totaling up to 100,000 ballots in a race with a margin of much less.

Most came from Lehigh County and Philadelphia. Ballots defined as suspicious were much more likely to be requested via mail instead of online. The data analyst calls it odd that the quick turnaround time would depend on how ballots were requested (mail requests somehow got done in a day, compared to online requests, which were more normal).

Late-arriving ballots were apparently a huge percent of the votes cast in several Pennsylvania counties. In general, these late-arriving ballots reduce confidence in the election system, fraud or no fraud.

Information Chaos

There were still other things to set GOP voters’ minds ablaze. Hilariously, Google searches for “election fraud punishment” spiked in Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania several days prior to the election.

Aside from anecdotal evidence of deceased voters, some alleged many thousands of deceased voters—a claim that has yet to be unproven. Former Democrat governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich, who was jailed for trying to sell Barack Obama’s Senate seat, confirmed conservatives’ suspicions even more. “In big cities where they control the political apparatus and they control the apparatus that counts the votes, and they control the polling places and the ones who count the votes, it’s widespread and it’s deep,” Blagojevich said.

Still other examples appear to have been false alarms. One picture showed voters with the birthdate listed as “1/1/1900.” While some poll workers are alleged to have improperly entered this date, and other birthdates have been found that can’t possibly be correct, some voters who were subject to spousal abuse or have other reasons for privacy have their birthdates entered as such. In another example, a viral video showed a poll worker filling out ballot after ballot—yet the election authority says that this is a regular part of the process, and the pollworker is evidently duplicating “damaged” ballots.

The Much-Discussed Software Issues

The spookiest thing thrown about in conservative circles involves allegations that Dominion, voting hardware and software used in a vast number of states and in all the swing states, changed vote tallies from Trump to Biden, or deleted Trump votes. What is certainly true is there were several Dominion-related errors, all of which took votes from Trump and gave them to Biden.

Votes were switched in Michigan on at least two separate instances. Dominion claims this was due to user error, but the Michigan GOP has called for a statewide investigation. Even if this was user error, it isn’t comforting that these errors could be so easily made using multi-million-dollar electronic voting machines.

The only place Democrats were turning out to vote was in Democrat-run cities in swing states where election laws were thrown out.

The New York Times is quick to point out that every confirmed error has been explained. But Republicans aren’t satisfied with the explanations when all the errors went against Trump, and speculate there could be many yet to be discovered. That’s because when votes were switched, these errors were only identified by authorities carefully tracking the issue—there was no clear-cut mechanism to flag this problem, which means it could be magnified across the country.

We also know that Dominion caused Georgia election-day voters to be initially turned away because of a glitch, which occurred in two Trump-leaning counties. A Georgia official said that Dominion “uploaded something last night, which is not normal, and it caused a glitch.”

A poll watcher in Georgia alleges that he or she saw a “suspicious [and yet unexplained] shift in votes while monitoring the interim election results on the Georgia secretary of state website.” There were also problems with Arizona voting machines on Election Day. Arizona’s secretary of state is refusing to investigate issues there, and conservatives were quick to point out that she had previously posted about Trump’s “base” being “neo-Nazis.”

Dominion has ties to prominent Democrats, too, adding to suspicions. This includes an overwhelming amount of donations going to Democrats, and a Dominion employee in charge of vote security participating in Antifa calls.

Republicans aren’t satisfied with the explanations when all the errors went against Trump.

Conservative blogs have alleged that thousands of votes were switched in Wisconsin, enough to give the state to Trump if true. Another blogger alleges that millions of votes were switched by Dominion, and this claim was tweeted by President Trump on Nov. 12.

The president’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is now saying that he has an affidavit from a Dominion worker in Michigan that 100,000 ballots for Biden were brought in the back door so they could “catch up with Trump.” Prominent Republican lawyer Sidney Powell claims Dominion was hacked, and others noticed a subtraction of vote totals in the live data from Virginia.

A data scientist claims there is a linear pattern of a declining Trump margin in more heavily Republican areas—which essentially steals votes from red areas and reduces Trump’s ability to run up the score there—in many key swing states.

These claims are fanciful, to put it nicely, but they deserve scrutiny and investigation. Dominion systems, at the very least, do appear to be prone to hacking. A federal judge and several senators, all Democrats, have criticized Dominion for security problems in the past. Texas decided not to use Dominion because of security issues.

Some allege that corruption was involved in granting massive contracts to Dominion in states like Georgia. Dominion might be completely unproblematic, but it is used in nearly 30 states, was used in all of the swing states, and should be scrutinized.

Can You Blame Them?

Four years ago, Republican voters would have accepted the current election results. That was before the Trump campaign was spied on, and a constant coup was underway to remove Trump from the presidency. That was before America saw massive riots and looting, resulting in countless injured and dead cops and citizens, while the corporate media ran cover for the rioters and looters.

Maybe Trump’s voters deserve to be skeptical about the outcome of this election. Silver and the other mainstream pollsters didn’t just promise that Trump and Republicans would be defeated soundly, they ridiculed those who said it would be a tight race. Trump’s supporters were again right to doubt the polls.

If Democrats believe half the things they are saying about Trump or his supporters, why wouldn’t massive vote fraud be justified and even moral?

The court-won destructions of state election law smacked Republicans as nakedly political. Nobody seriously believes that allowing mailed ballots to come in after the election has anything to do with actually protecting people from the pandemic, especially when the same officials applauding mail-in balloting have selectively applied coronavirus restrictions to reward their friends and punish their political enemies.

Democrats have compared Trump to Adolf Hitler and have widely called his supporters white supremacists and fascists. If they believe half the things they are saying about Trump or his supporters, why wouldn’t massive vote fraud be justified and even moral?

The same people who ranted about Russia hacking the 2016 election—to the point where almost 70 percent of Democrats falsely believed that Russia had hacked and changed vote totals—tell Trump’s base that it is dangerous and unpatriotic to doubt the results of this election. Russia, via a so-called troll farm, spent less than $100,000 on social media advertising before the 2016 election, but that didn’t stop House Democrats and many Senate Republicans from treating this spending like it was the biggest problem this country faced. The same people who think less than $100,000 of Russian social media advertising could sway an election say there is no way the election could be swayed by fraud.

The same people who think less than $100,000 of Russian advertising could sway an election say there is no way the election could be swayed by fraud.

The censorship of any post questioning any part of the election on social media and the denial and dismissal of obvious signs of fraud only add fuel to the fire. These fly in the face of common sense. Consider an article from the BBC in September 2016, about vote rigging in Africa. The article says that classic signs of fraud include “high turnout in specific areas,” and “delay in announcing results.” Note that states like Florida had high turnout, but it wasn’t hugely concentrated to certain areas and ballots were counted instantly.

After the election the rejection rate of mail-in (absentee) ballots may have plummeted in the key swing states, meaning officials there don’t appear to have checked ballot validity, even though millions more mail-in ballots were cast in 2020. Georgia is recounting votes, but not checking absentee ballot signatures. And Pennsylvania officials appear to have destroyed absentee ballot envelopes—in violation of state law—which are necessary to determine the validity of votes in an audit.

The Threat to Our Democracy

Nothing here proves election fraud changed 10,000 votes or 1,000,000 votes, and that’s partly the point. It isn’t possible to know what would have happened without a major recanvassing and audits. Even then, unlawful votes are extremely hard to undo. People asking for definitive proof of fraud that would result in a specific total of fraudulent votes are asking for the impossible. The election is supposed to be secure from the get-go.

Trump’s chances in the courts look slim, fraud or no fraud. The legal system is probably not equipped to handle these matters, given the alleged scale and egregiousness. Courts can’t go through ballot by ballot and figure this out. Instead, they would apply brightline rules, such as tossing out ballots in Pennsylvania that came in after a certain date.

People asking for definitive proof of fraud that would result in a specific total of fraudulent votes are asking for the impossible.

But since Pennsylvania officials failed to segregate these ballots, and corrupt officials violated the law and threw out the ballot envelopes, are the courts really ready to invalidate whole categories of votes from a swing state? The courts already failed the country by allowing perfectly decent election laws to be ignored.

Consider too that if Trump does pull off a shocking victory, America will see riots and violence in the streets unlike anything seen before. According to PredictIt, this has at least a one in ten chance of happening.

But if Trump loses his court challenges and recounts, his supporters aren’t going to forget about this. People are angry unlike anything this author has seen before. The Jeffrey Epstein affair, the FBI corruption, and the riots have completely eroded trust in basic institutions, especially on the right.

If the fraud alleged did occur, it was pre-planned, industrialized, and brazen. This isn’t 1960, where John F. Kennedy received more votes in Cook County than the number of people living there. It isn’t 2000, where a legal battle is ensuing over one state’s balloting issues.

Quite obviously, this is not a healthy democratic republic. It will be incredibly hard to deescalate from here.

This is an allegation that there was massive fraud, on a scale never seen before—and the allegation comes from about 50 million Americans. The allegation is plausible because the establishment denying it has hated Trump and his supporters from the get-go. Trump supporters deserve to be paranoid—they have been neither accepted nor understood.

The Republican Party may not like that its voters believe this, but at this point they are riding a tiger. Trump won’t go away, either. Yes, Trump made plenty of mistakes—he tried too hard to work with an establishment that viewed him as an existential threat, and realized only too late that it would never accept him—and in some ways governed too much like a traditional Republican. But Trump is now inseparably tied to the Republican base, largely because of how the establishment has brutalized him and his supporters.

Picture inauguration day: Biden is being sworn in, but Trump isn’t in D.C. Instead, he’s holding a massive rally in the Midwest. Republican Party officials and most politicians (privately at least) will screech at this, but at this point they have no control. They are along for the ride.

Note that these things are happening when the economy is relatively good for most Americans, despite the coronavirus pandemic. Imagine what happens if this is no longer the case. Quite obviously, this is not a healthy democratic republic. It will be incredibly hard to deescalate from here, and that should terrify Americans.

Have We Crossed the Rubicon?

Let’s put this even more bluntly. After the election, Tucker Carlson had a segment on how Republicans dodged a bullet in 2020 by holding the Senate. But with mail-in balloting, how sure can Republicans be that they will hold the two seats in Georgia?

Many establishment Republicans and party insiders are happy to move on from Trump and have touted the good night other Republican candidates had. The base isn’t going to move on from Trump, could care less about Republican senators, and wonders if the country will have a fair election again.

If mail-in ballots go away next time, all this worry was for nothing. But Democrats are unlikely to give up mail-in balloting given the power it provides. If cheating did occur, and it is unaddressed, it will certainly happen again. Maybe Republican areas have 120 percent turnout next election. See how this works?

Overall, people feel like America has been sliding for decades, and indeed the American working class has been sliding for decades. If people begin to feel like elections no longer matter, the only avenue to settle differences is through force and violence. The far-left in this country has already skipped belief in the electoral system and reached this conclusion. How else does a divided people settle disputes without the ballot box?

At the Point of No Return?

The phrase “crossing the Rubicon” refers to the moment Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon River, which precipitated the Roman Civil War and the end of the Roman Republic. It’s like saying “the point of no return.” People can laugh at what this is implying, but America is reaching a dangerous point if the people—on both sides—no longer trust elections.

Only a few things can walk us back from the ledge. First, Democrats need to drop the push for mail-in balloting. The fear, however, is that Democrats won’t be able to resist the advantage this gives them. Trump not leaving politics will provide moral ammo, in Democrats’ minds, for not taking the high road. Plus, even when Trump does get too old for politics, the movement he started isn’t going away.

Next, Biden should be calling for a full auditing of the election, especially in the swing states, if he really wants to bring the country together. This is highly unlikely to happen, however, and Biden’s moves are being closely handled even as D.C. is springing into action in anticipation of the administration change.

Biden should be calling for a full auditing of the election, especially in the swing states, if he really wants to bring the country together.

Republicans in Michigan and Pennsylvania want a full audit before the legislature certifies the results, which is both their right and good for the country. But any audit that results in success for the Trump campaign will result in chaos and violence, given how poorly the media is covering these issues. And Democrats are fighting hard to pressure the swing-state legislatures to certify the results without an audit.

No, there won’t be a revote. The small fraud that got Democrats a new congressional election earlier this year can’t happen for a presidential election, given timetables set by the Constitution. No matter what happens, the courts won’t decide this in a way that is acceptable to more than half the country.

So this is the massive risk our country faces going into the 2020s: if one side no longer agrees to play by the rules of a game, the game is over. It appears that with Trump as an excuse, the left believes the rules of the game no longer apply. The political right is approaching the point where they feel the same way.

Joe Biden: Why Are Reporters Asking Me Questions?,"Former Vice President Joe Biden isn’t used to getting real questions. On Friday, Biden appeared dumbfounded as to why a reporter was asking the projected Democratic presidential-elect a question as the press pool was being scurried away by staff.

“Mr. Biden, the COVID task force said it’s safe for students to be in class. Are you going to encourage unions to cooperate more to bring kids back to classrooms, sir?” asked CBS reporter Bo Erickson.

“Why are you the only guy that always shouts out questions?” Biden said.

Asked Biden if he will encourage teacher unions to cooperate to get kids back in school because the COVID task force said it is safe to be in the classroom. He didn't answer. “Why are you the only guy that always shouts out questions?” he said. pic.twitter.com/x2DsG5Fmgo — Bo Erickson CBS (@BoKnowsNews) November 20, 2020

It was a bizarre episode for the 78-year-old Democrat, who enjoyed the least amount of media scrutiny on the campaign trail of any modern candidate running for president. While serious revelations were emerging, revealing Biden’s role in his son’s potentially criminal overseas business dealings, reporters asked hard-hitting questions such as what kind of ice cream Biden purchased at a pit stop.

Erickson was also one of the few reporters to ask Biden about the scandals plaguing his campaign, bombshells suppressed by Big Tech and either ignored or dubiously delegitimized by other mainstream outlets. When pressed on the issue, Biden lashed out at the media.

I asked Joe Biden: What is your response to the NYPost story about your son, sir? He called it a “smear campaign” and then went after me. “I know you’d ask it. I have no response, it’s another smear campaign, right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask.” pic.twitter.com/Eo6VD4TqxD — Bo Erickson CBS (@BoKnowsNews) October 17, 2020

Erickson’s treatment of the former vice president Friday was the same treatment the media offered to President Donald Trump and his staff throughout the entire last four years, which was on full display again in the White House briefing room on the same day.

Meanwhile, one would be hard-pressed to find California Sen. Kamala Harris, Biden’s running mate, at any point throughout the entire general election campaign taking a single question from a reporter during a press conference.

The media gave a preview of how it would treat a Biden administration on Monday, when Biden began speaking with reporters, who lobbed him softball questions. Joe Concha, a media reporter for The Hill, dubbed the incoming presidential press corps “The new marshmallow media in the Biden era,” in a column published Thursday.

“Any press conference Biden has held since capturing the Democratic nomination has consisted mostly of questions about President Trump and very few questions about Biden’s own worldview, record, policy stances or perspective on important issues such as trade, foreign affairs, gun control, immigration, education, or taxation as it relates to repealing the Trump tax cuts,” Concha wrote. “Of the 12 questions Biden received Monday, there were zero follow-ups. Zero interruptions during answers. Zero questions about any of the issues above, which rank as among the top concerns on voters’ minds, along with the coronavirus.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/11/21/joe-biden-why-are-reporters-asking-me-questions/,2020-11-21
5 More Ways Joe Biden Magically Outperformed Election Norms,"This article has been corrected.*

In all the excitement among objective journalists for Joe Biden’s declared victory, reporters are missing how extraordinary the Democrat’s performance was in the 2020 election. It’s not just that the former vice president is on track to become the oldest president in American history, it’s what he managed to accomplish at the polls this year.

Candidate Joe Biden was so effective at animating voters in 2020 that he received a record number of votes, more than 15 million more than Barack Obama received in his re-election of 2012. Amazingly, he managed to secure victory while also losing in almost every bellwether county across the country. No presidential candidate has been capable of such electoral jujitsu until now.

While Biden underperformed Hillary Clinton’s 2016 totals in every urban county in the United States, he outperformed her in the metropolitan areas of Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Even more surprising, the former VP put up a record haul of votes, despite Democrats’ general failures in local House and state legislative seats across the nation.

He accomplished all this after receiving a record low share of the primary vote compared to his Republican opponent heading into the general election. Clearly, these are tremendous and unexpected achievements that would normally receive sophisticated analysis from the journalist class but have somehow gone mostly unmentioned during the celebrations at news studios in New York City and Washington, D.C.

The massive national political realignment now taking place may be one source of these surprising upsets. Yet still, to have pulled so many rabbits out of his hat like this, nobody can deny that Biden is a first-rate campaigner and politician, the likes of which America has never before seen. Let’s break down just how unique his political voodoo has been in 2020.

1. 80 Million Votes

Holy moly! A lot of Americans turned out for a Washington politician who’s been in office for nearly 50 years. Consider this: no incumbent president in nearly a century and a half has gained votes in a re-election campaign and still lost.

President Trump gained more than ten million votes since his 2016 victory, but Biden’s appeal was so substantial that it overcame President Trump’s record support among minority voters. Biden also shattered Barack Obama’s own popular vote totals, really calling into question whether it was not perhaps Biden who pulled Obama across the finish lines in 2008 and 2012.

Proving how sharp his political instincts are, the former VP managed to gather a record number of votes while consistently trailing President Trump in measures of voter enthusiasm. Biden was so savvy that he motivated voters unenthusiastic about his campaign to vote for him in record numbers.

2. Winning Despite Losing Most Bellwether Counties

Biden is set to become the first president in 60 years to lose the states of Ohio and Florida on his way to election. For a century, these states have consistently predicted the national outcome, and they have been considered roughly representative of the American melting pot as a whole. Despite national polling giving Biden a lead in both states, he lost Ohio by eight points and Florida by more than three.

For Biden to lose these key bellwethers by notable margins and still win the national election is newsworthy. Not since the Mafia allegedly aided John F. Kennedy in winning Illinois over Richard Nixon in 1960 has an American president pulled off this neat trick.

Even more unbelievably, Biden is on his way to winning the White House after having lost almost every historic bellwether county across the country. The Wall Street Journal and The Epoch Times independently analyzed the results of 19 counties around the United States that have nearly perfect presidential voting records over the last 40 years. President Trump won every single bellwether county, except Clallam County in Washington.

Whereas the former VP picked up Clallam by about three points, President Trump’s margin of victory in the other 18 counties averaged over 16 points. In a larger list of 58 bellwether counties that have correctly picked the president since 2000, Trump won 51 of them by an average of 15 points, while the other seven went to Biden by around four points. Bellwether counties overwhelmingly chose President Trump, but Biden found a path to victory anyway.

4. Biden Won Despite Democrat Losses Everywhere Else

Randy DeSoto noted in The Western Journal that “Donald Trump was pretty much the only incumbent president in U.S. history to lose his re-election while his own party gained seats in the House of Representatives.” Now that’s a Biden miracle!

In 2020, The Cook Political Report and The New York Times rated 27 House seats as toss-ups going into Election Day. Right now, Republicans appear to have won all 27. Democrats failed to flip a single state house chamber, while Republicans flipped both the House and Senate in New Hampshire and expanded their dominance of state legislatures across the country.

Christina Polizzi, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, went so far as to state: “It’s clear that Trump isn’t an anchor for the Republican legislative candidates. He’s a buoy.” Amazingly, Biden beat the guy who lifted all other Republicans to victory. Now that’s historic!

5. Biden Overcame Trump’s Commanding Primary Vote

In the past, primary vote totals have been remarkably accurate in predicting general election winners. Political analyst David Chapman highlighted three historical facts before the election.

First, no incumbent who has received 75 percent of the total primary vote has lost re-election. Second, President Trump received 94 percent of the primary vote, which is the fourth highest of all time (higher than Dwight Eisenhower, Nixon, Clinton, or Obama). In fact, Trump is only one of five incumbents since 1912 to receive more than 90 percent of the primary vote.

Third, Trump set a record for most primary votes received by an incumbent when more than 18 million people turned out for him in 2020 (the previous record, held by Bill Clinton, was half that number). For Biden to prevail in the general election, despite Trump’s historic support in the primaries, turns a century’s worth of prior election data on its head.

Joe Biden achieved the impossible. It’s interesting that many more journalists aren’t pointing that out.

* This article’s third point originally quoted Patrick Basham‘s citation of pollster Richard Baris and election analyst Robert Barnes’ claims that “Biden underperformed Hillary Clinton in every major metro area around the country, save for Milwaukee, Detroit, Atlanta and Philadelphia.” Post-results vote analysis shows this is inaccurate.

Poll: One In Six Biden Voters Would Have Changed Their Vote If They Had Known About Scandals Suppressed By Media,"A new report from the Media Research Center shows that the media’s lack of coverage and big tech’s suppression of certain issues and scandals surrounding Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden could have cost President Donald Trump the election.

The survey results report that 17 percent of Biden voters would not have voted for the Biden-Harris presidential ticket if they had known about at least one of the eight news stories that were suppressed by big tech and mainstream media outlets.

“This is not happenstance. This is not coincidence. This is not oversight and this is not just a mistake,” president and founder of Media Research Center Brent Bozell said at a press conference Tuesday. “These were deliberate decisions that were made thousands of times, literally thousands of times, to either twist or to not cover it at all, which we found in this case.”

The survey, conducted online by The Polling Company with a +/- 2.34 percent margin of error at a 95 percent confidence interval, asked 1,750 Biden voters living in seven swing states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) if they were aware of certain issues surrounding Biden, his family, and some of the Trump administration’s successes.

Some of these topics include former Biden staffer Tara Reade and her sexual assault allegations against Biden, the Hunter Biden scandal, VP Nominee Kamala Harris’s extreme liberal voting record in the Senate, the U.S.’s economic jump in the third quarter, millions of jobs added, America’s energy independence, Operation Warp Speed successes, and Trump’s facilitation of multiple peace deals in the Middle East.

“The media can talk all day long about Donald Trump and about things that he’s doing wrong. It is absolutely unequivocal, the evidence, that it was the national news media that deliberately, and I underscore deliberately, made it a point, not to tell the public about these stories that nobody can question weren’t important stories,” Bozell said. “We showed that they covered it up, and now we’re showing the evidence that it costs Donald Trump the election.”

Over a quarter of Biden voters said they didn’t know Sen. Harris had the most liberal voting record in the Senate in 2019, and nearly half of all Biden voters polled, 49 percent, said they were unaware of the U.S.’s remarkable economic recovery in the third quarter, doubling the previous record.

One in six Biden voters polled, 17 percent, said they would have changed their vote had they been aware of these stories. The report also found that without even voting for Trump and simply refusing to vote for Biden, “these voters would have handed all six of these states, and a second term, to the president if the news media had properly informed them about the two candidates.”

Each swing state surveyed also produced high numbers of Biden voters who would have defected if they had known the full story.

In Pennsylvania and Georgia, 15 percent of Biden’s voters would have refrained from casting a vote for him. In Michigan, it was 14 percent. In Arizona, it was 21 percent. In Wisconsin, it was 13 percent. And in Nevada, it was 18 percent.

The significant numbers, the report states, “would have moved every one of the swing states into Trump’s column, some by a huge margin.”

“The president would have won the electoral college 311 to 227,” Bozell said.

These results, Bozell said, shows a deliberate effort by big tech and the media to suppress information and must be combated.

“The national news media stole this election,” Bozell concluded. “As far as I’m concerned, they stole it from President Trump by deliberately censoring and keeping from the American people those stories which, had the American people known, would have led to his reelection unquestionably.”

Georgia Candidates Have To Answer For Biden's Health Care Hypocrisy,"Both of the Democratic candidates in Georgia’s two Senate elections want to focus their runoff campaigns on health care. For instance, at a recent rally, Rev. Raphael Warnock, the Democrat challenging Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., claimed “it must be really hard to explain why you’re for getting rid of health care in the middle of a pandemic.”

If Warnock wants to have that debate, then bring it on. The two Republican candidates, and conservatives in general, should welcome this focus, by highlighting the astounding differences between Democratic Party rhetoric on health care and former Vice President Joe Biden’s actions.

Perhaps then Warnock and Jon Ossoff, the Democratic candidate in the other Georgia Senate race, can explain why Biden failed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes that fund Obamacare and Medicare. Does that mean Biden wants to “get rid of health care in the middle of a pandemic,” as Warnock claimed — and if so, then why on earth do Warnock and Ossoff support Biden?

Biden’s Tax Scheme

While the media have spent the past four years hyperventilating about Donald Trump’s taxes, they’ve all but ignored a significant issue with Biden’s. From 2017 through 2019 Biden and his wife Jill funneled more than $13.5 million of their book and speech income as profits paid by two corporations, CelticCapri Corporation and Giacoppa Corporation. By booking this income as corporate profits, rather than wages, the Bidens avoided paying payroll taxes on most of their earnings.

The payroll taxes the Bidens circumvented fund health-care programs that they and Democrats in general claim to support. Specifically, they avoided paying a 2.9 percent Medicare tax on their $13.5 million in corporate profits, as well as an additional 0.9 percent payroll tax imposed in Section 9015 of Obamacare. Last year, tax experts interviewed by the Wall Street Journal called the Bidens’ actions “pretty aggressive,” and found no reason to justify the scheme other than payroll tax avoidance.

Where Do the Candidates Stand on Biden’s Tax Avoidance?

The Democrat Senate candidates should have to answer for the behavior of the man at the top of their ticket. For instance, Ossoff’s health-care platform says that “people with pre-existing conditions are under attack.” So, does Ossoff believe Biden’s deliberate avoidance of Obamacare taxes constitutes an attack on people with pre-existing conditions? If not, how does he think Biden failing to pay $121,628 in Obamacare levies helped people with life-threatening illnesses?

Likewise, Warnock has called for Georgia to expand Medicaid because “Georgians continue to pay taxes to give people in other states access to health care, while we go without.” In that case, what does Rev. Warnock think of Biden not paying more than $120,000 in Obamacare taxes, which, according to his platform, would have “give[n] people…access to health care?”

Both Ossoff and Warnock claim to support Medicare. Ossoff said he “will oppose cuts to Medicare or Medicaid and will vote to strengthen Medicare,” while Warnock claims he will “fight back against efforts by Washington politicians to slash Medicare funding.”

But by taking most of his book and speech income as corporate profits instead of wages, Biden — a Washington politician if ever there was one — avoided paying a whopping $391,912 in Medicare taxes, or more than twice what the average couple will pay over their entire working career. Do Ossoff and Warnock believe the Bidens not paying Medicare taxes strengthens or weakens the program — and what do they plan to do about it?

Ossoff and Warnock: Rubber Stamps for the Left?

During his presidential campaign, Biden repeatedly claimed in campaign ads that Obamacare “is personal to me.” But his actions dodging more than half a million dollars in Obamacare and Medicare taxes say otherwise.

Conservatives should spend the next month-plus asking Ossoff and Warnock whether they agree with the Bidens’ tax avoidance scheme.

Here Are All The Times Joe Biden Falsely Claimed Stories About Hunter Were Debunked,"For months, former Vice President Joe Biden has vehemently denied that any evidence exists that his son, Hunter, was involved in criminal activity or wrongdoing. These denials now look like dishonesty after the Biden-Harris transition team released a statement Wednesday acknowledging that Hunter is indeed under investigation by the Department of Justice for potential tax crimes.

“I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs,” Hunter wrote in the statement.

This news, as Federalist Editor Mollie Hemingway pointed out, is not actually new and was reported before the election, but was purposefully suppressed by gatekeepers like Facebook, Twitter, and corporate media outlets who ignored the reporting on Hunter Biden’s affairs. In October, the New York Post and others reported Biden’s knowledge and potential involvement in his son’s overseas business dealings during his time as vice president. A few weeks later, investigative reporter James Rosen broke news that the FBI was investigating Hunter for money laundering.

As early as 2019, Biden began to deny that Hunter or anyone else in the Biden family ever did anything wrong, ignoring the concerns of some about Hunter’s affiliation with the Ukrainian energy company “Burisma.”

“Every single, solitary, serious investigation, including your network and others, have looked at this, have said there’s absolutely zero basis to the accusation that I had acted anyway inappropriately or that my son did,” Biden said at a presidential town hall in Iowa.

In an interview with Axios on HBO, Biden seemed appalled that a reporter even dared to ask him about his son’s foreign business and work.

“I mean, come on, this is — (laughs) — you guys are amazing,” Biden responded when the reporter asked him about Hunter’s business dealings.

“So you think everything that happened was kosher?” the reporter shot back.

“You know there’s not one single bit of evidence, not one little tiny bit that says anything done was wrong. You know that,” Biden continued.

In the same interview, Biden denied knowing anything about his son’s dealings except for the fact that Hunter was on the board of Burisma, a fact he said wasn’t disclosed until after it occurred.

Shortly before one of the Democratic presidential debates, Biden echoed these denials, instead choosing to shift the blame on President Donald Trump.

“Every major national, international, and local news operations looked into it and said it’s a lie. This is a president who’s flat-lying,” he said.

In February this year, when NBC’s Savannah Guthrie pressed Biden on whether it was appropriate for his son to take the Burisma board position, Biden lashed out, saying, “Well that’s not true. You’re saying things you do not know what you’re talking about.”

“No one has found anything wrong with his dealings with Ukraine,” Biden told Guthrie.

The claims continued for the rest of his campaign all the way through the election, where he repeated multiple times that “there’s not been one scintilla of evidence that my son ever interfered, that he ever asked me anything, that I ever got involved in anything.”

Instead of addressing the evidence and emails presented from a laptop belonging to Hunter, Biden’s only acknowledged the New York Post, which alleged the former VP was introduced to a senior adviser to Burisma through Hunter while Joe was the “public face” of the Obama administration’s policy towards Ukraine, was when he called it a “smear campaign,” and blamed the press for asking questions about it.

“I know you’d ask it. I have no response, it’s another smear campaign, right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask,” he said.

I asked Joe Biden: What is your response to the NYPost story about your son, sir? He called it a “smear campaign” and then went after me. “I know you’d ask it.

Biden and his team also latched onto a rumor started by Rep. Adam Schiff that Russia was somehow behind the release of the evidence.

“Giuliani, he is being used as a Russian pawn– he is being fed information that is not true,” Biden said from the presidential debate stage in October.

“We have shared no intelligence with Chairman Schiff or any other member of Congress that Hunter Biden’s laptop is part of some Russian disinformation campaign,” Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said. “It’s simply not true.”

Where's Hunter? His Corruption Resurfaces Now That Joe Biden Won,"“Where’s Hunter, fat?” This question, which got anonymous conservative Twitter personality Comfortably Smug suspended from the platform, has come to define Silicon Valley’s approach to handling scandals surrounding their preferred presidential candidate. The question, mocking former Vice President Joe Biden for fat-shaming an Iowa voter for making accusations later shown to be true, is now more relevant than ever.

On Wednesday, Hunter Biden re-emerged in the spotlight after the Biden-Harris transition team released a statement that the president-elect’s son is under investigation by the Justice Department for potential tax crimes.

“I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs,” Hunter admitted through his father’s transition team.

While the detail on Hunter’s taxes might be new, the existence of a federal investigation into the Biden family finances had already been reported just days before the November election. Big tech and big media just throttled it, and as with other big stories, the Biden team is just playing along as if corporate media gets to define reality.

On Oct. 29, Sinclair’s James Rosen revealed the FBI was still conducting an ongoing money-laundering investigation into Hunter Biden.

EXCLUSIVE: Tony Bobulinski tells @WeAreSinclair he was questioned by six @FBI agents, with counsel present, for five hours on October 23, listing him as a ""material witness"" in an ongoing investigation focused on Hunter Biden and his associates. His cell phones were examined. pic.twitter.com/5lPzRTREJN — James Rosen (@JamesRosenTV) October 29, 2020

At the time, however, legacy media was maintaining a barricade against reporting the major news threatening to impede their candidate’s chances to land four years in the White House. It was the same media routinely dismissing the blockbuster reporting from the New York Post implicating Joe Biden in his son’s potentially criminal overseas business activity as Russian disinformation, contrary to statements from FBI, the Department of Justice, the director of national intelligence, and the Department of State.

What corporate coverage there was of the Biden bombshells — revealing the presidential candidate stood to rake in millions from Chinese communist leaders, lied repeatedly when denying conversations about his son’s business, and leveraged his high-powered position to benefit the family — almost immediately dropped off even as they became more important in light of his White House ascent.

Now legacy outlets that derided the biggest story of the entire campaign as Russian interference to excuse their activism are treating Wednesday’s statement from Biden as a brand-new story.

Before Wednesday, The New York Times hadn’t published a single news story containing the name “Hunter Biden” since the election, other than one article complaining that conservative media had given ink and air time to the scandal. Not much more attention was given to the president-elect’s son by the Washington Post or CNN. Several stories will come up featuring December dates, when the admission from the Biden team forced the newsrooms that protected the Democratic ticket from journalism to actually report on the investigation, but it would be unwise to finally expect fair coverage.

In their homepage story on Wednesday’s statement from Hunter Biden, CNN omitted any mention of family business partner-turned whistleblower Tony Bobulinski, who in October claimed these business deals through Hunter have compromised Joe Biden with communist China.

Despite their homepage headline about Hunter Biden, a search for “Bobulinski,” the former business associate of Hunter who spoke out before the election about the Biden family’s shady dealings, still comes up empty at @CNN. pic.twitter.com/6KSdDhhsns — Drew Holden (@DrewHolden360) December 10, 2020

Neither did The New York Times in theirs.

It is particularly egregious from @nytimes because one of their stories is about how the “November surprise” of Bobulinski never gained traction. Funny that. pic.twitter.com/Y8p4aOUBUx — Drew Holden (@DrewHolden360) December 10, 2020

Outlets that relied on anonymous sources for years to promote their Russiagate hoax built on the Democrat Party-funded junk Steele opposition research will likely defend their decision to neglect Bobulinski in their reporting by claiming Bobulinski was not credible. One can easily imagine how credible Bobulinski would suddenly appear to them if he began defaming the outgoing president. After all, former CIA Director John Brennan still gets a platform despite his decades of proven lies.

Before Biden cements his grip on power, however, Attorney General William Barr ought to put a special counsel in place to ensure the wide-ranging charges of corruption are properly investigated absent more Democratic disruption.

This is why AG Barr needs to appoint a Special Counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. It would be wildly inappropriate if his dad’s AG was involved in this matter. https://t.co/RUYVAyARE3 — Rep. Ken Buck (@RepKenBuck) December 9, 2020

"Joe Biden Deflects Questions From The Press, Stays Silent On Son's Criminal Investigation","Former vice president Joe Biden refused to answer questions about his son, Hunter Biden, who is under ongoing tax investigation by the Justice Department and was the subject of a series of stories in the New York Post about his potentially criminal foreign business activity.

When asked by a reporter about the investigation, which gained traction with the mainstream media this week despite being previously reported, Biden avoided the question, only replying that he was “proud of his son.”

“Did Hunter Biden commit a crime?” one reporter asked. “Have you spoken to your son, Mr. President-elect?”

“I’m proud of my son,” Biden replied as he exited the room.

While the former vice president took less than half of the number of questions President Donald Trump did on the campaign trail, Biden has a history of refusing to take questions, often walking off his campaign stages while ignoring the shouts of reporters or simply calling a lid many days, a label used by the campaign to announce Biden would not be made available for any public events or interviews.

Even during presidential debates, Biden blatantly refused to answer tough questions, even on his own policy positions.

“Are you going to pack the court?” both debate moderator Chris Wallace and opponent President Trump asked Biden.

“I’m not going to answer that question,” he replied, later snapping “will you shut up, man?”

Biden also played the victim when a reporter asked him about the science behind students returning to school during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Mr. Biden, the COVID task force said it’s safe for students to be in class. Are you going to encourage unions to cooperate more to bring kids back to classrooms, sir?” asked CBS reporter Bo Erickson.

“Why are you the only guy that always shouts out questions?” Biden shot back.

Erickson previously asked Biden about the New York Post’s story about his knowledge of his son Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings to which the Democratic candidate replied that it was a “smear campaign” and once again, insulted the reporter for asking.

“I know you’d ask it. I have no response, it’s another smear campaign, right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask,” Biden said.

I asked Joe Biden: What is your response to the NYPost story about your son, sir? He called it a “smear campaign” and then went after me. “I know you’d ask it.

Does Big Tech Face Regrets For Killing Their Reputations To Rig 2020?,"Do Facebook and Twitter regret blowing up their reputations to save Joe Biden? Some executives might, but they won’t admit it.

Few stories can better encapsulate the bias of our Silicon Valley tech overlords, who have assumed unique and powerful roles facilitating American elections in the 21st-century tech-dominated era than the Hunter Biden saga this fall.

On Oct. 14., The New York Post published its first in a series of exposés blowing back the curtain on Biden family corruption, an October surprise unearthing groundbreaking revelations in a story that began to unravel over Democrats’ impeachment play last year.

Emails the Post obtained from a Delaware laptop abandoned at a computer repair shop revealed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had lied when making repeated denials of ever discussing business with his son. Biden’s lies extended through the primaries.

The 77-year-old candidate even fat-shamed an Iowa voter for bringing the story up of Hunter Biden serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company despite no prior experience in the industry while raking in upwards of $50,000 a month in excess compensation. At the time of Hunter’s lucrative overseas board gig in Ukraine, Joe Biden was serving as the “public face” of the Obama White House’s policy towards the eastern European ally.

Facebook and Twitter promptly shut down the story after spending two years censoring President Donald Trump and the Republican’s affiliated campaign accounts at least 65 times between each platform while not doing the same to Biden once.

Without providing an explanation for hours after it disabled users’ ability to link the Post’s story, Twitter eventually explained it had blocked sharing because the article included “hacked” content. The nation’s oldest newspaper was also locked out of its account in a suspension that eventually lasted two weeks despite more evidence coming forward to corroborate its reporting and cement its credibility, including the existence of an FBI probe featuring federal investigators who had also retrieved the laptop contents reported by the Post.

Through a spokesperson who had been a Democratic staffer, Facebook released a statement moments after the Post’s first bombshell that the platform would preemptively suppress the story until its third-party fact-checkers censored it officially.

While I will intentionally not link to the New York Post, I want be clear that this story is eligible to be fact checked by Facebook's third-party fact checking partners. In the meantime, we are reducing its distribution on our platform. — Andy Stone (@andymstone) October 14, 2020

It’s clear however, considering legacy media’s favorite stories of the Trump era, that neither platform enforced its rules consistently.

If they had, they would have censored stories related to the president’s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart that became the basis for impeachment, the president’s tax returns, Michael Flynn’s phone call with the Russian ambassador, the Democrat National Committee-funded Steele dossier, Donald Trump Jr.’s WikiLeaks emails, The Atlantic’s anonymously-sourced story in September charging Trump with out-of-character remarks disparaging American troops, The Atlantic’s story about a shooting it made up, secretly recorded Trump audio, secretly recorded Melania Trump audio, and smears against the Covington Catholic students at the March for Life in Washington D.C.

Yet, while Facebook claimed the Hunter Biden story first needed to be cleared by the arbiters of truth at the company, some of which are either funded by communist China or run by partisan leftists who have gone on record to trash Republicans as racist, questions remain surrounding Facebook’s selective censorship.

Did the fact-checkers at Facebook ever make their findings public? Have they retracted or altered their checks after last week’s statement from Hunter Biden that he is under an ongoing FBI investigation? Will these entities remain fact-checking partners going forward?

Has Facebook detailed which of its paid Fact Check partners were the basis for it suspending the Hunter Biden story's spread? Have these partners retracted or altered their checks? Will they remain Fact Check partners going forward given such obvious inaccuracy? — Ben Domenech (@bdomenech) December 11, 2020

Facebook did not respond to The Federalist’s request for answers on these questions.

Legacy corporate media is just as guilty of election interference on behalf of their preferred presidential candidate, chalking up the Post’s blockbuster reporting to Russian disinformation, regurgitating Democrat talking points on the issue. Never mind that the myth of Russian disinformation about the Hunter Biden laptop had been disputed with on-the-record statements from the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Department of National Intelligence, and the Department of State all prior to the November contest. The typical culprits of corporate disinformation stuck to their debunked narrative, including CNN, the Washington Post, and the taxpayer-funded activists at National Propaganda Radio.

We now know that the Biden family is the subject of at least three federal investigations under Justice Department offices in Delaware, in New York probing Hunter Biden’s finances, and in Pennsylvania, where Politico reported prosecutors are examining hospital deals involving Joe Biden’s brother James.

What’s public surrounding the Biden family business ventures leveraging Joe Biden’s political status have likely only scratched the surface of the family’s operations. There still remain transactions detailed in a September Senate report released by Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin where the circumstances remain relatively unknown.

Senate investigators found, for example, that Hunter Biden took $3.5 million from an ex-Moscow mayor’s wife. Senate investigators also flagged a six-figure shopping spree for Hunter Biden, James Biden, and James’s wife paid for by Chinese businessman backed by the Chinese Communist Party as potentially criminal.

Hunter Biden business partner-turned whistleblower named Tony Bobulinski came forward in October to offer further details into the family practices, raising concern that the president-elect might be compromised by China. It’s an extreme claim if true, but it’s one with far more credibility than ever existed for claims that President Donald Trump was compromised by the Russians.

It’s undeniably clear the Hunter Biden stories several months ago had merit, and warranted serious, uncensored coverage in the midst of a presidential campaign as voters made their decision who place in the nation’s highest office for the next four years. While big tech’s election interference might have saved them the election, it likely also came at a long-lasting cost, destroying their credibility as platforms presiding over the 21st-century public square and exposing them as publishers making editorial decisions that hide the truth.

With that will likely come enhanced regulation of the Silicon Valley tech giants wielding unchecked power, a consequence for the tech elites for sure. But worse, the blatantly unfair censorship further erodes institutional trust, which the nation needs for self-preservation and national harmony.

The United States is now well on its way to becoming a nation where two sides can’t even share the same online platform, and that is an ugly predicament.

Susan Rice's Domestic Policy Will Just Be Her Foreign Policy Renamed,"Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador and National Security Adviser under President Barack Obama, is set to become Biden’s domestic policy adviser, but her only experience is in foreign policy, an area in which she has continually failed the American people.

While the Biden transition team’s press release claimed that “Rice is among our nation’s most senior and experienced government leaders with the skills to harness the power of the federal government to serve the American people,” Rice does not have a domestic policy record worth lauding.

As a matter of fact, her political resume solely consists of foreign policy spanning from her time as the assistant secretary of state for African affairs in the Clinton State Department, her position as a senior foreign policy fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, her time as senior foreign policy adviser for the Kerry/Edwards presidential campaign, serving as American ambassador to the U.N. and eventually becoming Obama’s national security advisor. She concluded her time in the Obama White House only to move on to American University as a visiting research fellow focused on, you guessed it, foreign policy.

This resume, while expected for someone lobbying for a foreign policy position in an incoming administration, does not equate to a domestic policy record, leaving many to speculate about the political benefits Biden sees in naming her to the position.

Rice’s lack of domestic policy was viewed as a positive in her race for Biden’s vice-presidential pick, but now that she’s named to the domestic policy adviser position, it’s cause for concern that her position on a number of domestic policy issues are unknown.

Yet, Biden chose her to join the White House, strategically pushing her past a risky and challenging Senate confirmation, a concern of Rice and other Democrats who wanted her in the Secretary of State position in the past.

Regardless of how or why she landed a spot in the domestic side of the Biden administration with exactly zero domestic policy qualifications, Rice’s reliance on her foreign policy background to inform her new position should be concerning to many Americans.

Not only did she falsely claim that the deaths of four Americans at Benghazi were the result of a spontaneous demonstration, but she also engaged with Russian collusion hoaxers to target Michael Flynn, and still refuses to answer questions about her knowledge of the Biden family’s foreign business affairs.

1. Benghazi, Libya

While Rice was not national security advisor in 2012 when terrorists attacked the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, she publicly weighed in on the situation, making false claims that the deaths of Americans were simply the result of demonstrations in Cairo over a video criticizing Islam gone wrong.

“Our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what this began as, it was a spontaneous — not a premeditated — response to what had transpired in Cairo. In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated,” she told Jake Tapper on ABC’s “This Week” the Sunday after the attack.

“Based on the best information we have to date, what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy– –sparked by this hateful video,” she echoed in an interview on CBS.

“We do not– we do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned,” she continued.

Despite her claims, State Department documents contain an email that confirms the Obama administration knew the day after the Sept. 11 attack that it was not “a random act of violence stemming from an anti-Muslim video.”

On a September 12, 2012 phone call, State Department Under-Secretary Patrick Kennedy also clearly stated that “this was a direct breaching attack” and was not connected to the Cairo protests or video cited by officials shifting the blame around for the attack.

“The attack in Cairo was a demonstration. There were no weapons shown or used. A few cans of spray paint,” he clarified.

2. Hunter Biden

Rice first became national security adviser to Obama in 2013, around the same time that then-Vice President Joe Biden used Air Force Two on “an official government trip to China,” accompanied by his son Hunter Biden who began meeting with Chinese businessmen to “build a Chinese private equity firm,” which Hunter would sit on the board of. Just days after the joint trip, Shanghai authorities approved the firm with a Chinese business license.

Since the Biden family’s trip, the firm reportedly channeled at least $2.5 billion into automotive, energy, mining, and technology deals on behalf of investors, including a joint acquisition of the Michigan motor company Henniges in 2015, “the biggest Chinese investment into U.S. automotive manufacturing assets to date,” during Rice’s tenure as national security adviser.

Emails uncovered by the New York Post from a laptop allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden and published in October show that Joe and his family stood to profit from some of his son’s deals with officials linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CPP), which Hunter said would be “interesting to me and my family.”

“An email dated for May 13, 2017 obtained by Fox News features talk of ‘remuneration packages’ for six individuals with a multi-million dollar deal with a Chinese energy company. The same email identified Hunter Biden as the “Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC.” CEFC China Energy Co. Ltd. is the Chinese energy firm founded by Ye Jianming, who held positions with the CCP and reportedly offered Hunter Biden $10 million a year for introductions alone,” The Federalist previously reported.

In 2014, while Rice was still in her position, Hunter joined the executive board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, making more than $50,000 a month while Joe served as the Obama admin’s “public face” for U.S. policy concerning Ukraine. A Federalist analysis of Hunter Biden’s pay reveals he was being showered in excess compensation nearly double the salaries of board members with larger corporations within the same industry, despite having no experience in the field.

It was during this time that, while Joe repeatedly lied when claiming he never spoke with Hunter, “or with anyone else,” about his son’s potentially criminal overseas business activity, Hunter introduced a senior advisor named Vadym Pozharskyi to his Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, to his vice president father.

“Thank you for inviting me to DC and giving me an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together,” Pozharskyi, wrote in an email recovered by the Post.

3. Michael Flynn

During her time as Obama’s “right-hand woman,” Rice lied about her involvement in the Obama admin’s targeting of the Trump campaign and her role in the unmasking for her successor Michael Flynn.

Not only did Rice “request the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter,” but she lied about it claiming she knew “nothing about this.”

Just weeks later, Rice admitted she tried to unmask information on Trump and his associates and family members, strategically claiming that it was “absolutely not for any political purposes.”

Later in 2017, CNN reported that Rice told House investigators that she had unmasked some senior Trump officials “to understand why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York late last year.”

According to the report, the Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan had circumvented some diplomatic courtesy, which, apparently, was enough justification to spy on American citizens.

In May of 2020, it was revealed that Rice assisted in the Obama admin’s targeting of Flynn, sending herself an email on Trump’s inauguration day, “detailing the Jan. 5 meeting between her, Obama, then-Vice President Joe Biden, then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, and fired former Federal Bureau of Investigations Director James Comey.”

In the emails, Rice details her knowledge of the admin’s singling out of Flynn, who they claimed to be concerned about due to Russian connections and potentially withhold sensitive security information from.

“Comey said he does have some concerns that incoming NSA Flynn is speaking frequently with Russian Ambassador Kislyak,” Rice wrote. “Comey said that could be an issue as it relates to sharing sensitive information.”

“President Obama asked if Comey was saying the NSC should not pass sensitive information related to Russia to Flynn,” Rice continued. “Comey replied ‘potentially.’”

“[Comey] added that he has no indication thus far that Flynn has passed classified information to Kislyak, but he noted that ‘the level of communication is unusual.’”

If Rice’s handling of these issues is any indication of how she plans to approach U.S. domestic policy, Americans should be concerned. Rice’s foreign policy experience is littered with liabilities and without any domestic policy experience, it’s hard to see how she wouldn’t rely on her previous roles to carry out new policies through her role in the Biden admin.

6 Experts Predict The Worst Scenario With China Under A Feeble Biden,"When Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, he ran on overhauling the economic relationship with China, which he blamed for raiding American factories and offshoring American jobs. Throughout his administration, Trump railed against the communist country for unlawfully claiming territory in the Pacific Ocean, stripping Hong Kong’s autonomy, and covering up the Wuhan virus outbreak.

Whatever you think of Trump’s positions on China, it’s a sharp contrast to what we’ve heard from President-elect Joe Biden on the same issues, which is essentially not much. When discussing his foreign policy during the 2020 campaign, Biden rarely got more specific than promising “to work with allies.”

On the campaign trail in May, Biden downplayed any problems the United States may have with China. “China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man … I mean, you know, they’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They’re not competition for us,” he said.

In an October “60 Minutes” interview, Biden upgraded the Chinese threat level from “not competition” to our “biggest competitor,” saving the actual “biggest threat” label for Russia.

Whether you interpret his silence on China as actively pro-China, or merely feeble on China, Biden’s weak stance is cause for concern as Beijing shows no slowing down in their pursuit of becoming the dominant global superpower. I asked a group of foreign policy experts what they envision as the worst-case scenario for China’s behavior under a Biden administration. Here’s what they had to say.

Gordon Chang

The worst thing that can result from Biden’s China policy is the next global war.

China’s regime tested both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama early in their terms with dangerous intercepts of the U.S. Navy in the global commons, specifically, the EP-3 collision in the case of Bush, and the harassment of the Impeccable and Victorious during Obama’s first months. In both cases, China felt it had prevailed.

The regime did not test President Trump because, I believe, Chinese leaders were scared of him.

They are not scared of Biden, as is evident from the bold comments of Renmin University’s Di Dongsheng, publicized widely inside China late last month. Those comments show the breathtaking arrogance of the Chinese elite, which now has no hesitation expressing in public its belief that, with a President Biden, China will once again control outcomes at the highest levels in Washington.

Because the Chinese elite believe they can do whatever they want, it will be hard for Biden to deter such a militant regime. Chinese ruler Xi Jinping might do something dangerous, something that America will have to oppose.

Once China starts something, Russia, North Korea, and Iran could take advantage of the situation to start hostilities elsewhere. We can, therefore, face simultaneous crises.

Gordon Chang is a columnist and author of “The Coming Collapse of China.”

Rebeccah Heinrichs

In the near term, the event of the most serious gravity would be China takes Taiwan. And if Beijing calculates that the Biden administration won’t stop it, no question the People’s Liberation Army does it. Like Hong Kong, it will be a nightmare for the Taiwanese, a really wonderful liberty-loving people. It’s hard to even think of it.

And with their loss, so goes America’s prominence in the Pacific. It would be a huge blow to our ability to make good on our security commitments in the region. It would be devastating.

Rebeccah Heinrichs is a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, where she specializes in nuclear deterrence and missile defense.

David Goldman

From what we observe at Asia Times, none of the Trump administration’s restrictions on exports to China has made much of a dent. China has installed nearly 1 million base stations out of a goal of 10 million to build out its national 5G network by 2024. Germany, Japan, and South Korea have refused American demands to exclude Huawei and ZTE from their 5G networks, although there are some limitations.

China, meanwhile, is developing 5G applications, including smart cities (traffic management), agriculture, flexible manufacturing, and so forth. And our imports from China in November reached an all-time record. If anything, this is likely to accelerate under a Biden administration, which probably will trade off a piecemeal removal of some of the Trump administration’s restrictions for greater access by US companies to the Chinese domestic market. I would use the word “re-coupling,” except there really hasn’t been any de-coupling to speak of.

I think Biden is fundamentally cautious, as his reticence about Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, etc. show. But he is also a feeble senile personality, as in he gets pushed over. So, in a Biden administration, there are two threats.

One, idealistic fanatics, like Susan Rice and others, will push Biden into untenable positions, and doing so, Biden would take his eyes off the ball and bankrupt and overstretch the country. China is the greatest challenge facing the United States, and the United States frankly needs an alliance in Asia, like an Asian NATO or a Quad to focus on stopping China’s rise, and move away from human rights promotion in the Middle East and Afghanistan.

Two, make sure Europe pays their fair share and stop free-riding. The European Union is turning into an empire, and if they side with China, game over. Biden lacks the spine to take on the EU.

The worst-case scenario I worry about is not accidental war or China’s near-term world domination. I worry about their successful global influence campaign that uses gifts, loans, bribes, think tanks, and academics in a brilliantly orchestrated campaign to bolster those who see China with complacency. They have promoted the image that China loves peace, loves the environment, and faces enormous internal challenges. The idea is to demonize anyone who wants to challenge China.

The campaign against Huawei taught our senior officials that China will not just faint away or swoon when the U.S. government says “boo.” China will fight back with all instruments of its economic power. They have had real success with many of our 550 or so billionaires who visit China in their executive jets, are hosted by Xi Jinping himself, and then promote false narratives suggested by the Chinese.

A few of Joe Biden’s advisers know China well and want him to be tough. I wrote “The Hundred Year Marathon” with a lot of declassified materials that CIA and FBI approved of me disclosing. My goal was to wake people up.

We should be deeply concerned because Biden has said so little. China takes a great deal of comfort that Biden is going to assume power in January, because if you look at his cabinet, these are all people who China knows how to deal with. These are all people who have been around for a long time and they advocated for China’s policies in the past. They’re mostly driven by corporate interests and emphasizing economic engagement.

For the last several decades, they painted a picture that economic engagement will bring political change in China, and it turns out economic engagement in a regime that has no interest to change only gives them economic power and helps them grow military power.

Look at what happened under the last four years of the Obama-Biden administration, when China took over the control of almost the entire South China Sea. That’s the template. If Biden carries similar policies going forward, it’s really likely China’s going to conquer somewhere else, most likely Taiwan, based on that same template. I think the real worst-case scenario is China becomes unstoppable.

Joe Biden Doubles Down On Hunter’s Innocence As New Reporting Emerges,"President-elect Joe Biden doubled down on his son’s innocence Wednesday as new reporting emerges with more insight into Hunter Biden’s overseas business ventures while also being the subject of two FBI probes examining the family finances.

“Are you confident that Hunter Biden did nothing wrong?” a Fox News reporter asked President-elect Joe Biden during a Wednesday press conference.

“I’m confident,” Biden said simply and moved on to the next question.

The show of certainty comes one week after the Biden-Harris transition team released a statement reiterating the president-elect’s support for his son along with a note from Hunter Biden himself acknowledging the existence of a Justice Department investigation examining Hunter’s taxes.

“President-elect Biden is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger,” the team said.

As of this writing, there are at least three active federal investigations underway by the Justice Department centering in on the Biden family, including probes in Delaware and New York targeting Hunter Biden and one in Pennsylvania revealed by Politico where prosecutors are reviewing hospital deals involving Joe Biden’s brother James.

On Wednesday, Fox News also published new correspondence showing Hunter Biden requesting $10 million from Chinese business partners to fund a joint Biden venture. Hunter signed off his message with “best wishes from the entire Biden family.”

The timeline of the letters reported by Fox dated for the summer of 2017 mean the deal in the process of being negotiated likely match the transaction outlined in emails published by the New York Post, where Hunter Biden was offered a $10 million annual contract for “introductions alone,” a portion of which would be set aside for President-elect Joe Biden funneled through Hunter.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/12/16/joe-biden-doubles-down-on-hunters-innocence-as-new-reporting-emerges/,2020-12-16
Documents Show Hunter Biden Requesting $10 Million From Chinese On Behalf Of 'Entire Biden Family',"New documents reported by Fox News Wednesday offer more details into a $10 million deal outlined between Hunter Biden and Chinese businessmen with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party, adding fuel to ongoing scandals plaguing President-elect Joe Biden, big tech, and big media.

According to correspondence obtained by Fox, Hunter Biden reportedly offered his “best wishes from the entire Biden family” to CEFC Chairman Ye Jianming in 2017 and urged the Chinese business partner with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party to wire over $10 million to “properly fund and operate” a joint Biden venture.

“I hope my letter finds you well. I regret missing you on your last visit to the United States,” Hunter Biden wrote in a June letter. “Please accept the best wishes from the entire Biden family as well as my partners.”

In the same letter, Biden continued to note Tony Bobulinski, a Biden business partner-turned whistleblower this year, requested the $10 million dollar transfer from Ye’s associates.

“I would appreciate if you will send that quickly,” Biden wrote, to fund the Biden-led firm Sinohawk in partnership with Bobulinski who would serve as CEO.

Later emails responding to Hunter Biden reviewed by Fox dated in July show the Chinese chairman enthusiastically arranging for Biden’s request working to “expedite” the transfer.

The correspondence is dated just before emails published by the New York Post in October show Chairman Ye outlining a $10 million annual contract for Hunter Biden for “introductions alone,” a portion of which would be slated aside for President-elect Joe Biden funneled through Hunter.

Fox News’ blockbuster revelations gives further credibility to the Post’s earlier reporting this year, which was dismissed by corporate media who adopted Democratic talking points to chalk up the stories as Russian disinformation, and suppressed by big tech engaging in election interference in the final days leading up to the November contest.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/12/16/new-documents-show-hunter-biden-requesting-10-million-from-chinese-on-behalf-of-entire-biden-family/,2020-12-16
Former Russia Amb. Michael McFaul Whitewashes Biden Email Claims,"While legacy outlets run cover for their election interference in October that stories surfacing related to Hunter Biden were Russian propaganda despite no real evidence, some Democratic elites who engaged in the conspiracy are outright whitewashing their earlier claims.

Former Obama Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, who now serves as a professor at Stanford and contributing columnist for the Washington Post, is no exception.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, McFaul wrote in response to Federalist Publisher Ben Domenech challenging the claim that McFaul ever dismissed the Hunter Biden story as Russian disinformation.

“If you have actual evidence that I lied about the Russian disinformation campaign against the Bidens, please post,” McFaul wrote. “Otherwise, delete this tweet. Its disinformation.”

So @bdomenech , I responded politely & factually, yet this tweet is still up. If you have actual evidence that I lied about the Russian disinformation campaign against the Bidens, please post. Be precise. I'll apologize. Otherwise, delete this tweet. Its disinformation: https://t.co/VX2N11kPHT — Michael McFaul (@McFaul) December 16, 2020

A quick online search revealed no shortage of evidence.

Here’s the former ambassador condemning a CBS reporter for daring to ask the former vice president on the campaign trail about the treasure trove of emails published by the New York Post implicating the Democratic candidate in his son’s potentially criminal business ventures. The question came after the Post reported emails verified by Fox News showing Joe Biden stood to personally rake in millions from Chinese businessmen with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party funneled through his son, Hunter.

“‘Story’? That’s not the right word to describe a hit piece so false that Twitter wont even post it,” McFaul snarked, as if Twitter’s selective censorship was proof of its illegitimacy. “By discussing disinformation, you legitimate and amplify it.”

""Story""? That's not the right word to describe a hit piece so false that Twitter wont even post it? Reminds me of when I was U.S. Ambassador to Russia & Russian trolls used to ask about the ""pedophile video"" about me. By discussing disinformation, you legitimate and amplify it. https://t.co/xZVd6cRItg — Michael McFaul (@McFaul) October 17, 2020

Just several days earlier, McFaul challenged Twitter users again to find evidence that Hunter Biden committed a crime, apparently ignoring the Post’s blockbuster reporting and an 87-page report from a three-year Senate investigation surrounding Biden’s finances and detailing potential crimes.

Send me evidence that Hunter Biden committed a crime. Otherwise, Im blocking you as I dont allow my feed to be used to propagate disinformation. — Michael McFaul (@McFaul) October 15, 2019

Senate investigators for example, flagged a six-figure shopping spree for Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s brother James, and James’ wife Sara paid for by Chinese communist leaders as potential criminal activity.

The report also exposed the existence of transactions, which the public still knows little about, such as a $3.5 million dollar wire transfer to Hunter Biden from an ex-Moscow mayor’s wife.

McFaul held no reservations throughout this fall perpetuating claims from corporate media that the Hunter Biden email scandal incriminating their preferred presidential nominee stemmed from a Russian campaign to interfere in the November election.

https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/1320069879496544257?s=20

The news plaguing the Biden campaign, at least from responsible outlets meanwhile, was merely dismissed by McFaul as a “kooky crazy conspiracy.”

https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/1318411644033064960?s=20

McFaul also freely went on MSNBC to engage in the actual conspiracy pushed by the Biden campaign that the Hunter Biden stories were a plot of Russian disinformation.

Speaking on “AM Joy” under the premise that the Hunter Biden story is Russian disinformation, McFaul likened the ongoing scandal to Russian interference in 2016.

“It is exactly the same. And what I think Vladimir Putin wants, is he wants polarization, he wants delegitimization, he wants us not to hold a free and fair election that the majority of Americans will recognize and this is part of achieving that ultimate objective,” McFaul said. “They are playing with us. They are trying to do their disinformation tactics.”

McFaul employed the same Democratic talking points during an appearance on MSNBC’s “Meet The Press Daily.”

Last week’s statement from Hunter Biden himself admitting the existence of an ongoing FBI probe into his finances have cast further doubts on claims of Russian disinformation, as if the conspiracy had not already been debunked prior to the election with statements from the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Department of National Intelligence, and the Department of State.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/12/16/obama-ambassador-to-russia-michael-mcfaul-whitewashes-debunked-claims-of-russian-disinformation-surrounding-biden-emails/,2020-12-16
Hemingway: Hunter Biden Email Ties Joe Biden To Chinese Oligarchs,"New documents reported by Fox News Wednesday show communication between Hunter Biden and a Chinese businessman, further implicating former Vice President Joe Biden in his son’s foreign business dealings, Federalist Senior Editor Mollie Hemingway said on “America’s Newsroom” Thursday morning.

“You don’t want the president’s son having ties to corrupt foreign adversaries or governments because you worry how that will affect U.S. policy,” Hemingway said.

New documents uncovered on Wednesday revealed that Hunter Biden sent Ye Jianming “best wishes from the entire Biden family” and requested $10 million from the businessman, who is closely tied to the Chinese Communist Party.

“The context of all of these emails and all these discussions is that Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, and his brother, James, have made a lot of money from companies or even governments that sought to access Joe Biden,” Hemingway noted. “So they would indicate that they were close to Joe Biden, they would get a lot of money, and they would also make sure not to put anything in a paper trail.”

Hemingway pointed out that some of the uncovered emails show that President-elect Biden’s involvement in the business ventures was not supposed to be discussed in writing. Despite this, she said, “Joe Biden has always claimed he had nothing to do with this.”

“But we have many indications that at least from the perspective of the governments and companies giving money to the Biden family, they were doing so in part because they wanted that access” to Joe Biden, she said. “Hunter Biden saying that he represents the entire family, and also the other emails showing that 10 percent was supposed to be held for the ‘big guy,’ Joe Biden.”

Hunter’s former associate turned whistleblower, Tony Bobulinski, has said that he talked with Joe Biden about the business venture. “This is in contradiction to what Joe Biden has said,” Hemingway added.

The revelations have sparked calls for a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings.

“Special counsels are supposed to be in order if there is a conflict of interest that might be in play,” Hemingway said. “Clearly, there is a conflict of interest between the incoming president’s son being investigated while this guy is president.”

“I think that’s also why the transition team put out this notification about Hunter Biden being investigated,” she added. “They don’t think they need a special counsel.”

Hemingway also noted how the Mueller investigation exemplified a special counsel out of control. “That really caused so many problems for these years of Trump’s presidency,” she said, “even though they never found what they claimed to be looking for, which was treason and collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election.”

"People Who Should Be Embarrassed About Hunter Biden, Ranked","A lot of powerful people have a lot to be embarrassed about.

Last week, President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team released a statement acknowledging the existence of an investigation under the Delaware U.S. attorney’s office probing Hunter Biden’s tax affairs. The investigation joins a broader probe examining Hunter’s finances underway by the securities fraud unit in the Southern District of New York, reported by Politico, and another targeting James Biden, Joe Biden’s brother, in Pennsylvania related to a series of hospital deals.

The existence of ongoing federal investigations targeting Hunter Biden was first reported in October, days before the November election. Content surfaced on an abandoned Delaware laptop implicating Joe Biden in his son’s potentially criminal overseas business dealings.

Democrats dismissed the revelations as pure Russian disinformation, offering their allies in the corporate media an excuse to ignore the news they’re responsible for reporting when not delegitimizing the idea of Biden family corruption altogether.

The irony of the Hunter Biden saga is rich, considering the same media perpetuated a four-year conspiracy with no end indicting President Donald Trump in the press as a Kremlin agent, laying the roots for a baseless narrative to attack any reporting they simply don’t like, including the blockbuster revelations on Hunter Biden.

Now that Hunter Biden has acknowledged an ongoing investigation probing his finances from the Department of Justice, legacy outlets finally offering coverage after forgoing any attention to a story that became even more important following the election. But don’t hold your breath for coverage to be fair.

If it wasn’t clear before — and it was given statements from the FBI, the Department of Justice, the director of national intelligence, and the Department of State — it’s undeniably clear now that stories unearthing incriminating details on Hunter Biden did not stem from some Russian plot to interfere in the November election. Public knowledge of not one, but three federal investigations targeting the Biden family with an on-the-record whistleblower and a laptop hard drive authenticated with forensic analysis also obtained by federal authorities help make that clear.

Yet two months after legacy media declined to take the Hunter Biden story seriously for potentially undermining their preferred presidential candidate, there’s a lot of people who engaged in interference with no shame and no accountability. The stories that surfaced in October ought to embarrass a lot of people. Here’s a short list.

Joe Biden

Above all, former Vice President Biden remains at the heart of the controversy, caught in a web of lies covering for his son’s overseas business ventures that emails show sought to enrich the entire family, including the president-elect himself.

The first bombshell to drop in the New York Post’s series of October exposés caught Joe Biden lying throughout the entire campaign when repeatedly denying ever discussing business with his son, “or with anyone else.” Indeed, 2015 emails show Joe Biden personally met with a senior advisor for Burisma, the Ukrainian energy firm showering the vice president’s son with upwards of $50,000 a month in excess compensation while Joe Biden served as the “public face” of Obama administration policy on Ukraine.

Biden, however, even fat-shamed an Iowa voter for bringing the Ukraine scandal up.

New emails published by Fox News Wednesday offer greater insight into a $10 million deal, likely the same as that reported by the New York Post in its story on Hunter Biden’s laptop. Documents, Fox News reported, revealed Hunter Biden offering Chinese business partners with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party his “best wishes from the entire Biden family” while requesting $10 million.

Emails published by the New York Post dated a month later show the same Chinese business partners offering Hunter Biden a $10 million a year contract for “introductions alone,” explicitly setting aside a sizable portion for Joe Biden funneled through Hunter.

During the presidential debate in October, however, Biden accused Trump of peddling Russian disinformation for pointing out this story.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey

The Hunter Biden saga is just as much a scandal for big tech as it is big media. Moments after the first New York Post story went live, Twitter began blocking its URL on the platform and disabled the paper’s account.

Twitter later explained it had blocked sharing because the article included “hacked” content, a frivolous explanation capitalizing on rules clearly selectively enforced to suppress the biggest story of the 2020 election.

Despite an apology from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s censorship continued, blocking the URL of the Post’s second story documenting Hunter Biden’s $10 million deal with Chinese business partners.

Unbelievable. Yesterday, @twitter blocks links to @nypost story alleging Joe Biden corruption on China. TODAY, blocking links to ANOTHER NYPost story alleging Hunter Biden sold access to communist China for millions. I just tried to share that story. Here’s Twitter’s response 👇 pic.twitter.com/NZpw4gmcb2 — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 15, 2020

Twitter eventually backed down from its censorship and allowed the stories to be shared following backlash over its overt election interference. The New York Post however, the nation’s oldest newspaper, remained locked out of tweeting to its nearly two million followers for two weeks during some of the most critical days of the election.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg

As Twitter suppressed the New York Post’s reporting on its platform, Facebook followed suit, announcing through a company spokesperson and former Democratic staffer the company would be preemptively censoring the Post’s blockbuster reporting until it underwent review from its third-party fact-checkers.

While I will intentionally not link to the New York Post, I want be clear that this story is eligible to be fact checked by Facebook's third-party fact checking partners. In the meantime, we are reducing its distribution on our platform. — Andy Stone (@andymstone) October 14, 2020

After the reveal of federal investigations, an on-the-record whistleblower, forensic analysis, a statement from Hunter Biden himself, and lack of dispute over the emails’ authenticity from the Biden campaign, questions remain surrounding Facebook’s selective censorship.

Did the fact-checkers at Facebook ever make their findings public? Have they retracted or altered their checks after last week’s statement from Hunter Biden that he is under an ongoing FBI investigation? Will these entities remain fact-checking partners going forward?

Has Facebook detailed which of its paid Fact Check partners were the basis for it suspending the Hunter Biden story's spread? Have these partners retracted or altered their checks? Will they remain Fact Check partners going forward given such obvious inaccuracy? — Ben Domenech (@bdomenech) December 11, 2020

Facebook declined The Federalist’s request for answers on these questions.

CBS’s Lesley Stahl

CBS’s “60 Minutes” aired its 2020 election special featuring each of the major-party candidates and their running mates on the legacy program Oct. 25. The broadcast garnered almost 17 million viewers hearing correspondent Lesley Stahl flat-out denying Joe Biden was facing a scandal at all.

“He’s in the midst of a scandal,” Trump said in the interview after complaining about reporters asking Biden what kind of ice cream he purchased on a campaign stop as opposed to the blockbuster reporting just two days before from the New York Post.

“He’s not,” Stahl interrupted to shut down the president. “He’s not. No.”

Stahl also lied in claiming there was no evidence to support Trump’s complaint that the Obama-Biden administration spied on the Trump campaign. Find the evidence here.

CNN’s Christiane Amanpour

CNN’s Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour self-righteously declared herself a “journalist” who “follows the facts” by regurgitating Democratic talking points yet she dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop as Russian interference during an interview with RNC spokeswoman Elizabeth Harrington.

Amanpour responded by claiming that reporting means ignoring on-the-record statements from all the nation’s top intelligence agencies to float unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.

“I’m a journalist, and a reporter, and I follow the facts. And there has never been any issues in terms of corruption,” Amanpour said of the Biden family.

“How do you know that?” Harrington challenged after citing the FBI investigation into the Hunter Biden laptop.

“I’m talking about reporting, and any evidence,” Amanpour said.

When Harrington called on Amanpour and the rest of the media to start doing journalism by engaging in rigorous digging and verification, Amanpour scoffed.

“No! We’re not going to do your work for you.”

Amanpour proved in the interview then she is not in fact a journalist. She is an activist, which is okay, as long as she starts being honest about it. We all know she won’t.

NPR Editors

The week after the New York Post began publishing its series on Hunter Biden’s laptop, the editors at the taxpayer-funded National Public Radio (NPR) explained to readers why it hadn’t bothered to report on the blockbuster revelations.

“We don’t want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories,” the editors wrote.

CNN’s Brian Stelter

When searching for leftist reporters masquerading as dignified journalists, CNN’s Brian Stelter has become the most reliable culprit of the Trump era.

In October, Stelter was roasted by the Washington Examiner’s Susan Ferrechio for downplaying the Hunter Biden story after leading the media’s crusade to characterize the incumbent Republican president as a Russian operative.

“The bottom line is this deserves scrutiny by all media outlets, and if they pick and choose this and decide it’s not worth their time, I think that’s showing real bias,” Ferrechio said on a panel hosted by BBC.

.@BrianStelter: ""Don't you dare. Don't you dare act like newsrooms didn't have ethics in 2017 & 2018.""@SusanFerrechio: ""You can 'don't dare' me all you want, Brian, I've been doing this for 30 years."" Susan and Brian clash over the Hunter Biden story vs Steele Dossier. pic.twitter.com/JSxwxyRK4b — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) October 22, 2020

Characteristically defensive of legacy media, Stelter shot back when Ferrechio pointed out the double-standard over CNN’s exhaustive coverage of the Mueller investigation while ignoring the Biden scandal.

“Don’t you dare, don’t you dare act like newsrooms didn’t have ethics in 2017 and 2018,” Stelter said.

“You can’t ‘don’t dare’ me all you want, Brian,” Ferrechio shot back. “I’ve been doing this for 30 years, so say whatever you want. It’s my view, and I have a right to say it.”

To this day, Stelter is still complaining about other outlets offering substantive coverage of the Biden scandals, charging Fox News of destroying its credibility when it leads with news about Hunter Biden.

Politico’s Jake Sherman

Politico’s Jake Sherman apologized for doing journalism by linking to a bombshell New York Post story and bowed to the Twitter overlords who temporarily suspended him from the platform for amplifying content its executives didn’t approve.

I tweeted a link to the NYP story right after it dropped yesterday morning. I immediately reached out to the Biden campaign to see if they had any answer.

Washington Post’s Max Boot

In October, the Washington Post’s Max Boot wrote on Twitter, “We don’t know if the Hunter Biden emails are genuine. But even if they are, they aren’t a scandal.” What is a scandal then, according to Max Boot?

We don’t know if the Hunter Biden emails are genuine. But even if they are, they aren’t a scandal. The Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was not investigating Burisma. Joe Biden demanded his firing precisely because he was complicit in corruption. https://t.co/sbF7RHW6wJ — Max Boot (@MaxBoot) October 17, 2020

The rest of these tweets speak for themselves, calling the Hunter Biden allegations “conspiracies” and “disinformation.”

He was, in fact, complicit in corruption—which is why Biden demanded he be fired.https://t.co/cXuaQwc4LC — Max Boot (@MaxBoot) October 14, 2020

Even if all the Hunter Biden emails are true, they don’t establish a scandal. But we have no way of knowing if these emails were hacked or whether they are genuine—or perhaps a mixture of fake and real.

MSNBC’s Ben Rhodes

MSNBC contributor and former deputy national security advisor in the Obama White House Ben Rhodes is no exception to the long line of those billing the Hunter Biden scandal as Russian disinformation.

The Republican freak out over not being able to spread disinformation unchecked demonstrates why you should not be able to spread disinformation unchecked. They know they have no political viability without the capacity to spread lies. — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) October 15, 2020

"Joe Biden, Three Days Before Christmas: 'Our Darkest Days Are Ahead'","Vice President Joe Biden said of COVID-19 on Tuesday in a public address that “Our darkest days are ahead of us, not behind us,” the same day Congress passed another $900 billion big business and blue state bailout spree and the day after he received the new COVID vaccine on live television.

Democrats’ recent pessimism has been puzzling, since the vaccine and massive government spending should be considered by Biden a step forward in the fight against COVID.

The former VP’s remarks are also odd given that during the presidential debates he said of COVID: “I will end this. I will make sure we have a plan.” Now that the darkest days are apparently ahead of us, Americans are left wondering if he will make good on this campaign promise.

this is quite surprising in light of what Biden said at the debate pic.twitter.com/eTJepThMXA — LB (@beyondreasdoubt) December 22, 2020

Biden has been severely critical of President Donald Trump’s handling of the pandemic, even accusing him of not caring about the American people. Blasting Trump on the campaign trail, Biden said, “For all his bluster about his expertise on the economy he is unable to explain how he’ll actually help working families hit the hardest. You know, he’s quit on you, and he’s quit on this country.” Yet, as of today, Biden is suggesting his administration will be worse than the Trump administration.

This could be another of Biden’s famous “gaffes” or Freudian slips. A Biden administration might really mean the darkest days are ahead of us. Biden’s son, Hunter, is suspected of money laundering in China and the Ukraine, with evidence that Joe Biden was aware of it and may be compromised, which poses a serious potential national security threat.

Given Biden’s mental deterioration, there is also fear that a Biden administration wouldn’t really be Biden’s. Instead, the forgetful and frail former VP will be used as a vehicle for the left’s cultural revolution, especially since Biden’s vice presidential pick Kamala Harris has proven to be a solid member of the far left.

"When Finally Asked About Hunter, Joe Biden Retreats To Conspiracy","Back in October, when The New York Post broke a story about Hunter Biden’s laptop and investigations into corruption involving a presidential candidate, a conspiracy theory was floated to explain it all. It had all the hallmarks, we were told, of Russian disinformation. Dozens of intelligence “experts” signed a letter saying so.

The world now knows that the Department of Justice is investigating the younger Biden, and that this was not Russian disinformation. But somebody needs to tell Joe Biden.

On Tuesday at a press conference, Biden was asked by Fox News’ Peter Doocy if he still believes the story is Russian disinformation now that his campaign has admitted the corruption investigation is real. After laughing for an odd moment, Biden replied, “Yes, yes, yes,” before chiding Doocy for asking him about it.

Joe Biden laughs when Fox News' Peter Doocy asks if he still thinks the allegations against Hunter Biden are Russian disinformation: ""Yes, yes, yes. God love you, man. You're a one horse pony."" pic.twitter.com/x8HEvPjpFn — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) December 22, 2020

This is an astounding claim from Biden given that we now know that the DOJ has had a long and ongoing investigation into Hunter Biden’s taxes. The investigation is serious enough that Attorney General William Barr kept it secret so it would not influence the election.

Over the past two months, Joe Biden himself has never disputed a single reported aspect of the story. So on what basis does he believe that this is all Russian disinformation?

Biden has grown accustomed to a media that won’t ask him hard questions, but he is about to appoint a new attorney general whose job is to oversee a department that is investigating his own son. If Biden really believes there is no legitimate case against his son, that this is all a plot by Vladimir Putin, then how can we trust him with that choice?

It would be one thing if he were saying he trusts his son but wants the legal procedures to play out. Instead, he is citing a debunked conspiracy theory.

The Biden transition team needs to clarify this right now. Is it the position of Biden that The New Post story (which social media giants widely censored) and the subsequent stories from other outlets are a disinformation campaign? If the answer is no, then they need to correct his misstatement.

If the answer is yes, then they need to show some evidence. Right now, it just looks like Biden is tossing around conspiracy theories to protect his family.

"While The Spotlight Eyes Hunter, James BIden Is Also Under Investigation","While President-elect Joe Biden’s son Hunter has dominated headlines about the Biden family business, landing lucrative overseas deals trading on his father’s name, Joe Biden’s brother, James, is too often overlooked in the corruption saga.

Yes, it’s true that Hunter Biden spent years raking in upwards of $50,000 a month on the board of a Ukrainian energy company despite no prior experience in the industry. It’s true that Hunter Biden’s father was serving as the “public face” of White House policy towards Ukraine at the same time.

It’s true that Joe Biden, who spent his entire presidential campaign denying that he ever spoke business with his son, was introduced to an executive of Hunter Biden’s Ukrainian firm, introduced by Hunter Biden. It’s true that Senate investigators found Hunter Biden took $3.5 million from the wife of an ex-Moscow mayor.

It’s true that Hunter Biden parlayed his father’s position into receiving an $80,000 diamond from a Chinese businessman with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party. It’s true that Hunter Biden was discussing a $10 million annual contract with the same Chinese businessmen paid for “introductions alone.” It’s true that Hunter Biden was discussing 10 percent of that sum flowing to Joe Biden.

It’s also true that Hunter Biden was one of three individuals showered in a six-figure shopping spree paid for by the same Chinese business leaders flagged as potential criminal activity by Senate investigators. The other two were James Biden, and James’ wife, Sara Biden.

The Senate report released in September after a three-year investigation expanded the public scope of the Biden family’s decades-long conflicts of interest featuring Joe Biden in the upper echelons of government. By unveiling ties between James Biden and the same Chinese businessmen courting the former vice president through Hunter, the family web of interests interlaced with the Chinese has given rise to new questions regarding Joe Biden’s knowledge and involvement with the family business.

Those questions began to be answered by business partner-turned whistleblower Tony Bobulinski. In a full-hour interview with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson in October, he claimed the family business activity in China had been corrupt to the point the current president-elect is “compromised” by the Chinese Communist Party.

“I just don’t see, given the history here and the facts, how Joe can’t be influenced in some manner based on the history,” Bobulinski said in prime time.

Bobulinski emphasized the family’s sensitivity about Joe Biden’s involvement. Bobulinski said when he raised concerns with James Biden over the former vice president’s role, James Biden dismissed them, reassuring Bobulinski the family would simply employ “plausible deniability.”

This is maybe THE clip from this interview. Bobulinski to #Tucker: ""I remember looking at Jim Biden in saying how are you guys getting away with this? Like, aren't you concerned? And he looked at me and he laughed a little bit and said. 'plausible deniability.'"" pic.twitter.com/GMDL1JNZtB — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) October 28, 2020

Public reporting of James Biden’s business deals alongside Hunter in China have almost certainly only scratched the surface. What we do know, however, beyond the Chinese business activity that featured an extravagant shopping spree, is that James Biden is under ongoing investigation by federal authorities in Western Pennsylvania over a series of hospital deals struck under Americore Health, a firm built on the model of buying and operating rural hospitals.

FBI agents raided one of the now-bankrupt firm’s hospitals in January, along with the home of its CEO, Grant White. James Biden’s home was not raided, James, a heavy investor in the company, became the subject of a lawsuit from White, accusing him of fraud and racketeering. This ultimately toppled the firm to the ground.

In court documents reported by The Federalist’s Mark Hemingway this spring, White accused James Biden of diverting funds for the struggling Americore for his own, partly used to save a vacation residence in Florida. White says James Biden never paid the company back as the firm was going under.

James, however, had been leveraging his family name to cultivate trust in his ability to grow the business.

“[Biden told me] there’s not a single door in the country that we can’t open. So if I wanted to meet, you know, the head of Google, it’s a phone call,” White said, as Hemingway reported. “He always represented himself as the fundraiser for his brother’s campaigns… he was the guy raising the money and so he knew everybody.”

But the company collapsed and lawsuits followed. Now James Biden is the subject of a federal probe.

In February, however, a lengthy report published by ProPublica chronicled James leveraging the family name through the decades to land six- and seven-figure loans through donors to his older brother’s campaigns.

“The vice president and his brother have always understood and agreed that James’ business ventures are separate from and independent of Joe Biden’s career in public life,” Bates said.

We’ve heard that line before, such as when Joe Biden fat-shamed an Iowa voter for bringing up his son’s Ukrainian business dealings.

“Yet on occasion,” ProPublica reported, “as Jim pursued opportunities, Joe met with his potential clients or partners, at Jim’s request.”

Janet Yellen’s Financial Ethics Problems Aren’t As Bad As Joe Biden’s,"On Tuesday, Treasury secretary nominee Janet Yellen will come before the Senate Finance Committee for her confirmation hearing. That hearing took on a bit more drama after New Year’s Eve, when Yellen’s financial disclosure forms revealed she made millions of dollars giving speeches to Wall Street banks.

As one might expect, news of the incoming Treasury secretary making millions from Wall Street institutions, many of which she would regulate, caused concern among the progressive left. But given the way she paid taxes on those speaking fees, Yellen’s actions raise as many concerns about the actions of the man who appointed her: Joe Biden.

Millions from Wall Street

According to her financial disclosure form filed with the Office of Government Ethics, Yellen made more than $7.2 million giving speeches to dozens of businesses, many of them with ties to the financial sector. For instance, she received nearly $1 million from Citi for nine separate appearances, raising echoes of Hillary Clinton receiving $675,000 for three speeches to Goldman Sachs because “that’s what they offered.”

Yellen and the Biden team attempted to pre-emptively address concerns that the speaking fees raise conflicts of interest. Specifically, Yellen promised to consult Treasury ethics attorneys about any company that has paid her within the past 12 months.

Unlike Biden, She Paid All Her Taxes

But Yellen’s financial disclosure also contains a noteworthy omission, revealing that she did not funnel those speaking fees through an S-corporation to avoid paying payroll taxes on her earnings. By contrast, Biden’s financial disclosure forms list him as the president of the CelticCapri Corporation, and Jill Biden’s involvement with the Giacoppa Corporation.

I previously reported that Joe and Jill Biden created these corporations for their book and speech income. The Bidens paid income taxes on all the income they received in 2017, 2018, and 2019. But because they characterized more than $13.5 million of their $14.6 million in income those three years as corporate profits rather than wages, they avoided paying over $513,000 in payroll taxes that fund Medicare and Obamacare. Tax experts have called the Bidens’ maneuvers legally questionable, because they characterize intellectual work product—i.e., income from speeches—as corporate profits rather than wages.

Anticipating criticism from the progressive left for Yellen’s Wall Street speeches, the Biden transition team launched a pre-emptive attack defending Yellen. An official said Yellen’s record shows she will not “pull punches when it comes to bad actors,” claiming that “she will bring the same high ethical standards and tough enforcement philosophy to Treasury.”

Unethical Biden?

But unfortunately for Team Biden, standards cut both ways. If the incoming administration wants to make Yellen into the paragon of ethical conduct, it will make the contrast between the way she paid taxes on her speaking fees, and the way the man who appointed her handled his millions in honoraria, all the more obvious.

The fact that Yellen will have jurisdiction over tax policy—and the Internal Revenue Service—adds to the drama. If Yellen felt uncomfortable using an S-corporation to avoid payroll taxes on her speaking fees from Wall Street, does that mean she believes Biden violated tax laws by doing so himself? If so, will she ask the IRS’s career civil servants to consider an audit of Biden’s returns?

Count Yellen’s speeches, and the potential conflicts they pose, as fair game in her confirmation hearings. But so too should senators ask Yellen why she didn’t use an S-corporation to avoid payroll taxes on her speech income, and what she thinks of Biden’s use of this loophole. If Yellen has the ethical standards the Biden transition team says she does, perhaps Hunter won’t be the only Biden facing an investigation about his taxes.

How Biden Will Open The Floodgates To Transgendering Public Schools,"The next several years are likely to reopen the floodgates to leftists’ long repurposing of public schools to indoctrinate children with lies about sex. According to leftist reporting, once in office Joe Biden plans to quickly use executive power to push transgenderism in schools, farther than President Obama did. In Congress, Democrats plan to prioritize legislation to do the same, potentially with Republican support, with the so-called Equality Act and more.

On Nov. 7, Biden was reportedly the first candidate to mention transgenderism in his speech claiming he had won the presidency. This is only the tip of the iceberg. On the campaign trail, Biden promised to reinstate President Obama’s requirement that public schools put boys in girls’ sports and showers, and push this issue much more.

“I will flat out just change the law, eliminate those executive orders. There should be zero discrimination,” Biden said of Trump’s transgender policies in October to the mother of an eight-year-old child she claims is transgender.

“Joe Biden said that on his first day of office, he will give transgender students access to sports, bathrooms and locker rooms in accordance with their gender identity in all federally funded schools,” (emphasis added) a reporter said to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer after the election, in December. “Do you think he has the ability to do this and do you agree with his decision?”

“I agree with the decision and I know he’ll check things out thoroughly, legally,” Schumer responded.

In its “LGBTQ Policy” document, Biden’s campaign states:

On his first day in office, Biden will reinstate the Obama-Biden guidance revoked by the Trump-Pence Administration, which will restore transgender students’ access to sports, bathrooms, and locker rooms in accordance with their gender identity. He will direct his Department of Education to vigorously enforce and investigate violations of transgender students’ civil rights.

Many Ways to Screw Children When Adults Don’t Care

Now let’s refresh what we’ve already seen in schools with the encouragement of the Obama administration and leftist judges, which Biden has openly promised to revive. Some of this would happen without federal pressure, but there is no doubt that federal pressure accelerates and expands this publicly funded assault on children.

If you don’t think this is twisted, you are. If you believe in the legitimacy of any politician, institution, or school that is willing to countenance any of this, you are a morally bankrupt fool.

All of this will be accelerated under a Biden administration. This is not conjecture. He and his campaign have publicly pledged to do it.

I would like every “principled” whitewashed tomb of a pundit who told us Biden was “the moral choice” to stick all this up their pipes and light it on fire. They are willing to sacrifice girls’ bodies for their pride. That is beneath contempt.

Creepy Obsession with Naked Kids

Since Democrats are used to zero effective pushback from their neutered political opposition, they make many of their insane plans quite public. So we can predict quite clearly how Biden’s administration plans to expand upon the above track record.

In his policy document, Biden pledges to use federal agencies to prosecute schools that do not completely fulfill LGBT demands for putting naked children of both sexes together. He promises to apply the Obama administration’s suspension of school discipline for children of favored racial identity groups also to children of favored sexual behaviors. He promises to use schools to punish teachers and children for saying the truth about the sexes, and indoctrinate them to believe the left’s depraved views of sexuality that conflict with the views of all major world religions.

Biden also promises to excuse minors who identify as LGBT from penalties for committing crimes (yes, that’s really in his plan). He plans to create federal orphanages for LGBT youth who run away from their homes, and put transgender males into shelters for women. This would also be accomplished via the Equality Act that Biden supports and congressional Democrats plan to prioritize immediately upon him taking office.

All schools that receive federal funding, Biden’s plan says, will be required to treat people as the sex they claim to be. This would apply to not just K-12 schools but also preschools and higher education programs that receive federal funding, which is nearly all the nation’s higher education institutions.

This means your freshman daughter could be placed with a male as her college roommate and the Biden administration could prosecute the school if it allows her to switch. It means athletes staying overnight for away games could be forced to room with a kid of the opposite sex without even being informed of that in advance.

Remember, in its “Overnight Housing” section in the Obama Title IX regulations Biden pledges to reinstate, “a school must allow transgender students to access housing consistent with their gender identity and may not require transgender students to stay in single-occupancy accommodations or to disclose personal information when not required of other students. ”

Leftist Religion Makes War On Ancient Religions

If the Biden administration truly does apply this to all institutions that receive federal funding, these transgender diktats will apply to most private and religious institutions as well. Numerous private K-12 schools participate in federal programs such as school lunch. Numerous religious institutions that deal with children, such as foster and adoption agencies, camps, after-school care, and preschools, could also be affected.

Another avenue a Biden administration could use to force-feed children sexual confusion is the accreditation process. Colleges cannot receive federal funds, including student loans, which are now essentially nationalized, if they are not accredited through a federally approved agency. The accreditation process is already used to control colleges’ curricula and campus atmosphere by requiring institutionalized racism and sexism such as through quotas. It can also be used to force schools to transgender students.

Leftists have already been exploring this avenue. A California bill “would have pulled state and federal college subsidies from students who attend religious colleges unless those colleges strip their distinctive religious practices, especially in the areas of human sexuality and theology instruction.” The Obama administration also considered accreditation and personnel regulations that would have forced religious colleges to lie about God or lose federal funds.

The LGBT organization Human Rights Campaign recently made policy recommendations to the Biden administration that included pulling federal funds from all faithful Christian, Muslim, and Jewish institutions by banning their beliefs through the accreditation process. If a school is not accredited, its students may not benefit from the GI bill, transfer credits, or apply for graduate study, noted Southern Baptist Theological Seminary leader Al Mohler.

“This would mean abandoning biblical standards for teaching, hiring, admissions, housing, and student life. It would mean that Christian schools are no longer Christian,” he wrote.

Leftist activists have spent the Trump administration projecting their bigotry onto religious schools, starting controversies over the fact that parents use vouchers to pick schools for their children that don’t subscribe to leftist sexual ideology. A year ago, Wells Fargo and Fifth Third banks pulled millions of dollars in donations from scholarships for poor black children because those children’s parents had chosen to use them in Christian schools. Numerous “journalists” have been using their platforms to get Christian schools defunded this way by slandering their religious beliefs as “bigoted.” Expect all this to intensify and get federal assistance.

Many More Kids Are Going to Need Lots of Therapy

Don’t forget, the Supreme Court handed Biden another accelerant to this entire agenda by rubber-stamping the Obama bureaucracy’s garbage interpretation of the word “sex” as including the ridiculous concept of “gender identity.” The evil consequences will be applied to all religious and reality-based institutions possible over the next generation — unless Americans refuse to comply with this obviously insane and destructive lie. Any backup from politicians half of us elect would help, but none has so far been forthcoming.

In the absence of moral courage among most parents and politicians, American children continue to suffer. As I’ve noted before, “both earlier and increased exposure to sexual material increases children’s risky behavior — such as unprotected sex, multiple partners, and violence — and damages their mental health.” We’ve seen that in the past several years with growing mental health problems among the young and the unnatural spike in claims of gender dysphoria, especially among teenage girls. They are told to cut off developing breasts and take off-label drugs with life-altering destructive effects.

It seems all even the most energetic parents are willing to do about the prospect of their daughters being forced to be naked in a room with a penis, or encouraged to cut their breasts off and take drugs to assist HIV-positive sex, is impotently complain at school board meetings, after which the board votes against them and their school keeps getting its usual tax funding. The majority of parents don’t even do that. All of us continue to pretend institutions that countenance this assault on human nature have any moral legitimacy whatsoever.

It’s no wonder politicians don’t believe parents and grandparents care about little girls’ and boys’ innocence and safety when so few do anything to protect children except maybe yell at Fox News once in a while. Our politicians are just like we are: If they say the right things too many of us excuse their lack of follow-up, and everyone marches home to watch Netflix.

If parents pulled their children from any school where seeing penises and breasts was even a possibility by someone who doesn’t have the same equipment, or where trans ideology was treated as a reasonable or legitimate point of view, this issue would resolve within three months. Democrats would never truly jeopardize their mind fog factories.

But too many Americans are lazy cowards who point fingers about problems instead of doing what it takes to solve them, because solving problems is hard and whining on Facebook is easy. Too many Americans want a nice car, comfy house in the “right neighborhood,” high school sports nostalgia, and frequent eating out more than they want to protect children from being mind raped by sweetly smiling kindergarten teachers and gawked at by emotionally disturbed peers and teachers.

Most likely, there will be backlash. But also most likely, Biden and Democrats will get away with most of this. In fact, they’re counting on it. They’ll all be dead when today’s generation of emotional wrecks grows up and gets nuked by China because the only things they know how to handle are a vibrator, cell phone, and lipstick.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/01/18/how-joe-biden-will-open-the-floodgates-to-transgendering-public-schools/,2021-01-18
What Jefferson And Lincoln Say About National Unity In Dark Times,"President-elect Joe Biden has spent a better part of the last 16 months calling for unity and healing. Although some of his cabinet picks and early policy proposals have cast doubt on the authenticity of that objective, it remains a noble goal.

We do need unity right now. No, not the faux “unity” that comes from one half of the country either meekly surrendering its principles or by being effectively silenced by its opposition, but sincere unity — a reaffirmation of our founding principles; a recognition that violent extremists must be routinely condemned no matter their self-identified political affiliation; and a commitment to defending the U.S. Constitution.

Biden’s inaugural address won’t mean much in the long run if his calls for harmony and reconciliation aren’t followed by actions that prove his sincerity. Still, his first speech as the 46th president of the United States is a one-time chance for Biden to set the initial tone for the next four years.

If Biden and his transition team possess the wisdom, they’ll have revisited two particular inaugural addresses given in dire moments in America’s past. The words of Thomas Jefferson in 1801 and Abraham Lincoln in 1865 are invaluable to our present national crisis, and it would be prudent for the president-elect to ponder them and their calming influence on the nation.

‘One Heart and One Mind’

Jefferson gave his first inaugural on March 4, 1801, in the tense aftermath of a bitterly contested rematch of his 1796 loss to John Adams. At the time, many international observers — Great Britain chief among them — expected the young American republic to devolve into violence and dissolution. Instead, doubters were shocked when Jefferson succeeded Adams in the first peaceful transfer of power from one party to another in the nation’s history.

To great surprise, Jefferson didn’t seize the opportunity to proclaim a partisan political victory or seek vengeance on the Federalists who stymied him for years. Instead, he reminded the citizenry that political parties did not define them, exclaiming, “We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.” Indeed, they were, first and foremost, Americans.

The first duty of government, as Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, is to protect the people’s rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, natural rights that are fragile if not defended vigilantly. In the troubled time we live in — just as in 1801 and 1865 — politicians will be tempted to erode or curtail these rights instead of upholding them. Biden should enlist, as Jefferson promised, all the wise counsel and prudent advice he can get in this critical effort:

To you, then, gentlemen, who are charged with the sovereign functions of legislation, and to those associated with you, I look with encouragement for that guidance and support which may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked amidst the conflicting elements of a troubled world.

As more than 77 million Americans voted for a candidate other than Biden, the president-elect must internalize and embrace Jefferson’s reminder that a democracy is only as virtuous as it provides the same rights and protections to all its citizens — regardless of whether they are in the majority:

All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will to be rightful must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal law must protect, and to violate would be oppression.

‘Leave Them Otherwise Free’

As Jefferson articulated in his first inaugural, during the next administration, repairing our local, familial, and religious associations must be an essential part of calming the temperature of the nation. Furthermore, just as religious tolerance must be a bedrock of our society, political tolerance is equally important to domestic tranquility:

Let us, then, fellow-citizens, unite with one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things. And let us reflect that, having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions.

Finally, Jefferson’s first speech as president contains one of the most eloquent and succinct “mission statements” for what government should do, and what it should leave alone. It’s a message as relevant today as it was 220 years ago:

A wise and frugal Government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government, and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicities.

After four years of Donald Trump everywhere, all the time, unavoidable, and all-encompassing, Biden should take the closing sentiment of Jefferson’s first inaugural to heart: Upon securing law, order, and due process for the American people, the state should leave its citizens alone. In an ideal outcome, Americans across the country would forget Biden was president until a major public address or if, heaven forbid, Biden must lead America during a major war.

‘A Just and Lasting Peace’

Sixty-one years after Jefferson was tasked with uniting Americans, Lincoln faced an even greater challenge. Lincoln gave his second inaugural on March 4, 1865, more than three years into a bloody civil war that had already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of men.

His speech contains fewer than 700 words and likely would have taken just eight minutes to deliver. Like the even pithier Gettysburg Address, Lincoln once again proved he could convey grand ideas with poignant brevity. With a few carefully chosen words, Lincoln laid the foundation for the long, hard road back to peace.

As with Jefferson’s defeat of Adams and the Federalists, Lincoln didn’t use his inauguration to gloat in the coming demise of the Confederacy or to be overly jubilant in recent Union victories. Instead, the address took on the tone and effect of a sober yet soothing sermon rather than a typical political speech.

Early in the address, Lincoln recalls how few predicted the full, true, terrible nature of the Civil War. It’s a chastening passage for us to reflect on in the wake of the capitol Riots of Jan. 6, an event we now know could have been marred by far more bloodshed:

Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. … Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.

It is the closing of Lincoln’s second inaugural, however, that we must reassert, and that Biden must strive to live up to above all. Given our current tribal, identity-based, grievance-driven politics, and our ongoing battle with COVID-19, Lincoln’s peroration must be the guiding light that shapes the hearts of the American people as well as those who have been elected to represent them:

With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.

One thing Americans can agree on right now is that the country is hurting, frightened, and wary of what the future holds. And yes, asking Biden to emulate American titans like Jefferson in Lincoln is, admittedly, a daunting request.

To be sure, even if Biden’s inaugural rises to even a modicum of the gravitas, dignity, and equipoise of two of our greatest Founders it won’t restore America’s promise overnight, nor be a guarantee that Biden will continue to operate in accordance with the Constitution.

Yet, if he learns from the examples set by Jefferson and Lincoln, he has a chance to remind the vast majority of Americans — those who are willing to listen and want their country to succeed — that we can live amongst our fellow citizens as brothers and peacefully air our ideological disagreements without shedding any more precious American blood.

"Trump Had Same Vaccination Goals As Biden, But Media Booed Him","While some states such as New York are suffering from a slower-than-expected COVID vaccine rollout, others such as North Dakota, West Virginia, and South Dakota are prioritizing vulnerable populations at higher rates.

Instead of covering some of these states’ successes, however, the legacy media and Democrats, both of whom claimed a vaccine could not be created by the end of the year under President Donald Trump, are promoting and echoing a narrative that the nation’s current vaccine rollout as a whole is “disastrous,” “a mess,” and a “dismal failure.”

While the United States currently leads the world in the number of COVID vaccines administered, the press and even President-Elect Joe Biden’s administration have latched onto the narrative that Trump’s administration failed to pioneer a successful vaccine campaign and distribution process. Just this week, Biden’s incoming chief of staff Ron Klain told CNN, “We’re inheriting a huge mess here.”

This same scrutiny, however, is not being applied to Biden’s COVID vaccination plans. In December, Biden claimed that one of his top priorities for dealing with the pandemic included distributing 100 million doses to states in his first 100 days.

“My first 100 days won’t end the Covid-19 virus. I can’t promise that,” Biden said. “But we did not get in this mess quickly, we’re not going to get out of it quickly, it’s going to take some time. But I’m absolutely convinced that in 100 days we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better.”

In January, Biden modified his plan to include not only the distribution of 100 million vaccines but also “10o million shots in arms,” a feat that was hailed as “ambitious” by many in the media and on the left and even dubbed a “big goal” by Biden himself.

If we continue at our *current* trajectory, we will be right on the edge of 100 million shot in arms at the 100 day mark Despite that truth, the media is calling the current rollout ""disastrous"" and ""slow"" and Biden's plan ""ambitious""https://t.co/vcMwYWkiOy pic.twitter.com/CVBew3EHJo — PoliMath (@politicalmath) January 15, 2021

While Biden’s shiny vaccination proposition made its rounds, receiving praise and positive coverage from CNN, The New York Times, USA Today, Vox, and others as a way to help get the virus under control, data shows the former vice president’s goal isn’t as lofty as he says.

“President-elect Biden has made it very clear his goal is at least 100 million doses in the first 100 days. Namely, 1 million doses a day. We can do that, Chris. This is something that is doable,” said Biden advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci on MSNBC.

The week before Biden’s inauguration, there were approximately 849,387 COVID vaccines administered each day in the United States, a rate that, if it continues to increase, is likely to meet Biden’s 100-day goal for vaccinations.

So Biden’s plan is to keep doing what we’re doing. https://t.co/taW8GEj8sL — Stephen L. Miller (@redsteeze) January 17, 2021

Despite its similarities to the current rollout, Biden’s so-called “ambitious” plan for distributing and administering shots is still being celebrated by the same media that targeted conservative states as Florida for its rising COVID-19 cases while largely ignoring blue states with the same problem.

The corporate media has glaring double standards on COVID-19, extending to Biden’s administration and vaccination plan.

Biden's Unity Speech Can't Undo His Ongoing Scorn For MAGA Americans,"Ever since the near-octogenarian Joe Biden threw his hat in the ring for president of the United States, Americans have speculated about his mental decline. But the now-president’s cognitive decline pales in comparison to his cognitive dissonance. The man’s calls for unity completely contradict the other messages that escape his mouth and color his plans.

Conservatives have noted the shift in tone and tenor between campaign Biden and post-election Biden. The former version made half of the electorate out to be racists, sexists, and bigots and produced sentiments such as “you ain’t black” if you were considering casting your vote for Donald Trump. The latter produced sudden but endless calls for unity despite no attempt to reconcile with those he had so recently detested. These two versions came together in one speech: Biden’s inaugural address.

For listeners who successfully overcame the elementary unity script, the cognitive dissonance in the messaging was enough to give them whiplash. The facade of harmony, woven together with promises of hope and togetherness, couldn’t quite mask the subtle digs at the many Americans who couldn’t bring themselves to vote for this administration. Nor did this theme of unity quite drown out Biden’s enthusiasm for narratives to which half the country doesn’t subscribe: systemic racism, impending climate doom, and the moral goodness of equity, as opposed to equal opportunities.

“This is a time of testing,” Biden said. “We face an attack on democracy and on truth. A raging virus. Growing inequity. The sting of systemic racism. A climate in crisis. America’s role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities.”

For Americans who buy into these themes — that the most existential crisis facing our hurting nation is the climate, that white people are so hopelessly oppressive that all our institutions continue to be stained with racial animus more than 150 years since this great nation successfully passed the 13th Amendment, that it would be preferable to bring Americans down to the lowest common denominator in order to ensure equal outcomes — perhaps Biden is the man to tackle these “gravest of responsibilities.”

But what about the rest of us? According to Biden, we’re all in this fight toward a more progressive America together: “Now we must step up. All of us.” That’s what unity looks like. Our national diagnosis is that we are racist, science-denying, nationalist capitalists. And healing is only possible if we all agree and commit to leftists’ program.

The pleas for unification were ubiquitous. “To overcome these challenges – to restore the soul and to secure the future of America – requires more than words,” Biden announced. “It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: Unity. Unity.”

That admonition, however, directly followed more accusations about America’s racist character, alarm bells about the “desperate” planet, and a direct attack on Trump supporters, with language of “political extremism, white supremacy,” and “domestic terrorism.”

It might be easy to overlook these latter insults as a proper condemnation of the Capitol riots, if not for continued calls from figureheads in the president’s own party and corporate media complex to create a “9/11-style commission” to investigate the events of Jan. 6 including presumably the peaceful rally attendees, since law enforcement is so far doing a fine job of apprehending the criminals. Even more broadly, these politicians and pundits continually call for the “de-Baathification” of the Republican Party and the “deprogramming” of Trump supporters, all the while they’re being de-platformed.

Beyond Biden’s tired and unconvincing unity schtick, the remainder of his address was a pile of humdrum platitudes, some of which were still loaded with contempt for the Trump-devoted:

“There is truth and there are lies.”

“We endured and we prevailed.”

“We will get through this together.”

The 46th president’s address lacked American gusto, but no amount of presidential enthusiasm could have accomplished what Biden set out to do Wednesday: unify a deeply divided country, whose wounds cut all the way down to her national soul, her very identity. For ultimately, the disunity exists over a fundamental disagreement of what exactly America is and who we want her to be.

Biden’s commencement speech was an early snow, a beautiful and pure dusting but woefully inadequate to veil the ugliness of the dead and dirty earth peeking through. In Biden’s “dark winter,” his policies and invective are the tufts of lifeless weeds that no amount of glistening flakes of unity rhetoric can possibly cover.

Biden Follows 'Unity' Speech With 48 Hours Of Divisive Social Policy,"President Joe Biden proclaimed Inauguration Day “A National Day Of Unity” on Wednesday, following his first presidential address on Capitol Hill that featured a theme of unity while vilifying dissenters from the progressive agenda as white supremacists.

“To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future of America requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in democracy: unity, unity,” Biden declared in his inaugural address, after having said the following just moments before:

The cry for survival comes from planet itself, a cry that can’t be any more desperate or any more clear. And now a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.

Biden’s speech, absent a close reading of the transcript might have sounded genuine. It might have looked genuine, and it might felt genuine, but a closer examination of his first acts in office peel back the curtain of a figure in the White House whose calls for unity are deeply unserious. One can’t unify a country while condemning many as white supremacists, let alone pursue a partisan progressive agenda on day one in office amid an aggressive impeachment of the predecessor.

The left doesn’t want the country to unify. The left wants the left to unify with each other, while adopting the idea of “de-programming” as a new Democratic d-word to characterize their wishes of the right. In MSNBC host Joy Reid’s case, it’s “de-Baathification.”

By Friday, Biden’s first 48 hours in office have launched the new administration with 17 executive orders, more than were issued in the first month of their presidencies by Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton combined. If it seems Biden is breaking records with executive orders right out of the gate, that’s because he is. In the January of their first inauguration, Trump signed four, Obama eight, Bush two, Clinton two, George H.W. Bush one, and Ronald Reagan one.

The new president’s wave of executive orders is already signaling that his administration will serve as a vehicle for the progressive revolution despite empty rhetoric on the campaign trail disputing otherwise. On Wednesday, Biden accelerated the elevation of wokeism as a secular religion, rejecting history by immediately dismantling the 1776 Commission and reversing Trump’s ban on seminars by promoting critical race theory throughout the federal government.

[Read the final report of the 1776 Commission, stripped by the Biden White House, here.]

Former Obama White House national security adviser Susan Rice, now head of Biden’s Domestic Policy Council, has been tasked with leading the new administration’s efforts to require agencies “rooting out systemic racism” to be a focal point of their mission. Biden’s team said Rice will lead a “robust interagency process to hold the federal government accountable for advancing equity for families across America.”

The new White House has also effectively dismantled women’s sports with a new anti-science executive order requiring institutions such as schools that receive federal funding to allow biological males who identify as females to be admitted to female sports programs and locker rooms.

“Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,” the order reads, pledging the administration’s commitment to “prevent and combat discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.”

Other executive orders passed in during “unity” week have included the reversal of the Mexico City policy barring taxpayer-funded abortions, removal of Trump-implemented travel bans, an ax to the border wall, and the reinstatement of sweeping Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants.

Apart from signing a cascade of executive orders in his first days in office, Biden shattered norms when he fired the National Labor Relations Board’s top prosecutor, a position that typically serves four-year terms. Peter Robb, who held the title of NLRB general counsel, refused Biden’s request to resign prior to the end of his four-year tenure and was in turn fired on Biden’s first day.

“It was my understanding that the incoming administration intended to foster civility and unity in this country and in the governing of this country, promising to adhere to the rule of law and enabling its chief law enforcement officers the independence, free from White House interference, to enforce the laws of the United States,” Robb initially wrote, declining the invitation to step down. “A presidential removal of the NLRB’s General Counsel prior to the expiration of his or her term violates these promises and principles.”

Hours after Robb’s successor, Deputy General Counsel Alice Stock, was announced to serve as acting general counsel, Biden fired her too.

Biden’s first 48 hours have illustrated a one-sided pledge for unity that doesn’t actually unify anything.

Here’s The Full List Of Every Lie Joe Biden Has Told As President,"Updated June 23, 2021

As President Joe Biden assumes the Oval Office, The Federalist will continue its rigorous coverage of the new White House, keeping the administration accountable with substantive fact-checking throughout Biden’s tenure.

59: White House Suggests Republicans, Not Democrats, Tried To Defund The Police

After last year’s summer of rage, Jen Psaki suggested that Republicans, not Democrats, were trying to defund the police.

“Part of his announcement is also ensuring their specific guidance to communities across the country to ensure that they have funding to get more community police around the country, something that was supported by the American jobs plan that was supported, that was voted into law by Democrats, just a couple of months ago. Some might say that the other party was for defunding the police,” Psaki concluded during a White House press briefing.

Here’s Jen Psaki suggesting REPUBLICANS were trying to defund police pic.twitter.com/m8pus7BS9O — Kylee Zempel (@kyleezempel) June 23, 2021

Psaki’s comments come after a year of leftist-led crusades to “defund the police” after the death of George Floyd.

Biden acknowledged the left’s quest to remove power from policing but warned civil rights leaders in December that it was the ‘defund the police’ push that granted Republicans victories in many down-ballot races on Nov. 3.

“That’s how they beat the living hell out of us across the country, saying that we’re talking about defunding the police,” Biden said in a leaked call.

58: Biden Says Corporate Media Reporters Are The Smartest People In The Entire Country

President Joe Biden told reporters on Wednesday following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin that he thinks they’re the smartest people in the entire country.

“You all are some of the brightest people in the country,” Biden said. “I mean it, I’m not being solicitous. But it makes no sense for me to negotiate with you!”

Biden’s affirmations for his Democrat cronies in the corporate media came minutes after he told the CNN White House Correspondent she was in the wrong business, and lobbed insults at the press pool for “never” asking a positive question.

Just a few weeks ago, reporters fawned over Biden as he munched on a chocolate chocolate chip ice cream cone.

57: Biden Repeats Lie That Rioters Killed Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick

During a press conference following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden once again repeated the lie that the Jan. 6 rioters killed a Capitol police officer.

“It’s one thing for literally criminals to break through [sic], go into the Capitol, kill a police officer, and be held unaccountable and than it is for people objecting, marching on the Capitol and saying ‘you are not allowing me to speak freely. You’re not allowing me to do A, B, C, or D.’ And so they’re very different criteria.”

President Biden says the ""criminals"" on Jan. 6 killed a police officer Medical examiners determined Officer Brian Sicknick died of natural causeshttps://t.co/os0fRXFpMO pic.twitter.com/C0Ml5NrooE — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) June 16, 2021

While the White House continues to tout Officer Brian Sicknick’s death as a reason to condemn Capitol rioters, the Washington D.C. chief medical examiner revealed in April that Sicknick, who died on Jan. 7, suffered two strokes and died of natural causes later at the hospital. The report followed months of erroneous coverage promoted and propelled by corrupt corporate media institutions and Democrats.

Biden’s false claim follows a deflection from Putin who mentioned the Jan. 6 riot and Ashli Babbitt’s death in response to a reporter who asked why many of his own political opponents are are “dead, imprisoned, or jailed.” Biden called Putin’s comparison “ridiculous.”

56: Biden Keeps Saying That The Economy Was Tanking Before He Arrived At The White House

Throughout his campaign for congressional Democrats to jam his expensive infrastructure proposal through both chambers, Biden has repeatedly claimed that the economy was tanking before he arrived in the White House.

“Remember, when I took office in January, our economy was in a tailspin,” Biden said last week.

As the Wall Street Journal reported, “Biden uttered these words eight days after his own Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. real gross domestic product ‘increased at an annual rate of 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2021.'”

Biden claims his infrastructure plan will be good for the U.S. and even potentially stimulate the economy but as noted by The Tax Foundation, federal spending costs will eventually outweigh the benefits for Americans.

“We estimate the infrastructure spending would increase long-run GDP by 0.3 percent, but this positive economic effect is entirely offset by the increase in corporate taxation, resulting in less corporate investment which reduces GDP by 0.5 percent in the long run, reduces wages by 0.5 percent, and eliminates 101,000 full-time equivalent jobs,” the Tax Foundation’s analysis of The American Jobs Plan suggests.

55: Biden Repeats Claim Capitol Riot Days Before Inauguration Was Worst Assault On Capital Since Civil War

While demanding a 9/11-style commission to study the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, President Joe Biden appeared to forget about 9/11 altogether.

Speaking to reporters outside a Cleveland-area ice cream parlor, Biden repeated his claim the riot was “the greatest assault since the Civil War on the capital.”

But at any rate, I came for ice cream."" pic.twitter.com/gT1hI7mRL3 — DJ Judd (@DJJudd) May 27, 2021

On Sept. 11, 2001 however, 125 people died instantly with 64 passengers on a plane flown into the Pentagon by Al-Qaeda terrorists. Only one person died at the 2021 riot at the Capitol when they were shot by security.

54: Psaki Claims ‘Number Of Officers’ Died On Day Of Capitol Riot. Zero Did.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a May 21 briefing that a “number of officers lost their lives” on the day of the January Capitol riot.

“Obviously, the president’s view is that a number of officers who lost their lives paid a tremendous sacrifice on a day that will be a stain on our democracy for many years to come,” Psaki said.

That number of officers, however, is zero.

While Democrats, in their second Trump impeachment, pointed to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick’s death the day after the riot based on a debunked report in the New York Times, the D.C. medical examiner concluded in April that the officer died of natural causes.

53: Biden Appears to Make up Amtrak Story

At a 50th-anniversary event for Amtrak in Philadelphia, President Joe Biden said that when he was vice president, a train conductor congratulated him for traveling 1.5 million miles on Amtrak. A Fox News report out on May 5, however, pokes holes in the president’s account.

“When I became vice president, one of the Capitol Hill newspapers estimated that I had taken more than 7,000 round trips on Amtrak over my career,” Biden said. “I think that’s an exaggeration. I’m going to rely on those two conductors. … One of them was a guy named Angelo Negri.”

Biden continued, telling the audience Negri estimated Biden had traveled 1.5 million miles on Amtrak trains around his fourth or fifth year as vice president, which would have been in 2013 or 2014.

“My mom was sick, and I used to try to come home almost every weekend as vice president to see her,” Biden said. “I got on the train and Angelo Negri came up and he goes, ‘Joey, baby,’ and he grabbed my cheek like he always did. … He said, ‘Joey, what’s the big deal? One-point-three million miles on Air Force Two? Do you know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?’ I said, ‘No, Angie, I don’t know.’ He gave me the calculation and he said you traveled 1.5 million miles on Amtrak.”

As Fox News pointed out, however, an obituary for Negri says the conductor retired in 1993, decades before Biden’s supposed story took place, while he was still a senator from Delaware. Biden’s mother died in 2010.

52: White House Says Trump Admin Spurred Border Crisis

Psaki said Trump created “an immigration system rooted in destructive and chaotic policies” that spurred the border crisis.

“Our administration immediately jumped into action to address the influx of migrants at the border, something that began during and was exacerbated by the Trump administration,” Psaki said.

.@PressSec says that the influx of immigrants at the southern border is ""something that began during and was something that was exacerbated by the Trump administration."" pic.twitter.com/iacLlRwxVg — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) May 4, 2021

While apprehensions under Trump’s leadership did begin increasing in fall 2020, border crossings surged during the first few months of Biden’s presidency. Not only did U.S. Customs and Border Protection take more than 172,000 illegal aliens into custody in March, but data also shows increases between February and March forced the CBP to stretch its chart to accommodate the largest numbers it has seen in at least two decades.

51: Biden Claims $1.8 Trillion American Families Plan Won’t Add to Deficit

Biden claimed in Virginia on May 3 while promoting the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan that the Democrats’ latest behemoth wish-list bill “doesn’t add a single penny to our deficit.”

“It’s paid for by making sure corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent just pay their fair share,” Biden said.

According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, however, the plan “includes $1.5 trillion of offsets, resulting in a $300 billion net deficit impact over a decade.”

50: Biden Says Anyone Making Less Than $400k Doesn’t Have to Pay Taxes

Biden said that anyone making less than $400,000 a year doesn’t have to pay taxes.

“Anybody making less than $400,000 a year will not pay a single penny in taxes,” the Democrat said. “And we will not increase the deficit either, unlike the last gigantic tax cut which increased the deficit by $2 trillion.”

https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1389279329335529476?s=20

Biden’s words may be a gaffe, but even experts agree that his promise not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year is ambitious and not realistic. Even if the Democrats concentrate on “taxing the rich,” those who fall below the $400,000 mark are subject to consequences from a highly taxed economy.

49: Biden Blames Trump for the Border Crisis (Again)

During his interview with NBC News, Biden claimed that the “one god-awful mess at the border” was created by the Trump administration.

“Hey, look, here’s what happened – the failure to have a real transition. The two departments that didn’t give us access to virtually anything were the immigration [department] and the Defense Department. So, we didn’t find out they had fired a whole lot of people, that they were understaffed considerably,” Biden said.

This statement, Former Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said, is false.

“At the Department of Homeland Security, we provided the transition team with more than 200 extensive briefings on homeland security issues, the majority of which dealt with the border, immigration policy, and the processes and procedures we had in place to secure the border and reduce asylum fraud. … During the transition, the incoming Biden administration was made fully aware of the consequences of undoing the effective policies that had fixed the previous crisis and driven illegal crossings down substantially,” he said.

Biden is quick to shift the negative media coverage of the disaster at the border to his predecessor, but Trump is not responsible for the thousands of people crossing the border. Not only have the number of illegal aliens surged to record highs since Biden assumed office, but migrants have admitted that the reason they came is that they knew the Biden administration wouldn’t turn them or their families away. Even though illegal migrants may be hopeful about a future in the U.S., Biden and his team are struggling to keep up with housing the aliens in safe and clean conditions.

48: Biden Claims the Border Is ‘Under Control’

Despite his belief that Trump created the border crisis, Biden falsely claimed that it is “getting urgent action now.”

“For example, a month ago, we had thousands of young kids in custody in places they shouldn’t be, and controlled by the Border Patrol. We have now cut that down dramatically,” Biden said in an interview with NBC News.

As noted by Heritage, even if the “number of unaccompanied minors in Customs and Border Protection custody has decreased, the numbers are clear: most of those minors are simply being transferred from one government agency to another — in this CBP custody to the Department of Health and Human Services.”

47: Biden Says Trump Admin Didn’t Adequately Plan for Border Crisis

During his interview with NBC News, Biden claimed the Trump administration did not plan for the border crisis.

“For example, we have — they didn’t plan for, which it comes every year, this flow, whether it is 22,000 or 10,000, they didn’t have the beds that were available. They didn’t plan for the overflow. They didn’t plan for the Department of Health and Human Services to have places to take the kids from the Border Patrol and put them in beds where there was security and there were that people who could take care of them. So, there is a significant change right now, a significant change in the circumstance for children coming to and at the border,” he said.

As noted by Former Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan, “This is an outrageous claim.”

“In November 2020, CBP under the Trump administration had fewer than 800 unaccompanied alien children, family units, and single adults in custody. In March of this year, that number had exploded to more than 10,000. Even though apprehensions started increasing in 2020, as growing numbers of illegal migrants gambled on a potential Biden election victory and subsequent amnesty, the Trump administration had strong policies in place to quickly and responsibly process and deport most of these individuals. This meant there was no systemic issue with backlogs or overcrowded CBP or HHS facilities,” Morgan said.

46: Biden Claims His Administration Has Control of the Border Crisis

In an interview with NBC’s Craig Melvin on “Today,” Biden falsely claimed his administration successfully reigned in the southern border crisis.

“It’s way down now, we’ve now gotten control,” Biden said.

“Do not send your kids, period. … they're in jeopardy going, making that 1000-mile trek.” -President Biden’s message to parents sending their children across the border pic.twitter.com/stHHQeUiWl — TODAY (@TODAYshow) April 30, 2021

Instead of facing the fact that U.S. Customs and Border Protection took more than 172,000 illegal aliens into custody in March, making it the busiest month for the agency in more than 20 years, Biden blamed the previous administration for not preparing for the influx exacerbated by Democrat rhetoric.

“They didn’t plan for, which comes every year, this flow, whether it’s 22,000 or 10,000,” Biden said. “They didn’t have the beds that were available, they didn’t plan for the overflow. They didn’t plan for the Department of Health and Human Services to have places to take the kid from the border patrol and put them in beds where there’s security and there were people that could take care of them.”

Biden promised that the White House and other federal agencies are taking “urgent action now,” a record-breaking 18,890 unaccompanied teens and children have been packed into overcrowded shelters plagued by COVID-19 spread and “dangerous” conditions for longer than the 72-hour limit permitted by federal law.

45: Biden Says Banning ‘Assault Weapons’ Reduced Gun Violence and Mass Shootings

Biden said that former President Bill Clinton’s ban on assault weapons contributed to the decline in gun violence and mass shootings over 10 years in his joint address.

“A ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds … we beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. Check out the report over 10 years,” Biden said.

President Biden once again touts the lie that former President Clinton's ban on ""assault weapons"" reduced gun violence and mass shootings over 10 years. Rep. @laurenboebert knows this is false. You can read @KatiePavlich's fact-check on the claim here: https://t.co/ALfjLcD7UM pic.twitter.com/1zCgpJ6MMN — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) April 29, 2021

As noted by Townhall’s Katie Pavlich, a 2004 University of Pennsylvania Center of Criminology study funded by the Department of Justice found that the “ban cannot be credited with a decrease in violence carried out with firearms.”

“We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury,” the report stated. “The ban’s impact on gun violence is likely to be small at best, and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. AWs [assault weapons] were used in no more than 8% of gun crimes even before the ban.”

Biden’s claim that semiautomatic rifles with “high capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds … can be fired off in seconds” is also disputed. While a semiautomatic rifle may be able to fire off 100 rounds in less than a minute, speechwriters chose to use “seconds,” which implies a smaller timeframe than what is actually required to go through that much ammo.

President Biden is about to lie to the American people about guns. Again. My favorite here is the blatant lie that ""high capacity magazines"" enable semi-automatic rifles to fire 100 rounds in seconds. It's just not true.https://t.co/nIeYNXhF9L — Amy Swearer (@AmySwearer) April 29, 2021

44: Biden Brags That COVID Spending Bill Was Bipartisan Effort. It Wasn’t.

During his first address to a joint session of Congress, Biden said his $1.9 trillion COVID spending bill was a bipartisan effort.

“What else have we done in those first 100 days? We kept our commitment — Democrats and Republicans — of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households. We’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door,” Biden said.

No Republicans, however, voted for the bill, which was jammed through the Democrat-controlled Congress using budget reconciliation. While Biden met with members of the GOP about the legislation to discuss changes, he ultimately refused to compromise on its price.

43: Biden Claims Jan. 6 Riot ‘Worst Attack on Our Democracy Since the Civil War’

Biden claimed in his first State of the Union address before Congress that the Jan. 6 riot was “the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.”

By the death toll, however, the United States has seen far worse.

Five died who were present at the riot, four of whom through natural causes, including the Capitol police officer whose death was weaponized by Democrats to impeach then-President Donald Trump. One Capitol rioter was killed by a police officer.

The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, killed nearly 3,000 people after two commercial airliners flew into the New York’s World Trade Center buildings, one into the Pentagon, and one into a field in Pennsylvania.

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, killed more than 2,400.

42: Biden Admin Repeats Fake News Russia Bounty Story to Justify Sanctions

The White House used a recently discredited narrative to justify enacting sanctions against Russia.

New reports state that U.S. intelligence had “low to moderate” confidence in a story claiming that Russia offered members of the Taliban bounties in exchange for killing American soldiers, but the Biden administration cited the narrative as one of the reasons Russia should be punished. Not only was the Russia bounty story mentioned in the White House “fact sheet” detailing the sanctions but it was also echoed by government officials.

Despite former President Donald Trump’s insistence in 2020 that the story was “fake news,” corporate media immediately latched onto the narrative and promoted it as fact. Many of the same news organizations that peddled the story have yet to walk back their previous coverage.

41: Biden Makes Misleading Statements About Gun Delay for 2015 Charleston Shooter

During his announcement of new gun control executive orders, Biden claimed that it was a three-day FBI background check delay called the “Charleston loophole” that allowed Dylann Roof to execute the 2015 Charleston church shooting.

“What happened is someone was allowed to get the gun used to kill those innocent people at a church service,” Biden said. “If the FBI didn’t complete the background check within three days. There was a process. If it wasn’t done in three days, according to the Charleston loophole, you get to buy the gun.”

As the Washington Free Beacon notes, not only did Roof shoot up the church more than two months after his background check was delayed, but “the FBI did not find the records that should have prohibited him from buying a gun” due to a mistake by the agency.

40: Biden Insists Gun Manufacturers Can’t Be Sued

Biden insisted during his gun control executive order announcement that gun manufacturers can’t be sued.

“People don’t realize the only industry in America, a billion-dollar industry, that can’t be sued, that are exempt from being sued, are gun manufacturers,” Biden said. “This is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued.”

As noted by the Washington Free Beacon, multiple gun manufacturers such as Remington and Sig Sauer have been sued over design flaws and defects in their products. The Free Beacon also noted that while the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act protects manufacturers from lawsuits “stemming from the criminal misuse of guns by third parties,” other industries including pharmaceutical companies tasked with creating the COVID-19 vaccine are protected have immunity under the 2005 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act.

39: Biden Says Gun Show Purchases Don’t Require Background Checks

During his announcement introducing multiple gun control executive orders, Biden said background checks are not required for purchases at gun shows.

“Most people don’t know when you walk into a store and you buy a gun, you have a background check but you go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want with no background check,” Biden claimed.

BIDEN: ""You go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want–no background check."" pic.twitter.com/TbvfDPEwlp — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) April 8, 2021

While private firearm sellers in some states may complete gun show transactions without a background check, what many Democrats often label as the “gun show loophole,” any gun dealers with a federal firearms license are required to run background checks on customers investing in a weapon.

When confronted with a fact-check on Biden’s comments, the White House denied the president’s words just minutes after he stated them.

“No, it’s not his belief,” Psaki said. “He believes that gun that background check should be universal. … We know what his position is.”

A reporter just asked Jen Psaki why Biden lied and said, ""You go to a gun show, you can buy what you want and no background check."" Psaki just said the complete OPPOSITE and said ""it is not his belief."" These two comments were made within 60 mins of each other.

38: Biden Repeats Spurious Claims About Georgia’s New Election Law

Biden told ESPN that Georgia’s new election reform law not only bans water and food in polling lines but also closes polls early so working people can’t vote.

“This is Jim Crow on steroids, but they’re doing it in Georgia and 40 other states,” Biden said. “Imagine passing a law saying you cannot provide water or food for someone standing in line to vote. Come on. Are you going to close a polling place at 5:00, where can people just get off? This is all about people, working folks, ordinary folks that I grew up with, from being able to vote.”

Despite Biden’s claims, nothing in the new legislation suggests that voting hours should end early. In fact, the law mandates that polls be open at least 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during early voting and offered counties the option to extend those hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. if necessary, a provision the Washington Post fact-checkers even acknowledged. The new law also provides exceptions for “poll officers” to give voters food and water as long as they are not provided by political interest groups.

37: Biden Insists ‘No One Making Under $400k Will See Their Federal Taxes Go Up’

During his introduction of a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, Biden repeated the lie that “no one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period.”

“This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe in American capitalism. I want everyone to do well,” Biden said. “Right now a middle-class couple, a firefighter and a teacher with two kids, making a combined salary of say $110,000 to $120,000 a year pays 22 cents for each additional dollar they earn in federal income tax. But a multinational corporation that builds a factory abroad, jobs overseas … is bad for American competitiveness, deeply unfair to the middle-class families, wrong for our future.”

BIDEN: ""No one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period."" pic.twitter.com/3offgNfVEY — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) March 31, 2021

Despite months of promises from Biden and his team on the campaign trail and from the debate stage, White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently clarified that individuals making $200,000 a year who are married to someone making similar amounts will be subject to the proposed tax hike.

36: Biden Repeats Falsehoods About Trump’s Tax Cut

Less than one week after he stated the claim during his first press conference, Biden insisted that “83 percent of the money went to the top 1 percent” because of Trump’s tax cuts.

Biden says again that in Trump tax cuts, ""83% of the money went to the top 1%."" That's a think tank projection of what would happen in 2027 if its individual cuts expired after 2025 as scheduled, not what has happened already; estimate is top 1% got 21% in 2018, get 25% in 2025. — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) March 31, 2021

As previously noted by The Federalist and other outlets, Trump’s tax plan not only benefitted Americans across the working, middle, and upper classes, but it also contributed to a large decrease in unemployment and underemployment. The 83 percent figure often touted by Biden, fact-checkers determined as early as 2018, is “true for 2027 but only because most of the individual income tax changes expire by then,” but not other years.

35: Biden Says Georgia’s Election Law Cuts Back Voting Hours for Working Americans

Biden is spreading misinformation that Georgia’s new election law ends voting hours early, making it difficult for working Americans to get to the polls after they leave their jobs for the day.

“What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick … deciding that you’re going to end voting at 5:00 when working people are just getting off work,” the president said during his first press conference.

Biden repeated the falsehood in an official statement released just one day after his presser, claiming that “among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over.

While Biden insists the new law is “un-American” and “sick,” nothing in the new legislation suggests that voting hours should end early. In fact, the law mandates that polls be open at least 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during early voting and offered counties the option to extend those hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. if necessary, a provision the Washington Post fact-checkers even acknowledged.

34: Biden Insists He Is Tough on China

During his first presser, Biden claimed he will “deal with China effectively” by “investing in American workers and American science” and “hold China accountable.”

The Committee on Ways and Means, however, says, “China’s corporate income tax rate is 25 percent, despite being a Communist nation” and that Biden’s promise to “increase our federal rate to 28 percent, on top of state corporate taxes, exposes American firms to takeovers from competitors based in Communist China.”

The committee also noted that Biden “has so far not committed to any action to enforce the China Phase One Agreement achieved during the Trump Administration, which included very specific requirements that protect American workers.”

33: Biden Makes Misleading Claim About R&D Investments

In his first official press event nine weeks into office, Biden claimed that research and development investments have consistently fallen since the 1960s.

“Back in the 1960s, America invested more than 2 percent of GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today it is 0.7 percent,” Biden stated.

Research and development spending, however, is at its highest point and accounted for more than 3 percent of the real GDP before the COVID-19 economic shutdown.

32: Biden Falsely States Top Corporations Don’t ‘Pay a Cent in Taxes’

During his first press conference, Biden said top corporations in the United States don’t put any money toward taxes.

“Ninety of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars are not paying a cent in taxes,” Biden said, “reducing taxes to a point that people who are making, you know, if you’re a husband and wife, school teacher, and a cop, you’re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year.”

The Committee on Ways and Means, however, said that the claims Biden made relied on information that “continually confused the difference between taxable income and financial statements.”

“From sales taxes to property taxes to payroll taxes, Fortune 500 companies pay billions of dollars in taxes to local, state, and federal government,” they wrote in a fact check. “Federal tax laws provide important bipartisan tax incentives to encourage specific economic activity — including investments in R&D, energy innovation, low-income housing, and distressed communities — which reduces taxable income without changing financial statement profits.”

31: Biden Says Trump’s Tax Cuts Only Helped the Rich

During his press first official press event, Biden falsely claimed that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did not put “money in ordinary people’s pockets” and instead only helped the “top 1 percent.”

“Do you hear them complain when they passed [a] close to $2 trillion Trump tax cut, with 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Do you hear them talk about that at all?” Biden asked.

Not only did Trump’s tax cut benefit Americans across the working, middle, and upper classes, a fact even corporate media outlets noted, but it also contributed to a large decrease in unemployment and underemployment. The 83 percent figure often touted by Democrats, fact-checkers determined in 2018, is “true for 2027 but only because most of the individual income tax changes expire by then,” but not other years.

30: Biden Says Majority of Migrant Families that Cross Border Are Sent Back

Biden said in his first press conference 64 days after inauguration that a majority of the migrant families crossing the border illegally are sent back.

“If you take a look at the number of people are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back,” Biden said at the White House. “We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming.”

According to Customs and Border Protection data, however, a fraction of the 20,000 family units apprehended have been sent back.

Further, Michelle Hackman, who covers immigration for the Wall Street Journal, reported on March 23 that an internal document she reviewed with her colleagues found that the weekend prior to Biden’s press conference, “only about 10 percent of families were being expelled.”

An internal document we saw over the weekend showed only about 10% of families were being expelled https://t.co/PrmRzEPLZw — Michelle Hackman (@MHackman) March 23, 2021

29: Biden Says Trump Admin Didn’t Address Communist China’s Human Rights Abuses

During his first official press conference, Biden implied that his predecessor former President Donald Trump did not address communist China’s human rights abuses.

“I made it clear that no American president, at least one did, but no American president ever backed down from speaking out of what’s happened to the Uyghurs, what’s happened in Hong Kong, what’s happening in the country. That’s who we are,” Biden said. “The moment a president walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world.”

The Trump administration, however, did directly condemn China’s actions against the minority Muslim population located in the Xinjiang province as a genocide before leaving office. Following investigations into the CCP’s use of mass imprisonment of more than 1 million people, forced labor, forced sterilization, torture, and limits on religious freedom, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that the United States has definitively evaluated and labeled these actions by the CCP as “crimes against humanity.”

Secondly, the Biden regime just deleted the State Dept page highlighting China’s human rights abuses: https://t.co/Py9yNKPFsD — R.J. Kassam (@RaheemKassam) March 25, 2021

The Trump administration previously issued sanctions against China shortly after Trump signed the “Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020” into law in June of 2020.

28: Biden Says Migrants Not Flooding the Border Because of Him

During his first press conference, Biden claimed illegal aliens are not crossing the southern U.S. border because of his rhetoric and open border policies, but because migrants’ chances of “dying on the way because of the heat in the desert” are lower in January, February, and March and because of the instability in their home countries.

“I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I’m a nice guy. … The truth of the matter is, nothing has changed. … That’s not the reason they’re coming. The reason they are coming is that it’s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one,” Biden said. “Number two, they’re coming because of the circumstances in [their] country.”

Biden believes surge in migrants is due to conditions in their countries & weather that's better for traveling not because he's seen as a ""nice guy"" who's lax on the border

While Biden might be convinced people are flooding to the U.S.-Mexico border in a normal immigration cycle, Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador recently said it is the new president’s migration policies and rhetoric that sparked hopeful “expectations” and created the border crisis.

“Expectations were created that with the government of President Biden, there would be a better treatment of migrants. And this has caused Central American migrants, and also from our country, wanting to cross the border, thinking that it is easier to do so,” López Obrador said, just weeks after he told reporters that many of those crossing the border illegally view Biden as “the migrant president.”

Some illegal aliens who crossed the border have also testified that Biden was the deciding factor for why they chose to come to the U.S.

“So did you come here because Joe Biden was elected president?” ABC’s Martha Raddatz pressed.

“Basically. Basically,” one migrant father replied. “The main thing was the violence in our country. And the second thing, I think, was Joe Biden.”

27: Biden White House Claims Regular Talks With McConnell

White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed at a March 24 briefing that the president regularly speaks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

McConnell’s office, however, told NBC News reporter Julie Tsirkin that the two have only spoken once since the inauguration in January, which focused on the military coup in Myanmar.

26: Biden Lowers Tax Hike Threshold After Promising It Would Only Affect People Making Over $400K

While the president recently told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that his bid to increase taxes would only apply to “anybody making more than $400,000,” and that any individual making less than that amount “won’t see one single penny in additional federal tax,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki recently clarified that individuals making $200,000 a year who are married to someone making similar amounts will be subject to the proposed tax hike.

Biden tax hike could hit people earning $200K, White House clarifies https://t.co/YYzEqoDPJz pic.twitter.com/wW4Wj6aCPt — New York Post (@nypost) March 17, 2021

This revelation comes after months of promises from Biden and his team on the campaign trail and from the debate stage that their attempts to raise taxes would not affect individuals making under $400,000 a year but eventually morphed into households making under $400,000 a year. Studies from at least five economic analysis institutions suggest, “Biden’s proposals would increase taxes, on average, for households at every income level” and that his intention to repeal Trump’s tax cuts would only further this outcome.

25: Biden Makes Sweeping Projection About Child Poverty

During his March 11 address, Biden said the COVID-19 spending bill “will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts.”

While researchers at certain think tanks and universities conceded that portions of the American Rescue Plan have the potential to “reduce child poverty by more than half in 2021,” the provisions in the bill apply only to this year, leaving the long-term effects of the spending bill on child poverty a mystery. There is no current evidence to suggest that the policies included in the plan will have a long-lasting effect on child poverty.

24: Biden Overreports Number of Vaccinated American 65 and Older

In his address on March 11, Biden lied about when the COVID-19 vaccine first became available in the United States. He also misspoke about the number of Americans 65 and older who have received the vaccine.

“When I took office 50 days ago, only 8 percent of Americans — after months — only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination,” Biden said. “Today that number is 65 percent.”

The vaccine, however, was not available for months before Biden took office. The first COVID-19 vaccine dose in the United States was administered on Dec. 14, just one month before the new president transitioned into the White House. Not only was Biden wrong about when the shots first became available, but he also lied that 65 percent of Americans 65 years old and above have been vaccinated. As of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that only 62.4 percent of those 65 and older received at least one round of the vaccine, not 65 percent.

23: Biden Claims US COVID Death Toll Exceeds Three Wars and 9/11

During his address to the nation on March 11, Biden falsely claimed that the total number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. was more than those in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and 9/11.

“I carry a card in my pocket with a number of Americans who have died from COVID to date. It’s on the back of my schedule.

As of now, total deaths in America: 527,726. That’s more deaths than World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined,” Biden stated.

President Biden notes the more than 527,000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States: ""That's more deaths than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War and 9/11, combined."" https://t.co/Zv4cfRYdhW pic.twitter.com/NKcXVzZcyy — PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) March 12, 2021

While Biden is correct in saying that at least 527,726 Americans have reportedly died from coronavirus, the nation’s death toll does not exceed the fatalities that resulted from the three wars and one terrorist attack he mentioned in his speech. Even without 9/11 included, more than 580,000 people died fighting in the aforementioned wars. “World War I: 116,516 deaths, World War II: 405,399, Vietnam: 58,220” the Washington Post reported.

22: Biden Claims Coronavirus Was Met with Silence

In his prime time address to the nation on March 11, Biden claimed the novel Wuhan coronavirus “was met with silence and spread unchecked.”

The Trump administration, however, convened a White House coronavirus task force, which CNN complained was too white, while congressional Democrats were pursuing partisan impeachment proceedings.

21: Biden Says Goal of 100 Million Vaccine Shots in 100 Days Was Tough for Him to Meet

Biden claimed his administration’s initial goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days was difficult to meet in his prime time address on March 11.

“When I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was kind of way over the top,” Biden said. “I said I intended to get 100 million shots in people’s arms with my first 100 days in office.”

That vaccination pace, however, had already been met by his White House predecessor. About 1.3 million Americans were vaccinated on Biden’s first full day in office.

20: Biden Says COVID Spending Bill Garnered Bipartisan Support

Shortly after Democrats in the Senate passed the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending bill, Biden falsely claimed in a celebratory speech that the legislation garnered bipartisan support.

“Quite frankly, without the overwhelming bipartisan support of the American people, this would not have happened. Elected officials heard overwhelming public support. Every public opinion poll showed overwhelming support for this plan,” Biden said.

Just watched his whole 10-minute monologue and this did happen. Also tries to describe bill as bi-partisan even though not a single Republican in either chamber voted for it https://t.co/P6HFBIePqD — Julie Kelly 🇺🇸 (@julie_kelly2) March 6, 2021

Despite Biden’s rhetoric pretending that the legislation received support from people on both sides of the political aisle, every Republican senator voted against passing the massive bill. Last month, the White House agreed to meet with 10 Republicans to discuss a smaller relief proposal that cut spending by almost two-thirds. Biden, who launched his presidency on a platform of unifying the country and toning down partisanship, however, did not budge on his decision to push the legislation through both chambers of Congress without GOP support.

19: Biden and White House Deny Border Crisis as Crossings Surge

Biden denied that there is a crisis at the border after departing a White House briefing in early March evaluating how to provide more than 20,000 beds for the largest projected influx of unaccompanied migrant children who are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

“We’ll be able to handle it,” Biden told reporters as he was escorted out of the room by his vice president.

When asked if there’s a border crisis, Biden says “no”https://t.co/1r8KjY5OKR pic.twitter.com/itA90NEAyo — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) March 2, 2021

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas also told reporters at the beginning of March that there is no crisis at the southern border, despite his own agency’s projections that more than 117,000 unaccompanied minors will attempt to cross the U.S.-Mexico border this year, numbers that are on track to exceed the current record of minors in federal custody by 45 percent. More than 13,000 of them are expected to come to the United States in May, giving the Biden administration just two months to sort out its plans for housing migrant minors after refusing to expel them.

“Do you believe that right now there is a crisis at the border?” a reporter asked.

“No,” Mayorkas said. “There is a challenge at the border that we are managing. … The men and women of the Department of Homeland Security are working around the clock seven days a week to ensure that we do not have a crisis at the border, that we manage the challenge, as acute as the challenge is.”

18: Biden Says Administration Not Opening New Migrant Centers

Biden falsely claimed during a February interview with Univision that the new administration is merely reopening migrant camps operational during the Trump administration even as the Biden White House creates new ones.

“They opened up one, one that was a former one used in the administration in the last administration,” Biden said. “Our hope and expectation is that won’t stay open very long and that we’ll be able to provide for every kid who comes across the border safely.”

https://twitter.com/BonillaJL/status/1365450210227458051?s=20

Border agents opened up a new facility in Donna, Texas, three weeks ago, according to the Washington Post, while creating new camps in Del Rio, Texas, and Arizona.

17: Biden Repeats False Claim That Trump Told Public to Inject Bleach

Biden repeated the debunked story, rated false even by left-leaning PolitiFact, that President Donald Trump recommended during a White House coronavirus press briefing to inject bleach.

“I think there’s a growing awareness that injecting bleach into your system doesn’t do it for you,” Biden said in remarks to black essential workers.

Trump, however, said no such thing, as Biden also asserted last summer. Instead, Trump was speaking on the role of disinfectants help in preventing serious infection with viruses such as the novel Wuhan coronavirus.

Speaking w/ Black essential workers, Biden says, ""I can't tell you how much a difference you're making. We have met with people all over the country…I think there's a growing awareness that injecting bleach into your system doesn't do it for you.""

16: Biden Lies Again About Not Inheriting a Vaccine Plan

During his visit to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing plant in mid-February, Biden once again falsely claimed that his administration did not inherit a vaccine plan from former President Donald Trump.

“Just over four weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country,” Biden said. “My predecessors — as my mother would say, God love ’em — failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office.”

Despite this repeated claim from Biden as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and White House press secretary Jen Psaki, officials such as Anthony Fauci have reassured the public that the Trump administration and Operation Warp Speed did not leave the Biden administration empty-handed.

“We’re certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution,” Fauci said, disputing the White House’s claims.

Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s project to facilitate the creation and distribution of the vaccine, also passed along a plan to Biden and his team once they assumed office.

15: Biden Says There Is ‘Overwhelming Consensus’ to Pass Excessive COVID Spending

During a February CNN town hall with Anderson Cooper, Biden claimed there was “overwhelming consensus” to pass a coronavirus spending bill with excessive funding.

I’m committed to pass — look, here’s — some of you are probably economists or college professors or you’re teachers in school. This is the first time in my career — and as you can tell, I’m over 30 — the first time in my career that there is a consensus among economists left, right, and center that is over — and including the IMF and in Europe, that overwhelming consensus is, in order to grow the economy a year, two, three, and four down the line, we can’t spend too much.

A column in the Wall Street Journal published in January disproves Biden’s erroneous assertion by highlighting remarks from several of Biden’s own political allies on the left who refute the idea of passing a gargantuan package.

Another article in the New Yorker published days before Biden’s CNN appearance cited warnings over Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief package by prominent economists.

“The 1.9 trillion program could overheat the economy so badly as to be counterproductive,” Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, tweeted.

14: Biden Denies Psaki Said Schools Should Open Just One Day a Week

The same night he claimed a COVID-19 vaccine was not created until after he joined the White House, Biden denied that White House press secretary Jen Psaki ever said schools should be open just one day a week, claiming it was simply “not true” and eventually clarifying his statement to say it was “mistaken in communication.”

Asked about @PressSec saying that schools should be open one day a week, Biden says ""that's not true"" and it was a ""mistaken in communication."" The quote from Psaki: pic.twitter.com/TVbeo80JnB — Philip Melanchthon Wegmann (@PhilipWegmann) February 17, 2021

At the beginning of February, Psaki proudly declared that Biden’s goal to have children back to classroom learning by his 100th day in office, in April, only applied to half the country’s schools and only requires one day of in-person learning — meaning just 50 percent of kids attending school for about five days total would accomplish the “goal.” When a reporter asked her to clarify the Biden administration’s position, Psaki doubled down on the plan to require just one day of in-person learning per week in “the majority of schools.” Days later, the White House flip-flopped its position on school reopenings, and Psaki told reporters that Biden’s plan was to ensure every school would be open “five days a week.”

13: Biden Claims COVID Vaccine Wasn’t Around When He Assumed Office

During a CNN town hall on Feb. 16, Biden falsely claimed the United States did not have a COVID-19 vaccine when he transitioned into the White House in late January.

President Biden said in reference to a vaccine — ""Which we didn't have when I came into office."" That's just blatantly false. @CnnTown — Beverly Hallberg (@BeverlyHallberg) February 17, 2021

Against faulty predictions from journalists, so-called experts, and verified Twitter users who cast doubt on former-President Donald Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, the first round of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the United States to health care workers in mid-December following the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use and mass distribution approval. The FDA also applied emergency authorization to the Moderna vaccine in mid-December, approving it for widespread distribution and use long before Biden joined the White House.

Biden received both doses of the Pfizer COVID vaccine before he was inaugurated.

12: Biden Statement on Impeachment Falsely Attributes Officer’s Death to Capitol Riot

Biden’s statement on Trump’s impeachment acquittal opened with the assertion that a Capitol police officer who died on the day of the January riots was killed by the mob of Trump supporters storming the congressional complex.

Is there any evidence at all that this statement from President Biden is true? Does it matter?https://t.co/jEBu5zKjhX pic.twitter.com/vGUCH0hWSk — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) February 14, 2021

“It was nearly two weeks ago that Jill and I paid our respects to Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who laid in honor in the Rotunda after losing his life protecting the Capitol from a riotous, violent mob on January 6, 2021,” Biden said.

There is absolutely no evidence to prove, however, that Sicknick was brutally killed by the mob that day, a claim amplified by Democrats throughout the impeachment proceedings with the help of legacy outlets such as the New York Times, which quietly later issued a correction as the trial came to a close.

Amazing: the NYT just quietly appended this so-called ""update"" – which is really a correction if not a retraction – to its Jan 8 article about Officer Sicknick's death.

11: Kamala Harris Repeats Bogus Claim New White House Starting ‘From Scratch’ on Vaccines

Vice President Kamala Harris repeated the bogus claim that the Biden White House has been forced to start “from scratch” to handle the coronavirus vaccine rollout.

“We’re starting from scratch,” Harris said, “on something that’s been raging for almost an entire year.”

Even National Institutes of Health Director Anthony Fauci rejected the assertion made by White House officials in January, as the Trump administration reached the 1 million shots-a-day threshold Biden has attempted to claim credit for.

10: Biden Said He Would Fire Staff ‘On the Spot’ for ‘Disrepect.’ Hasn’t Fired Deputy Press Secretary

Biden issued a stark warning to about 1,000 presidential appointees upon taking the reins of the Oval Office.

“If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect or talk down to someone, I promise you, I will fire you on the spot — on the spot. No ifs, ands, or buts,” Biden said.

On Feb. 12, however, Vanity Fair reported White House deputy press secretary TJ Ducklo threatened a Politico reporter inquiring about a romantic relationship with an Axios political reporter tasked with covering the vice president after leaving the Biden beat.

“I will destroy you,” Ducklo reportedly threatened Politico’s Tara Palmeri, if the paper published the story.

Instead of unemployment, however, Ducklo was given a one-week suspension without pay.

9: Biden Said He ‘Misspoke’ When Claiming US Would Reach Only 100 Million Vaccines in 100 Days

Biden said during a Jan. 25 press conference he “misspoke” when claiming the United States would reach only 100 million coronavirus vaccine shots given out within the administration’s first 100 days, a pace reached by the Trump administration. Biden then emphasized a hope of reaching 150 million instead.

The White House COVID-19 Response Team tweeted two days later, however, that the Biden administration’s goal of 100 million doses in 100 days hasn’t changed.

The President set an ambitious goal of administering 100 million shots in our first 100 days. To get there, we’ve got to average about a million shots per day.

8: Biden Trashed Trump’s China Travel Ban as Xenophobic Before Signing His Own

When Trump implemented a travel ban on China in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, then-candidate Biden railed against the executive action as “xenophobic,” claiming such restrictions do not work.

Less than a year later, Biden has implemented his own travel bans on South Africa, Brazil, Great Britain, and 26 other European countries in the second week of his presidency.

7: Biden Team: Trump Vaccination Plan ‘Worse Than We Could Have Imagined’

After Biden staffers lied, telling CNN there was “nothing for us to rework” in terms of a vaccination distribution plan, White House press secretary Jen Psaki admitted at the podium during a Jan. 25 briefing that there was a plan — they just won’t give credit. Psaki told reporters the plan from the Trump White House was “much worse than we could have imagined.”

.@PressSec says the coronavirus vaccine distribution plan inherited from the Trump White House is ""much worse than we could have imagined."" — Anders Hagstrom (@Hagstrom_Anders) January 25, 2021

The plan inherited by the Biden White House, however, has already put the new administration on a trajectory to reach its goal of getting 100 million people vaccinated within its first 100 days.

Below is the chart outline for the distribution process under Operation Warp Speed, which produced not one, but two coronavirus vaccines in record time.

6: Biden Warns Pandemic Will Worsen After Pledging to Shut Down Virus

Biden spent the entire campaign last year running on a platform to shut down the novel coronavirus, only to back away from the signature pledge on day three of his White House tenure with a bold admission.

“There’s nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months,” Biden said on Jan. 22.

Not only did Biden’s official campaign promise acknowledge that “the trajectory of COVID-19 in America is headed in the wrong direction” and that his administration would be the solution, but Biden also pledged numerous times to “immediately put in place a national strategy that will position our country to finally get ahead of this virus and get back our lives.”

5: Biden Claims Federal Government Never Acted with Urgency to Combat Pandemic

Joe Biden claimed the federal government failed to “act with the urgency” that was necessary to combat the coronavirus pandemic, apparently neglecting to mention the Trump White House’s Operation Warp Speed that produced two viable coronavirus vaccines by the year’s end.

Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn also pointed out that Congress passed trillions in stimulus, providing funds for pandemic efforts and economic recovery.

4: Biden Team Tells CNN Trump Offered No Plan for Vaccine Distribution

Sources within the Biden administration told CNN they inherited no vaccine distribution plan from the previous White House.

“There is nothing for us to rework. We are going to have to build everything from scratch,” one source reportedly told CNN’s MJ Lee, except there was, as outlined in Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, included below.

The Biden team’s statements were also contradicted by Dr. Fauci the same afternoon.

“We’re certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution,” Fauci told reporters.

3: Biden White House Claims Elites ‘Celebrating’ Is Exception to Mask Edict

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki justified Biden’s decision with his family to forgo face masks at the Lincoln Memorial after signing an executive order requiring them on all federal lands.

“He was celebrating a historic day in our country. … We have bigger things to worry about,” said Psaki, whose dismissal of the face mask as an insignificant issue was contradicted by the White House edict passed hours earlier.

Though Biden has received both shots of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines stipulate that vaccinated people are to continue wearing face masks, citing a lack of research showing whether those vaccinated can still spread the virus. While Biden likely did not need to wear a face mask, considering he was outside and adequately distanced from others, the absence of a mask flies in the face of Biden’s executive order, in which “celebrating” is not listed as an exception.

2: Biden Falsely Claims ‘All’ Media Smeared Vaccine Plan as ‘Impossible’

Joe Biden defended his administration’s goal to vaccinate 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office after a reporter questioned whether the target was too modest.

“When I announced it, you all said it wasn’t possible. C’mon. Gimme a break, man,” Biden snapped.

While few articles at major publications have voiced some skepticism, they remained rare, undermining Biden’s claim that “all” media had been overwhelmingly pessimistic of the Biden administration reaching the 100 million mark by the end of April.

1: Biden Vows to Be Unity President After Smearing GOP Sens. as Nazis

Biden launched his first term as commander-in-chief by branding himself as the unifier-in-chief while aggressively pursuing a partisan progressive agenda promoting left-wing ideas of “social justice” after smearing two Republican senators as Nazi collaborators.

“To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart,” Biden pleaded with the American people.

Less than two weeks prior, however, the “unity” president smeared Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas as Nazis.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/01/22/heres-the-full-list-of-every-lie-joe-biden-has-told-as-president/,2021-01-22
Canceling Keystone And Reducing U.S. Arms Are Biden's Gifts To Russia,"Since assuming office last Wednesday, President Joe Biden has been busy issuing more than two dozen executive decisions that will profoundly affect domestic affairs and foreign policies. Among his foreign polices directives, two decisions stand out. They’ll benefit Russia at the expense of the interests of our allies, American workers, and America’s national security.

The first executive decision that benefits Russia was Biden’s executive order to rescind the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. The Keystone project plans to build a 1,200-mile pipeline from Alberta, Canada to Nebraska, where it would join existing pipelines so 830,000 daily barrels of oil from Canada can easily reach refineries and ports on the Gulf Coast. From there, they could be exported conveniently to the rest of the world market.

The Canadian company that proposed the project, TC Energy (formerly TransCanada), applied for U.S. government approval of the project in 2008, when America was experiencing one of the worst economic recessions in our nation’s history. A study by the Obama administration’s State Department estimated the pipeline would create “3,200 temporary construction jobs directly, 42,000 additional jobs indirectly, and generate over $2 billion in wages.”

TC Energy sweetened the appeal of the project to Democrats by promising “a $10 million Green Job Training Fund; $500 million for indigenous suppliers and jobs; and 100 percent renewable power to operate the pipeline.”

Russia Loves Biden’s Scuttling of the Keystone XL Deal

In addition to economic benefits, an increased supply of oil from a friendly ally like Canada will reduce dependency on Russian oil supplies among our energy-deficient European allies. About 30 percent of the European Union’s gas imports and 35 percent of its oil imports come from Russia. Germany, the largest economy in the European Union, is even more vulnerable — 36 percent of its natural gas imports and close to 40 percent of its oil imports come from Russia.

This explains why, despite strong objections from both the Obama administration and the Trump administration, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insists that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will bring Russian gas to Germany, must go forward.

The EU’s dependency on Russian energy presents a serious security risk. If Russia were to cut off energy supplies to the EU, some estimate the EU’s reserves would only allow it to survive for three months. No wonder the EU wields so little leverage to hold Russia’s Putin accountable for his domestic and international aggressions.

Unfortunately, the Keystone project has become a victim of leftist politics. Even though President Obama’s State Department found through five separate studies the project would have no material impact on greenhouse gas emissions, environmentalist groups have fought the project since day one. Additional analysis shows that shipping oil by rail or tanker would generate more greenhouse gas emissions and more chances for leaks than through a pipeline.

When two American Indian groups in Nebraska joined the opposition to the pipeline project on the ground of tribal sovereignty, TC Energy offered an alternate route to address their concerns.

Despite all the benefits, compromises, and multiple rounds of environmental analysis, President Obama eventually refused to issue the presidential permit for the pipeline, still claiming it would increase greenhouse gas emissions. When Trump was elected, he quickly approved the project to go ahead. Yet, on day one of Biden’s presidency, he revoked the permit for the pipeline.

Biden’s decision is an insult to Canada, one of America’s most trusted allies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed disappointment as the pipeline “supports thousands of jobs on both sides of the border.”

In addition, Biden’s decision is a slap in the face of American workers. With the stroke of a pen, Biden made thousands of well-paying job opportunities disappear at a time the unemployment rate in the United States is still quite high due to the government-mandated lockdowns during the pandemic. Because Canada will not stop producing and shipping oil, revoking the pipeline project does little to better the environment and will force Canada to find a new partner, most likely China.

Russian leader Vladimir Putin, however, is assuredly ecstatic over Biden’s decision. Indeed, Biden just took a viable competitor of Russia’s energy supply off the table. Going forward, Putin can easily weaponize Russia’s energy supplies to compel the EU to accept his domestic oppression of dissent and enable him to achieve aggressive foreign policy goals.

The Flawed New Arms Treaty

If the Keystone XL debacle wasn’t bad enough, President Biden delivered another gift to Russia on day two by announcing that he would seek a five-year extension to the “New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty” arms control pact with Russia.

The treaty, signed by President Obama in 2010 and set to expire on Feb. 5, 2021, limits the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads each. The treaty, however, is deeply flawed. Rebeccah Heinrichs, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute specializing in nuclear deterrence and missile defense, notes one major defect:

Due to the treaty’s counting rules, a bomber is counted as one weapon no matter how many nuclear bombs it carries. This permits greater uncertainty rather than clarity and demonstrates that New START’s much-vaunted ‘cap’ on deployed strategic nuclear weapons really are not.

Another weakness of the treaty is that it doesn’t address how to limit Russia’s capacity to pursue other nuclear weapons outside of the treaty. Russia has been taking advantage of this loophole by modernizing its existing nuclear weapons and developing new ones while claiming compliance with the treaty.

Patty-Jane Geller, the policy analyst for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation, writes, “New START did not limit tactical warheads, and Russia maintains a tactical arsenal of an estimated 2,000 warheads” (in contrast, the United States has about 500).

Additionally, as Geller points out, “Russia has also been developing destabilizing new delivery systems outside of New START, including an unmanned, underwater nuclear drone, a nuclear-powered cruise missile, and an air-launched ballistic missile, all nuclear-armed” adding “Russia is developing new high-yield and earth-penetrating warheads to attack hardened U.S. military targets.”

What’s even more disturbing, according to Geller, is that while Russia has been building up its nuclear weapons outside the limits of the treaty, under the Obama administration, “the United States not only reduced its deployed warhead and delivery vehicle count but decided to limit its own capabilities that are not restricted by the treaty.”

Blind to other Threats

Worse still, the New START treaty is so outdated it doesn’t include China. The Pentagon warned last year that China has been rapidly building up its nuclear weapon capacity, and will likely double its nuclear warhead stockpile within the next decade.

The Pentagon also concluded that China’s People’s Liberation Army has “already achieved parity with or exceeded the US in at least three key areas: shipbuilding, land-based conventional ballistic and cruise missiles, and integrated air defense systems.” Any nuclear arms treaty without China as a signatory is largely meaningless and doesn’t make the world a safer place, which is exactly why the Trump administration was pressing to bring China into its nuclear arms control talks with Russia.

Experts such as Heinrichs and Geller say it didn’t serve our national interests to renew the New START without fixing its flaws. They all recommended the Biden administration engage Russia for a new round of negotiations and find a way to bring China to the table.

Yet Russia has been urging the Biden administration to renew the treaty in its present form since it doesn’t restrict Russia from modernizing its existing nuclear weapons nor from developing new ones. By agreeing to extend the same treaty for five years without any fixes, President Biden is doing precisely what Russia is asking for.

Democrats and the leftist legacy media have treated Russia as the biggest threat to America’s democracy on daily basis for the last four years. They accused the Trump campaign of “collusion” with Russia during the 2016 presidential race even though an extensive investigation found no credible evidence for this extreme claim, while Trump was frequently criticized for not being tough on Putin.

Yet, from revoking the Keystone XL pipeline permit to seeking an automatic extension of a flawed and outdated New START treaty, President Biden’s first 48 hours in office have greatly benefited Russia at the expense of the interests of our allies, American workers, and America’s national security. Nevertheless, his Democrat colleagues on Capital hill and media allies don’t seem to mind at all. It’s as if the threats Russia poses suddenly evaporated once a Democrat took the White House.

New York Times Idol-Worships Joe Biden’s Heretical Faith,"“Biden’s Catholic faith grounds his life and policies.” This is the text in the photo caption of a New York Times article by Elizabeth Dias. Entitled “In Biden’s Catholic Faith, an Ascendant Liberal Christianity”, the Dias applauds Biden for being “the most religiously observant president in over half a century.” The article showers Biden with praises and likens him to Jesus Christ himself for leading the charge in promoting an “ascendant liberal Christianity” that is being proposed as the purest form of following Christ.

The keystone to Biden’s political Christianity, and the next evolution in faith that the newspaper calls every serious Christian to emulate, is evident and woven throughout this article. We must become “less focused on sexual politics and more on combating poverty, climate change, and racial inequality,” it claims, openly substituting politics for religion.

Note that we must not use the term sexual “morality,” but “politics,” which is more about policies and power than what is right and wrong. While every Christian must fight every injustice, it’s clear any nation that deems the unborn as worthless will likely fall far short in other avenues of morality. If the basic human right to life is deemed worthless, all other rights are apt to crumble as well.

According to Dias, however, Biden’s shift is closely united to the person of Jesus and parallel to the teachings of Pope Francis. Indeed, there is a concerted effort to align Pope Francis with the president and liberal ideology as a way to excuse Biden and others from clearly contradicting Roman Catholic teaching.

Somehow, someway, his open rejection of infallible church teaching on the protection of unborn life makes President Biden more like Jesus to The New York Times. Furthermore, although some of his comments may be ambiguous at times, Pope Francis stated in January 2020 that the protection of human life is the “preeminent issue” in both social and political life. The context of these words was a meeting with American bishops.

Even the homilist at the morning Mass on the day of the inauguration also noted Biden should be compared to Jesus. Fr. Kevin O’Brien serves as the president of Santa Clara University and has been a close friend of Biden for years. He crafted his homily around the personhood of Joe and Jesus, because they both desire, he says, “to help and protect people and to advance justice and reconciliation, especially for those who are too often looked over and left behind.”

O’Brien must be unfamiliar with the Biden administration’s plan to advance abortion rights under the guise of reproductive health. This will inevitably lead, not to the protection of the helpless, but further the attacks on the most vulnerable.

The Times notes “Jesus taught that a nation is judged by how it treats the least of these, the poor, the hungry, the sick, the immigrant.” Yet the keyword for emulating Christ is found in the understanding of the “least” in society.

How, by any reasonable definition, can the “least” not mean the unborn child in the womb — literally the weakest member of society? Indeed, the Times’s analysis neglects the fact that Pope Francis, the U.S. bishops, and the entire history of the church have stated abortion is a fundamental human rights issue and that no Catholic in good standing can support the heinous practice. Yet Biden does, adamantly, and The New York Times praises him as an exemplar of religion. If that’s so, it’s not of the Christian religion.

On the contrary, liberal Christianity states that faith in Jesus is only valid if it does not assume or propose that it is true, but merely a nice life philosophy. Dias notes that the president’s inauguration speech “rooted himself and the country in a Christian moral vision that makes room for a pluralistic society.”

Therefore, Biden is a better Christian because he does not concern himself with sexual “politics,” which is personified in the fact that he is a crusader of abortion and invited two transgender preachers to his inaugural prayer service. In the background we hear the refrain again: “We must never focus on sexual politics.”

Biden’s administration is viewed as a breath of fresh air because the last four years have been “embodied” by “white evangelicals laser-focused on ending abortion.” Apparently, it is more crucial to note that these preachers were white rather than discuss the logical position of the Christian stance on abortion grounded in biology and the teachings and life of Christ.

Why doesn’t Biden follow the science in this arena and truthfully ponder the faith that he speaks about so often? Science tells us that at the moment of conception complete human DNA is present. Jesus said that whoever receives a child in his name receives God himself (Mark 9:37). Biden quoted Psalm 30 at his inauguration, but forgot the psalmist who sang: “For You created my inmost being; You knit me together in my mother’s womb” (Psalm 139:13).

Biden’s move to support intrinsic evil has already met contention from his own church. The president’s inauguration speech and his move to codify Roe v. Wade both met responses by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

The bishops called for Catholics to pray for Biden and commented that it is “deeply disturbing and tragic” that any president would support abortion in such a manner, noting that Biden’s Catholic faith should change his life and policies. Explicit in these words is the fact that morality and truth are objective and not merely determined by those who set policy and happen to hold power.

The Times argues that Biden “adopted the position of a chaplain” at his inauguration and that he has taken on a “biblical posture” in his presidency thus far. Christians, however, must be on alert. Political operatives are now attempting to flip the script on what it means to be a follower of Christ and are moving to disqualify morality right along with it.

Catholics must unite on all fronts to combat this illogical distortion of Christianity that praises evil, neglects the sacred, and looks to craft its own version of reality. While some Catholics will devote the majority of their efforts to learning about the faith in order to defend its teachings (including abortion), others will spend their time in the slums with the poor and serving the world’s physical needs.

Whatever our different roles may be, we all have a part to play in practically, intellectually, and spiritually ushering forth a Christianity that is rooted in all of Jesus’s teachings while affirming what it truly means to love the least among us.

Joe Biden’s Abortion Policies Are Grounds For Excommunication,"The Catholic Church has a Joe Biden problem. With Thursday’s announcement the Biden administration has reversed the Mexico City Policy’s ban on U.S. taxpayers funding foreign abortion providers, such as Planned Parenthood International, church leaders now must make a choice: Either condemn Joe Biden’s pro-abortion governance or become complicit in the president’s scandalous support of abortion and lose the moral authority necessary to pastor the flock.

During the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden relied on his Catholic roots to woo a segment of middle-class voters who had abandoned the Democratic Party to vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Trump and his cohorts “look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, [who] grew up in Scranton,” Biden charged during his first presidential debate, in an attempt to reclaim the Catholic voting bloc that helped elect John F. Kennedy the first Catholic president more than a half-century ago.

While peddling his claimed Catholicism in battleground states, Biden was genuflecting at the altar of the extreme abortion left, promising to undo the many pro-life policies adopted by the Trump administration. During the campaign, Biden even “rescinded his long-held support for the Hyde Amendment,” which prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for U.S. abortions.

Biden’s strong advocacy for unrestricted and government-funded abortion—an intrinsic evil according to church teaching—coupled with his campaign casting him as a “practicing Catholic” created a conundrum for the American hierarchy. This metastasized following Biden’s election as the 46th president of the United States.

By mid-November, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) announced the establishment of a task force “to address issues surrounding the election of a Catholic president and policies that may come about that would be in conflict with Catholic teaching.” In announcing the task force, the organization’s president, Archbishop Jose H. Gomez of Los Angeles, California, noted that “we are facing a unique moment in the history of our country” with the election of Joe Biden as this country’s only second Catholic president.

“This presents certain opportunities but also certain challenges,” Archbishop Gomez noted, adding that while “the president-elect has given us reason to believe his faith commitments will lead to certain policies that we favor,” he also “support[s] policies that are against some fundamental values we hold dear as Catholics.” “This includes repeal of the Hyde Amendment and his support for Roe v. Wade,” the USCCB’s president noted.

Gomez reaffirmed his commitment to addressing the challenge Biden presents to the church when, shortly after the long-time politician took his oath of office, Gomez released a statement on Jan. 20, 2021, sharing his prayers for the new president and our country. In this same statement, after calling President Biden’s “piety” a “moving witness to how his faith has brought him solace in times off darkness and tragedy,” and his “longstanding commitment to the Gospel’s priority for the poor” “hopeful and inspiring,” Gomez highlighted that “our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender.”

“For the nation’s bishops, the continued injustice of abortion remains the “preeminent priority,” Gomez continued. “As Pope Francis teaches, we cannot stay silent when nearly a million unborn lives are being cast aside in our country year after year through abortion.” He continued:

Abortion is a direct attack on life that also wounds the woman and undermines the family. It is not only a private matter, it raises troubling and fundamental questions of fraternity, solidarity, and inclusion in the human community. It is also a matter of social justice. We cannot ignore the reality that abortion rates are much higher among the poor and minorities, and that the procedure is regularly used to eliminate children who would be born with disabilities. Rather than impose further expansions of abortion and contraception, as he has promised, I am hopeful that the new President and his administration will work with the Church and others of good will.

Gomez’s statement caused bristling by at least one of his brothers in Christ. Cardinal Blasé J. Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago, posting a Twitter thread chastising the supposedly “ill-considered statement” that was “critical of President Biden.”

Cupich took no issue with the veracity of Gomez’s statement—or with President Biden’s pro-abortion proclivities. Instead he complained that the issuance of the statement represented an “internal institutional failure,” which Cupich proclaimed “must be addressed” so that together they can “take up the work of healing our nation in this moment of crisis.”

Cupich’s bureaucratic wallowing took on an even more pedantic tone when Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, faced questioning about Biden’s forthcoming abortion policy later that same day. Owen Jensen from the Catholic network EWTN asked Psaki about Biden’s plans related to “two big concerns for pro-life Americans: the Hyde Amendment, which of course keeps taxpayer dollars, from paying for abortions, and the Mexico City Policy, which keeps tax dollars [from funding abortions overseas.”

Psaki response was scandalous: “I think we’ll have more to say on the Mexico City Policy in the coming days,” she began, adding, “But I will just take the opportunity to remind all of you that [Biden] is a devout Catholic and somebody who attends church regularly. He started his day attending church with his family this morning. But I don’t have anything more for you on that.”

As promised, last Thursday, President Biden had “more to say on the Mexico City Policy.” In an executive order signed that day, the president rescinded the Mexico City Policy and with the stroke of his pen authorized American tax dollars to fund international organizations that counsel women on abortion services, perform abortions, and lobby foreign governments to legalize abortion.

The Catholic Church can no longer ignore President Biden’s support for the grave moral evil of abortion and his clear demonstration “that he is not in full communion with the Catholic Church.” By signing the executive order rescinding the Mexico City Policy, President Biden has turned promises and policy positions—such as his assurance on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade that “the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to codifying Roe v. Wade and appointing judges that respect foundational precedents like Roe”—into unequivocal formal cooperation with the grave sin of abortion.

If church leaders continue to ignore President Biden’s formal cooperation with abortion, they will become complicit in the scandal. Here, non-Catholics must understand “scandal” refers not to some tabloid concept, but to a grave evil. As the “Catechism of the Catholic Church” explains, the evil of scandal proves gravely dangerous to the souls of our Christian brothers and sisters:

Scandal is an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil. The person who gives scandal becomes his neighbor’s tempter. He damages virtue and integrity; he may even draw his brother into spiritual death. Scandal is a grave offense if by deed or omission another is deliberately led into a grave offense. Scandal can be provoked by laws or institutions, by fashion or opinion. Therefore, they are guilty of scandal who establish laws or social structures leading to the decline of morals and the corruption of religious practice, or to ‘social conditions that, intentionally or not, make Christian conduct and obedience to the Commandments difficult and practically impossible.’

Shortly after Biden’s election, Archbishop Emeritus of Philadelphia Charles J. Chaput spoke of the scandal his oxymoronic profession of his Catholic faith and his extreme abortion positions caused: “Public figures who identify as ‘Catholic’ give scandal to the faithful when receiving Communion by creating the impression that the moral laws of the Church are optional.”

Chaput did not stop there. He called out the church hierarchy, writing “bishops give similar scandal by not speaking up publicly about the issue and danger of sacrilege.”

With President Biden’s single-handed reversal of the Mexico City Policy, “speaking up publicly” is no longer enough. If that is all American bishops do, they will cement the impression that the moral laws of the church are optional for politicians and that ecclesiastical laws, such as Canon 915 of the Code of Canon Law, are optional for the church hierarchy.

Canon 915 makes clear that Catholics “obstinately persevering in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to holy communion.” As then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI), who at the time served as the head of the church’s doctrinal office, wrote in 2004, a Catholic politician “consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws” is engaged in “manifest” and “formal cooperation” in grave sin.

To the pro-life lay Catholic, 40-plus years of campaigning and voting for permissive abortion laws would seem pretty obstinate. Yet even before Biden was sworn in as president, then-archbishop, now Cardinal Wilton Gregory of Washington, D.C. rejected the idea that President Biden would be denied communion in his home archdiocese.

“The kind of relationship that I hope we will have is a conversational relationship where we can discover areas where we can cooperate that reflect the social teachings of the church, knowing full well that there are some areas where we won’t agree,” Gregory said, noting that there “are areas where the church’s position is very clear,” such as in regard to abortion. But “in deciding when to collaborate and when to criticize,” he added, “I hope that I don’t highlight one over the other.”

But two things have changed since Gregory spoke of a hoped “conversational relationship:” In responding to a question about the Mexico City Policy, President Biden’s press secretary directly connected the forthcoming decision to Biden’s supposed status as “a devout Catholic and somebody who attends church regularly.” And Biden has since unilaterally directed taxpayers’ money to international abortion providers.

The relationship needed now is not a conversational one, but a pastoral one—both for President Biden’s benefit and the benefit of all Catholics. Cardinal Gregory can no longer merely focus on areas of agreement: He must publicly and clearly state the grave sin Biden committed in signing the executive order.

As the 2004 guidance Benedict XVI detailed, he should meet privately with President Biden, “instructing him about the Church’s teaching, informing him that he is not to present himself for Holy Communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of sin, and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the Eucharist.” Should Biden ignore this pastoral correction and refuse to reinstate the Mexico City Policy while still presenting himself for Holy Communion, there will be no choice left but to deny President Biden communion.

No Catholic should want this outcome, but anything less will render the church complicit in Biden’s heresy.

Biden's Energy Policies Will Decimate U.S. Jobs For No Good Reason,"One week after taking the oath of office, President Joe Biden kick-started his push to change how energy is produced and consumed in America. The White House marketed this as both “Climate Day” and “Jobs Day,” an obvious attempt to sell the idea that Democrat climate policies don’t just mean a better environment, they mean better jobs and opportunities for all Americans.

The centerpiece of the day included the president signing an executive order entitled “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad.” It was his way of following through on promises made during the campaign.

The climate order and Biden’s related actions are heavy on new government prohibitions, and create new and duplicative government offices, working groups, and reports. The specifics on how Biden will deliver millions of new high-paying green jobs remains to be seen.

While his new climate effort is far unpredictable, many of the president’s other promises will be left unfulfilled if Biden implements his new energy agenda. Candidate Biden promised the American people three specific things that he would do if elected:

“Ensure the future is made in America” Implement a “recovery plan for working families” Promote “American leadership abroad”

These are laudable goals that every American should want to see fulfilled. Unfortunately, with his order to halt the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and the 60-day day moratorium on new oil and gas permits on federal land, President Biden is going to leave these promises unfulfilled and will leave millions of Americans behind as a result.

Ensuring the Future Is Made in…China

The United States is currently the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Our vast resources allow us to access reliable, affordable energy. If accessing these resources doesn’t “ensure the future is made in America,” then what will?

President Biden seems to view this energy abundance as a hindrance or a problem that needs to be solved. Beyond the most recent prohibitions, his strategy will undoubtedly be to use the Environmental Protection Agency and other executive mechanisms to regulate the industry into extinction.

So, with America producing less oil and natural gas under President Biden, where will the energy come from to supply the world’s second-largest energy-consuming country? We know the answer to this question because our country experienced it from the 1970s to the early 2000s.

We can let history be our guide. The Middle East will sell us more of its oil and Russia will look to export Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to our shores. Meanwhile, China will continue to provide many of the raw materials that go into the production of solar and other renewable energy sources.

This is a strategy that will ensure the future is made in the Middle East, Russia, and China. The first product we must ensure is “made in America” is energy. Without energy, the foundation of our economic and national security will erode.

A Recovery Plan for Connected Cronies

Our nation is in the midst of a fragile COVID-19 economic recovery. There are millions of families in every corner of the country that depend on a healthy American energy industry for their livelihood and well-being. Many of these jobs are in oil and natural gas extraction or pipeline and energy infrastructure construction and maintenance. Surely these working families deserve to experience the economic recovery that Biden promised while he was still a candidate for president.

Indeed, entire states and regions depend on the oil and natural gas sector. A prime example is New Mexico. The “Land of Enchantment” has experienced an economic revival because of oil and natural gas production technologies and the ability to access these resources on public lands. The federal government owns more than 30 percent of land in New Mexico, so access to energy on these lands is vital.

In fiscal year 2020, the oil and natural gas industry contributed $2.8 billion, or 33 percent, to New Mexico’s budget. That figure includes a contribution of almost $1.4 billion for education in the state and $640 million for health and human services. Additionally, the industry supports more than 134,000 jobs within the state. The fossil fuel industry is, without question, the foundation of New Mexico’s economic health.

If President Biden and his pick for interior secretary, New Mexico Rep. Debra Haaland, end drilling on public lands — where half of New Mexico’s production occurs — and enact stifling environmental regulations on private land projects, what happens to New Mexico? Does any other industry even have the ability to step in and fill the state’s coffers? Where will thousands of out-of-work residents find a new job? How will the public health and education systems be able to serve residents if they lose billions in funding?

No answers are forthcoming from Democrats.

Promoting American Failures Abroad

Finally, time and again candidate Biden spoke of “restoring American leadership abroad.” Energy is an important tool that our nation can use to strengthen ties with international allies. American energy is helping countries in eastern Europe reduce their dependency on Russian supply.

Key countries in the Asia Pacific region are importing less oil from the Middle East thanks to American LNG exports. India is using American coal to provide electricity to its vast and largely rural population. American energy production is making these partnerships possible, which strengthens diplomacy and our footing on the world stage.

As part of his recent climate order, President Biden included a provision that directs the federal government to stop financing international fossil fuel projects. Regardless of one’s opinion of the United States funding overseas projects, this is a particularly interesting policy change.

While renewable projects might be the most economical and beneficial option in some areas, fossil fuel projects such as LNG might make more sense in others. If the United States assists an international ally and helps them transition to using American LNG, it can mean lower emissions and in turn, help American natural gas workers. Instead, the president’s climate order ignores this fact and mandates only “green” projects. It’s a one-size-fits-all approach.

Energy Doesn’t Need to Be a Zero-Sum Game

In a previous article, I outlined the pay gap between workers in the oil and gas industry versus renewables. Indeed, oil and gas workers make more than double that of wind and solar workers.

Nevertheless, renewables like wind and solar do have an important place in America’s energy mix. It is necessary to ensure our country has diverse sources to power our homes, vehicles, and businesses. Additionally, zero-emission nuclear energy also plays a vital role in ensuring we have sufficient baseload power.

None of this should come at the expense of the workers in the fossil fuel industry. While America is the number one producer of oil and gas in the world, we are also the number two producer of both wind and solar energy in the world. Both the private sector and taxpayers continue to fund research and development in battery and grid storage technologies to expand the use of renewables.

Energy policy doesn’t need to be a zero-sum game. However, the current administration seems to hold a different perspective. It will leave energy workers in places like Texas, New Mexico, Ohio, and Pennsylvania worse off, not better.

If we want a future that is “made in America,” includes a “recovery plan for working families,” and “restores American leadership abroad,” we need to look no further than our ability to produce American energy.

"In Interview, Biden Ignores Hunter Scandal, Compliments Xi Jinping","On Feb. 7, CBS Anchor Norah O’Donnell asked Joe Biden in an interview that aired prior to Super Bowl LV about his son Hunter’s new memoir, but failed to ask about the scandal implicating him in Hunter’s many business deals with China, Russia, and Ukraine. Worse, President Biden failed to condemn Chinese dictator Xi Jinping, who is responsible for ethnic cleansing and other forms of totalitarian repression in China.

“I’m sorry to get so personal,” O’Donnell said, referring to asking the president about his son’s battle with drug addiction in an apparent opportunity for him to paper over the federal numerous corruption probes into his family’s corruption that Biden has repeatedly denied and ignored.

Hunter Biden’s private drug woes are not important to the public. What is important to the public is Hunter’s scandalous appointment to the board of Burisma, where he reportedly raked in up to $80,000 per month despite lacking any energy experience and marketed himself as selling access to his father, who was then vice president. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian government officials into firing a prosecutor that was investigating Hunter’s dealings.

As first reported by The Wall Street Journal, Hunter Biden still owns a 10 percent stake in a financial investment firm associated with organizations operated by the Chinese Communist Party. In December, after federal investigations into Hunter’s business dealings were announced, Joe Biden claimed Hunter “will not be involved in any business” or enterprise that is in conflict with his administration. Since then, Joe Biden has faced nearly no public scrutiny over the fact that the U.S. president’s son has raked in millions of dollars from U.S. adversaries who use business deals and other compromising information to push goals against the U.S. interest.

Also demonstrated on the Delaware laptop, which was seized by the FBI, is an email chain from Aug. 2, 2017, between Hunter Biden and former chairman Ye Jianming, of CEFC China Energy. The communications showed that CEFC China Energy offered Hunter $10 million annually just for business introductions. Hunter subsequently described some of the offers from Jianming as “interesting to me and my family,” as reported by The New York Post.

Last week, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was asked by a reporter at The York Post about Hunter’s investments in Chinese organizations. “He has been working to unwind his investment but I would certainly point you — he’s a private citizen — I would point you to him or his lawyers on the outside on any update,” Psaki replied.

Hunter Biden is the subject of two ongoing federal investigations looking into his taxes in Delaware and a securities fraud inquiry in the Southern District of New York. As reported by The Washington Free Beacon, this past summer, Biden’s son also was levied a $453,000 lien for not paying state taxes in D.C.

In the CBS Sunday interview, Joe Biden also stated Xi is not a democratic leader but then immediately hedged that he did not mean that as a “criticism.” Biden added that he has spent “more time with Xi Jinping than any other world leader has,” and often traveled with him as vice president from 2008 to 2016, giving no comfort to those worried that Biden’s lucrative friendships with members of the Chinese Communist Party will compromise U.S. interests while he is president.

“I had 25 hours of private meetings with him when I was vice president, I know him pretty well,” Biden said of Xi. “He’s very bright, he’s very tough, he doesn’t have, and I don’t mean it as a criticism, just as a reality, he doesn’t have a democratic (small-d) bone in his body.”

https://twitter.com/NorahODonnell/status/1358441497444679683

While Biden does not view the undemocratic nature of Communist leader Xi Xinping as a criticism, China and its allies have been continuing to threaten the United States and our allies, ramping up in strategic aggression.

Notably, in an article that appeared in the U.S. Naval Institute’s publication in January, STRATCOM Commander Adm. Charles Richard argued that America must be prepared for potential nuclear conflict with both China and Russia moving into 2021. The “….People’s Republic of China,” he said, “have begun to aggressively challenge international norms and global peace…using… threats of force in ways not seen since the height of the Cold War—and in some cases, in ways not seen during the Cold War, such as cyberattacks and threats in space.”

According to U.S. National Security Advisor James L. Jones, who served under the Obama administration, China has asserted itself as “the most serious threat” to the United States. “One of the things that concerns me a little bit is that we’ve stopped talking about values in the world…even in the democratic countries. We should talk about human rights,” Jones told CNBC anchor Hadley Gamble in January.

President Joe Biden has referred to Xi as a “thug” on other occasions, but it is unclear if his administration will continue the “Clean Network” program established under President Trump to pact with global allies to not purchase Huawei products manufactured by China. Huawei is the multinational technology company based in Shenzhen that beat out Apple in 2018 to become the second-largest smartphone manufacturer worldwide—behind Samsung. It is a known agent of the Chinese Communist Party and U.S. defense agencies will not use its products because they represent a significant security threat.

On Jan. 27, Republican Senate Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell R-Ky., called upon President Biden to stay the course of Trump on being tough on China and allies. “The Trump administration helped bring about a long-overdue American awakening to the reality that we are in strategic competition with the PRC: that Beijing will not magically conform itself to the so-called international community and that these challenges demand fast and serious action from the US and from our friends,” McConnell told his Senate colleagues on the floor.

In November 2020, the United States hit an all-time record for importations from China. Many point to companies in America as being wholly reliant on the Communist state for technology, which has caused a major shift in economic power.

“If anything, this is likely to accelerate under a Biden administration, which probably will trade off a piecemeal removal of some of the Trump administration’s restrictions for greater access by US companies to the Chinese domestic market. I would use the word ‘re-coupling,’ except there really hasn’t been any de-coupling to speak of,” David Goldman, a columnist for the Asia Times, told The Federalist in December.

It remains to be seen how the Biden administration handles Communist China in the ensuing trade and ideological war, among sympathies from Big Tech, in its importation and infrastructural reliance on China.

The left continues to swoon over Joe Biden and does not press him on issues that matter in order to preserve his stature. Nonetheless, overwhelming evidence has implicated both Joe and Hunter in an indefensible relationship with China, the United States’ number one foreign threat.

Why is Joe Biden Such A Coward On Impeachment?,"To hear congressional Democrats and their corporate media allies tell the tale, the impeachment and conviction of former president Donald John Trump (they always use the “John” when they talk about impeachment) is vital to the health and survival of the republic. They argue that these measures are needed to send a message to future would-be despots in the Oval Office that there is accountability. Whatever you make of that, I happen to think it’s a ludicrous pile of hogwash. There is one person with no opinion, however, and that would be the current president.

Joe Biden and his White House team refuse to say whether Trump should be convicted. Every Democrat in the country, it seems, supports the impeachment, yet the self-proclaimed leader of the Democratic Party isn’t sure? The excuse given by the White House is that this is a decision for senators and Biden is no longer in the Senate. But so what? Biden wasn’t in the Senate in January of 2020, when he said Congress had “no choice” but to impeach Trump.

Suddenly, now that Biden is president he cannot weigh in on what Democrats claim is one of the most pressing political issues in the nation? As with everything Biden does or has ever done, the answer lies in politics. But even from a political perspective, this evasion seems particularly obsequious. I mean, come on, man, we all know what his actual opinion is. He’s not the sole Democrat in all the land against conviction. Is he really winning over Trump voters by refusing to profess an opinion here?

Biden would appear to be operating under his patented “do no harm” political philosophy, the one that served him so well in the basement during his campaign. When talk of impeachment first began after the Capitol riots, some Republicans and conservative pundits saw an opportunity for Biden to bring about unity by opposing the measure. That might have been pie in the sky stuff, but Biden didn’t take the bait. Instead, in classic Biden fashion, he says nothing.

This is a pattern with the president. On opening schools, he is similarly feckless. His own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisers say they can open, and Biden hems and haws in awe of the teachers unions. Had Trump defied his own experts in such a way, it would have been a two-week scandal with its own CNN theme music. Now that Biden is president things are more nuanced, you see? Political considerations matter right alongside science. We could have used some of that sentiment last year.

The problem with Biden refusing to tell us what he actually thinks about these important issues is that it strongly suggests he is not the one making the decisions. Like his former boss, Barack Obama, Biden likes to lead from behind. But behind whom, exactly? Who is deciding what his positions on impeachment and schools are? Say what you will about Trump, but we always knew his opinion. And it was his opinion, not a focus-group position delivered to him by unknown lackeys in mediocre suits.

Biden was elected president of the United States. He claims it is a job he wanted. It is a leadership position, yet he refuses to lead. Is this impeachment as important and vital as Democrats not named Joe Biden claim? It’s kind of hard to take those claims seriously when the leader of the party can’t be bothered to comment.

It’s time for Sleepy Joe to take a stand on impeachment. It is an issue that deeply divides the country. One cannot create unity by simply avoiding hard or uncomfortable positions, but we have to accept that this is exactly who we elected. We elected a smiley grandpa who doesn’t want to make trouble.

One of the biggest fears that opponents of Biden had throughout his candidacy was that he would not be making the decisions, that he would be a prop, an extra in his own administration who looks nice behind the desk. Three weeks into his administration, it is starting to look like those predictions were right. Come on, Joe. Tell us what you really think, man. We’d like to know.

Africans Plead With Biden To Stop Paying Their Countries To Kill Children,"President Joe Biden likes to present himself as an advocate for racial justice and a man of the people, especially those whose voices are often under-represented. Yet his actions routinely contradict his lofty rhetoric. A recent example is how he has ignored African people’s plea not to fund abortions on their continent.

One of the more than two dozen executive orders President Biden signed recently revokes the so-called “Mexico City Policy.” The policy, first implemented by President Reagan in 1984, requires any federal grant recipients to agree to neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning to receive U.S. aid.

Abortion rights groups and leftist interest groups have opposed this policy since its debut. Every Republican president since Reagan supported the policy, while every Democrat president — from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama — reversed the policy as soon as they came into office.

The Trump administration not only reinstated the policy but also expanded it to one called Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance, requiring “foreign non-governmental organizations that receive global health assistance from affected Federal Departments and Agencies to agree that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning or provide financial support to any other organization that conducts such activities.”

During a 2019 campaign event organized by Planned Parenthood, the United States’ largest abortion corporation, then-candidate Biden claimed that “many people around the world died” as the result of Trump’s Protecting Life order, without providing any supporting evidence for this claim. The number of lives the Protecting Life order saved by extending protections to unborn children meant nothing to him. Candidate Biden then referred to himself and Planned Parenthood as saviors of the world. He then vowed to revoke the Mexico City Policy if elected.

President Biden fulfilled his campaign promise by signing the executive order to reverse the policy on Jan. 28, once again permitting money drawn from American taxpayers to fund overseas abortions. Yet a recent poll shows his decision is extremist and far from the unifying moderate he also portrayed himself as on the campaign trail. The poll finds that 77 percent of Americans, including many independent voters and some pro-choice Democrats, oppose U.S. funding to “support abortion in other countries.”

Internationally, the loudest voice of objection to President Biden’s executive order came from Africa, in the form of a 16-minute video titled “A Message to President Biden: The Unified Voices of Africa.” The video was produced and hosted by Obianuju Ekeocha, the founder and president of Culture of Life Africa, an initiative “dedicated to the promotion and defense of the African values of the sanctity of life, beauty of marriage, blessings of motherhood and the dignity of family life.”

The first half of the video features a dozen Africans, men and women, from students to professionals to entrepreneurs, all pleading with Biden not to fund abortion in Africa. Timeyin asks Biden: “What if you weren’t given the chance to live? What if I was aborted? I wouldn’t be here making this video.”

Matthew, an operation manager, declares: “We all deserve the right to live. I stand against the funding of abortion in Africa.”

Marion Lisa, a lawyer, explains three principles the African community is built on: the sanctity of life, equal dignity for all, and protecting the weak and the vulnerable. Reflecting on these principles, she concludes, “Since the right to life is inherent, I believe the same should be accorded to the unborn child. The energy should be diverted to other sectors that we need to develop. Therefore, protect the unborn child.”

In the second half of the video, another group of African men and women focused on educating the West, especially President Biden, about what African communities genuinely need. It’s not abortion.

Rose, a teacher, speaks passionately about what she has seen in her community, “children walk homelessly on streets; youth dropped out of schools; [and] people [are] dying of hunger every day. Children being abused and used as slaves in their homes.” As she explains, “These are things we need funds on, not abortion. God will never bless a nation that destroys its children.”

Sonia, a lawyer, agreed. Instead of funding and supporting abortions, why not channel funding to those sectors in need, such as health care, infrastructure, and the eradication of unemployment among the young? Aicha, a family counselor, makes it clear:

Abortion is not an African problem. On the contrary, Africans will live much better having access to clean drinking water, access to good education and by having good governance … we beg you not to fund abortion-related programs in Africa. We have real problems in Africa, it is not abortion.

Stella Marris, an entrepreneur in Nigeria, lists five things Nigerians need more than abortions: poverty alleviation, education, employment, electricity, and better infrastructure. She also points out that abortion is illegal in Nigeria. She pleaded with President Biden: “Please help us, don’t kill us.”

These are powerful and heartfelt words from African people. Every leftist who claims to care for poor and underrepresented communities should watch this video and listen to these voices.

African men and women who spoke in this video made it clear that Africans reject abortion on the ground of their faith and their cultural heritage. They see abortion as something detrimental to the very foundation of their communities — the sustainability of their people. They understand the real needs of their communities, and they want to see foreign aid go toward areas that will improve the lives of themselves and their children, such as access to clean drinking water and employment.

Their communities may be poor, but they demand to be treated in a respectful and dignified way by the world’s richest and most powerful nation. They demand to be heard. They are understandably frustrated that Western leftists refuse to listen to the cries for help emanating from these communities.

Instead, western leftists insist on imposing their ideology on these communities, providing a “solution” to a problem that doesn’t exist, because these progressives arrogantly believe they know what’s best for these communities instead of the people who live there.

At the end of the video, Uju asks:

Will President Biden listen to us? Will he recognize the voice of African people? Will he respect the cry of the heart of the ordinary African person? Or will he just be the neo-colonial master like many western leaders? Will he be the one to come in to force his own ideas and ideologies in the world of the poor?

Instead of heading the heartfelt pleas of so many African people, President Biden chose to impose his will on the world’s poor.

Hiding Biden: How Dems Helped Defeat Trump In 2020,"By the numbers, Joe Biden is president of the United States because he won the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin by a combined total of some 43,000 votes.

But he also owes his victory to the groundwork laid by Democrats and their media allies one year before, during the first impeachment of Donald Trump over his supposedly strings-attached demand that the Ukrainian government investigate alleged corruption involving Biden’s son, Hunter.

The first impeachment failed to oust Trump from office, but it helped secure the White House for Biden. It shielded him from scrutiny, enabling him and his supporters to cast allegations during the campaign about dubious Biden family business ties as rehashed Trumpian conspiracy theories.

Biden’s razor-thin swing state victories might not have materialized if the Trump campaign had been able to gain traction from its October Surprise — a series of articles it helped orchestrate in the New York Post that reported information from a laptop owned by Hunter Biden suggesting corrupt foreign business deals that may have involved his father.

As many as 45 percent of Biden voters said they were unaware of Hunter’s financial scandals before the election. That’s likely because Democrats and much of the media discredited or did not report the accusations in the final weeks of the campaign — accusations that were bolstered after the election when Hunter admitted that he has been the subject of an ongoing federal corruption probe since 2018.

Once the Post ran its first laptop article on Oct. 14, Democrats and their allies immediately turned to the narrative they had long used against Trump: foreign interference. Without evidence save for the claims of Democrat partisans and anonymous official sources — like those commonly relied upon during the debunked Trump-Russia affair — the New York Times, Washington Post, and Politico ran stories suggesting the laptop could be Russian disinformation. Joe Biden said the laptop was a “Russian plan” at the first presidential debate. The FBI, which was a main driver of the Trump-Russia collusion investigation, added to the narrative when word was leaked that the bureau was investigating whether the laptop emails were Russian disinformation. Twitter and Facebook reacted by actively censoring the Hunter Biden story. Twitter went so far as to lock the New York Post out of its own account.

As the Senate takes up a second impeachment of Trump, Republican objections to the Democrats’ handling of the first go-round loom large. The record of those proceedings shows that they were conducted in a highly unusual manner. In retrospect, it seems clear that they were designed not just to target Trump — but to protect Biden.

Taking Early Aim

Some Democrats were bent on impeaching Trump from the moment he took office, on Jan. 20, 2017. Just 19 minutes after Trump was sworn in, the Washington Post published a piece headlined, “The Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun.”

Those early efforts were spearheaded by Texas Rep. Al Green, who drew up articles of impeachment for alleged misdeeds ranging from Trump’s insulting kneeling professional football players to his firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Green’s effort led to three different unsuccessful impeachment votes — one in 2017 and two more in 2019 after Democrats gained a House majority in the 2018 election.

Publicly, Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders said they did not approve of Green’s efforts. “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country,” the House speaker told the Washington Post in March 2019.

Privately, Democratic leaders were betting Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump-Russia collusion would produce a clearly impeachable offense.

They were wrong. After three years of thorough investigation — as well as thousands of breathless articles and untold hours of TV coverage keyed toward Trump’s prospective guilt — Mueller’s final report, issued in March 2019, concluded that the probe “[did] not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” Mueller did not make a determination of whether Trump had tried to obstruct his investigation. Looking at the evidence, Attorney General William Barr determined he had not.

Nevertheless, some powerful Democrats sought to use the Mueller report as the basis to impeach Trump, only to be rebuffed by Pelosi.

The speed of what happened next blindsided Republicans.

The Ukraine Affair

In early August, a CIA employee filed a formal whistleblower complaint against President Trump aimed at forcing Congress to address the matter. He alleged that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July 25 phone call to investigate the Bidens for political purposes, and subsequently made aid to Ukraine contingent on the probe.

Trump reportedly raised the issue because he believed there had never been any serious inquiry into why Hunter Biden, a lawyer with no experience in the energy sector, had been paid upwards of $80,000 a month to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma. Hunter received the appointment in 2014, shortly after his father was asked to oversee Ukrainian affairs as Barack Obama’s vice president. In 2016, Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid to Ukraine unless it fired a prosecutor widely considered to be ineffective. The fired prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, testified that he was driven from office because he was investigating Burisma.

“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son,” Trump told Zelensky, “that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. … It sounds horrible to me.”

At the time of the whistleblower complaint, Biden was favored to win the Democratic nomination for president.

However, the allegations regarding the Trump phone call with Zelensky were problematic from the start. The man who brought the complaint was not really a whistleblower as the term is commonly understood. He had no direct knowledge of the phone call but had been leaked details of it by one of the seven American officials who were on the call with the president.

The Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel, whose legal opinions are normally binding on these matters, soon concluded the whistleblower complaint did not meet the requirements of an “urgent concern” for it to be forwarded to Congress.

Meanwhile, Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, worked to surface the details of the complaint publicly. He recast obstacles to legitimizing the whistleblower’s complaint as attempts to hide Trump’s malfeasance. When the White House ultimately made a transcript of the call public, Trump’s rhetorical style, an odd combination of obliqueness and bluntness, made the idea of a quid pro quo — no Biden investigation, no aid — open to interpretation.

Officials from Ukraine, which did not open an investigation, said they never felt pressured by Trump.

Despite the procedural problems with the whistleblower complaint, it provided a semblance of formal process to buttress an all-new impeachment attempt. Progressives and much of the media cast the call as an abuse of power by Trump who, they claimed, tried to extort a foreign leader to kneecap a political rival. A formal House impeachment inquiry was launched on Sept. 24, 2019, with the full support of Democratic House leadership.

From the beginning, the impeachment inquiry was rife with episodes suggesting Democrats had a larger strategy. To begin with, they took an unprecedented amount of control over the process. With the 2020 election and the prospect of a second Trump term looming, there would be no years-long special counsel or nonpartisan investigation of this matter.

While the Judiciary Committee, led by Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, was the traditional venue for impeachment, Democrats decided that Schiff would guide the impeachment inquiry through the Intelligence Committee.

Schiff, who had raised his national profile during the Mueller probe by repeatedly claiming that he had seen more than circumstantial evidence that Trump had colluded with Russia, had already acquired a reputation for fierce partisanship. In early October, shortly after the impeachment inquiry began, the New York Times reported that Schiff’s office had helped shepherd the alleged whistleblower’s complaint. The Washington Post fact-checker gave Schiff “four Pinocchios” for repeatedly denying his office’s contact with the man. Nevertheless, Schiff received glowing press coverage for his impeachment efforts.

The corporate press further enabled impeachment by refusing to publish the whistleblower’s name, in line with Democrat admonitions, even though he wasn’t formally protected by any whistleblower laws. News organizations disclosed no agreements of source confidentiality with the man, and his identity was common knowledge in Washington.

When Paul Sperry of RealClearInvestigations reported the evidence that the whistleblower was a then-33-year-old CIA employee named Eric Ciaramella, this news blackout by major media allowed them to ignore his history of partisan ties and anti-Trump statements. Sperry reported that Ciaramella had served as an adviser on Ukraine to Vice President Biden and had been overheard in 2017 discussing with another staffer how to “take out,” or remove, the new president from office.

That colleague was Sean Misko, who left the White House in the summer of 2019 to join House impeachment manager Schiff’s committee, where, sources say, he offered “guidance” to the whistleblower. [Update, Feb. 5, 2021, 2:30 PM Eastern: In a statement dated Jan. 3, sent after publication and RCI’s request beforehand for comment, Schiff’s panel said “Misko never met with or provided guidance to any whistleblowers regarding complaints they wished to file, including the anonymous Ukraine whistleblower” and reports otherwise are “false.”]

Aside from Schiff’s backstage dealings with Ciaramella, the Intelligence Committee chairman publicly tried to spin Trump’s alleged wrongdoing. On Sept. 26, the day after the Trump-Zelensky transcript was released, Schiff gave an opening statement before acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before his committee.

During the statement, Schiff, who had once been an aspiring screenwriter, characterized the president’s behavior on the Zelensky call as being like “a classic organized crime shakedown.” Instead of reading the plain text of the call, Schiff paraphrased what happened in hyperbolic and lurid terms.

“I have a favor I want from you,” Schiff said while seeming to read from a transcript. “And I’m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.”

Republicans were appalled.

“He makes up a conversation supposedly between the president and Ukraine which sounds like a script from a cheap comic book. Lies and innuendo. He was called out on it and said, well, I meant it as a parody. Geez, that’s great. The fun begins,” Utah Congressman Chris Stewart would record in his journal, as quoted in “Obsession,” Washington Examiner reporter Byron York’s book on Democrats’ years-long quest to remove Trump from office.

Leaking Testimony

To make the case for impeachment, it was crucial for Democrats to demonstrate the existence of a quid pro quo between Trump and Zelensky, which was ambiguous because Trump never mentioned aid on the call.

Schiff responded to Republicans’ witness Kurt Volker’s testimony by taking even more unprecedented steps for Democrats to control the impeachment proceedings. Volker had sat for what was known as a “transcribed interview,” which allowed Republicans to speak about the testimony afterward. After Volker, Schiff made sure all the witnesses in the impeachment inquiry were deposed, forbidding committee members from discussing what was said publicly.

But the secrecy rules had a convenient and glaring exception — the witnesses themselves could speak about what happened. “The sessions settled into a pattern of secret testimony accompanied by quick leaks of witnesses’ opening statements,” York observes in “Obsession.” The leaked, one-sided testimonies allowed press speculation to run wild, while House Republicans who knew the particulars were subject to ethics charges if they told the public what had actually been said.

The DNC-Ukraine Nexus

For Democrats, Biden was a fraught issue in the impeachment proceedings. One obvious defense of Trump was for Republicans to argue that the president’s questions about Biden family corruption in Ukraine were legitimate and necessary to protect national security. Under questioning, multiple witnesses called by Democrats conceded that Hunter Biden’s role with Burisma was concerning, leading to calls for Hunter to testify in the proceedings. (During the subsequent Senate impeachment trial, one Democratic senator, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, said Hunter Biden was a relevant witness.)

Democrats rejected calls to question Hunter Biden, Ciaramella, and others. “I think we really could have torpedoed impeachment by making the whistleblower detail all of his prior contacts with Schiff and also his prior contacts with Biden as well,” said a Republican House staffer with intimate knowledge of the proceedings who requested anonymity because he did not want to speak for elected officials.

Democrats also shut down Republican attempts to probe the Democratic Party’s own troubling connections to Ukraine during impeachment. A Politico investigation published in January 2017 “found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the [2016] race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another’s elections.”

The article, written by David Stern and Kenneth Vogel, the latter now at the New York Times, reported that Ukrainian officials had helped Hillary “Clinton’s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers,” including his campaign manager, Paul Manafort. Key to this effort was a Democratic National Committee operative, Alexandra Chalupa, who met with Ukrainian officials and American journalists in Washington and was invited to the White House by Biden’s Ukraine pointman — the future “whistleblower” Ciaramella.

(Chalupa wasn’t the only Democratic operative pushing Manafort dirt originating in Ukraine at about the same time. So was Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS, the Democratic contractor behind the discredited Steele dossier on Trump-Russia collusion. He has acknowledged feeding the media Ukraine tips in “Crime in Progress,” the book he co-wrote with his Fusion co-founder Peter Fritsch.)

But even though Politico’s reporting on Ukraine and the DNC was largely unquestioned for three years, the media once again sprang to Democrats’ defense as Republicans sought to make an issue of it.

In the end, Schiff’s secrecy and tight control over who got to testify allowed House Democrats to sidestep any explosive questions about the chairman’s role in instigating impeachment, the DNC’s involvement with Ukraine, and Biden’s potential role in his son’s corruption.

Ultimately, the Senate refused to convict Trump and many Republicans believed that it did little to harm him politically. “Not a single Democrat speaker referenced impeachment during any of the convention, which is a really amazing thing,” the GOP staffer noted. “That just shows me they didn’t get a whole lot of political benefit out of it.”

Shielding Joe

But if impeachment failed to tarnish Trump as much as Democrats hoped, it appeared successful in delegitimizing valid questions about alleged Biden corruption. After impeachment, the corporate media showed almost no interest in investigating Biden family business ties, which were largely characterized as a series of unsubstantiated and debunked allegations.

Christiane Amanpour of PBS expressed the prevailing view in an interview with Republican National Committee spokeswoman Liz Harrington when she said “there has never been any issues in terms of corruption” with the Bidens. After Harrington disagreed and urged journalists to look into the story, Amanpour responded: “We’re not going to do your work for you.”

Some coverage transformed the potential scandals into a positive for Biden. At a campaign event in Iowa, a Democratic voter asked the candidate in December 2019 about allegations of his son’s corruption. In response, Biden called the voter a “damn liar” and challenged him to an IQ test. CNN national political reporter Maeve Reston characterized the exchange this way: “In a human moment defending his son, Biden showed the authenticity, emotion and readiness for a fight that appeals to so many Democrats as they look for someone who can take on Trump.”

Last September, when a Senate intelligence panel report revealed that a firm co-founded by Hunter Biden received a $3.5-million wire transfer from the wife of a Russian politician, the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, and MSNBC did not cover the story. When Trump raised the issue at the first presidential debate, Biden claimed it had been “totally discredited” even though its existence was confirmed by Treasury Department documents.

This news blackout may have helped propel Biden to victory, but questions regarding the Bidens have not gone away.

There is the laptop, which, far from Russian disinformation, did indeed belong to Hunter Biden, who in December admitted he has been the subject of a federal corruption probe since 2018.

Other evidence and testimony implicate President Biden. Tony Bobulinski, a former naval officer and business partner with Hunter Biden, asserted in October that he met with the senior Biden as part of a plan to secretly give the future president a 10 percent stake in a deal with a Chinese conglomerate with ties to the country’s communist government. Bobulinski has provided documents to back up his account and news outlets such as the Wall Street Journal have confirmed they are authentic.

President Biden seems aware of the danger of family embarrassments, including from a January 2020 FBI raid involving allegations of financial fraud at a company where Biden’s brother James was listed as “principal.” Politico reported last week that the president had pulled his brother Frank aside last summer to tell him, “For Christ’s sake, watch yourself. Don’t get sucked into something that would, first of all, hurt you.” On Inauguration Day, a law firm’s ad promoting Frank Biden’s relationship with the president caused a new stir.

Such Biden family matters, and Republicans’ awareness that their concealment may have helped seal Trump’s defeat, color Democrats’ upcoming long-shot efforts to convince at least 17 senators of the opposite party to join their legally and politically fraught effort to convict a president in an impeachment trial after he has left office. Republicans think the Democrats’ handling of the first impeachment poisoned the well.

“Republican fence sitters are probably already on the record denouncing the unfairness of the House process last time around, since both GOP House members and senators were doing that,” says a GOP staffer who insisted on anonymity. “So if that process was unfair, how can you trust Democrats enough to sign off on impeachment 2.0, when there wasn’t even any process to speak of at all?” A number of House Democrats involved in the first impeachment declined to comment on their Republican colleagues’ concerns.

In a recent vote, 45 Republican senators went on record saying they did not believe impeaching a former president was constitutional. Even prominent Senate Democrats, such as 2016 vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine, are advocating censuring Donald Trump for fear that a bitter and drawn out impeachment trial is not only futile but will hamper Biden’s ability to get his administration up and running during the crucial early months of the presidency.

Congressional Republicans, for their part, have shown no signs of dropping efforts begun in the first impeachment to investigate what they see as clear Biden family corruption — even after Trump’s second impeachment. Prominent Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham and Charles Grassley, recently told Fox News they plan to ask Joe Biden’s nominee for attorney general, Merrick Garland, about the Hunter Biden corruption probe during his nomination hearing.

Biden Continues To Proclaim Unity While Sowing Division,"On Friday, the president and first lady meandered through a Valentine display Jill Biden designed to decorate the front lawn of the White House. With Champ, Major, and a handful of media lap dogs in tow, the Bidens nodded with approval at the large white, red, and pink heart-shaped cut-outs adorned with trite truisms: “unity,” “healing,” “love,” and “compassion.”

But Democrat politicians don’t want healing, love, or compassion. They want power. If successful and long-lasting, the policies they push, and corporate media and Big Tech’s complicity in the leftward lurch of our country, will ensure America is never united again.

Last week’s photo-op continued the unity theme Democrats have been peddling since their primary season began in 2019. After Biden secured the nomination and ran on a “character counts” platform, the press continued to play along, ignoring both Biden’s scandals and his own bullying behavior.

Biden’s inaugural address proclaimed the unity theme as well, before the president began to divide the nation with the flick of his pen, signing a flurry of executive orders that pitted Americans against each other.

Biden’s reversal of the Mexico City policy was a painful attack on pro-life Americans, forcing them to fund international abortion providers with their tax dollars. Halting the Keystone XL Pipeline promises to decimate many of this country’s blue-collar oil workers. And by discontinuing the border wall and instituting a 100-day freeze on deportations, Biden has pitted border states against the federal government, as southern states fight to safeguard American citizens and their fiscal health.

Unity does not mean abandoning policy priorities, Biden’s defenders counter. No, it is “more of a change in culture, not splitting the difference on policy plans. . . .The two sides will still wage vigorous battles over ideas, so this argument goes, but they should be debates of good will rather than search-and-destroy operations.” This definition of unity, however, fares no better: Biden and his allies don’t want debate, and they don’t possess goodwill.

Proof of the latter permeated the 2020 campaign, with Biden regularly repeating the lie that then-President Trump called neo-Nazis and white supremacists “very fine people.” Then, just two weeks before his inauguration, “Biden smeared Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas as Nazis.” And in abolishing the 1776 Commission and reversing Trump’s ban on critical race theory “training,” President Biden further displayed bad faith by branding the former president’s policies as “harmful,” “offensive,” and “counterfactual.”

Our country can survive the lack of goodwill in politics, as except for a faction of extremists, Americans love their neighbors, no matter their political persuasion. What our country cannot survive, however, is a silencing of debate—whether it be at the hands of the government or monopolistic powers aligned with the ruling class.

So great is the need for a full airing of competing ideas to our republic that the Founding Fathers placed the freedom of speech, of the press, and the right to petition the government first among the individual liberties in the Bill of Rights. But what the Constitution forbids the government from doing, corporate America is doing on behalf of Democrats.

Corporate media began the march to a totalitarian vetting of viewpoints by slanting the news and spinning narratives. What began as a mere bias in reporting, however, became a pure propaganda project when Trump entered the scene, first with the years-long peddling of the Russia-collusion hoax and then with big tech helping bury the Hunter Biden scandal.

Legacy media proved powerless to silence new media outlets and citizen-reporters. And with Twitter, Trump and other conservative politicians bypassed the filter of the press entirely.

But then came the purge. First, they came for Trump, followed by his high-profile supporters. Next, came the shuttering of Parler. On a smaller, but more personal scale, private citizens have seen the same: Support conservative causes, and face ostracization and unemployment.

The silencing of dissent will only get worse, with Big Tech and corporate media emboldened with every success and with the apparent helplessness of the right to respond. And really, what is the response? Antitrust challenges to the monopolistic power exercised by Google and Amazon? Removal of Twitter and Facebook’s legal immunity? Yet without the support of the Biden administration, neither approach has much chance.

Stifling debate won’t change minds, however. And conservatives will not capitulate. They will either continue to speak in whatever public sphere they can, or they will remain silent publicly, but band together to work, pray, learn, play, and live, free within their enclaves to profess their traditional values.

All the heart-shaped unity placards cannot change that a republic cannot long survive this way.

Biden Set To Revive Obama’s Devastating Middle East Foreign Policy,"During his short tenure as president, Joe Biden has made it a priority to schedule phone calls to American allies across the globe, ranging from Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan to President Emmanuel Macron of France. More recently, the new president made the time to have a conversation with the leader of America’s greatest geopolitical adversary, Chairman Xi Jinping of China.

Noticeably absent from Biden’s call list, however, has been the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. In office for nearly a month, Biden’s lack of outreach to Netanyahu is troubling, given that former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump called the Israeli leader within days of assuming office.

When asked about the matter during a recent press conference, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, attempted to downplay worries, stating the delayed call is “not an intentional dis,” and the president “will be speaking with the prime minister soon, and he’s looking forward to doing that.” Nevertheless, a date and time for the call have yet to be announced.

In the same press conference, however, when asked if the Biden administration considered Israel and Saudi Arabia “important allies,” Psaki deflected. She provided a vague, longwinded response:

Well, you know, again, I think we — there are ongoing processes and internal interagency processes — one that we, I think, confirmed an interagency meeting just last week — to discuss a range of issues in the Middle East … We’re — we’ve only been here three and a half weeks, and I think I’m going to let those policy processes see themselves through before we give, kind of, a complete laydown of what our national security approaches will be to a range of issues.

Biden’s lack of outreach to Netanyahu, coupled with Psaki’s refusal to acknowledge Israel as an important ally, raises serious concerns that the freshman administration is positioning itself to revert to the Obama-Biden era of American foreign policy, which oversaw relations with Israel deteriorate to their worst in decades and continued aggression among Arab nations. Given his administration’s recent actions regarding the Jewish state, that’s exactly what Biden looks to do.

On Jan. 26, acting ambassador to the United Nations Richard Mills laid out the Biden administration’s policies on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the U.N. In addition to supporting a two-state solution, the new administration will “base its policies on consultations with both sides,” rather than prioritizing Israel.

Furthermore, Mills announced the United States will “renew ties with the Palestinian Authority”, which includes “economic and humanitarian aid to the Palestinians” and the reopening of “diplomatic missions which were shut down by the Trump administration — like the PLO office in Washington and the U.S. consulate general in Jerusalem.”

Likewise, Mills stated that the administration will oppose any form of annexation and settlement building in the disputed territory. This move seems to serve as a rebuke of the Trump administration’s move to recognize the legitimacy of Israel’s settlements in the West Bank in Nov. 2019.

Regarding relations with Iran, Biden’s stance is poised to make a bad situation even worse. During his presidential campaign, Biden made it clear that he intends to rejoin the disastrous 2015 nuclear agreement, marking a reversal of President Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the deal in 2018.

According to The Washington Post, “the Biden administration has begun mapping out how the United States might rejoin the international nuclear deal with Iran,” with the main question facing the White House being “whether to trade U.S. actions for Iranian ones as a way of bringing both nations back within the fold of the 2015 agreement.”

While some European nations support this, Israel does not. In December 2020, a senior official from the prime minister’s office issued a statement making clear that the Jewish state does not endorse the United States rejoining the pact.

“Israel is unequivocal that under no circumstances should there be a return to that bad deal,” the official states. “The deal gave Iran a highway paved with gold to build the critical infrastructure for an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs. That deal gave Iran the resources to significantly escalate its aggression and terror across the Middle East.”

Trump’s withdrawal from the deal has been noted as one of the factors that helped encourage the best developments for peace in the region in decades under his administration.

Moreover, Biden has also stacked his administration with several officials whose histories are filled with anti-Israel activism. Recently, the president tapped Maher Bitar, a former Obama White House staffer and general counsel for Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, to be the senior director for intelligence programs at the National Security Council.

According to the Washington Free Beacon, Bitar has a history of aligning himself with anti-Israel and anti-Semitic organizations. “Bitar spent years leading anti-Israel organizations that promote the anti-Semitic Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, which wages economic warfare on Israel,” the report reads. “In college, he was a leader in Students for Justice in Palestine, a pro-BDS campus group known for bullying Jewish students. A 2006 yearbook picture from Georgetown University, where Bitar attended school, shows him posing before a sign that reads ‘Divest from Israel Apartheid.’”

President Biden has also tapped former Obama State Department official Hady Amr to serve as deputy assistant secretary of state for Israel-Palestine. In addition to calling for the terrorist organization Hamas to be involved in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, Amr has previously accused Israel of “ethnic cleansing” and “apartheid,” as well as working for organizations funded by the Iranian-allied country of Qatar.

It’s safe to that Biden’s approach to Israel is a sharp departure from the Israeli-centric strategy of the Trump administration that led to massive steps forward for peace in the region with the Abraham Accords. Whether it was recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, acknowledging Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, or facilitating multiple Israeli-Arab peace agreements, the Trump administration’s “Israel First” approach to the Middle East not only strengthened ties with our greatest ally in the region but also brought about historic change.

Indeed, Biden’s initial posturing regarding Israel is alarming, given that Trump’s pro-Israel approach proved to be the most significant progress made in the elusive goal of peace in the Middle East that the world had witnessed in decades. Based on his current trajectory, however, Biden will all but guarantee that his administration’s relationship with Israel will be nothing more than a mirror image of the disastrous Obama years.

Why You Should Be Skeptical Of The New ‘Tough On China’ Joe Biden,"The Biden administration and its corporate media cheerleaders are at pains to tell you that career-long China kowtower Joe Biden is “tough on China.” But toughness can only be proven by action. Contra the official narrative, however, President Biden’s initial policies and those tasked with implementing and building upon them do not indicate strength. Rather, to America’s detriment, they signal a reversion to the status quo ante of weakness.

The media has trumpeted Biden administration rhetoric on three key China-related issues: the administration’s affirmation — with caveats — of the Trump administration’s designation of the Chinese Communist Party’s atrocities in Xinjiang as constituting “genocide”; its pledge of a “rock-solid commitment” to Taiwan; and its promise to maintain a “free and open” Indo-Pacific — again, with caveats.

The media also celebrated the Biden administration’s most authoritative statements on U.S.-China policy yet, from a readout of the president’s first call with Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, and related statements by officials on the administration’s China strategy. Headlines about the call claimed Biden “confronted” Xi with “concerns” about contentious issues such as human rights, trade, and Taiwan. Chinese state media, of course, saw it quite differently — as an amiable and welcome reversal of Trump’s tough on China stance.

American corporate media also reported that Biden staffers embraced the idea America is in an “intense strategic competition with China,” and would be maintaining some of the Trump administration’s policies — a tacit admission of Trump’s relative toughness.

Caving to China on Multiple Fronts

Still, actions speak louder than words, and notwithstanding its continuation of certain policies, and convening of a Pentagon China Task Force too green to be judged, the Biden administration has undercut its rhetoric on several fronts.

It is recommitting America to the self-defeating Paris Climate Accord, on which peerless polluter China will almost surely cheat.

It is returning America to the CCP-dominated World Health Organization, for which it was rewarded with scorn by the lone American on the panel investigating the coronavirus’s origins.

It is extending the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty and excluding China from it, delaying implementation of an investment ban on certain companies suspected of working with the Chinese military.

It is barring executive branch employees from calling the Chinese coronavirus by its rightful name and withdrawing a Trump administration draft rule requiring schools to disclose financial ties to Trojan Horse Confucius Institutes.

It is shelving U.S. companies’ acquisition of TikTok, suspending an executive order that would bar the government’s purchase of equipment for the U.S. electric grid from adversaries, and demonstrating ambiguity on whether it would keep Huawei on the Commerce Department’s “entity list.”

Biden’s Troublesome Personnel

Even more consequential than these policies will be the individuals to whom President Biden has entrusted his China strategy. Because personnel is policy, from “The Big Guy” on down, there are glaring weaknesses.

President Biden’s disastrous record on China and the compromising nature of his family’s continued dealings with CCP-tied individuals and entities are troublesome enough. That he also refuses to recant his biggest blunders suggests China may well “eat our lunch” — or at least his.

The same can be said of his senior-most advisors. Given the national security and foreign policy establishment’s historic accommodation of China’s rise, one would think a “tough” president would seek some outsider, contrarian appointees. Yet President Biden has overwhelmingly appointed those who served with him in the feckless Obama administration, in which the status quo of engagement and integration with, and appeasement of, Communist China reigned.

One will search in vain across the top ranks of the Biden administration for anyone who has distinguished himself as an outspoken critic of the CCP, or prognosticator of its malign acts in pursuit of hegemony. Few have publicly engaged in self-reflection about past failings concerning China, let alone demonstrated a newfound understanding of the challenge that would justify belief in superior results going forward.

Co-operation or Co-ordination?

Consider even exceptions to the rule. Two of President Biden’s top China-related appointees include former Obama administration colleagues “Asia czar” Kurt Campbell — who is rumored to have been responsible for that administration’s weakness in 2012 at Scarborough Shoal — and Pentagon China Task Force leader Dr. Ely Ratner.

In 2018, Campbell and Ratner wrote a mea culpa of sorts in Foreign Affairs, where they admitted the establishment they had served had failed on China. Yet their essay was more descriptive than prescriptive. The authors concluded vaguely that instead of trying to grapple with China directly, “Washington should … focus more on its own power and behavior, and the power and behavior of its allies and partners.”

Yet months after publishing the essay, the authors were calling for “cooperation” with China. Notwithstanding China’s predominant culpability in the coronavirus pandemic, in April 2020 as the crisis was accelerating, Campbell, Dr. Ratner, and future Biden administration colleagues Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines signed onto a letter calling for “cooperation between the United States and China,” the “logic” for which the signers found “compelling.”

Meanwhile, consistent with the president they serve, and the China-abetting ruling class from which most of them hail, many senior Biden administration officials have fostered troubling ties to China that would indicate potential vulnerability.

Secretary of State Blinken co-founded WestExec Advisors, a consultancy that on top of other China-related business, helped American universities solicit donations in China without threatening Pentagon-funded grants. DNI Haines and Press Secretary Jen Psaki both worked there.

Blinken also served as managing director of the Penn Biden Center. Tens of millions of anonymous Chinese dollars allegedly flowed into the University of Pennsylvania’s coffers, and potentially the center following its establishment.

Colin Kahl — Biden’s pick for undersecretary of defense policy, who has also been linked to China via his perch at Stanford’s Freeman Spogli Institute — was a strategic consultant at the Penn Biden Center.

Central Intelligence Agency director nominee William Burns presides over the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which in recent years has reportedly received up to $2 million from CCP-tied businessmen and think tanks.

United Nations Ambassador-designate Linda Thomas-Greenfield received a $1,500 honoraria in 2019 for speaking in front of a Confucius Institute at Savannah State University — a speech in which she spoke positively about China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

The aforementioned Kurt Campbell, was, until August 2020, listed as board vice chairman of the U.S.-China Strong Foundation, a Confucius Institute-linked “student language exchange” outfit reportedly sharing additional deep ties to the CCP. Separately, Campbell has already had to promise to recuse himself from certain issues given business conducted in Asia under the auspices of the consultancy he founded.

‘Engagement’ As a Code for Weakness

Consider this background against the part of the Biden-Xi call readout the media glossed over: President Biden’s commitment to “pursuing practical, results-oriented engagements.” That China has done nothing to merit such a commitment is a red flag. Is immediately indicating a desire to work with China a sign of strength?

China, after all, is a ruthless, ambitious, determined power that has proven uniquely capable of exploiting the West’s greed, naivete, and openness in the pursuit of its ends. It thrives on “engagement.”

And these are not just any areas of common interest we are talking about. The readout of the Biden-Xi call indicated that both leaders acknowledged “the shared challenges of global health security, climate change, and preventing weapons proliferation.” It’s hard to see how it demonstrates “toughness” to work with China in these domains.

The same question can be asked of the Biden administration’s expressed desire to pursue multilateralism to “compete” with China, at the same time Xi is singing the praises of multilateralism — right after inking a massive investment pact with the very European partners and allies Biden seemed to think he could court for some kind of China-focused coalition.

Given its early actions, and with the same Democrat establishment cast running the show that has supported the project of China’s rise to global dominance for years — to say nothing of Biden’s broader ruling class backing from Wall Street to Silicon Valley — all signs point to a high likelihood of a soft-on-China policy.

Talk is cheap. Americans will ultimately pay the price if the Biden administration speaks loudly and carries no stick.

Biden's 'Conservative' Supporters Must Defend His Hard-Left First Month,"President Joe Biden wraps up his first full month in office this week having set a new record of speed and aggression in pursuing a partisan, hard-left agenda.

At the Democrats’ virtual convention in 2020, former Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden, branding the Democratic nominee a “unifier” with a commitment to bring the country together.

“America is at a crossroads,” Kasich said, while standing at a physical crossroads for the taped address.

The message of unity, decency, and bipartisanship became the defining theme of anti-Trump Republicans who promoted the most radical pair of candidates on any major party-ticket in decades.

“The responsible vote is for Joe Biden,” wrote former Pennsylvania Republican Gov. Tom Ridge for the Philadelphia Inquirer in September. “It’s a vote for decency. A vote for the rule of law.”

One has to wonder then, whether Ridge feels blindsided by the new president breaking records with the number of hard-left executive orders signed within his first month in office. Biden has already stamped his signature on 30 executive orders enacting sweeping and divisive social policy and paving the way for open borders. Seventeen of Biden’s orders were signed within his first 48 hours of inauguration, more than were issued in the presidencies of his four immediate predecessors combined.

But yes, a vote for Biden was “a vote for the rule of law,” no need for the elected representatives in Congress to weigh in on such massive changes at the stroke of a pen.

Self-purported conservatives who backed Biden now have to defend all his left-wing actions of the last month, governing with a Democrat Senate after a majority of the NeverTrump Republicans waded into the Georgia Senate runoffs to strip the Senate from Republican control even after Trump had already lost. If nothing else exposed the mission of the NeverTrumpers at the Lincoln Project and The Bulwark as having more to do with defeating Republicans than defeating Trump, it was Georgia.

In December, Reed Galen, a cofounder of the Lincoln Project, said the quiet part out loud.

“At this point, we’re as much never-Republican as we are anything else,” Galen told Politico as the group grappled with irrelevancy in the coming post-Trump era, before it finally fell apart just weeks later due to an underage sex scandal.

In his first month in office, Biden has followed through on his promise to serve as a vehicle for the left’s revolution, opening the Trojan horse conservatives detected in the run-up to November. The nomination of then-California Sen. Kamala Harris alone served as ample warning, considering her record in the upper chamber as the farthest-left member in support of Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, higher taxes, open borders, sanctuary cities, taxpayer-funded health care for illegal migrants, late-term and taxpayer-funded abortion, and a religious litmus test for Catholic nominations to the federal judiciary.

But it’s all worth it in the name of “unity,” said the Bulwarks and the Lincoln Projects. Biden has done nothing for unity except hypocritical lip service.

The new president came into office a week after House Democrats passed a snap impeachment of his predecessor. Biden did nothing to derail the divisive actions of his own party seeking retribution against the ousted president while their big tech allies put in motion a long-anticipated purge of political dissidents to the new left-wing regime. Nor has Biden condemned the escalating rhetoric of prominent left-wing voices, which include many who consider themselves mainstream, who demand the “de-programming,” and “de-baathification” of Republican Trump supporters.

Isn’t a mantra of the left “silence is violence”? While it’s a simple quip weaponized to guilt those into submission to so-called social justice, standards are different for the leader of the free world.

The new president’s silence as Democrats triggered an extreme measure reserved for only the most severe offenses, cheapening the institution in the process with a made-up crime, remains merely a prominent exposure of Biden’s talk of unity as a façade.

Within 48 hours of his swearing-in, Biden tasked former Obama White House national security adviser Susan Rice, now heading Biden’s Domestic Policy Council, with leading the new administration’s efforts to get agencies “rooting out systemic racism” as a focal point of their mission. Biden’s team said Rice will lead a “robust interagency process to hold the federal government accountable for advancing equity for families across America.”

Biden also dismantled the 1776 Commission and reversed Trump’s ban on seminars that promote racist critical race theory throughout federal agencies. The ticket cheered by NeverTrump “conservatives” is proving an effective vehicle for the far-left revolution.

Women’s sports also fell on Biden’s chopping block under a new anti-science executive order that requires institutions such as schools that receive federal funding allow biological males who identify as females be admitted to female sports programs and locker rooms.

Then there’s the reversal of the previous administration’s Mexico City Policy that bars taxpayer-funded abortions abroad, signed again by executive order. Restoration of funding for overseas abortion came passed alongside executive orders to remove Trump-implemented travel bans, axe funds for the border wall, and reinstate Obama-era protections for illegal aliens.

Workers on the Keystone pipeline met Biden’s message of unity coupled with pink slips after Biden yanked the project’s permit.

This came all within Biden’s first 48 hours.

It took Biden nearly a full month to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The two world leaders spoke on the phone for the first time Wednesday, news which came first from Israeli press. The Biden White House has been reluctant to declare the critical Middle Eastern ally an ally.

WOW: @PressSec refuses to say that Israel is an American ally. There is literally no excuse for this. And might explain why Biden hasn't called Netanyahu yet. pic.twitter.com/EfMJNN9Ssh — John Cooper (@thejcoop) February 12, 2021

Earlier this month, Biden repealed a Trump-era rule that prohibited banks from discriminating against entire politically unfavorable industries such as guns and ammunition dealers.

There also remains no shortage of Biden’s aggressive pursuit of Green New Deal climate policies. After all, Vice President Harris was an original co-sponsor of the legislation in the Senate. Newly unemployed coal miners, according to Harris, need not worry about the president canceling their jobs and undermining American energy infrastructure. Displaced coal workers can pivot to “reclaiming abandoned land mines.”

Are the NeverTrump “conservatives” who have always been overrepresented in the corporate press so far pleased with the results of the new left-wing administration? It’s hard to say. They’ve remained fixated on smearing Republicans who reject a return to the old world order. One of the primary pillars of their movement run by grifters, the Lincoln Project, is crumbling.

It’s important at times to not to lock political opponents into restrictive binaries categorizing individuals who support one candidate over the other as either completely committed or completely averse to a politician’s platform. Taken together, however, nearly every item on the Biden agenda, stated clearly before the election, has possessed all the markings of a radically leftist administration. And name-brand “conservatives” told us to vote for this.

Biden's Obvious Politics-Playing On Opening Schools Is Alienating Parents,"In the run-up to the 2020 election, Joe Biden blamed then-President Donald Trump for the COVID-19 death toll — and not just excess deaths, but for every single person who died with COVID.

“If the president had done his job, had done his job from the beginning, all the people would still be alive. All the people — I’m not making this up. Just look at the data. Look at the data,” Biden intoned to a pliant Anderson Cooper. “How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the table because someone died of COVID-19?”

The Democratic National Committee likewise stood on the graves of those killed by COVID-19 to score political points, even featuring at Democrats’ 2020 convention the daughter of a man killed by the virus. Leftist pundits and propagandists posing as journalists also pushed the narrative that the deaths of loved ones across America lay at Trump’s feet.

Now that a Democrat resides in the White House, however, the politicization of COVID-19 deaths has ceased, even with more than 80,000 Americans reported as dying with the virus since President Biden’s inauguration. Instead, the left is now accusing the GOP of “weaponizing pandemic-exhausted parents against Biden.”

How are Republicans triggering American moms and dads? By joining parents’ calls for schools to reopen, and by criticizing Democrats who have caved to teacher unions that demand classrooms stay shuttered pending compliance with an ever-expanding list of demands.

Politico, where editors had penned the unwittingly ironic headline accusing Republicans of “weaponizing parents,” then spun Republicans’ position. It claimed GOP lawmakers had offered “no commitment to meaningfully engage on policy proposals” and instead “responded to continued school closures by striking hard at Biden and Democrats, with more Republicans each week accusing the administration of scaling back their ambitious goals on everything from testing to school reopenings.”

On Feb. 18, the Washington Post followed Politico’s lead, framing the problem with school closings being “not Democrats’ policy, but Republican’s criticism of that policy.”

Yet Republicans have been clear on their position since May: Open. The. Schools.

It is not “striking hard” or “weaponizing” anyone or anything to highlight this policy difference. It is utter chutzpah for the left-leaning press, pundits, and politicians who used COVID-19 deaths on a daily basis to attack Trump — but not, at the time, New York Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo — to frame the debate in this light.

Leftist media seeks to obfuscate the difference on this issue between the two political parties to protect Democrats and teachers’ unions. It won’t work.

Parents across the country see two Americas on school openings. Red states — like Texas, Florida, Wyoming, Montana, and North and South Dakota — have been safely providing in-person education for months. Conversely, schools in the bluest states — such as California, Washington, and Oregon — remain virtual.

Over the course of the last two weeks, the country has also witnessed the Biden administration continually shifting its approach to school reopenings. After promising in 2020 that kids would return to the classroom within the first 100 days of his administration, last week, Biden Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the White House’s goal was “to have the majority of schools, so more than 50 percent, open by Day 100 of his presidency.”

Psaki then defined “open” as “some teaching in classrooms, so at least one day a week, hopefully, it’s more.” Psaki later confirmed that goal of one day a week among just over half of U.S. schools comprising “opening,” calling this “bold and ambitious.”

Yet on Tuesday night during a CNN town hall in Milwaukee, Wis., President Biden claimed Psaki’s statement that one day a week would meet the goal of in-person learning was “a mistake in the communication.”

Biden then assured the virtual town hall audience that “a majority of elementary schools will be open five days a week by the end of his first 100 days in office.” Yet that is not quite what Biden had promised Americans in December. He had committed to “seeing that a majority of our schools can be opened by the end of my first 100 days.”

While on Tuesday night Biden claimed he had “said open a majority of schools in K through eighth grade,” a transcript of Biden’s earlier 100-day promise tells a different story: He made no such distinction between elementary and middle schools and high schools. He said 100 days for schools, period.

On Wednesday morning, Vice President Kamala Harris attempted to cement that new lower standard for success in an interview with NBC “Today” host Savannah Guthrie. “Our goal is that as many K-8 schools as possible will reopen within the first 100 days. Our goal is that it will be five days a week, and so we have to work to achieve that goal,” Harris said.

Harris fumbled the interview, unable to explain how the Biden-Harris administration could reach its goal given that following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s new guidelines would necessitate keeping 90 percent of schools shuttered. The vice president was also unable to state whether the administration believes teachers needed to be vaccinated before students return to classrooms.

While Biden, Harris, and Psaki seem unable to provide consistent answers to basic questions about school reopenings, Republican governors have been more forthright. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the CDC’s new guidelines a “disgrace.”

“Florida schools are open for in-person instruction. Every single parent in this state has a right to send their kid to in-person instruction. We have done it the right way, we are not going to turn back,” DeSantis told reporters, adding: “What the CDC put out, 5 o’clock on a Friday afternoon — I wonder why they would do it then — was quite frankly a disgrace.”

It’s not just Republican politicians calling the endless closure of schools a disgrace. Parents, including self-described “progressive parents,” are equally outraged, as one Oakland-area parent posted on Medium:

Trump said open schools, so we must keep them closed at all costs. I have never felt so alienated from the people I usually align myself with politically. I will never understand how the left in this country has decided that advocating for putting kids first is somehow right-wing. I’m hearing from progressive parents all the time who are so infuriated about the Democratic apathy around school reopening — from politicians like Gavin Newsom, who are willing to allow their stances to be dictated by teachers’ unions — that they’re considering supporting the recall effort, maybe even switching parties. … Because here’s the thing: parents are not willing to sacrifice their kids’ wellbeing for the sake of ideology or being a good leftist.

Democrats are right to fear their voters are being pushed into the arms of Republicans, but they are being pushed there by the Biden administration’s policies.

That is not Republicans weaponizing parents. That’s the consequence of Biden telling voters that “President Trump doesn’t have a real plan for opening schools safely. He’s offering nothing but failures and ­delusions,” when, in reality, Biden’s soundbite described himself and his party.

"In Major Speech, Biden Reveals Deep Misunderstanding Of Foreign Policy","In a speech that would have been appropriate for the bipolar world in 1962, President Joe Biden called for an alliance of democracies to face off against tyrannical forces across the globe. This is a misreading of current geopolitics, which is not predominantly binary, but multipolar. The world we inhabit is qualitatively similar to the post-Napoleonic world of 1820, with one predominant but overstretched great power and several other powers jostling for space, influence, and interests.

Biden’s speech, given at the 2021 Munich Security Conference on Feb. 19, was touted as a restoration speech. It was as binary as one could have expected, and to his credit, Biden did not deviate from the message.

“We are in the midst of a fundamental debate about the future and direction of our world,” he said. “We’re at an inflection point between those who argue that, given all the challenges we face — from the fourth industrial revolution to a global pandemic — that autocracy is the best way forward, they argue, and those who understand that democracy is essential — essential to meeting those challenges.”

In providential liberalism mode, Biden spoke of a faith that democracies will prevail in any competition: “And I believe that — every ounce of my being — that democracy will and must prevail. We must demonstrate that democracies can still deliver for our people in this changed world. That, in my view, is our galvanizing mission.”

So, what is to be done to accomplish this? Biden suggested the United States needs to “demonstrate to our great, great-grandchildren, when they read about us, that democracy — democracy — democracy functions and works, and together, there is nothing we can’t do.”

Biden also said he hoped Europeans would choose the side of the United States in this Manichean struggle: “I hope our fellow democracies are going to join us in this vital work. Our partnerships have endured and grown through the years because they are rooted in the richness of our shared democratic values. They’re not transactional. They’re not extractive. They’re built on a vision of a future where every voice matters, where the rights of all are protected and the rule of law is upheld.”

Unfortunately for Biden’s analysis, we do not live in a bipolar world. The biggest blunder of the United States in the post-Cold War hegemonic world has been to institutionalize peace on the European continent, consolidating a polity under one flag and the single leadership of the European Union. This decision conflicted with the centuries-old British hegemonic strategy of divide and rule and balance of power.

As a result, the European Union is now starting to have its own strategic interests, opposed to what Washington might desire. While America’s military power is unparalleled and Europe is still dependent on Washington, the EU has independent financial interests and trade sanction powers that diverge from the United States’ interests, and sooner or later, that elephant in the room must be addressed.

The Austro-Hungarian empire wasn’t a military superpower. Yet it siding with Imperial Germany resulted in catastrophe. Likewise, the EU siding with China in trade issues is a statistical possibility.

Even in a bipolar world, which this isn’t, the EU as an actor might choose to side with China. In a multipolar world, it is almost guaranteed that the EU will not see China as a potential threat, as the United States, and will seek to hedge and play both sides.

That poses complicated theoretical questions Biden did not answer in the speech. There is a tendency to view the core Euro powers, especially West Europeans and Germany, as free-riding on the United States. The reality cannot be further from the truth.

The German and EU strategic cultures are different. Germany has been immensely successful and is possibly the greatest practitioner of buck-passing in Europe. The country has also so far managed to play China, Russia, and the United States at the same time, while keeping France from taking over EU leadership. Those contradictory but very pragmatic instincts are now coming to a head-on collision as great power rivalry returns.

The more baffling part of Biden’s speech was equating Russia and China in the same grouping, as authoritarian countries opposed to a global democratic brigade. “The challenges with Russia may be different than the ones with China, but they’re just as real,” he said. That simply isn’t empirically true.

Russia, for example, is nowhere as despotic as Saudi Arabia or Turkey, our purported allies. India, a partner in the Quad, is increasingly turning reactionary and majoritarian, yet not a single person from Biden’s State Department would consider ditching India, as it is the only nuclear counterbalance to China in Asia. Life and foreign policy aren’t just a simple democracy versus autocracy binary.

More importantly, Biden’s frame for foreign policy puts forward a needlessly confrontational stance that will give all small states in the peripheries incentive to drag the United States into a potential confrontation with other adversarial great powers. A moderate to large power should be very wary of small states on the periphery dragging them to conflict with other large powers who might be hostile overall, but not confrontational.

Sometimes, great powers battle other great powers over strategic and tactical resources. Other times, they are dragged by small powers into conflicts that are not in the great powers’ interest. A small state has nothing to lose by doing this. Small states are mostly often activist, ideological, perpetually afraid, and seeking security.

Naturally, if one is steering the grand strategy of a great power, one should ideally aspire to workable relations with other great powers, like a “concert” or equilibrium, instead of appeasing the insecurities of highly ideological small states in regions that are not existential to your security. That’s classical realism.

A multipolar great power competition is not rhetorically attractive and is more complicated. It is not men with bloodshot eyes rushing to Normandy after calls to arms by soaring rhetoric and speeches from larger-than-life leaders.

Those are unique times. Most of human history is a grand chessboard that demands calm, slow, deliberate long-term historical strategy. It needs historical understanding, which is more than having heard about 1939 Nazi Germany, or the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.

The United States also needs to pass burdens to allies, prioritize regions and territories, and accept that various powers have their various interests and spheres of influence. This allows a way out from the burden of policing the world.

Instead, binary Biden, like all idealistic and simpleminded liberals in history, took his first major shot and missed it by miles. By turning everything into a simplistic good versus evil, Biden risks doubling down on the United States’ failed grand strategy of the last quarter-century.

Deb Haaland Is The Trojan Horse Of Radicalism The GOP Warned About,"President Joe Biden’s pick for secretary of the interior, New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland, faced Senate lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday and did little to shake fears about her progressive radicalism.

Haaland was nominated in December after completing just one term in the House. She came to Congress in the 2018 midterms as a climate activist who had previously joined protesters against the South Dakota Access Pipeline Project. In the House, Haaland’s environmental activism earned her praise from New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who called her a “Green New Deal champion,” and the New Mexico congresswoman was an original co-sponsor of the progressive legislation, which sought to mandate the rapid decarbonization of the American economy under a socialist agenda.

On fossil fuels, Haaland has said she remains “wholeheartedly against fracking and drilling on public lands,” while being opposed to any and all oil and gas exploration on public property. Revenues from such energy exploration, however, provide the lifeblood of her home state’s economy. Forty percent of New Mexico’s budget depends on oil and gas production.

In 2018, Haaland tried to claim revenues could be offset by legalizing cannabis. “That is another industry that would be an economic boon for our state and this district,” Haaland said.

As secretary of the interior, Haaland would oversee 500 million acres of public lands with a pivotal role in crafting the environmental agenda of the Biden White House. Haaland tried to ease lawmaker concerns surrounding her opposition to fossil fuels by reiterating their importance in her opening statement.

“There’s no question that fossil energy does and will continue to play a major role in America for years to come. I know how important oil and gas revenues are to fund critical services,” Haaland said, in empty rhetoric Americans have heard before.

Last year, then-candidate Joe Biden routinely wavered back and forth over his opposition to fossil fuels depending on the audience. Throughout the primary, Biden was clear that under his administration, fracking would be banned.

“We would work it out. We would make sure it’s eliminated,” Biden once said during a CNN debate.

SUPERCUT: Biden promises ""no more"" fracking if he's elected President. pic.twitter.com/iWcsU2Yam8 — Abigail Marone 🇺🇸 (@abigailmarone) August 31, 2020

In the fall, however, Biden pretended to back off his earlier promises, even with an original Senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal running with him on his ticket. Biden’s own website touted support for the Green New Deal, a note highlighted in a fact-check by The Federalist after the Democratic nominee tried to claim “that’s not my plan,” in the September debate.

“I do not propose banning fracking,” Biden said during an October ABC town hall. “It has to be managed very, very well.” Ban or no ban, however, it won’t matter if the Biden administration, featuring Haaland, would just regulate the industry to death.

Biden’s apparent change of heart was merely empty political rhetoric so as not to lose votes in key tipping-point states such as Pennsylvania where Trump aired footage at rallies of Biden’s earlier comments railing against fossil fuels. “We’re going to phase out fossil fuels,” Biden says in the video.

Within his first month in office, Biden signed executive orders to do just that, yanking the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, and placed moratoriums on new mining, oil, and gas leases on public lands with an order for the Department of the Interior to review existing permits.

The new policies are poised to wreck states dependent on energy production, and Haaland stands to be their champion at the helm of Interior. Haaland dodged questions about her personal opinions on Tuesday and instead pivoted to reaffirming her commitment to Biden’s agenda, an already progressive platform crafted under the framework of the Green New Deal.

“Do you support a ban on fracking and no new pipelines?” pressed Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines.

“President Biden does not support a ban on fracking is my understanding,” she said. When asked again, Haaland gave a re-worded version of the first answer.

“If I am confirmed as secretary, I would be serving at the pleasure of the president, and it would be his agenda that I would move forward,” Haaland said, without backing away from earlier statements that she was “wholeheartedly against fracking.” Adequate regulation passed by the Biden administration could effectively serve the same purpose as outright banning fracking.

When Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy pressed her on her position over Biden’s order on the Keystone Pipeline, Haaland said again that it remains the president’s decision.

Of course, no Cabinet nominee would openly contradict the platform of the president prior to confirmation, let alone during a confirmation hearing. Her nomination and record of environmental radicalism, however, combined with the president’s aggressive early climate policies, expose the Trojan Horse of progressivism that Republicans warned of all last year on the campaign trail.

Biden's Foreign Policy Is Obama Again: Boosting Enemies At Our Expense,"President Biden says his foreign policy goal is to promote American values. Yet serious questions deserve to be raised as to whether these were only empty words following the Biden administration’s recent controversial moves on China and Iran that seem all too eager to appease America’s adversaries.

In a recent CNN town hall, when asked about the genocide of the Uighur Muslims enacted under Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, Biden sounded like a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, repeating the CCP’s talking points, and explaining the CCP’s treatment of the persecuted Uighur population as a different cultural “norm.”

Tony Blinken, Biden’s secretary of state, stated in his Senate confirmation hearing that he agrees China is committing “genocide” in Xinjiang but had a change of heart after Biden dismissed the CCP’s actions. Following his boss’s lead, the State Department now claims “insufficient evidence to prove genocide.”

The intrinsically discernible fact is that no cultural norm could ever justify the systematic elimination of the identity, culture, and religion of an entire group of people. As the numerous news reports about the plight of Uighurs in China indicate, more than 1 million have been “systematically dehumanized, humiliated, and brain-washed” in prison-like internment camps.

Uighur women reportedly have suffered the worst, including rape, sexual assaults, forced sterilization, and forced abortions inside the camps. Besides these unspeakable physical sufferings, Uighurs are losing their religious sites and cultural heritage.

Refusing to Hold the CCP Accountable

Under the Trump administration, the United States took a series of actions to hold the CCP accountable for its human rights abuses, such as sanctions targeting senior CCP officials. On his last day as the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo officially declared that the Chinese Communist Party’s actions against Uighur Muslims and other minorities in Xinjiang constitute “genocide” and a “crime against humanity.”

By doing so, Pompeo removed a challenging barrier for his successor, making it easier for the Biden administration to take tough actions to hold Beijing accountable while providing the new administration powerful leverage to use in future negotiations.

In its zeal to erase all things Trump-related, the Biden administration is giving up the leverage gifted by the Trump administration and relinquishing America’s legal responsibility and moral leadership. If this appeasement is being done in hopes of a change in the CCP’s behavior, it’s both ignorant and arrogant. Already, there are now credible reports regarding the CCP’s deployment of identical tactics it used in Xinjiang against the Uighurs to populations in Tibet and Inner Mongolia.

The Biden administration’s moral cowardice will only drive allies further into China’s sphere of influence, emboldening the CCP to intensify its domestic aggression, and accelerating the rise of a dangerous Sino-centric new world order.

Rewarding Iran’s Bad Behaviors

Former President Obama, along with then-Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, handed the American people and the rest of the world a bad Iran nuclear deal in 2015. Since then, the deal has provided Iran millions of dollars, enabling Iran’s mullahs to fund menacing activities to regain and expand their influence in the Middle East.

Most importantly, the deal never served its intended purpose: stopping Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons. Last November, the Institute for Science and International Security released a report stating Iran’s low enriched uranium stock exceeds the limit set by the 2015 Iran nuclear deal by 12-fold:

[Iran] now has sufficient low enriched uranium to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a second nuclear weapon, where the second one could be produced more quickly than the first.

Since the foundation of the 2015 nuclear deal was the Obama administration and the European Union’s willful ignorance of and blind trust in the Iranian government, no one should be surprised with this finding. The Trump administration pulled out of this bad deal and re-imposed economic sanctions on Iran in 2018. The idea was to weaken Iran’s clerical authoritarian regime so the United States could negotiate a more effective nuclear deal.

The sanctions worked as they were intended. Along with the Iranian regime’s mismanagement and corruption, Iran’s economy crumbled. Its currency lost 80 percent of its value to U.S. dollars. The overall unemployment rate reached 15 percent, and between 40 and 50 percent among young people.

Fed up with economic hardship, Iranians staged mass protests demanding political change from late 2017 into 2018, and then again between 2019 and early 2020. The coronavirus pandemic further weakened Iran’s clerical authoritarian regime.

With the Trump administration’s facilitation, Israel and several Arab nations in the Middle East signed historic peace agreements last year, partially driven by their collective concern about Iran’s menaces in the region. As Brian Hook, the U.S. State Department’s special envoy for Iran under the Trump administration, stated: “Peace between the Arabs and the Israelis is Iran’s worst nightmare.”

Wasting Opportunities

The Biden administration should have taken advantage of the leverage gifted by the previous administration, demanded the Iranian regime indefinitely abandon developing nuclear weapons, and make real progress toward establishing long-lasting peace in the Middle East. Instead, President Biden acted as if the much-weakened Iran is the one that has a stronger hand than the United States.

Even before he was sworn into the office, Biden’s team reportedly partook in covert talks with Iran about returning to the 2015 nuclear deal. Biden’s appointment of Robert Malley as his special envoy to Iran — a man with a long history of sympathy to Iran’s authoritarian regime and of overtly anti-Israeli sentiments — signals that appeasement of the mullahs will be the new foreign policy of the United States.

Last week, Iran threatened to limit international agencies from monitoring its nuclear activities. A day later, an Iran-backed militant group fired rockets into the U.S. military base in Iraq, injuring at least one U.S. serviceman. Rather than making it clear to Iran that the United States will neither tolerate nor be intimidated by such attacks or threats, the Biden administration demonstrated that its desperation to appease the mullahs has only grown.

In the latest troubling developments from last Thursday, the Biden administration made what the administration calls “goodwill gestures“ to Iran. First, the United Nations Security Council was informed the United States was rescinding a Trump administration claim that all U.N. sanctions had been re-imposed on Iran. Second, the U.S. state department publicly announced it will return to nuclear negotiations with Iran with no pre-set conditions. Last but not least, the U.S. lifted “severe movement restrictions“ on Iranian diplomats in New York.

None of these concessions were made because Iran’s regime did anything to earn them. All were made after the Iran-backed militant group attack on the Iraqi US. base. Iran never offered any “goodwill gestures” in return. When asked why the administration rewarded Iran for its displeasing behavior, a State Department official elaborated that “these are not concessions to Iran. These are concessions to common sense.”

Reading the Signs

When our adversaries perceive American desperation, they will take advantage of the situation and extract maximum concessions. That’s exactly what Iran is doing. As Frontpage Magazine reports, “Javad Zarif, Iran’s Foreign Minister, has shown he believes that the Biden Administration can be threatened into rapidly submitting to Iran’s demand that it lift all sanctions on Iran without there being any change to the 2015 nuclear deal.” It seems Iran’s read on the Biden administration, which is full of veterans from the Obama administration, is far more accurate than the Biden administration’s read on Iran.

Former American hostage in Iran Xiyue Wang tweeted: “The US can’t exchange goodwill with IRI, because U.S. goodwill is regarded as a sign of weakness and IRI will exploit it. IRI’s compliance with JCPOA is not goodwill. It is a necessity, as IRI’s nuclear file is itself a gigantic tool for extortion.”

The Biden administration’s appeasement of Tehran will not only harden Iran’s resolve to demand maximum concessions from the United States without giving up its nuclear ambitions but also will send a clear message of weakness to all of America’s adversaries around the world that all talk from the Biden administration about promoting and defending American values are nothing but a fig leaf.

Biden’s foreign policy is clearly a potentially worse retread of Obama’s foreign policy, rarely backing up lofty rhetoric with needed tough actions. The foreign policy of the Biden administration looks poised to treat America’s foes with kid gloves, both ignorant of the true uncharitable nature of our adversaries and too arrogant to learn otherwise. It’s an ideology that mistakes wishful thinking as sound policies that will somehow induce desired changes.

From the South China Sea to the Middle East, Obama weakened U.S. global leadership, accelerated American decline, and alienated some of our most important allies while empowering our rivals. It seems President Biden is determined to retake the same path as his former boss, which will no doubt strengthen antagonists to American interests at the expense of peace and security of the United States and our allies.

Joe Biden Wants To Make You Pay Off Rich People’s College Debt,"Joe Biden has proposed wiping out student loan debt for millions of student loan borrowers. Biden wants to make taxpayers pay off all undergraduate federal student debt for borrowers who earn an income of less than $125,000 per year and who attended a public college, a “historically black” college,” or a “minority-serving institution.”

On Election Day, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., urged Biden to enact a plan, authored by him and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to eliminate up to $50,000 in borrowers’ student loan debt by executive order. Warren and Schumer have since renewed that call, and dozens of Democrats reintroduced a bicameral resolution earlier this month urging Biden to take such action.

Biden has stated that making taxpayers pay off $10,000 of every person’s outstanding student debt should be done “immediately” as part of a broader coronavirus spending package. At a CNN town hall in Milwaukee, Wisconsin last week, Biden resisted the call to cancel $50,000 in debt per borrower but emphasized that he is “prepared to write off” $10,000 in debt.

He also reiterated his belief that community colleges should be free for everyone and that all public four-year colleges should be free for students from families making less than $125,000 per year. Biden’s debt bailout plan is bad for a variety of reasons. I list five of them here.

It’s Unfair

According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, only 35 percent of Americans attain a bachelor’s degree. This means forcing 65 percent of Americans—many of whom are blue-collar workers who neither want nor need college degrees—to subsidize others’ careers.

It’s unfair to require those families to pay off the college debts of others, especially when, according to a McKinsey report relying on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, nearly half of graduates from four-year colleges are working in jobs that don’t require a four-year degree.

Also, what of college graduates who worked hard and paid off their loans or made substantial headway toward doing so? Would they get reimbursed? Biden doesn’t say. Is it fair that, after paying down their loans, they now must be required to pay off everyone else’s? Clearly not.

Moreover, Biden is dodgy on whether his loan bailout would be a one-shot deal or a new, permanent entitlement program. As the New York Times stated, if it’s a one-time deal, the plan “would create a generation of student loan lottery winners, with losers on either side. People who had already paid back their loans would get nothing. People with future loans would get nothing. People with debt on the day the legislation was enacted would be rewarded.”

Given that Biden has already signed on to the idea that public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for students from families with incomes up to $125,000, it’s a fair bet that he wants this to be a new, and prospectively applied, entitlement.

It Punishes the Poor and Hard-Working

The countries that provide socialized higher education have jacked up the taxes on working citizens. Germany, for example, saw a 37 percent increase in the college subsidy cost to taxpayers once public universities removed tuition. Placing a tax burden on lower-income workers for the benefit of students who will go on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, and other professionals is unfair to those who earn less.

While proponents of socialized college argue that it gives students from lower socio-economic classes the opportunity for upward mobility, in reality it does not work out that way. England is perfect example. Once college there became free, enrollment skyrocketed. Because the government lacked the funds to cover the cost, it imposed strict caps on enrollment.

To ration the limited seats, colleges raised their admissions standards. Since families with more money could afford to pay for better schools and tutors, those who benefitted from free college were students from well-off families who tended to have higher test scores and a resume of extracurricular activities. Even Karl Marx recognized that socialized college mainly benefits the rich.

Because rationing is necessary in all countries with taxpayer-paid college tuition, most end up accepting just a fraction of applicants. Consequently, they regularly rank low among developed countries for college-degree attainment.

According to U.S. statistics, out of 36 developed countries, the United States ranks fifth highest in percentage of the population who have attained a postsecondary degree – behind only Japan, Israel, South Korea, and Canada, none of which offer free college. In fact, as of 2017 (the most recent year for which data is available), the percentage of Americans aged 25 to 64 years who had attained a postsecondary degree was far higher than in those countries where college tuition is tax-paid.

According to the Manhattan Institute, many programs 2020 Democrats pushed “transfer society’s resources to upper-middle-class professionals at the expense of lower-income households.” Biden’s debt-canceling plan fits comfortably within this model. A working paper released last month by the prestigious University of Chicago Booth School of Business confirms this.

It Eliminates Accountability

When schools know the government will cover the cost of students’ education, they do not cut costs to keep tuition down. In 2015, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued a study that found that for every additional dollar the federal government allows students to borrow, colleges and universities increase their tuition by 60 cents, thereby increasing the number of students who need loans to afford college in the first place.

A Harvard University study found that tuition at for-profit colleges eligible for federal student aid is 78 percent higher than at colleges ineligible for such programs. The National Bureau for Economic Research cited expansions in borrowing limits as “the single most important factor” in driving up college tuition.

Not only are schools raising tuition, they’re not spending the bulk of this additional money on education. In 2012, The New York Times reported that “A decade-long spending binge to build academic buildings, dormitories and recreational facilities … has left colleges and universities saddled with large amounts of debt. Oftentimes, students are stuck picking up the bill.”

Despite the soaring cost of tuition, colleges and universities carry an average aggregate debt bill of approximately $125 billion, according to a December 2017 analysis by Moody’s. Biden’s plan does nothing to address this out-of-control spending, and in fact likely makes it worse.

Similarly, Biden’s plan fails to encourage accountability by borrowers. By eliminating repayment obligations, students are incentivized to take out loans with no intention of paying them back, or to borrow more than they need.

As explained by the director of the Federal Education Budget Project at the New America Foundation, this makes students “price-indifferent.” We should be encouraging students to consider seriously their educational options, including trade schools, and, above all, to be fiscally responsible with their areas of study. Biden’s plan encourages none of this.

Although federal loan money has historically been handed out with little scrutiny about students’ ability to pay it back, Biden’s plan also includes no details on how, if at all, the federal government plans to address the expansion in borrowing limits. Without meaningful provisions holding schools, borrowers, and the federal government accountable for the problem of enormous educational debt, Biden’s plan is a kludge that does nothing to address, long term, any of the root causes of the student debt problem.

It’s Expensive and Paid For By Small Businesses

Even before Biden added debt cancellation to his college plan, it had already racked up a staggering $750 billion price tag. Biden’s plan to pay for this is to restore the Section 461(l) limitation.

As part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Section 461(l) of the IRS Code was amended to limit how much partnerships, S-corporations and pass-throughs could claim in losses against non-business income in a given year. With the passage of the CARES Act, that limitation was suspended, thereby benefitting most, if not all, small businesses.

Since most small businesses are organized as S-corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships, Biden’s plan to restore the Section 461(l) limitation would hurt those who have suffered most during the pandemic: small business owners. It would also allow large C-Corporations—such as Walmart, Home Depot, and the big box stores—to continue enjoying the loss limitation relief.

So much for Biden’s declaration that “taxes on small businesses won’t go up” in a Biden administration. In fact, the tax burden on ordinary Americans would swell to epic proportions if Biden’s plans are enacted.

It’s Likely Unconstitutional

Biden’s plan calls for bailing out federal debt for borrowers who attended private institutions only if those institutions were Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) or schools registered with the U.S. Department of Education as a “minority serving institution” (MSI).

Allowing the federal government to cancel federal debt for private college tuition only for those who attended HBCUs or MSIs sparks serious constitutional concerns. To begin, it seems to violate the guarantee of equal protection recognized under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

Since Biden’s plan expressly favors only some races and ethnicities, it would be subject to strict scrutiny by the courts—the most exacting standard of review. Also, since Biden’s plan would effectively penalize all students—including blacks and other minorities—who attended any of the more than 2,000 non-MSI private institutions in our country (more than half of our nation’s private colleges and universities) it is hard to see how it would pass constitutional muster.

Further, assuming that Biden’s plan eliminates future, not just past, federal loan debt, it also implicates the First Amendment’s freedom of association, and possibly the freedom of religion under the Free Exercise clause.

While the educational loan debt problem is a grave one, Biden’s plan is no solution. Indeed, in Federalist 10, Madison remarked that forcing people to pay others’ debts is a “wicked project.” Democrats, however, kneel at the altar of socialism, raise high the poisoned chalice of debt cancellation, and ignore the wisdom of our founders.

Biden vs Trump On National Security: Here's The First Month Report Card,"Whatever your views of Donald Trump’s presidency, it is hard to dispute that he produced a stronger record of achievement across the board when it comes to protecting the American people from a range of foreign threats than any other president in at least a generation. His national security accomplishments in four short years included taking on China, forging the historic Abraham Accords in the Middle East, defeating the ISIS caliphate, countering Iran, and standing up the Space Force. So now, one month into his tenure, how is President Joe Biden doing in preserving and building on Trump’s remarkable record?

One month ago, all presidential appointees in the White House wrote standard, end-of-office resignation letters to Trump. In my letter departing as deputy assistant to the president and spokesman for the National Security Council, I singled out 10 key accomplishments he achieved for the American people (most of which were accomplished in the last 18 months of his term, with new NSC leaders Robert O’Brien and Matt Pottinger executing efficiently on his priorities across the government). The 10 accomplishments offer a good framework for scoring President Biden’s effect on our national security in his first 30 days in office.

The bottom line: The jury is still out on where the Biden administration stands on most of these issues so early into the administration, but on a number of the items, there are worrying signs of a backslide on the historic progress Trump made. Following are each of Trump’s key accomplishments and a couple of points from Biden’s initial actions on each of them:

1. Building a new international consensus on China by standing up to its aggression in all its forms:

After Trump pulled the United States from the World Health Organization last year over the body’s working with China to cover up the virus, Biden rejoined the WHO on his first day in office, resuming full U.S. funding, and failed to demand specific reforms including the replacement of the disastrous leadership team headed by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

Further, Biden held a two-hour call with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Feb. 10, and while he echoed Trump’s priorities on maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific and pressing Xi on Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Uighur human rights, at a CNN town hall he later appeared to excuse the treatment of the Uighurs, saying, “Culturally, there are different norms that each country and their leaders are expected to follow.”

Biden also failed to confront Xi for his party’s unleashing the China virus on the rest of the world and for continuing to cover it up.

2. Strengthening critical partnerships with allies such as India, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand on issues from counterterrorism to maritime security:

Here there is actually good news. In a Feb. 18 call with the “Quad” countries — United States, India, Japan, and Australia — Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterparts agreed “to strengthen cooperation on advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region, including support for freedom of navigation and territorial integrity.” Good work so far. Let’s hope that stands.

3. Signing a peace agreement with the Taliban after 19 years of war:

Trump pledged to withdraw the 2,500 remaining U.S. troops from Afghanistan by May 2021, in accordance with that agreement with the Taliban last year. There is a real question about whether Biden will either delay that pullout or cancel it entirely, leaving some U.S. troops in Afghanistan indefinitely.

As a reminder, President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Biden had more than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan in 2011, and it will be important to see whether Biden follows through on Trump’s promise finally to end our presence in that country after two decades.

4. Bringing Iran’s economy to its knees and choking off funds to its terrorist allies:

Here there are real questions. No one was tougher on Iran than Trump, who in 2018 pulled us out of the “disastrous” Obama-Biden Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, that included $1.7 billion in funding for Iran, $400 million of which was airlifted into the country on pallets of cash. Now Biden wants to rejoin that widely criticized deal, although for the time being he is insisting on Iran halting the enrichment of uranium before lifting the Trump-imposed sanctions.

A positive move was Biden’s decision to launch airstrikes on Iran-backed militia targets in eastern Syria this week in response to several recent rocket attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq, including one that killed a contractor. This response was welcome, if not somewhat surprising, given his strong criticism of Trump’s decisive action against malign Iranian actors for similar misconduct a year ago.

5. Eliminating the ISIS physical caliphate, once the size of Great Britain:

Once again, this was a real victory for Trump, where under Obama and Biden, the force reached a peak of tens of thousands of fighters in 2014. Trump effectively eliminated the ISIS caliphate in December 2017, after less than a year in office.

Most notably, Trump made the bold decision in October 2019 to send U.S. troops into northern Syria to capture or kill ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, resulting in the terrorist’s death by suicide vest when he was cornered in a tunnel. Biden pointedly gave Trump no credit for launching the successful operation at the time, very much of a piece with Biden’s opposition to the raid on Osama bin Laden eight years earlier. Needless to say, whether Biden exhibits the same decisiveness to keep ISIS from resurging early in his term remains an open question.

6. Forging a historic peace agreement between the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Israel, the most significant step toward peace in the Middle East in over 25 years:

In September of last year, Biden “welcomed” Trump’s forging of the first of the Abraham Accords and noted that “a Biden-Harris administration will build on these steps, challenge other nations to keep pace, and work to leverage these growing ties into progress toward a two-state solution and a more stable, peaceful region.” Since that statement, Trump expanded the Accords to include Sudan and Morocco.

Needless to say, this pledge by Biden on the Accords is great news — but whether he will, in fact, honor it remains unclear, both in his initial steps on rejoining the Iran deal and in his move in January “temporarily pausing” the landmark Trump sale last November of 50 F-35 stealth fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates that followed that country’s signing of the Accords.

7. Rebuilding our military and establishing the Space Force, the first new branch of the Armed Forces in 70 years:

Finally some good news here, but not without a push. After initially mocking a reporter’s question about whether Biden would keep Trump’s signature new service branch formed last year, White House press secretary Jen Psaki stated the next day, in response to criticism from Republicans, “We are not revisiting the decision to establish the Space Force.” Can’t anything be easy from this White House?

Whether Biden will continue Trump’s rebuilding of our nation’s military is far from settled, as initial planning suggests he will recommend a flat Defense Department budget for 2022, at $696 billion, rather than Trump’s planned $722 billion that included big increases for shipbuilding. Watch this space, as Biden’s budget is scheduled for release on May 3.

8. Pressing NATO members to increase their defense spending, resulting in pledges of an extra $400 billion through 2024:

There are good initial signs here. In advance of last week’s NATO ministerial meeting, a U.S. official noted that Biden and his team “expect all allies to live up to this commitment” on defense spending for the alliance, even as they would seek a “change in … tone and approach” from Trump, whose very tone and approach is exactly what brought the NATO allies to increase their spending massively beginning in 2018 after years of excuses.

Decorous calls for NATO allies to do more are nothing new. What was new under Trump was worrying less about the decorum but actually getting the allies to increase their defense spending.

9. Normalizing economic relations between Serbia and Kosovo:

To build on this important agreement forged by Trump in September, which provided for economic interaction between these two Balkan nations, Biden indicated earlier this month that he will press for the countries to recognize each other politically.

Mutual recognition and ultimate integration of the two countries into the European Union has been a shared goal of the United States and the European Union for the past decade, and Trump’s approach was to broker an economic agreement between the two countries as a initial step to pave the way for that goal.

Biden deserves credit for building on Trump’s progress bringing the countries together economically, but Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic’s response to Biden’s overture indicates that political recognition of Kosovo remains dead on arrival in his country. This at least demonstrates shared interests between Biden and Trump on Balkan policy.

10. Reducing undocumented migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico by 85 percent:

No policy was arguably as important to Trump than securing our southern border, and he delivered on it starting early in his tenure, from building over 450 miles of a border wall, to instituting a “remain in Mexico” policy that mandated asylum-seekers remain outside the United States while they await their status.

Biden reversed both of those on his first day in office. He called the border wall “a waste of money that diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security,” and has long called the remain in Mexico policy “inhumane.”

The result? A surge of over 100 percent in illegal border crossings over this time last year. Now Biden is proposing an eight-year pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants that many fear will itself be a magnet for more illegal immigration as migrants try to get to the United States to benefit from it. Make no mistake, there could be no clearer contrast between Trump and Biden in the area of national security than on border policy.

The record is clear: Trump produced remarkable achievements on national security in four short years, achievements that many Americans are looking for Biden to sustain and build on. This early in his presidency, it remains unclear whether Biden will do just that, but a one-month examination of his initial moves on some of Trump’s key wins raises some concerns on that important question.

Evangelicals For Biden 'Feel Betrayed' By Biden Doing What He Promised,"In an open letter released Sunday, Pro-Life Evangelicals for Biden urged him to “honor his commitment” and include the Hyde Amendment in Democrats’ $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending package, writing “we feel used and betrayed.” The letter states:

We are very disappointed about the COVID-19 relief package’s exclusion of the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding bipartisan policy that prevents taxpayer funding for abortion. We’re even more upset that the Biden administration is supporting this bill. As pro-life leaders in the evangelical community, we publicly supported President Biden’s candidacy with the understanding that there would be engagement [with] us on the issue of abortion and particularly the Hyde Amendment …We feel used and betrayed and have no intention of simply watching these kinds of efforts happen from the sidelines.

https://twitter.com/breaking911/status/1368400944476651523?s=21

During an Atlanta Democratic National Convention Committee event in 2019, Biden announced that he no longer supported the Hyde Amendment—which has been included on a bipartisan basis in federal spending bills since 1976. The Hyde Amendment restricts federal taxpayer dollars from funding many abortions.

“If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s ZIP code,” Biden said in May 2019 in a video posted by the American Civil Liberties Union.

Our volunteer Nina asked Joe Biden whether, as president, he would lift the Hyde amendment, which bans federal insurance coverage of abortion. He said yes. #RightsForAll pic.twitter.com/W4jT7RLNzN — ACLU (@ACLU) May 8, 2019

This was a major reversal for the then-nominee, given Biden claimed in his 2008 book “Promises to Keep” that “I’ve stuck to my middle-of-the-road position on abortion for more than thirty years. I still vote against partial birth abortion and federal funding.” Even in June 2019, Biden’s campaign claimed he still supported the amendment.

Regardless of Biden’s change of heart, more than 5,000 “pro-life evangelicals” endorsed him for the presidency in October 2020. The coalition noted that “we disagree with Vice President Biden and the Democratic platform on the issue of abortion” but still claimed “Joe Biden’s policies are more consistent with the biblically shaped ethic of life than those of Donald Trump.”

“Knowing that the most common reason women give for abortion is the financial difficulty of another child, we appreciate a number of Democratic proposals that would significantly alleviate that financial burden: accessible health services for all citizens, affordable childcare, a minimum wage that lifts workers out of poverty,” the October letter stated. “For these reasons, we believe that on balance, Joe Biden’s policies are more consistent with the biblically shaped ethic of life than those of Donald Trump. Therefore, even as we continue to urge different policies on abortion, we urge evangelicals to elect Joe Biden as president.”

The Sunday letter comes after Senate Democrats rejected Sen. James Lankford’s, R-Okla., effort to include the Hyde Amendment in the $1.9 trillion spending package in which allocations have nothing to do with coronavirus. Democrat Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Tim Kaine of Virginia, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted in favor of Lankford’s amendment, likely aware that it would ultimately fail given their colleagues’ positions.

Prior to this, 48 Republican senators pledged to oppose any spending bill without the Hyde Amendment in February. Two hundred Republican House members signed a joint letter addressed to Congress in January demanding the Hyde Amendment continue to be respected.

“We call on President Biden to honor his commitment to us and immediately demand the House of Representatives apply the Hyde language to the American Relief package,” the Pro-Life Evangelicals for Biden coalition continues. “This is no time for radical change to longstanding abortion policy.”

It is unclear what “commitment” Biden had provided the evangelical coalition, given his vocal denouncement of the Hyde Amendment before assuming the presidency. The letter was signed by Dr. Richard Mouw, president emeritus of Fuller Seminary, as well as Ronald J. Sider, president emeritus of Evangelicals for Social Action.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/07/evangelicals-for-biden-feel-used-and-betrayed-by-biden-fulfilling-his-radical-abortion-promises/,2021-03-07
Joe Biden Is The Commander In Hiding,"78-year-old President Joe Biden is nowhere to be seen, aside from sporadic television appearances through a black mask the size of a Rawlings baseball mitt, or appearing to be on the verge of collapse from dehydration in social media videos.

On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced Biden’s name will not appear on the $1,400 COVID-19 stimulus direct payments being sent out to millions of Americans this month. “This is not about him,” Psaki said. “This is about the American people getting relief.”

While Psaki claims this action is due to the federal government’s efforts to expedite the relief process, it is a strikingly on-cue representation of Biden’s reclusive campaign and presidency. Biden’s name missing from the checks is an avatar of him going missing from campaigning and now the presidency. The man has repeatedly and noticeably avoided the public eye since deciding to run for the president for the third time.

According to a final count of 2020 presidential rallies, Biden hosted a total of 53 compared to former President Trump’s 86. Biden canceled public speaking events in advance, notably all rallies prior to his debate with Trump in October.

Dozens of Biden’s supposed “rallies” were performed digitally, presumably out of fear of contracting COVID or perhaps in desperation for another Botox shot to keep the facade going that he is actually in fine mental and physical condition to be the president. In a virtual town hall back in April 2020, Biden seemingly fell asleep on camera with Hillary Clinton. In October 2020, he claimed to voters in Toledo, Ohio he was running for the Senate.

The Biden “gaffes” just kept on coming. They still do.

This and other factors fueled a lack of enthusiasm for Joe. According to an Associated Press-NORC Center For Public Affairs survey taken in July 2020, 42 percent of Trump supporters were “excited” heading into the election, while only 31 percent of Biden supporters could say the same. In March 2020, the same sentiment showed; “strong enthusiasm” for Biden rested at 24 percent, the lowest of any Democratic presidential candidate in the last 20 years, while Trump rode the ship at 53 percent in the ABC/Washington Post poll.

“We’ve got the most energy in the history of politics, and he’s got the least,” Trump yelped in October 2020 to a crowd in Janesville, Wis.

There was another glaring discrepancy between the Trump rallies and the Biden “rallies.” For one, Trump’s rallies were electric and fun and hip. “Billie Jean,” “All Right Now,” “We Are The Champions,” “Macho Man,” and other songs energized crowds of Americans wearing MAGA hats and waving flags. “God Bless The U.S.A.” continues to be the song Trump comes out in front of crowds, including his February speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Fla.

Biden’s rallies attracted an average attendance of 38 people, with only 1,996 attendees in total from August to November. Trump’s rallies had an average of 13,024 people and attracted a total of 1,120,070 (not including his many rallies leading up to 2020). Trump did even not allow contracting the virus to stop him from speaking to the American public face to face. He outperformed his 2016 rally digits by about 50 percent, which at the time outmatched Hillary Clinton in total by 853,935 attendees combined.

Biden may have captured the presidency, but he did so by raking in votes from Democrats and Independents more focused on removing the “mean orange man” than electing a senile career politician. It appears voters did not care if a man is unfit, so long as he is running against what the left hyperbolized as a tyrant in Trump.

Now each day, Psaki sanctimoniously tries to clarify Biden’s positions of the day. Whether these are his actual positions, or that of radical puppetmasters in the administration, who knows.

“[Biden] has replaced in-person meetings with video calls. He allows only a limited number of people in the building — even staff that normally would have been in the West Wing are working from home or in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door,” Politico reported in February on Biden’s daily routine. “He doesn’t leave the White House often…. He isn’t planning any foreign or domestic trips for now. And until this week, when he invited senators of both parties to talk about Covid-19 recovery legislation, he was not asking visitors to the White House.”

Words from this president are rarely long and in-depth, contrary to the “page-turner” executive orders Biden has pushed through. A glimpse at content on Biden’s Twitter feed is like going to BrainyQuote.com. Each post is an orchestrated catchphrase fit for a bumper sticker hanging off the side of a woke upper-middle-class suburban mother’s minivan. But Biden isn’t writing the tweets, of course. A man named Brendan Cohen is his social media manager.

“While Trump would call friends and allies seemingly at random, Biden has a list of phone calls scheduled for him,” Politico continued. “While Trump didn’t mind aides and outside allies wandering into the Oval Office, Biden has a handful of gatekeepers who control access to the room.”

At the Republican National Convention in August, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz’s speech foreshadowed what would become of the Biden presidency. “I’m speaking to you from an auditorium emptier than Joe Biden’s daily schedule,” Gaetz said. By this time, Trump’s coined “sleepy Joe” phrase to define Biden was a fan favorite for the conservative base.

“Welcome to the race, Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign,” Trump tweeted in April 2019 upon Biden announcing his run for the presidency. “It will be nasty – you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick & demented ideas. But if you make it, I will see you at the Starting Gate.”

For a commander-in-chief so detached from the American public, Biden signed the most executive orders out of any president in history on his first day of office — 15. As of writing, he has signed close to 50 orders, whereas during the same time in their respective presidencies, Barack Obama had signed 28 and Donald Trump 27.

David Keltz, a former speechwriter for the executive branch, brilliantly captured in The American Spectator Biden’s bleak shadow presidency. “What a difference from our new basement president. Perhaps no song better sums up Biden’s first two weeks as commander in chief than the Beatles tune: ‘Nowhere Man,'” Keltz writes.

“He’s a real nowhere man

Sitting in his nowhere land

Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Doesn’t have a point of view

Knows not where he’s going to.”

We are living in a weird time, in a weird place, led by a senior citizen who remains silent while his minions appear to run the show.

Lapdog Corrupt Media Coverage Of Biden’s Carteresque Speech Is Embarrassing,"It’s embarrassing. Our corrupt, partisan media are embarrassing.

Thursday night, President Joe Biden gave a speech to mark the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization’s delayed acknowledgment of the COVID-19 pandemic that China unleashed upon the world. The media swooned.

The speech was delivered off a Teleprompter by a man who wasn’t inspiring even when he had better command of his faculties decades ago. It was ungracious, going out of its way to refuse to acknowledge his predecessor’s Operation Warp Speed, the only pandemic response that has worked. And it worked so well: throwing money at private developers and getting rid of regulatory hurdles to do the impossible of obtaining vaccines within a few months.

The dark and depressing speech was reminiscent of Jimmy Carter’s “malaise” talks. He painted a horrible future with threatened future lockdowns if the people didn’t keep following his rules. The best-case scenario, he argued, was that if everyone did what he wanted, he’d let people have very small backyard barbecues with just a few select people on Independence Day.

“Just two to four Independence Day lockdowns to slow the spread!” is not a particularly uplifting sentiment. The Washington Post had claimed earlier this week that Biden was “impregnable” to mockery, but somehow it wasn’t difficult for the two main satirical news sites to do that immediately:

Biden Says If Everyone Is On Their Best Behavior He Might Allow Some Limited Freedoms On July 4https://t.co/qEdIhHrbDV — The Babylon Bee (@TheBabylonBee) March 12, 2021

It was so bad that even The Onion mocked it:

Biden Announces Americans Will Be Able To Do What They Did At Christmas By July 4 https://t.co/zZxbkKFeum pic.twitter.com/cwK06a8Opo — The Onion (@TheOnion) March 12, 2021

And yet. And yet.

See, the White House had asked reporters earlier in the day to spread their preferred messaging that the speech was uplifting, unifying, and hopeful. So they did. Before he gave it, the media dutifully claimed that was what the speech would do. After the speech was over, they reiterated this propaganda talking point, even though the speech was not at all what was promised.

Yes, admittedly, if you were a Democrat activist who was inclined to be encouraging in the face of failure, you might say it was hopeful. Let’s grant that. It reminds me of my favorite line from a friend that the media act like a family trying to help their 3-year-old family member win at Candyland.

It’s embarrassing! Absolutely embarrassing.

The Washington Post’s Dan Diamond wrote, “Another reminder tonight of how Trump failed at a traditional responsibility of being president: soothing the fears of a rattled nation.”

There is nothing soothing about being told that you face further lockdowns, or that you can’t celebrate Independence Day with more than immediate family. The word for that is “depressing,” or “sad,” not “soothing”!

Our media conflate their personal reaction, as Democrats, to politicians with a general reaction to same. It should not be news to people that even the most banal Democrat speeches might alarm folks who do not share their views. And to further blow their minds, they should consider the possibility that GOP speeches absolutely soothe the fears of those who share their views. Yes, even from Donald Trump.

If you think the country is at risk of imploding due to cancel culture, lack of border control, horrific foreign policy decisions going back decades, and bowing down to China – and many of us do – then absolutely a Trump speech is a breath of comforting and soothing fresh air. I know enough people who genuinely get turned off by his rhetoric to know it does not have the same effect on everybody, but let’s not pretend that there aren’t tens of millions of people who responded to his frank speech against the corruption of the elites with exhilaration and comfort. It works both ways, geniuses. The difference is the media.

One Twitter user noted, “Twitter – mean tweets notwithstanding – was Trump’s way of getting around the media filter and talking directly to Americans. Biden cannot exist without the media filter.”

So well put. Biden’s speech without the media filter is unmemorable at best, and depressing at worst. With the media filter, however, it’s supposedly the best speech you’ve ever heard. Here was the analysis from Ryan Lizza, Tara Palmeri, Eugene Daniels, and Rachel Bad, the bright bulbs over at Politico Playbook:

It is hard to imagine any other contemporary politician making the speech JOE BIDEN did Thursday night — both channeling our collective sorrow and reminding us that there is life after grief. The latest in Playbook: https://t.co/jbe90Ob3pf — POLITICO Playbook (@playbookdc) March 12, 2021

“This is what happens when you confuse agenda-driven political messaging with sincerity and empathy. How this isn’t obvious, I have no idea,” wrote one Twitter wag.

The actual article was somehow even worse.

Those are real words put into Politico Playbook, my friends.

Embarrassing, embarrassing, embarrassing.

Goofy Joe Biden as a pastor, is what Ryan Lizza puts forth. It’s what they all put forth, as if you will be forced to buy it with enough repetition. Word to the wise, when you’re copying Jen Rubin, who also describes Biden as the “mourner in chief,” you done messed up A-A-Ron!

AFP correspondent Michael Mathes last month also previewed the talking point that Biden’s horrible familial loss in the early 1970s – something no other politician has experienced, we are led to believe – makes him uniquely able to talk about loss.

AP’s Jonathan Lemire genuinely loves and adores the man whose propaganda he pushes, and it shows. It must be so nice for Biden! When Biden gave a speech last month, Lemire wrote of it: “A president whose own life has been marked by family tragedy, Biden spoke in deeply personal terms, referencing his own losses as he tried to comfort the huge number of Americans whose lives have been forever changed by the pandemic.”

Lemire’s commitment to propaganda is so serious that he also recently lied to a national audience by saying fatal BLM riots that caused $2 billion in damage were peaceful.

“Fact” “checker” Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post pretended to do a “fact” “check” of Biden’s speech on Thursday. This is the guy who said that every one of Trump’s denials related to the false claim that he was a traitor who colluded with Russia – and there were roughly 15,000 of those, probably – were on a list of lies. But somehow his ability to detect lies was so off that he missed the one in the opening lines of the speech!

I have no doubt that Glenn Kessler is a nice guy, but the job of “fact” “checking” the Washington Post’s ally Joe Biden will not rest with anyone so politically biased in his favor. It just won’t.

Propaganda like this even goes a bit far by Soviet standards.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/13/lapdog-corrupt-media-coverage-of-bidens-carteresque-speech-is-embarrassing/,2021-03-13
White House Finally OKs A Biden Interview … With A Former Clinton Aide,"President Joe Biden’s handlers have gone out of their way to keep the media from asking the president questions directly. After weeks of keeping him locked away, they are finally granting an interview to “Good Morning America” co-host and chief ABC news anchor George Stephanopoulos.

Stephanopoulos’s interview will air this Wednesday, marking only the second sit-down network interview with Biden since speaking with CBS’s Norah O’Donnell prior to the Super Bowl.

The president is set to travel this week in order to discuss his administration’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package and will reportedly discuss the plan with Stephanopoulos, among other topics. Last Thursday, Biden gave an address on his administration’s Coronavirus plans — but has yet to deliver a solo press conference in his 54 days in office. Since 1923, all U.S. presidents have held a press conference within the 33-day mark, making Biden the first president in about 100 years to hold off.

In an editorial last week, even The Washington Post declared, “It’s past time for Biden to hold a news conference.”

“Mr. Biden should be eager to advertise his more thoughtful — reality-based approach. He should do so in front of reporters for extended periods of time, and more often than his late start would suggest,” The Post writes.

O’Donnell soft-balled Biden in his first primetime interview on Feb. 7, failing to push the president on the ongoing federal investigations into his son Hunter Biden. The CBS anchor went so far as to say “I’m sorry to get so personal,” making it abundantly clear that her aim of the interview with Biden was not to try and discover new truths about alleged criminal activity within the Biden family.

Stephanopoulos interviewed Biden at a town hall in October. He also failed to ask Biden about the Hunter Biden scandal, particularly the bombshell New York Post report that Big Tech colluded to censor. The report alleged that an email in 2015 from Hunter Biden to Ukrainian energy company Burisma holdings directly mentioned Joe Biden, which was on the heels of the then-nominee claiming he “never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”

#BREAKING: As expected, @ABC News and chief anchor/former Clinton official George Stephanopoulos made sure that there was NOT A SINGLE question about Hunter Biden at this #BidenTownHall. Another example of censorship and collusion. — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) October 16, 2020

Stephanopoulos is known for blurring the line between activist and journalist, getting slammed by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on ABC in January for failing to report on the facts and showing biases.

You’re forgetting who you are as a journalist if you think there’s only one side. You’re inserting yourself into the story to say that I’m a liar because I want to look at election fraud and I want to look at secretaries of state who illegally changed the voter laws without the permission of their state legislatures. That is incontrovertible, it happened, and you can’t just sweep that under the rug and say, ‘Oh nothing to see here and everybody’s a liar and you’re a fool if you bring this up.’

“You’re inserting yourself into the story,” Paul added. “A journalist would hear both sides and there are two sides to this story.”

The ABC anchor notably directed viewers on air to a Democratic fundraising page in December, while speaking to actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the star of HBO’s “VEEP.”

“Tune into GMA Wednesday for my exclusive interview with President Joe Biden as he travels the country to sell his economic relief plan,” Stephanopoulos said on Sunday morning.

The White House may have finally granted access to the president, but with a former Clinton aide asking the questions, Americans should not expect to hear important answers about what the president is doing to address the border crisis or the re-opening of schools.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/15/white-house-finally-oks-a-biden-interview-with-a-former-clinton-aide/,2021-03-15
Biden Echoes 'Believe All Women' On ABC. What About Tara Reade?,"In an exclusive interview with ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos on Tuesday evening, President Joe Biden claimed all sexual assault accusers should be believed. His own accuser, Tara Reade, immediately called out his hypocrisy.

Stephanopoulos asked Biden to comment on the ongoing allegations against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The president said Cuomo “should be prosecuted.”

“Here’s my position,” Biden said. “A woman should be presumed to telling the truth and should not be scapegoated and become victimized by her coming forward.”

EXCLUSIVE: @GStephanopoulos on Gov. Andrew Cuomo: ""If the investigation confirms the claims of the women, should he resign?"" ""Yes,"" Pres. Biden says. ""I think he'll probably end up being prosecuted, too.” https://t.co/a6qfOJ9Byp pic.twitter.com/EiC63wtnUo — ABC News (@ABC) March 17, 2021

After hearing Biden’s “believe all women” sentiment, Reade told The Daily Caller that the president was “using platitudes and lies to cover his own misconduct.”

“Again Biden is using the wolf in sheep clothing pretending to care but meanwhile he used his resources to silence and smear,” Reade also said in April 2020. “He is a predator, not an ally, of women.”

Biden has continued to deny the allegations against him by Reade, a former staffer in 1993 who alleges the then-Delaware senator touched her inappropriately

“I’m saying unequivocally it never, never happened. And it didn’t. It never happened,” Biden said to MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski in May, denying Reade’s allegations. “Women are to be believed, given the benefit of the doubt. If they come forward and say something that they said happen to them, they should start off with the presumption they are telling the truth,” Biden said.

Needless to say, Biden has operated in double-speak since Reade spoke out. So have Democrat politicians, who have adjusted their “believe all women” stance if Biden is part of the equation.

“Well, I have great sympathy for any woman who brings forth an allegation. I’m a big strong supporter of the Me Too Movement. I think it’s been a great contribution to our country,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said last April. “I do support Joe Biden. I’m satisfied with how he responded. I know him, I was proud to endorse him on Monday… So I’m satisfied with that.”

Comparatively, Pelosi said in a 2018 statement that “Failure to postpone this vote without due process and a thorough investigation into these serious and credible allegations would be a dereliction of Congress’ duty to demand zero tolerance of sexual harassment and abuse,” in relation to Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations against then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Bret Kavanaugh.

“I’m sorry that I’m politically inconvenient, but my perpetrator was Joe Biden. And people need to deal with it,” Reade has said.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/17/biden-echoes-believe-all-women-in-abc-interview-but-what-about-tara-reade/,2021-03-17
The Biden Administration Is Imposing A Media Blackout At The Border,"On Wednesday, NBC News reported the Biden administration has imposed what amounts to a media blackout at the southwest border amid a worsening crisis.

Border Patrol agents, including sector chiefs and press officers, are under an unofficial gag order not to answer questions from the press, according to four current and two former Customs and Border Protection officials who spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity.

Federal officials along the border, they say, have been verbally instructed—there is no official memo, no paper-trail—to deny all press requests for ride-alongs and refer all media inquiries, even from local reporters, to Washington. Officials responsible for gathering data about the number of illegal immigrants in federal custody, they say, have been told not to share that information with anyone to prevent possible leaks.

The blackout comes as the Biden administration continues to deny there’s a crisis at the border, even as the number of migrant children detained by CBP soars, overwhelming federal facilities ill-equipped to house and care for minors. As of Sunday, CBP had more than 4,200 minors in custody along the border, a record.

The Department of Homeland Security has not conducted any media tours of several hastily opened shelters for minors, included one in Donna, Texas, that was 729 percent over capacity earlier this month. Lawyers who have been inside these facilities and interviewed migrant children housed there report there is not enough food, bed space, or showers. Many of these minors are being held for much longer than allowed under federal law.

This stands in stark contrast to the Trump administration, which gave press access to these facilities during its controversial family separation policy in June 2018. Likewise, CBP routinely approved press requests for ride-alongs with Border Patrol agents during the Trump administration. But there has not been “a single one since January 20,” when Biden was inaugurated, one federal official told NBC News.

The media blackout at the border also stands in stark contrast to the Biden administration’s empty rhetoric about transparency. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who continues to deny there is a crisis, earlier this month pledged to be transparent with the media on immigration issues but has since denied media access to migrant processing centers, including embedded reporters with congressional delegations that visited the border this week.

Earlier this week, Mayorkas said the United States is on pace to see the largest number of illegal border crossings in 20 years. In February, Border Patrol arrested nearly 97,000 people along the southwest border, and will likely arrest more than 100,000 in March.

Since reporters aren’t allowed to ask Border Patrol or CBP press officers any questions, one of the only places reporters can get information from federal officials is in White House press briefings, where anyone who does ask a question is denigrated by Press Secretary Jen Psaki.

Fox's Kristin Fisher asked Jen Psaki a basic question if there's ""a limit or cap to the number of unaccompanied minors…allowed in,"" but Psaki went low and personal: ""Should we send some kids who are 10 back at a certain point? Is that what you're asking me?"" pic.twitter.com/wzyS9OffgJ — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) March 17, 2021

When Fox’s Kristin Fisher asked Psaki on Wednesday if there was a limit to the number of unaccompanied minors that would be allowed into the country—an entirely fair question, given that on average 565 minors are being apprehended at the border every day—Psaki replied, “Should we send some kids who are 10 back at a certain point? Is that what you’re asking me?”

Biden Is Trying to Hide a Crisis of His Own Making

By every measure, there is a crisis underway at the border—a crisis largely of Biden’s own making, which is why he is trying to suppress information about it. Republicans have frequently pointed to a series of Biden executive orders in January that loosened Trump-era border restrictions and restored Obama-era “catch-and-release” policies. But the foundation for the current crisis was laid long before Biden took office.

During the first Democratic debate—in June 2019, when the last border crisis was in full swing—Biden, in a moment of honesty, said that if he becomes president there should be a “surge to the border,” that “all those people seeking asylum, they deserve to be heard,” and that “if you want to flee and you are fleeing oppression, you should come.”

Flashback: In the first Democratic primary debate, Biden says when he’s president, illegal immigrants should “immediately surge to the border” pic.twitter.com/Fq1vCNEN75 — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) March 17, 2021

Well, they heard him, and they’re coming.

In many ways, messaging is policy for the border. So when Biden and every other Democratic candidate pledged during the primaries to open the southwest border and rescind Trump’s strict immigration and asylum policies, the stage was set for a future border crisis.

The Biden campaign’s messaging mirrored some of his first official actions and orders once in office, confirming for many migrants that the time to come north is now, with a Democrat in the White House who had promised leniency and actually said, on a national stage, “You should come.”

It doesn’t matter what Biden says now. It doesn’t matter that this week he told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, “I can say quite clearly don’t come over,” or that his message to migrants has changed from “you should come” to “don’t leave your town or city or community.” Migrants from Central America to Africa and Asia aren’t listening anymore, they’ve heard enough and are on the move.

In the case of Central Americans seeking asylum, consider the complete naiveté—or dishonesty—of Biden’s remarks to Stephanopoulos. He implored would-be asylum-seekers from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador to wait until the administration has set up a system to hear asylum claims in those countries. “Make your case,” Biden said. “We’ll have people there to determine whether or not you are able to meet the requirement you qualify for asylum. That’s the best way to do this.”

The thing is, the vast majority of asylum claims are ultimately denied, either on procedural grounds or because they otherwise don’t meet the requirements set forth in federal law. Migrants from Central America, who make up the overwhelming majority of those illegally crossing the border and seeking asylum, know this.

Or at least many of them do, because their family members and relatives have been through the process, and many have been deported. Their goal, in many cases, isn’t so much to win an asylum case but to initiate the asylum process, which can drag on for months or years, in order to get into the United States and join family members who are already here.

The idea that all these people will wait in their home countries, often under horrible conditions, in hopes of being among the relatively small number of people who are ultimately granted asylum is Pollyannish in the extreme. It is not a real solution to the problem on our southwest border.

It’s becoming increasingly clear, however, that the Biden administration isn’t interested in any real solutions to the border crisis, and even less interested in transparency about what’s happening on the Rio Grande.

Supreme Court Can Stop Extreme Rules Made In Secret Deals,"Elections have consequences. Abandoning the rule of law should not be one of them. That matters not, though, to the Biden administration, which has abandoned the legally mandated rulemaking process to establish its preferred policies through closed-door settlement agreements with political allies.

To stop the administration from gutting the governing Title X regulations on abortion providers, however, Ohio and a contingency of 18 other states could also stop these shenanigans with a petition now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Will Title X Fund Abortion? Depends on the President

When Congress passed Title X of the Public Health Service Act, it authorized the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to make grants to support “voluntary family planning projects.” The statutory language of Title X, however, expressly prohibited grant funds from “being used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.”

Since its enactment, the HHS regulations swung as if on a pendulum, bouncing from right to left in time with the policy persuasions of the president. Under Ronald Reagan, HHS banned the use of Title X funds for “family planning projects” that counseled or referred women for abortions. The Supreme Court upheld those regulations in 1991, in Rust v. Sullivan.

The Clinton administration’s HHS rescinded those regulations, however, and promulgated rules requiring grantees of Title X to “provide information and counseling regarding abortion.” Those new rules remained in effect until recently, with the HHS in 2019 issuing new regulations that removed the mandate that Title X recipients make abortion referrals and adopting a rule that permits the discussion of abortion so long as “the counselor neither refers for, nor encourages, abortion.”

The 2019 HHS regulations also established new rules designed to “protect against the intentional or unintentional commingling of Title X resources with non-Title X resources of programs,” where the non-Title X resources were used to promote or perform abortions.

The left-leaning American Medical Association (AMA) and a bevy of deep-blue states challenged the 2019 regulations. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the challenge. Conversely, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck the 2019 regulations in a lawsuit brought by the mayor and city council of Baltimore. The AMA sought review of the Ninth Circuit’s decision in the Supreme Court, as did the Trump administration of the contrary decision coming out of the Fourth Circuit.

On February 22, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in both cases and consolidated the appeals. Two weeks later, Ohio, joined by the attorneys general of 18 other states, filed a motion in the Supreme Court seeking leave to intervene in the case as a party to defend the 2019 Title X regulations.

The states’ motion for leave to intervene proved prescient because, after reaching a backroom deal with the parties challenging the 2019 Title X regulations, the Biden administration last Friday filed a pair of joint stipulations to dismiss both appeals.

Biden Refuses to Defend Trump Policies in Court

The Biden administration had previously succeeded with this tactic in the pending Supreme Court appeal over the “public charge” regulations at issue in Dept. of Homeland Security v. New York. That case is about regulations promulgated following the notice-and-comment period by the Department of Homeland Security that interpreted the statutory term “public charge” and provided that foreign citizens did not qualify for permanent residency status if they had used “food stamps, Medicaid, housing vouchers other public benefits.”

While lower courts had struck the Trump administration’s public charge regulations, the Supreme Court, finding the government likely to succeed on the merits of its appeal to the high court, entered an order allowing those regulations to remain in effect. Then on Feb. 22, 2021—the same day the Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the Title X cases — the justices agreed to hear the appeal of the public charge case.

On March 9, 2021, however, the Biden administration and the parties involved entered a joint stipulation to dismiss the appeal, and the Supreme Court dismissed the case the same day. And as Ed Whelan exposed at National Review Online, simultaneously the Biden administration dropped its defense of the “public charge” rules in all the pending appeals.

The Biden administration’s stipulated dismissal of all of the public charge case represented a “significant departure from longstanding practice,” Whelan highlighted. More significantly, the current administration’s approach destroys the protections the Administrative Procedure Act provides.

We Don’t Need No Stinkin’ Laws

The Administrative Procedure Act, or APA, mandates the procedure for rescinding and adopting federal rules that govern the minutia of American life. Notice and comment periods and the courts’ analyses of final regulations to ensure they are not arbitrary and capricious provide at least a minimal protection against rules established by unelected bureaucrats.

The Trump administration’s DHA complied with the APA to promulgate the final public charge rules. Rather than follow the legally mandated requirements for rescinding and replacing those regulations, the Biden administration instead colluded with litigants who opposed the regulations to allow them to be rescinded by the courts instead.

Last Friday, the Biden administration repeated this maneuver, filing a stipulated dismissal of the two Title X appeals. But unlike the public charge case, where the court immediately dismissed the case, the Title X case has yet to be dismissed — and that is likely thanks to Ohio and her sister states seeking to intervene as parties.

Private Groups Taking Up the Fight

The same day the Biden administration filed the stipulated motion to dismiss, a second motion to intervene also hit the Supreme Court docket. This group, represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, consists of the American Association of Pro-life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Christian Medical and Dental Associations, and the Catholic Medical Association.

Whether the Supreme Court will grant the motions to intervene is unclear, but the briefs present strong arguments in favor of intervention. Ohio, for instance, received millions of extra dollars in funding under Title X as a result of the 2019 regulations. The second set of would-be intervenors likewise have a strong argument for standing based on their desire to participate in Title X without being forced to counsel women about abortion — something the prior regulations required.

How the Supreme Court resolves the competing motions in the Title X case will prove significant much beyond Title X.

How the Supreme Court resolves the competing motions in the Title X case will prove significant much beyond Title X, as the Biden administration appears poised to weaponize this strategy, with “regulation” of CO2 emissions likely the next target.

As the Wall Street Journal revealed yesterday, it won’t be through the normal APA regulatory process that climate activists seek to cap CO2 emissions. Rather, as emails between Democratic attorneys general and a former Obama official obtained by the Wall Street Journal reveal, the strategy is to tighten ozone standards so much that states must in effect reduce CO2 emissions.

From the lawsuit filed on Jan. 19, 2021, by the Democratic attorneys general from 16 states challenging the Environmental Protection Agency’s ozone regulations, it appears the strategy as executed in the public charge and Title X arenas will be used again. Namely, rather than await new regulations under the APA, the Biden administration will negotiate with friendly foes and then enter a stipulated settlement agreement that strikes the currently governing regulations.

Should the Supreme Court grant the motions to intervene in the Title X case, there will at least be some check on these backroom and backdoor deals. But we should not need states and private parties to police the executive branch. President Biden won the election, and his administration remains free to advance his preferred policy objectives — but he must do so consistent with the legal mandates of the APA.

Joe Biden Is Our Geriatric President And He Should Embrace It,"President Joe Biden took more than one tumble on the stairs of Air Force One Friday morning, falls which his administration chalked up to the wind.

Not only did this incident spark a barrage of memes, videos, and other humorous content mocking Biden’s fall and shed light on the corporate media’s continuos and ridiculously biased approach to covering Democrats, it also reinforced questions about the supposedly most powerful person in the country’s ability to complete relatively simple tasks.

I genuinely feel bad for Biden. He’s an elderly man who probably experienced all of the physical and emotional pain and embarrassment that comes with falling on live television not once, not twice, but three times. Biden’s most recent stumble, however, seems to indicate that the 78-year-old might be better off embracing his age and chilling in a recliner for most of the day instead of trying to govern a nation.

For one, Biden already has plenty of experience staying home and out of sight. During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden opted to stay at home for most of the year instead of hitting the trail and traveling around the nation like his opponent former President Donald Trump, who held 86 rallies compared to Biden’s 53.

Biden’s campaign also repeatedly ended the candidate’s day early and often, issuing lids just a few hours into the workday. This laidback schedule extended into the Democrat’s tenure in the White House, which he spent two months in before his administration announced that an official presidential press conference.

This gave Biden approximately nine weeks to relax, issue an onslaught of executive orders trampling on biological sex, border security, and other important issues, and prepare to avoid any verbal gaffes or slip-ups like forgetting the name of his defense secretary.

Biden could also embrace his age by leaning into his role as grandfather to multiple grandchildren, including the one his son Hunter refused to claim and financially support until a paternity test showed that he was, in fact, the father. If Biden takes some time off and lets his eager, younger Vice President Kamala Harris take over, he’ll have more opportunities to play Mario Kart with his 26-year-old granddaughter Naomi Biden, hopefully choosing a better character to play as instead of the second-rate brother, Luigi. Instead of sitting in the driver’s seat of a gaffe machine intent on reversing the Trump administration’s policies protecting women, babies, the border faster than Mario Kart’s last lap music, maybe Biden would be better off driving on Rainbow Road.

And after calling a lid on his screen time and hanging out with his grandkids, if he can remember them, Biden can curl up in the aforementioned recliner with his “sweet,” but secret-service biting dog Major Biden, a bowl of his favorite ice cream, and babble long, winding, rambly stories about “Kamala’s wife,” “trunalimunumaprzure,” and his time in the Senate, which he said he was still running for in 2020, to whoever chooses to listen.

For his own safety and sanity, Biden should consider taking a very, very, very careful step back and welcoming his place, position, and duty as a senior citizen in America with open arms far away from breezes.

3 Key Takeaways From The U.S.-China Summit In Alaska,"The Biden administration’s first high-level meeting with Communist China in Anchorage, Alaska, last week opened with a war of words, then closed with nothing meaningful to show in the end. Still, there are some critical takeaways from this important summit.

1. Diplomacy Is Political Theater for Domestic Audiences

The traditional understanding of diplomacy is that through dialogue and negotiations, countries seek to influence each other’s behaviors to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome while avoiding war. Diplomats are not soldiers. Therefore, when diplomats speak, especially in front of a camera, their tone tends to be measured, and their words tend to be vague. They generally avoid insulting the other side publicly, to leave room for negotiation and compromise.

The Chinese delegation’s behavior, however, broke this diplomatic norm. Even though China agreed to the summit schedule in advance, including a four-minute opening statement, Yang Jiechi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Chinese delegation lead, ignored the schedule by speaking for more than 15 minutes.

He filled his long remark with insults to the United States, including insisting that the United States “does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength. The U.S. side was not even qualified to say such things even 20 years or 30 years back.” Yang’s contempt for the U.S. delegation and the nation they represent couldn’t have been more obvious.

Yang’s offensive words, his tone, and his attitude were all part of a performance meant for the audience back home, including his boss, the CCP’s leader Xi Jinping. Ever since he came to power, Xi has presented himself as the strongman China needs and the only one who will “return” China to its former glory. Xi unleashed a group of Chinese “wolf” diplomats to show Chinese people that his government knew how to stand up to those western powers that “humiliated” China in the past.

These Chinese “wolf” diplomats often break diplomatic protocols by acting aggressively and making offensive remarks to threaten human rights activists, journalists, and even government officials. They are combative and treat every criticism of China, no matter how legitimate it is, as a mortal threat to the longevity of the CCP’s rule in China.

They exploit Western social media’s openness by promoting CCP propaganda and spreading misinformation and conspiracies while suffering no consequences. Understandably, these “wolf” diplomats haven’t won many friends for China internationally, but they help Xi solidify his popularity among the growing Chinese nationalists.

Yang’s disdain of the United States in Alaska in front of the worldwide press served two purposes at home. First, it pleased Chinese nationalists. Yang’s condescending remarks were widely reported in China. The Global Times, a Chinese state media that often speaks on behalf of China’s nationalist movement, praised Yang for teaching the United States a good lesson by refuting the U.S. “arrogance in public.”

Second, many suspect Yang did what he did to benefit his career. Yang is part of Politburo, a 25-person decision-body of the CCP. But the CCP and China’s real power lies with Politburo’s Standing Committee, which is led by Xi and has only six other members. Yang’s performance in Alaska will undoubtedly burnish his nationalist image, win further favors from his boss Xi, and lay the groundwork for Yang’s possible elevation to the Standing Committee.

2. Communist China Employs U.S. Left’s Rhetoric to Attack America

During his long remarks, Yang often employed rhetoric from the American left to attack America. He lectured American diplomats on democracy, stating, “Many people within the United States actually have little confidence in the democracy of the United States, and they have various views regarding the government of the United States.”

On the topic of human rights, Yang claimed it is the United States, not China, that needs to improve.

“The fact is that there are many problems within the United States regarding human rights, which is admitted by the United States itself as well … the challenges facing the United States in human rights are deep-seated. They did not just emerge over the past four years, such as Black Lives Matter,” he said.

In a recent editorial about the Alaska summit, China’s Global Times claimed: “everything Washington talks about is centered on the US and on white supremacy.” U.S. adversaries have long regarded race divisions as a soft underbelly of the United States and have exploited it to undermine the United States’s global leadership and sow self-doubt and division among Americans.

What’s more challenging today than the Cold War between the United States and the former Soviet Union is that the American left has gone beyond simply criticizing America’s imperfections. Today’s extreme leftist rhetoric condemns America’s founding and its founding principles. American people have been told that America is fundamentally and irredeemably racist, that the United States is a nation founded on white supremacy and white nationalism, and a country that has always oppressed people of color because of “systemic racism.”

This rhetoric ignores the universal appeal of our nation’s founding principles, including the progress our country has made toward achieving equality and liberty for all, the fact that we’re the most diverse and welcoming nation on this planet, and that millions of U.S. immigrants still believe in the American dream.

Unfortunately, the Biden administration has accepted the American left’s rhetoric as truth, has repeated this rhetoric in many official capacities, and lets it drive policy decisions. Therefore, when Yang used this rhetoric to attack the United States at the Alaska Summit, both National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave weak responses.

Joel Pollak, editor-at-large of Breitbart News, tweeted “Biden’s team is learning a hard lesson here: when you spend years talking about how awful America is, how we suffer from ‘systemic racism,’ blah blah, it undermines our standing on the world stage. Moral self-confidence is a strategic asset.” We cannot expect U.S. officials to defend America forcefully on the international stage if they don’t have moral confidence in our country.

3. The Biden Administration’s China Policy Lacks Clarity

The great power competition between the United States and China should be one of the Biden administration’s highest priorities. Yet it has been three months since Biden was sworn into office, and there is no clarity on what his China policy is. As a presidential candidate and now as the president, when asked about his China policy Biden’s answer has always been that he will “work with allies.”

Both Sullivan and Blinken reiterated the same point at the Alaska summit. But “working with allies” is not a strategy. It is, at best, a means to achieve strategic goals. Sometimes it is not even a reliable means because some allies are not reliable.

For example, the European Union signed in principle a comprehensive investment deal with China last December, despite the incoming Biden administration’s concerns. Sullivan urged the Europeans to delay the agreement’s signing and request a consultation with the United States.

The Biden administration hoped the United States would work with the EU to counter Communist China’s aggression at home and abroad. But the EU chose a different path because it couldn’t resist China’s mass consumer market. If “working with allies” is a strategy, it failed at its first test.

Biden’s insinuation Trump failed to “work with allies” is also unfair. Biden held his first meeting with leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a strategic alliance created to counter China’s aggression in the Indo-pacific region, also known as the Quad. Former President Trump enjoyed good relationships with Quad member states Australia, India, and Japan.

By working with these allies, the Trump administration made a historic breakthrough in the Middle East peace process by facilitating several peace deals between Israel and a few Arab nations, an accomplishment many previous U.S. administrations aspired to but failed to achieve.

To protect our national interests and preserve world peace, the Biden administration should try to build upon where Trump’s foreign policy succeeded rather than abandoning these policies out of contempt for Trump.

Xi is clear about what he wants. He wants to establish a new Sino-centric world order, replacing the liberal world. But the lack of clarity in Biden’s China policy makes America vulnerable to China’s attack.

American people deserve to know: besides providing China’s “wolf” diplomats with a world stage to insult U.S. diplomats, what did the Biden administration accomplish at the Alaska summit? The longer it takes for the Biden administration to clarify its China policy, the more it will endanger our national security while strengthening Communist China’s hand.

The United States may lose even more allies and partners to China as a result. The Biden administration should do its best to avoid such outcomes.

‘Science Is Back’ With Joe Biden? Here Are 7 Things That Say It’s Not,"With the dawn of his administration, President Joe Biden ushered in a new era of norms, civility, and, most importantly, science. That’s right, No. 46 has brought us out of our anti-science Neanderthal thinking and into the glorious light.

“Science is back,” Biden announced while visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta on Friday. No, really, “all kidding aside.”

""Science is back,"" President Biden says while visiting CDC headquarters after his admin. administered 100,000,000 vaccines. ""When we have a crisis, you're prepared to meet it, because you speak truth and science to power."" pic.twitter.com/0d6wBS13uy — MSNBC (@MSNBC) March 19, 2021

Biden can tout “science” all he’d like, but the policies at the forefront of his administration would like a word. Here are seven proofs that science is absolutely not back.

1. Transgender Person at the Helm of Public Health

Perhaps nothing displays Biden’s commitment to science quite like his nomination of Rachel Levine to be assistant health secretary. Levine, who is currently the secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Health, royally botched the state’s COVID-19 response, removing an elderly family member from a care facility while relegating others to the veritable Wuhan virus Petri dishes.

Worse than Levine’s failures as a state health secretary, however, is the fact that Biden’s pick to be assistant science czar is the living embodiment of science denial. Levine, born a biological man, is transgender, having transitioned in 2011.

2. The Anti-Equality ‘Equality’ Act

In that vein, let’s talk about the so-called Equality Act, which the Biden administration has long championed. A far cry from making anything more equal, this proposed amendment to the Civil Rights Act would effectively end girls’ sports and eradicate safe spaces for women. It does this by denying science.

Instead of just sex-based (and thus science-based) protections, which would largely become moot under the Equality Act framework, this legislation seeks to include arbitrary anti-discrimination laws on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

Scientists agree that “gender identity can be very ephemeral,” independent journalist and author Abigail Shrier noted during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week, but if this legislation is passed, it would be “impossible ever to legally distinguish between a woman and a biological male who claims a female identity.”

3. Double Masking While Vaccinated

Nothing promotes vaccine hesitancy quite like watching the leader of the free world, who has been fully vaccinated, and his top health cronies parade around in not just one, but two masks.

He's been vaccinated for months now. His actions are anti-science and undermine the fight against the virus. The president needs to be communicating to the public that the vaccine works. https://t.co/lizio9ZOjt — Noah Pollak (@NoahPollak) March 9, 2021

“That’s the opposite of the message we ought to be sending and it’s the opposite of the message politicians ought to be sending,” Federalist publisher Ben Domenech said on Fox News this month, following GOP Sen. Rand Paul using science to throw wannabe god Anthony Fauci around like a little rag doll during his Senate committee testimony. “Virtually all of them that you see on your TV cameras have been vaccinated. They are not going to be transmitting this disease, they are not going to be vulnerable to it anymore.”

4. No Life Until Birth, Apparently

Despite the stores of evidence demonstrating human life begins at conception, Biden and his vice president have long maintained their support for abortion long before a baby can feel pain or takes its first breath outside the womb, in defiance of science.

While the Sacramento Bee said the claim that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris support taxpayer-funded late-term abortion until the moment of birth “exaggerated,” the duo’s record on the issue suggests otherwise.

Not only did the Biden administration reaffirm its commitment to the barbaric practice immediately after taking office by rescinding the Mexico City policy, effectively ordering Americans to fund abortions overseas with their tax dollars, Biden also nominated pro-abortion extremist Xavier Becerra, who has since been confirmed, to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Another of Biden’s nominees believes abortion is necessary for “racial justice.” This is the same Biden who waffled on the Hyde Amendment, signaling support for taxpayer-funded abortion here in the United States.

Earlier this month, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said it has been Biden’s “consistent belief” that Roe v. Wade “should be law,” a common refrain from Democrats that would ultimately, analysts say, take power away from states and give it to the federal government to ensure women could obtain abortions until birth for any reason around the whole country.

Harris has a perfect score from the pro-abortion group NARAL Pro-Choice America. She voted no on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would have prevented abortions after 20 weeks gestation, by which point, if not earlier, the science shows babies can feel pain in the womb. Harris also voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would have required appropriate medical care for any baby who survives an abortion attempt and would have established criminal penalties for health-care workers who violated that standard of care.

5. Biden’s Border Superspreader

While the Biden administration has maintained that “even after you’re vaccinated, social distancing, wearing masks are going to be essential,” they have dismissed the COVID superspreading potential of the crisis on the southern border.

The Biden Administration is recklessly releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants who have COVID into Texas communities. The Biden Admin. must IMMEDIATELY end this callous act that exposes Texans & Americans to COVID. — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) March 3, 2021

According to U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, 108 migrants released from just one Gulf Coast city during the month of February were COVID-19-positive. As migrants surge across the southern border, many are in shelters or custody only briefly before dispersing throughout the United States to connect with relatives or friends.

“They tested some of the people who got put at the bus station in Brownsville and according to the rapid tests, about 108 tested positive,” Cuellar said. “So basically that creates a situation that they are letting people who are positive (for coronavirus) get on buses and with the permission of Homeland Security they can go anywhere in the United States.”

A Brownsville spokesman confirmed that number to Border Report and said that while some nonprofit organizations have provided hotel rooms for COVID-positive migrants to quarantine, the city can’t prevent them from traveling because the Department of Homeland Security has issued documents to them that allow them to travel north into the rest of the United States.

“We let them know and we guide them with CDC guidelines and explain to them that it’s really important that they isolate and quarantine, but I want to make clear that we can’t contain them. We can’t stop them,” the spokesman said.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the Biden administration’s policies allowing COVID-positive illegal immigrants to infiltrate the United States “unconscionable.”

6. School Out of Session

While the science has consistently suggested remarkably low fatality rates among school-aged children and even shows children contribute very little to community transmission rates, the Biden administration has completely fumbled messaging on school reopening, proving their devotion is much more to teachers unions than to following the science.

After getting intense flak for its goal of only requiring half of the country’s children to return to in-person schooling for a minimum of one day a week by Biden’s 100th day in office, meaning students getting back into classrooms for only five or six days in total would meet the goal, the administration flip-flopped. The science hadn’t changed, just the amount of bad press.

Psaki then switched the “goal,” saying, “The president will not rest until every school is open five days a week.” The vice president also flubbed her way through articulating a school reopening plan, checking science at the door.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky even admitted the agency catered to anti-science teachers unions with its guidelines for school reopening.

“We have conducted an in-depth review of the available science and evidence base to guide our recommendations, and we have also engaged with many education and public-health partners to hear firsthand from parents and teachers directly about their experiences and concerns,” Walensky said, noting that input from these people who stalled school reopenings across the country resulted in “direct changes to the guidance.”

7. No Fracking Way

Over and over, Biden and Harris have exchanged science for stump speeches about the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the State Department finding numerous times that the Keystone Pipeline would not have a material effect on greenhouse gas emissions, environmental groups have aggressively opposed the project, and the Biden administration capitulated, putting the kibosh on it during his first days in office.

According to the American Petroleum Institue, anti-fossil fuel policies like Biden’s would “shift to foreign sources, cost nearly one million American jobs, increase CO 2 emissions and reduce revenue that funds education and key conservation programs.”

While Biden and Harris have repeatedly denied that they oppose fracking, their record on the issue is clear. “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,” Harris declared at a town hall in 2019 during her campaign for president. There’s more where that came from:

SUPERCUT: Biden promises ""no more"" fracking if he's elected President. pic.twitter.com/iWcsU2Yam8 — Abigail Marone 🇺🇸 (@abigailmarone) August 31, 2020

Saying “science is back” means very little coming from a vaccinated person in a double mask whose leadership has resulted in science denial at every turn.

Sleepy Joe Biden Hosts The Most Awkward Press Conference Of All Time,"I hope you enjoyed your popcorn, folks. 78-year-old President Joe Biden temporarily left the basement, and it sure wasn’t pretty.

On Thursday, Biden delivered the first press conference in all of the 64 days of his presidency. In one hour, the president spoke to a 25 reporter-capped press pool about the ongoing migrant crisis at the southern border, gun control in the wake of the Atlanta and Colorado shootings, relations with China, the filibuster, running for president in 2024, and other topics.

The president side-stepped on nearly every topic, more focused on concluding the presser as soon as possible than providing substantive answers. It was predominantly a Democratic lovefest, with PBS White House reporter Yamiche Alcindor asking Biden at one point if he is too “moral” and “decent.”

The 64-day mark makes Biden the first president since 1932 to not hold a solo press conference in the first 43 days of his presidency. Donald Trump held a conference 27 days in, and Barack Obama did so only 20 days in.

Biden Press Secretary Jen Psaki appeared particularly unaware of how historically significant this is. Psaki claimed in January that the administration was “bringing truth and transparency back to the briefing room” and “rebuilding trust with the American people.” Breaking a 100-year precedent was a funny way of doing so.

The president did not call on any conservative reporters. Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy—who frequently questions Psaki—was not provided the opportunity to probe. Reporters from Associated Press, PBS, The Washington Post, ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, CNN, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg News, and Univision all got their turn to pander.

On March 19, Biden fell three consecutive times walking up the stairs of Air Force One. It was sad. Truly, one can only feel bad for the elderly and frail man we now have to call the president. Nonetheless, this notable event—along with a whole other swath of topics—such as the bombshell Politico story published on Hunter Biden, or the failed reopening of schools and the country, were not even broached. Biden was not challenged, but caressed and fondled by the morally bankrupt media.

Biden’s fall makes perfect sense in light of his gobbledygook performance in the presser. At one point, the president refused to answer a question from CNN Chief White House Correspondent Kaitlan Collins on whether he will eliminate the filibuster.

“I answered your question,” Biden mumbled, after verifiably not doing so, slumping off into an all-too-familiar gaffe. Prior to Collins standing up to ask one of her two questions, Biden said, “that counts as a question,” laughing awkwardly and thus demonstrating he was taking all steps possible to avoid being held accountable.

The president chuckled at uncomfortable questions. “C’mon!” he said to Cecelia Vega of ABC News, smirking when pushed on the surge in minors being held near the border. Biden likewise chuckled when NBC’s Kristen Welker asked about both Biden’s repealing of Trump policies to deter illegal immigration and North Korea’s launching of two ballistic missiles into the sea of Japan.

His voice rose and fell at the drop of a hat. He started talking about “computer chips” when CBS’s Nancy Cordes asked him about his fractured relationship with Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky—but soon after moved on to rambling about God knows what.

“I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you, if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to, anyway,” Biden sputtered to Yamiche Alcindor on the filibuster.

Biden operated in an awkward hostility all throughout. He seemed shocked that the press—his leftist comrades—would have the nerve to ask him any questions at all, even if they were by no means challenging. They were soft-balls. But for a president in apparent cognitive decline, they did not appear so. The pauses between his answers were only worsened by the fact that the questions were so very straightforward and easy for him if he could only remember what the questions were.

By the end of the cringe-worthy hour, it was time for Biden to pack up ship and be shuttered away in the basement again by his top aides. Psaki eyed him in the corner, taking notes on a pad. Biden checked his $9,650 Rolex near the end to ensure things were wrapping up nicely.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/26/a-sleepy-joe-biden-hosts-the-most-awkward-press-conference-of-all-time/,2021-03-26
"Mr. President, Most Gun Owners Aren’t As Reckless As Hunter Biden","Although President Joe Biden would rather monologue about infrastructure than talk about this and Kamala Harris will deny it, a power-hungry Biden administration in cahoots with a Democrat-controlled Congress is working hard to enact sweeping gun control. Capitalizing on tragic shootings, this administration is bypassing Second Amendment infringement and has opted instead to just stomp it right out.

During his first press conference more than two full months into office, Biden briefly promised gun control. Immediately before changing the subject to something as non-polarizing as bridges and roads, Biden replied to a question about whether he would pursue gun control, including through executive action, saying he would do “all of the above. It’s a matter of timing.”

Vice President Kamala Harris just this week said no one is “trying to come after your guns.” “Stop pushing the false choice that this means everybody’s trying to come after your guns,” Harris said. “That is not what we’re talking about.”

But in the right setting, the Biden-Harris duo has eagerly pledged their commitment to sweeping gun control. Biden is presently urging lawmakers to pass a federal ban on what he calls “assault weapons,” which the left usually says to mean semi-automatic guns, which are among the most popular firearms.

In 2018, civilians owned 16 million of these modern sporting rifles, meaning legislation like this would limiting gun access for hordes of law-abiding Americans. Biden has also pressed Congress to ban certain kinds of magazines.

During a presidential primary debate in 2019, Harris said she would use executive power if Congress didn’t do her bidding. The now-vice president has advocated for banning imports of AR-15s, implementing universal background checks (a move Biden is pushing for now), banning semi-automatic rifles, repealing gun manufacturer immunity, banning high-capacity magazines, and prohibiting those convicted of a federal hate crime from purchasing guns. These measures would gut the Second Amendment.

Where’s Hunter’s Gun?

As Democrats forge ahead with these efforts, a bizarre story surfaced on Thursday in the pages of Politico regarding a gun, a trash can, and a scandal-ridden Biden family.

The story begins in 2018 with Hallie Biden, widow of the late Beau Biden and then-girlfriend of his brother Hunter Biden, allegedly rummaging through Hunter’s truck due to “suspicions she had,” then finding and subsequently dumping his .38 revolver in a trash can behind a grocery store.

When Hallie later returned to the store to recover the gun, as Hunter had directed her to do, it was nowhere to be found. Hallie told the grocery store about the missing gun, and the manager called the police, which then arrived to question the couple.

Things only got weirder from there. The missing gun was particularly worrisome because the grocer was located right across the street from a high school, prompting fears that it could be used in a crime. While police were questioning Hunter, he also appeared to racially profile two Mexican grocery store employees, telling officers they were “prolly illegal.”

Soon after police and the FBI — which was then looking into Hunter for potential tax crimes, an investigation that is ongoing — arrived at the grocery store, two Secret Service agents with “badges and identification cards” reportedly paid a visit to the gun store where Hunter bought the firearm earlier that month and told the owner to turn over the Firearms Transaction Record from the purchase.

The store owner “suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” according to multiple people with a “firsthand knowledge of the episode.” So he held onto the paperwork until the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the agency authorized to review the forms, could get to them. Both the Secret Service and the White House denied involvement.

It also appears Hunter might have lied on his federal background check form. Joe Biden’s son’s history of drug use is well-known. In fact, he’s scheduled to release a tell-all memoir about it next month.

In 2003, 2010, and 2014, soon after being discharged from the military for using cocaine, Hunter was in drug and alcohol rehab programs. His infamous laptop dropped off for repairs in 2019, which the media and tech giants aggressively tried to cover up during the conclusion of his father’s 2020 presidential election cycle, included graphic photos and video of Hunter allegedly smoking crack cocaine while engaged in a sex act.

Despite this troubling record, Hunter answered “no” to a question on the Firearms Transaction Record asking if he was an “unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.” While lying on this form would have been considered a felony, Hunter was never investigated over his answer.

Most People Aren’t Hunter Biden

There’s so much to unpack there — from Hunter accusing brown people of being illegals, to maybe lying about drug abuse on a government form, to the Secret Service cleaning up Biden family messes. It’s all a highly suspicious circus.

But at the heart of the story is a well-connected person with a sketchy track record getting past a background check (maybe by lying), obtaining a revolver, and somehow losing it in a trash can next to a high school. Remember, this person is the son of President Joe Biden, the same one who doesn’t want law-abiding Americans to have guns he doesn’t like.

That revolver could have been used to shoot up the high school. Thankfully it was not (apparently it had been found by an older man who was rummaging through the trash for recyclables). But if it had been, no amount of the Biden administration’s gun-control efforts would have stopped it.

A check on Hunter revealed nothing of substance nor any consequences if he had indeed lied to the federal government on the form. Nor does an “assault weapons” ban apply to a .38 revolver. And no amount of gun control measures would have stopped the reckless Biden duo from losing a firearm in a grocery store trash can where any rando could find it.

Alas, just like our current first family, Democrats’ gun-control proposals rarely if ever operate within the realm of reality or common sense. Repealing manufacturer liability wouldn’t protect victims of gun violence any more than Democrats’ Justice in Policing Act would have protected George Floyd. It’s all theater.

Maybe Biden family gun use is all the president knows about firearms. We’re talking about the same Biden who called them “AR-14s,” after all. But Biden, Harris, and their gun-grabbing friends in Congress would do well to realize that most gun owners aren’t lying on background check forms and dumping our firearms willy-nilly in trash cans by schools. Even if we were, none of Biden’s anti-gun pipe dreams would stop us.

READ: The Gun Background Check Form Where Hunter Biden Claimed He Wasn’t Using Drugs,"Hunter Biden was the subject of a strange missing firearm case in 2018 after Hallie Biden, the wife of his late brother and subsequently Hunter’s girlfriend, tossed it into a trash can behind a grocery store near a high school, according to a strange new report from Politico. It appears Hunter, the son of President Joe Biden, might have lied on the federal forms he filled out to purchase the gun a few months prior, forms The Federalist has now obtained.

Hunter answered “no” to a question on the Firearms Transaction Record asking whether he was an “unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.” See question 11.e on the form below:

Hunter Biden 4473 Form 1 Redacted by The Federalist on Scribd

Hunter Biden 4473 Form 2 Redacted by The Federalist on Scribd

Hunter’s history of drug use is well-known, and he’s scheduled to release a tell-all memoir about it in April. His lifestyle contributed to his divorce from his wife Kathleen in 2017. Hunter “created financial concerns for the family by spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations), while leaving the family with no funds to pay legitimate bills,” his ex-wife said in the divorce filing.

The now-president’s scandal-ridden son was in numerous drug and alcohol rehab programs, including in 2003, 2010, and 2014, soon after being discharged from the military for using cocaine. According to the New Yorker, he also went on a cocaine binge in 2016. His infamous laptop he dropped off for repairs in 2019, a story which tech giants and the media aggressively tried to cover up during the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, included graphic photos and video of Hunter allegedly smoking crack cocaine while engaged in a sex act.

It’s unclear whether Hunter was using drugs around the time of his firearm purchase or what timeframe the question “are you a user of” illicit substances implies. Hunter was, however, suspected of smoking crack cocaine in a Washington, D.C., strip club in late 2018. He purchased the firearm the same year on Oct. 12.

The alleged incident occurred just blocks from the White House at Archibald’s Gentleman’s Club, where Hunter spent thousands of dollars on multiple visits. One security worker at the club said Hunter was a regular who would hole up in a VIP room, but the club’s managing partner James Ritter said one night in late 2018 included a “suspicion of drug use.”

“There was a smell of burning Styrofoam in the VIP room. We told him nothing illegal can go on here,” Ritter told Page Six. “We didn’t see anything illegal. After he was spoken to, the smell stopped.”

“VIP employees suspected it was crack,” Ritter added.

While the club typically required patrons to pay with credit cards that matched official IDs, Ritter said “Hunter was a bit of an exception” and would pay “thousands and thousands of dollars in the Archibald’s VIP rooms” with “credit cards that didn’t have his name on it.”

Now newly uncovered text messages that appear to be from Hunter Biden not only corroborate Politico’s reporting that the Secret Service got involved in the missing gun incident, ostensibly to cover up the Biden family mess, an involvement both the Secret Service and the White House have denied, but they also include mention of drug use in connection with the gun fiasco.

“She stole the gun out of my truck lock box and threw it in a garbage can full to the top at Jansens. Then told me it was my problem to deal with. Then when the police the FBI the secret service came on the scene she said she took it from me because she was scared I would harm myself due to my drug and alcohol problem and our volatile relationship and that she was afraid for the kids,” the message reads.

While lying on the gun purchase form would have been considered a felony, Hunter was never investigated over his answer.

Meanwhile, President Biden is in the process of choosing a new director for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), a confirmation that could be imperiled over the news of his son’s 2018 gun purchase and subsequent missing firearms case, a case that involved more problems than Hunter’s potential lying on background check forms.

The grocery store where Hallie Biden dumped the gun was across from a high school, which made the case particularly worrisome and prompted fears that the firearm could be used in a crime. While police were questioning Hunter, he also appeared to racially profile two Mexican grocery store employees, telling officers they were “prolly illegal.”

Shortly after police and the FBI — which was then looking into the Biden for potential tax crimes, an investigation that is still ongoing — arrived at the grocery store, two Secret Service agents with “badges and identification cards” reportedly visited the gun store where Hunter bought the firearm earlier that month and told the owner to turn over the Firearms Transaction Record, the document included above, from the purchase.

The store owner “suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” according to multiple people with a “firsthand knowledge of the episode.” So he held onto the paperwork until the ATF, the agency authorized to review the forms, could get to them.

Meanwhile, despite his own son’s irresponsibility with firearms, a recklessness most American gun owners don’t share, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris continue to pressure lawmakers to pass sweeping gun control legislation and have both threatened to take executive action if Congress doesn’t do their bidding.

As Biden prepares to nominate someone to head up the ATF, Republican senators will have plenty of important questions to ask during a confirmation hearing, such as whether the nominee will commit to using the ATF, which is a federal law enforcement organization, to investigate Hunter’s potential fraud on his Firearms Transaction Record — or whether, instead, like the reported incident with the Secret Service, the Biden nominee would continue to cover up Biden family scandals.

Senators Demand Secret Service Details In Hunter Biden Gun Scandal,"Two Republican lawmakers sent a letter to the head of Secret Service on Thursday demanding records of the agency’s involvement in the case of Hunter Biden’s missing firearm in late 2018, a story Politico reported last week.

“In light of the recent press report, please provide all records relating to your agency’s involvement in the alleged October 2018 incident with respect to Hunter Biden’s firearm no later than April 8, 2021,” wrote GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin on March 25.

The report to which the senators are referring is a bizarre story about a .38 revolver Hunter Biden purchased in late 2018 that Hallie Biden, Hunter’s love interest and the wife of his late brother Beau Biden, says she disposed of in a trash can behind a grocery store and across from a school after having discovered the firearm while rifling through Hunter’s truck over her “suspicions” of him.

In what appears to be a text message sent by Hunter, he acknowledged these suspicions, saying Hallie “stole the gun out of my truck lock box … because she was scared I would harm myself due to my drug and alcohol problem and our volatile relationship and that she was afraid for the kids.”

BREAKING: Text message from Hunter Biden confirms involvement of Secret Service in his illegal firearm incident pic.twitter.com/1vb8GGJidX — AmericaFest Poso (@JackPosobiec) March 26, 2021

The same text includes the concession that the police, the FBI, and the Secret Service were all involved after the incident, involvement the Secret Service has denied but the two Republican senators are now looking into.

“One law enforcement official said that at the time of the incident, individual Secret Service agents at the agency’s offices in Wilmington, Del., and Philadelphia kept an informal hand in maintaining the former vice president’s security,” Politico reported. “The person cited an instance in 2019 when the Wilmington office of the Secret Service called the Delaware State Police to arrange security for a public appearance by Biden.”

According to Politico, soon afterward police and the FBI — which was also looking into the Biden for potential tax crimes, an investigation that is still ongoing — arrived at the grocer because when Hallie later returned to retrieve the gun, it was gone. Then two Secret Service agents with “badges and identification cards” reportedly visited the gun store where Hunter had bought the revolver earlier that month. The agents reportedly told the owner to turn over the Firearms Transaction Record from the purchase.

The store owner “suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” according to multiple people with a “firsthand knowledge of the episode.” So he kept possession of the paperwork until the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the agency authorized to review the forms, could get to them.

“Any involvement by the Secret Service on behalf of the Biden family or on its own initiative would be inappropriate interference in an incident that was already being investigated by Delaware State Police with the involvement of the FBI, according to law enforcement officials,” Politico reported.

A spokesman for Secret Service has said the agency does not have a record of involvement in the ordeal. “U.S. Secret Service records confirm that the agency did not provide protection to any member of the Biden family in 2018, and that the Secret Service had no involvement in this alleged incident,” the agency said. If that’s true, it could indicate Secret Service officers were appearing to act in their official capacity when they were not authorized to do so.

If Secret Service was instead secretly keeping a hand in Biden family security and affairs at that time, Grassley and Johnson said the agency “must explain to Congress why such informal actions were taken and whether they were necessary in light of the circumstances.”

“Further, [Secret Service] failed to fully respond to our October 20, 2020, letter relating to emails that reference travel plans for Hunter Biden involving [Secret Service] agents one year after Hunter Biden’s protection ended,” the two Republican lawmakers said. “We continue to expect a complete response to that letter and ask that you produce all requested records no later than April 8, 2021.”

Grassley and Johnson’s impulse to investigate the latest Hunter Biden drama is one that other GOP senators should adopt in the days ahead. President Joe Biden is expected to nominate someone to be director of the ATF, the federal law enforcement organization within the Department of Justice that oversees the forms Hunter Biden filled out to purchase the gun. This nomination would require a Senate confirmation.

It appears likely that Hunter Biden lied on the federal background check form, answering “no” to whether he used numerous illicit drugs. Hunter’s history of drug abuse is well-known and led to many bouts of rehab, a discharge from the military, and a failed marriage. Reports also indicate Hunter was suspected of smoking crack cocaine in a strip club VIP room in “late 2018.” The Biden son purchased the firearm in October 2018.

Any Biden nominee to lead the ATF could present a glaring conflict of interest since that agency should be investigating Hunter Biden and whether he lied on a federal form about drug use to obtain a gun, which would be a felony.

Biden’s Weakness On The World Stage Is Dangerous,"Two days after that ABC interview, Chinese diplomats came to sovereign U.S. territory in Anchorage, Alaska, and brutally dressed down Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. The media did their best to downplay the embarrassing situation, but the disrespect that the Chinese showed the United States was impossible to ignore.

Particularly hurtful was that the Chinese diplomats, like Putin, used the Democratic Party’s own talking points about how corrupt, racist, evil, and irredeemably sinister the United States is. The message oft-repeated by the left this past year was that black people are routinely hunted on the streets, are regularly killed by law enforcement, and have no rights. It’s not any surprise that the Chinese said they agreed with those points.

Biden’s team can’t say, politically, that those lines parroted by the highest echelons of their own party are lies, even though they are. Instead, they mumbled something about how America tries to improve itself.

The tongue-lashing against the United States occurred after the U.S. diplomats condemned China for its economic policies and human rights abuses, including against the Uighur ethnic group. China said the United States is in no position to lecture. It was a poorly thought-out effort from the U.S. diplomats.

The Biden team, which has largely maintained the Trump administration’s economic policies, including controversial tariffs, against China, went into the meeting thinking they could easily dunk on the prior administration and show how much better they were at diplomacy. They should have thought through their standing and strategy a bit more.

“Rather than staying focused on giving China-specific demands and conveying our seriousness, the U.S. team insulted half the Americans who voted for Trump and was glad for his administration’s foreign policy approach by saying ‘America is back.’ America never left. And it’s the approach from the last administration that returned our focus on China and power and away from merely abstract ideas when we deal with other nations,” said Hudson Institute Senior Fellow Rebeccah Heinrichs.

Blinken has said he wants to move from Trump’s foreign policy focused on national interest back to the post-World War II familiar ruts and abstractions of enforcing a “rules-based order.” But the liberal international order has now officially turned its sights on the United States, with the UN Human Rights Council saying it will investigate “systemic” racism in the United States.

The New York Times, the leading paper of the Democrat Party, says the country was founded when slaves arrived, not when the Declaration of Independence was signed. That helped lead to a summer of murderous riots that destroyed major downtowns across the country.

“Hating America is a luxury we can no longer afford,” the liberal writer Caitlin Flanagan tweeted this weekend. Well said. The hatred of this fine country would be awful even if foreign adversaries didn’t exploit it. But they do.

Putin challenged Biden to a debate about U.S. history and the White House scurried. Xi Jinping had his people yell at U.S. diplomats in their first meeting with the new administration on U.S. soil. Tough words between adversaries are to be expected, but these two big, powerful adversaries have no regard, no esteem, and no respect for the people who lead this country, in part because those people don’t seem to respect themselves or the country they lead.

While the liberals in the media and other D.C. establishments aren’t concerned about it at all, few things express the weakness of the current ruling regime like the fact that the U.S. Capitol is still surrounded by troops, months after a riot that erupted over widespread concerns — concerns that those who control the discourse in this country are not allowing to be expressed publicly — about the integrity of a U.S. election conducted mostly by mail-in ballots. The United States would be using that as leverage against any adversary if it were happening in their country.

What’s more, it leaves genuine issues of national interest abandoned. “Blinken punts on punishing China for coronavirus outbreak,” read the headline after an interview this weekend. China hid the origin story and deceived the rest of the world about the attributes of the deadly virus that they unleashed upon the world. Viruses can arise anywhere, but China’s behavior and lack of transparency was reprehensible and a country that cared about its dead and the carnage this outbreak caused would demand some accountability.

Then, unfortunately, Biden stumbled up the stairs to Air Force One. Three times. Anyone can fall, even three times, but the White House response to the repeated stumbles was not great. They blamed the falls on the single-digit wind speeds in D.C. that day. “Our world leader gets knocked over by slight gusts,” is not the message you want to send the day after top diplomats are dressed down by our chief adversary.

What’s more, Biden had gone out of his way to mock President Trump for walking gingerly down a slippery ramp last year. “Look at how he steps, and look at how I step. Watch how I run up ramps and he stumbles down ramps. OK. Come on!” the 78-year-old Biden said.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/30/bidens-weakness-on-the-world-stage-is-dangerous/,2021-03-30
It's Time For Gun Control Activists To Hold Hunter Biden Accountable,"“Now is the time to push the Senate to do the right thing and pass background check legislation. Because this moment is different,” wrote Shannon Watts on Monday in The Nation, where she insisted the U.S. government should be “closing loopholes in order to stop guns from ending up in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them.”

Watts is the founder of Moms Demand Action, a massive movement of anti-gun activists throughout every state. She’s ardently anti-National Rifle Association, pro-background checks, and pro-bans on guns she thinks are too big. Her organization calls Joe Biden and Kamala Harris “the strongest gun safety administration in U.S. history,” as the executive duo works to enact sweeping gun control measures.

Watts has also been completely silent on Hunter Biden’s reckless missing gun scandal. No mention of Hunter appears on the high-level activist’s Twitter account, despite it being days since the latest report on the Biden son surfaced last week, not to mention the wildly irresponsible and shady nature of the whole ordeal.

Hunter Biden, who has a known history of drug abuse, probably lied about it on a background check form to obtain a firearm, which then went missing after it ended up in a trash can near a high school. Secret Service agents may have tried to clean up and cover up the mess — and Watts, who wants to close “loopholes” and “stop guns from ending up in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them,” has nothing to say about it?

Watts is in good company. The Democratic Party is teeming with firearm opponents champing at the bit to get as many guns as possible out of the hands of average citizens — such as the more than 16 million semi-automatic sporting rifles owned by law-abiding Americans — and to make the remaining guns as hard to acquire and ineffective as possible through universal background checks, bans on certain magazines, and other measures that would render the Second Amendment a relic of the past.

Biden and Harris are in her camp, as are the countless Democrats and media mouthpieces who compulsively seize on every mass shooting to advance their political agendas and earn gun-control brownie points with special interest groups, all while victims’ bodies are still warm.

Meanwhile, while well-connected leftists and other elites break the gun laws our country already has in place, Watts and her class look the other way. It’s inconvenient to deal with the fact that gun laws didn’t stop the president’s troubled son from probably lying to get one and then losing track of it near a school. These activists seem wholly unbothered by the fact that we aren’t even enforcing the gun laws we already have.

The left and ruling class’s lack of interest in Hunter is reminiscent of how they treated David Gregory when, on national television, the host of “Meet The Press” flashed a 30-round-capacity magazine, despite anything over 10 rounds being prohibited in the District of Columbia. Here was Gregory, going toe to toe with NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre, and preaching at his opponent about the dangers of high-capacity magazines while holding one in violation of D.C. law.

Gregory was never prosecuted. Although D.C. Attorney General Irvin Nathan insisted his office took the responsibility of prosecuting such offenses “very seriously,” he let Gregory off the hook because “under all of the circumstances here a prosecution would not promote public safety in the District of Columbia nor serve the best interests of the people of the District to whom this office owes its trust.”

The message reeks of elitism: We can handle our guns, but you can’t handle yours. Left-wing celebrities never get prosecuted for violating left-wing gun laws. And Hunter Biden won’t be prosecuted either. He won’t even be questioned or investigated.

Hunter Biden Must Be Investigated

It isn’t for lack of probable cause to inquire. Not counting the other times the Biden son has been let off the hook for his scandals, the missing gun incident alone is ripe for investigation and almost assuredly prosecution.

At the center of the story, as reported by Politico, is a gun that Hunter’s girlfriend Hallie, the wife of the late Beau Biden, found when she was rifling through Hunter’s truck because she was suspicious of him. She took the gun and dumped it into a trash can behind a grocery store, which was across from a high school — completely reckless behavior.

According to a firearm transaction record obtained by The Federalist, Hunter had purchased that gun, a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver with a talo finish, after replying “no” to a question on an ATF transaction form inquiring whether he was the “unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.” The Federalist also obtained a copy of that form, which can be viewed here.

Hunter’s track record of drug abuse, however, is well established. Not only did his drug habit contribute to his marriage falling apart, his discharge from the military, and a handful of stints in rehab, but Hunter was also suspected of smoking crack cocaine in the VIP room of a strip club he frequented.

“There was a smell of burning Styrofoam in the VIP room. We told him nothing illegal can go on here,” the club’s managing partner told Page Six. “We didn’t see anything illegal. After he was spoken to, the smell stopped.”

“VIP employees suspected it was crack,” he added.

While the club typically required customers to pay with credit cards that matched official IDs, the managing partner said, “Hunter was a bit of an exception” and would pay “thousands and thousands of dollars in the Archibald’s VIP rooms” with “credit cards that didn’t have his name on it.”

This occurred in “late 2018” — and the firearm purchase? That occurred on Oct. 12, 2018, which would be “late 2018.”

In a text allegedly sent by Hunter, he essentially acknowledged as much, implying his drug use was an ongoing issue. Hallie “stole the gun out of my truck lock box … because she was scared I would harm myself due to my drug and alcohol problem and our volatile relationship and that she was afraid for the kids,” the message reads.

BREAKING: Text message from Hunter Biden confirms involvement of Secret Service in his illegal firearm incident pic.twitter.com/1vb8GGJidX — AmericaFest Poso (@JackPosobiec) March 26, 2021

The same text exchange corroborated what Politico reported: that Secret Service agents got involved. Shortly after police and the FBI — which was also looking into Hunter for potential tax crimes in an investigation that is still ongoing — arrived at the grocery store where the gun had been dumped but then had disappeared when Hallie went back to retrieve it, two Secret Service agents reportedly paid a visit to the gun store where Hunter had bought the firearm earlier that month. According to Politico’s sources, they had “badges and identification cards” and told the owner to turn over the Firearms Transaction Record from the purchase.

The store owner “suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” according to multiple people with a “firsthand knowledge of the episode.” So he held onto the paperwork until the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the agency authorized to review the forms, could get to them.

Both the Secret Service and the White House denied involvement, but the text says otherwise. Two Republican senators last week sent a letter to the head of Secret Service, demanding answers about the agency’s involvement.

Biden’s ATF Pick Will Be Compromised

President Biden will soon be choosing a nominee to head the ATF, the law enforcement agency within the Department of Justice that issues the background check forms on which Hunter denied drug use. It’s also the same agency that regulates firearm sales, transportation, and possession of firearms and ammo, meaning a director hostile to firearms would not only pose a threat to the Second Amendment, with the full force of the federal government behind him, but the installment of a left-wing director would also result in Hunter Biden off the hook once again, recklessly flouting firearm laws with impunity.

Republican senators have a responsibility here to double down on the Biden son incident when vetting his father’s nominee. Will a potential director commit to using ATF resources to pursue an investigation and subsequent prosecution against a potential felon, no matter his political connections? Republican lawmakers must ask.

Harris bailed out violent leftist rioters, peddled the Jussie Smollett hate crime “MAGA country” hoax, and now wants to make it illegal for people convicted of federal hate crimes to obtain firearms. Will a Biden ATF pick use government resources to disproportionately target conservatives while turning a blind eye to Biden family scandals?

We know how President Biden likes to handle prosecutors and family business. He once bragged about bribing Ukraine to fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma, where Hunter was raking in $50,000 per month to sit on its board.

The ATF and other federal law enforcers must confirm whether Hunter lied on a federal form to get his hands on a gun. They must unearth the names of the Secret Service agents who may have abused their power to try to collect the form in question and thus clean up the messes of the Biden family.

That we don’t have answers to these questions — and that left-wing gun hawks aren’t even beginning to ask them — is unacceptable. Anyone Biden appoints to head the ATF will be compromised.

No more freebies for the Biden family. No more free passes for leftists like Shannon Watts to spew rhetoric that seeks to deny fundamental freedoms to law-abiding Americans while remaining utterly mum about gun malfeasance within their own ranks. It’s time to investigate Hunter Biden for breaking gun laws, and powerful left-wing gun-control activists should say so.

How Can Hunter Biden Say He 'Did Nothing Unethical' But 'Wouldn't Take' Burisma Seat Again?,"President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden claims in his memoir “Beautiful Things” releasing on April 6 that he never committed any wrongdoing “in our political environment” by taking a seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.

“I did nothing unethical, and have never been charged with wrongdoing,” Biden writes. “In our current political environment, I don’t believe it would make any difference if I took that seat or not. I’d be attacked anyway. What I do believe, in this current climate, is that it wouldn’t matter what I did or didn’t do. The attacks weren’t intended for me. They were meant to wound my dad.”

Hunter, who is 51-years-old, is correct he has not been charged in regard to his role on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas company, but it’s still curious why he was appointed with a salary of $50,000 per month during the Obama presidency despite having zero energy policy experience. In 2015, the former acting deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv contacted then-Vice President Joe Biden’s office to voice concerns over a conflict of interest with Hunter’s appointment. Joe Biden bribed President Petro Poroshenko to fire Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, threatening that the United States would otherwise take back $1 billion in loans.

According to a Senate report, “In addition to the over $4 million paid by Burisma for Hunter Biden’s and Archer’s board memberships, Hunter Biden, his family, and Archer received millions of dollars from foreign nationals with questionable backgrounds.” Hunter also received millions combined from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow, Chinese nationals linked to the Communist Party, investor Kenges Rakishev of Kazakhstan, and several other individuals.

Hunter is now the subject of an ongoing federal probe into his tax affairs. As first reported by Politico in December 2020, the U.S. Attorney’s Office is investigating Hunter’s dealings in Delaware, in addition to a securities fraud inquiry in the Southern District of New York. Feds in the Western District of Pennsylvania are in the process of probing into Biden’s “hospital business,” which reportedly involved James Biden, Joe Biden’s brother.

As Politico reported last week, Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden, disposed of Hunter’s .38 revolver in a trash bin behind a grocery store, which eventually led to the store manager calling the police. Secret Service agents reportedly went to the location of the gun store where Hunter purchased the firearm. The owner of the gun store, however, did not turn over the federal transaction forms the agents asked for because “he suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime.” As of yet, the Secret Service and White House have denied any involvement in the matter, but text messages allegedly sent from Hunter Biden admit Secret Service involvement.

Notably, Biden appears to have lied on the Firearms Transaction Record when he claimed he was not a user of illicit drugs. The president’s son was discharged from the Navy Reserve in June 2013 for cocaine usage, in addition to multiple stints in rehab and a story from late 2018 in which Hunter was suspected of smoking crack cocaine in a VIP room of a strip club he frequented. He purchased the firearm in October of 2018.

Hunter’s memoir focuses on his drug addiction struggles and is being published by Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, the same publishing company that nuked Sen. Josh Hawley’s, R-Mo., book deal on Big Tech after the Capitol breach in January.

The Biden son claims in his memoir that if he could do the situation over again, he would not take the seat on Burisma. “Knowing all of that now: No, I would not do it again,” Biden wrote. “I wouldn’t take the seat on Burisma’s board.”

It is certainly unclear how Hunter can both deny any wrongdoing in Ukraine, and at the same time say he would not take the position if he could do it over again. The reasonable follow-up question to the Biden son is why?",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/31/how-can-hunter-biden-say-he-did-nothing-unethical-but-wouldnt-take-the-seat-on-burisma-again/,2021-03-31
Iowa Governor Sets The Bar To Refuse To Enable Biden's Border Crisis,"Last Thursday, Republican Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds told WHO radio in Des Moines that she declined a request by the Biden administration to house illegally present foreign minors. Reynolds became the first GOP governor in the nation to refuse a temporary housing request for illegals trafficked by international drug cartels in league with Communist China to destabilize the United States. She models behavior more lawmakers would be prudent to heed.

“This is not our problem,” Reynolds said, in addition to noting that Iowa does not have the resources to provide temporary housing for the U.S. Department of Housing and Human Services to use. “This is the president’s problem. He’s the one that has opened the border, and he needs to be responsible for this and he needs to stop it.”

Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said on Fox News in March that he has no room for migrants to be relocated to his state. That was after a leaked email showed U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB) was targeting northern states to house foreign citizens illegally trafficked into the United States at taxpayer expense. Knudsen told The Federalist that Reynolds has got it “absolutely right.”

“When these migrants are interviewed when they get here, they all say the same thing: ‘Biden told us to come by and said we’re welcome.’ I think that’s a messaging failure on the President’s part,” Knudsen said in an interview.

The Iowa Department of Human Services notified the Biden administration on March 31 that the state would not permit the federal government to fly migrants in. The state cited the state government’s need to prioritize American “children first,” even though the White House has inevitably fostered this “incredibly saddening and difficult situation.”

“This is due to limited resources and administrative concerns. We have an obligation to take care of our children first and absent the resources or a clear and comprehensive plan for federal support, we were unable to accommodate the request,” the agency said in a statement to the White House. “We acknowledge this is an incredibly saddening and difficult situation.”

In March, The Washington Post reported that CBP requested the Biden administration grant airplanes to transport migrants across the United States due to a surge in border crossings. At the time, the CBP cited 4,500 unaccompanied children and teenagers held in detention facilities and tent sites.

Shortly after, documents showed more than 5,000 unaccompanied children being held rather than returned to their home countries. In March, CBP reported an estimated 19,000 unaccompanied minors arrived at the border, with 172,000 people combined coming in, effectively making for the largest influx of illegal immigrants in more than 20 years.

The latest data from the government shows Border Patrol agents are allowing 1,000 illegal aliens to come in each day. The CBP currently projects 184,000 migrant children will cross the border in fiscal year 2021. “We’ve never seen anything like this before,” an agent told Fox News on April 2.

Iowa state Rep. Eddie Andrews, who sits on the Public Safety Committee, told The Federalist that he supports a “strong, independent governor,” which Reynolds has demonstrated herself to be.

Reynolds is reacting in a commonsense way to incentivize the Biden White House to discourage illegal migration used to weaken the United States by international criminal cartels and foreign adversaries such as China. The Biden administration has opened 11 facilities in states along the border to fly minors because of its policy failings.

While Reynolds stood up for her state against federal intervention, Democratic-run Michigan is opening an emergency facility for up to 240 migrant children to live. This decision was in alignment with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s decision in June to sustain migrant housing for agricultural workers with taxpayer money.

Matt Seely of the Michigan Conservative Coalition told The Federalist that his organization is “dumbfounded” that a state struggling economically due to lockdowns would divert public resources this way. In the past year, the number of Michigan children in foster care has increased.

“Why are we taking on people that have never been immunized and that we don’t know anything about their health,” Seely said. “Our whole focus should be getting Michigan healthy and opening our state.”

Nationwide, 275 sheriffs signed a letter last week urging Biden to secure the U.S. border and take action against the influx of illegal immigration. Ten of these individuals were from counties in Iowa. Cerro Gordo County Sheriff Kevin Pals told The Federalist that after the letter went to Biden, some of the Arizona sheriffs who signed the letter met with the Biden administration. He added that the White House loosened border security “out of hatred for President Trump.”

“It appears to me that the Biden administration is just trying to reverse everything that President Trump did out of hatred for President Trump,” Pals said. “I don’t think it has anything to do with the middle class or the people in Iowa. They need to change their mission to be about the safety of the people of the United States.”

On Sunday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas called on the White House to reinstate former President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, which deterred illegal crossings. Abbott referenced Biden’s decision in January to repeal the government’s “remain in Mexico” asylum policy that required migrants to wait until their court date before crossing the border. Since its inception in January 2019, 67,000 migrants were enrolled. Abbott said Biden could send “a stronger message that” illegals should not be coming instead of wavering.

“President Biden alone caused this border crisis and he alone has the responsibility to stop it,” Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who visited the Donna, Texas migrant facility on Saturday and shared videos on social media of overcrowding, told The Federalist. “No governor should be forced to solve the problem that President Biden created with his reckless executive orders. President Biden created this crisis at the border, and President Biden needs to stop passing the buck and fix this problem today.”

This Article Is A Textbook Example Of Media Running PR For Democrats,"A recent Politico article by Caitlin Emma on President Joe Biden’s hold of funding for border wall construction provides a perfect example of the press running cover for the Biden administration. Almost every sentence is designed to excuse or defend Biden’s action, and of course smear the Trump team in the process.

Biden’s executive order on Jan. 20 ordered a hold on all funds being used for the construction of the wall along the U.S. southern border, including funds Congress specifically appropriated for border wall construction. Based on the Government Accountability Office’s opinion finding that the Trump administration violated the law for pausing Ukraine funding in the same manner, it would seem like a slam dunk that Biden’s hold is illegal.

While the headline states Biden “is under fire,” almost every sentence in the story is designed to defend Biden’s actions, beginning with the rest of the title that says Biden would merely be a “rule-breaker” if it was determined he violated federal law. In the same story, there are no references to “rule breaking” for the same action by Trump’s Office of Management and Budget pausing the Ukraine funds. The word used? “Illegal.”

Politico blindly accepts the Biden OMB official’s defense that Biden’s hold was publicly announced, while the Trump OMB’s hold was secret. This distinction has zero relevance to whether the hold violates federal law. But you would not know that reading this article.

Politico also reprints the Biden OMB’s official distinction that the Biden hold was not done by using OMB’s apportionment power, as the Trump OMB did with Ukraine funding. Whether OMB is using its apportionment power or an agency is holding the funds is irrelevant to whether this is legal.

The article later implies that Trump used these same tactics to pause funding to the World Health Organization (WHO), but links to a story that literally begins with President Trump announcing the hold. And OMB’s apportionment authority was not used to pause WHO funding.

Politico also prints a Biden OMB official’s statement that the Trump OMB tried to “permanently tie up [Ukraine funds] by taking action right before the annual spending deadline.” That’s false.

Those Ukraine funds were first paused informally beginning in mid-June of 2019, more than three months before the end of the fiscal year. OMB’s first apportionment footnote holding those funds was placed on July 25. These dates are not even close to the Sept. 30 fiscal year deadline. Those funds were in fact released and obligated.

Politico writes approvingly that White House officials defend the hold because it was necessary to “come up with a plan to spend the money.” That is exactly what the Trump OMB argued when pausing the Ukraine funds, and GAO rejected this argument. It instead found that the administration can’t pause funds for a policy review to determine how best to spend the money.

Politico wrote that the Trump OMB’s justification for holding the funds to conduct a policy review was “vehemently swatted down [by GAO], citing the president’s policy and political ambitions.” That’s false. There is not a single reference in GAO’s opinion to Trump’s “political ambitions.” Or any political ambitions. GAO focused on OMB’s justification for hold.

Biden’s OMB official states the funds are being held consistent with appropriations law. Reports are that all construction work is frozen, and based on GAO’s opinion, this would violate appropriations law. OMB undoubtedly believes it is permissible to hold funds for a policy review because that was the exact same position the Trump OMB took. But GAO and congressional Democrats rejected that position. Politico’s article did not challenge this at all.

Speaking of congressional Democrats and Politico’s partisan slant, the article writes approvingly of House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth and his supposed nonpartisan desire to strengthen Congress’s power of the purse, but the article not once challenges Yarmuth for being utterly silent during the Biden administration’s pause of congressionally appropriated funds, despite his obsession with just such executive actions during the Trump administration. This is especially interesting as Politico—even this same Politico journalist—parroted every accusatory Yarmuth press release during the last administration.

Politico ends its supposed straight news article by noting that the Biden administration “has also promised to release the money if the pause violated congressional intent.” Under GAO’s legal analysis, pausing funds violates the law. Unfreezing the money would be a welcome development, but according to GAO’s opinion, it would be “too little, too late” to avoid being an illegal impoundment.

Biden has already violated his executive order deadline to have a plan within 60 days to spend these funds. It’s day 85 and there is no plan, and no evidence that a plan is coming any time soon.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has stated that the border wall funds appropriated by Congress are “still moving forward,” but press reports indicate all funds are frozen. This appears to be a false statement, but no one in the crack media corps, including Politico, is fact-checking this apparently false claim.

What is going on here? This story, like so many stories, is written with false facts and false narratives to cover for Biden, and of course smear Trump. Politico never contacted a Trump OMB official to get their side of the story. This isn’t journalism, this is being part of Team Biden.

Biden Has Already Betrayed The Christians Who Voted For Him,"Many Christians are feeling frustrated with the Biden administration. A recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal points to how Joe Biden’s flip-flop on refugees is frustrating evangelicals who foolishly voted for him last November. As the Journal contributor noted, they have a reason to feel betrayed.

Believers who care about values, life, and religious liberty continue to find that the new administration has let them down time and time again. While Biden may attend Mass regularly, many of his policy positions raise questions of how diligently he practices his Catholic faith outside the four walls of his church.

The Journal op-ed, written by Sheila Joiner of Fort Worth, Texas, said she voted for Biden in large part because of his promise to restore the refugee resettlement program. Last fall Biden pledged to raise the annual cap on refugees to 125,000, a move that in Joiner’s words “sold” her on his candidacy.

But in the space of a few hours last Friday, the Biden administration went through a very public flip-flop on the issue. First, the administration claimed it would not raise the current year’s refugee cap of 15,000, violating candidate Biden’s own promise. Then, after a public outcry from the left, the White House said it could lift the cap on admissions eventually, but believed that time would limit the number of refugees it could admit between now and the September 30 end of the fiscal year.

On top of the betrayal many pro-Biden evangelicals feel over the refugee fiasco, the White House’s egregious actions on human life and religious liberty add insult to injury for all those of Christian faith.

On Friday, the National Institutes of Health announced it would reverse the Trump administration’s ban on fetal tissue research. That development came mere days after documents from Judicial Watch highlighted the ways officials at the Food and Drug Administration trafficked in aborted baby parts — until the Trump administration’s ban on fetal tissue research ended the practice. Now the Biden administration wants to reinstate this grotesque trade in the name of “science.”

On Wednesday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) began the process of removing pro-life protections for the Title X program. HHS, now headed by pro-abortion Secretary Xavier Becerra, would allow Title X grantees receiving federal funding to refer patients for abortion, thus allowing Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider who endorsed Biden for president, to resume receiving federal taxpayer dollars.

But wait, there’s more. As part of last month’s purported “COVID relief” package, Congress greenlighted a massive expansion of taxpayer subsidies for plans that cover abortion. The $34.2 billion in increased subsidies for Obamacare plans that Democrats want to make permanent contain “restrictions” on funding of insurance plans covering abortion that the pro-life community has derided as a sham accounting gimmick. Also, the $35.1 billion in spending on subsidized COBRA coverage include no restrictions on insurance plans covering abortion.

To top it off, we are currently witnessing a record number of illegal crossings at the border, leading to an overflow of unaccompanied children packed on top of each other in detention facilities – a practice that was decried by evangelicals under the Trump administration. Despite vowing to shut down those exact detention facilities, Biden has instead reversed several Trump administration immigration policies that worked to curb human trafficking.

The damage to human life and religious liberty won’t just end there, of course. To win support from the far left during his campaign for the presidency, Biden had to reverse his decades-long support for the Hyde Amendment, meaning Democrats will now seek to repeal this pro-life protection to enable taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand.

Finally, Biden’s HHS, led by a man who supported shutting down churches during the coronavirus pandemic, will likely withdraw the conscience protections the Trump administration finalized in 2019, and which Becerra and other leftists challenged from the outset.

These moves, and unfortunately, many others yet to come, show the radical nature of the Biden presidency and its threat to individuals of faith, no matter their particular creed or denomination. Evangelicals like Joiner taken in by the avuncular Biden’s demeanor last year should not allow themselves to be fooled again.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/04/20/joe-biden-has-already-betrayed-the-christians-who-voted-for-him-as-the-more-moral-candidate/,2021-04-20
"Trump Isn’t President, But The Left Is Still Blaming Him For Everything","“Trump’s shadow looms over Biden’s presidency and a divided nation.” So ran the headline of the latest piece of propaganda scribed by the Democrat mouthpiece publishing under the banner of the Washington Post. Line after line following that in last Thursday’s purported “analysis” cements the sad reality that journalism dies in broad daylight.

In advance of this week’s State of the Union address, Washington Post staffers peppered the public with reasons for Joe Biden to blame former President Trump for the country’s division—and Biden’s inability to keep his promises.

“Joe Biden won the White House by appealing for calm and unity. But he has inherited a fractured and volatile nation,” the article began. Yes, Biden pushed “unity” as a campaign theme, but that appeal didn’t win Biden the White House. It was a corrupt media. It is also the left and its complicit media that sow the division that is destroying our country.

The corrupt media sold the American public a fictional figure—a healer, a moderate, a temperate man—while burying Biden’s bullying behavior and extreme positions. CNN “got Trump out” by pushing propaganda designed to hurt the 45th president.

In addition, a collusion of purpose drove the major “news” and social media outlets to banish The New York Post’s blockbuster reporting on Joe Biden’s pay-to-play scandal revealed by the trove of emails recovered from Hunter Biden’s abandoned MacBook. The latter election-interference alone likely cost Trump a second term, with “4.6% of Biden voters [saying] they would not have selected him had they been aware of his son’s China money affair.”

Pressuring People Into Capitulation Isn’t Unity

Biden’s unity theme is bunk. Soon after reading his inaugural address repeating that theme, as I noted previously, “The president began to divide the nation with the flick of his pen, signing a flurry of executive orders that pitted Americans against each other. Biden’s reversal of the Mexico City policy was a painful attack on pro-life Americans, forcing them to fund international abortion providers with their tax dollars. Halting the Keystone XL Pipeline promises to decimate many of this country’s blue-collar oil workers. And by discontinuing the border wall and instituting a 100-day freeze on deportations, Biden has pitted border states against the federal government, as southern states fight to safeguard American citizens and their fiscal health.”

Yet the Washington Post, like most Trump critics, blames the former president for the country’s current divisions, and views Biden as the innocent who inherited the tinderbox. However, the divide between left and right long predated Trump. All Trump did was punch back. He did it as a street-fighter, never trained to aim above the belt like a lifetime politicians.

Democrats and their professional propogandists don’t want a clean fight, either. They don’t want debate and compromise—or better yet federalism—to bridge the divide. They want unity by capitulation.

The Washington Post’s “analysis” on the issues that divide so clearly proves this point. “As Biden tries to keep his own promises, these are the volatile issues that confront him and continue to divide America,” the article reads, suggesting if only Biden were able to fulfill his campaign pledges, America would be united.

The Left Is Not Completely Innocent Here

Issue one dividing the country, according to the Post, is immigration. And why the schism? It’s not because “immigration has always been an intractable issue,” with half (or more) of Americans supporting border security and limited legal immigration in a time of tight labor markets. No, it’s Trump’s fault because he “vilified immigrants like no president in modern times” and his policies reduced the number of immigrant visas issued overseas and caused the annual growth of the immigrant population to plunge.

Ignored fully in last week’s P.R. release on behalf of Team Biden were the current president’s policies that caused a crisis on the southern border. Instead, the Post again presented the challenge as one Biden inherited, noting “asylum seekers are still being turned away at ports of entry.”

While acknowledging that “a record number of unaccompanied teens and children are being held in detention centers, often for longer than legally allowed,” Biden’s complicity in that crisis merits no mention in the article. Rather, the Post again quickly pivots to Trump, writing in the next sentence that “House GOP leader Keven McCarthy (Calif.) returned to Trump’s messaging, spreading unfounded claims that terrorists were trying to enter the United States through Mexico.”

Here we see the corrupt media’s role as both a propaganda machine and as a divider. Under Trump, it was “kids in cages,” but now it’s “detention centers.” Yet it is the Post and not McCarthy “spreading unfounded claims”: U.S. Border Patrol confirmed just weeks ago that two Yemeni men who were both named on the FBI’s terror watchlist and no-fly list illegally crossed the southern U.S. border before being arrested.

Blame Trump for All Our Sins

While the left remains blinded to the media’s role in dividing America, the populace sees the propaganda aimed at denigrating those with “wrong-think” and resents the co-conspiratorial role leftist politicians and the press have forged.

No better example may exist than the transitional sentence the Post’s staffer penned to take readers to the next “volatile issue” dividing America. “Biden has promised to be “a president for All Americans,” the text ran before highlighting Biden’s “pledge[] to confront white supremacy and advance racial justice.”

“He was quick to condemn hate crimes against Asian Americans,” the puffery continued, while ignoring that the Biden administration dropped the federal lawsuit filed against Yale University based on its admissions policies that discriminate against Asian Americans. Then came the attacks on Trump, with a link to a supposed “in-depth look at how Trump policies and rhetoric exacerbated racial tensions.”

Sadly, our country is experiencing a strain in race relations, but it is Biden, the left, and their complicit media torquing those tensions. Here are just a few examples: “Biden regularly repeat[ed] the lie that then-President Trump called neo-Nazis and white supremacists ‘very fine people,’” and the press perpetuated that lie. “Biden smeared Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas as Nazis.” The president outrageously condemned Georgia’s voter-integrity law as a return “Jim Crow,” and encouraged Major League Baseball to move the All-Star Game as punishment.

Lying to Protect the Narrative

The Biden administration, backed by much of corporate media, continued this path of divisiveness with its reaction to the shooting death of Ma’Khia Bryant in Columbus, Ohio. While video footage established the police officer’s quick reaction and sure shot saved another black girl from being stabbed by a charging Bryant, the press instead ran with the inciting and incomplete narrative that police had killed a black teen.

When asked about the incident, Biden Press Secretary Jen Psaki took this tack as well, implying race was a factor in the shooting and that the officer acted unjustifiably: “She was a child. We’re thinking of her friends and family in the communities that are hurting and grieving her loss. We know that police violence disproportionately impacts black and Latino people in communities and that black women and girls, like black men and boys, experience higher rates of police violence.”

As the press secretary for the country’s top Democrat, Psaki’s comments also represented a shocking chutzpah, as last year Senate Democrats killed Sen. Tim Scott’s police reform bill.

“Today we lost, I lost, the vote on a piece of legislation that would’ve led to systemic change in the relationship between communities of color and the law enforcement community,” Scott said when his bill died. “We would’ve broken this concept in this nation that somehow, some way you have to either be for law enforcement or for communities of color. That is a binary choice. It’s just not true,” Scott said.

It’s Okay to Attack Black People With Different Views

The corporate press virtually ignored the demise of Scott’s legislative proposal, and for good-in-their-eyes reasons: Scott is a Republican and African-American. As if to prove their motive, the Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler last week ran a hit piece on Scott under the auspices of fact-checking his heritage as the grandson of a grammar-school drop-out and cotton-picker.

Yet the same Washington Post that ran Kessler’s embarrassing self-own touted Biden’s warning, “We must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufacturer,” as the answer to our country’s division. The great American divide can also be mended, the Post suggests, if Biden “can move quickly to fill vacancies on federal courts.” Rejoining the Paris climate agreement and “reversing the rest of Trump’s environmental impact,” the Post claimed, will also heal the nation.

In other words, if everything Trump did can be undone, our country will be all kumbaya. Unity by capitulation, however, is not unity; it is totalitarianism. Democrats seek it and the corrupt media sells it—and they do so in the open air.

But sunshine is a disinfectant that still holds the chance of destroying the symbiotic relationship between the press and leftist politicians, designed to put and keep the country in the left’s tight control. Perhaps democracy will die after all, but if so, let’s make it do so in the light.

Biden Is The Worst Left-Wing Culture Warrior Since Obama,"In a primary full of socialists, President Joe Biden clinched the Democratic nomination and rode his way to the White House on the appearance of a supposed moderate, a pragmatist who promised an American “return to normalcy” in a 21st-century digital version of the early front-porch campaigns.

To those paying attention, however, Biden’s radicalism was clear from the start, with normal nowhere in sight. He ran on a platform cloaked in centrism only by virtue of what others were proposing on stage. Even McClatchy wrote in September 2019, “Biden’s current set of policy prescriptions would likely be considered radical if they had been proposed in any previous Democratic presidential primary.”

The following summer, Biden’s platform was taken over by California Sen. Kamala Harris joining the ticket and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dominating the discussions for the “Unity Task Force Recommendations” to unite Democrat support after a highly fractured primary. Harris accepted the vice-presidential nomination as a senator with the hardest left voting record in the upper chamber, even to the left of Sanders, an open socialist. So true to form, Harris was characterized as a “pragmatic moderate” by the corporate press.

In Biden’s first 100 days, the new president has conformed to his promise to aggressively govern in pursuit of a progressive, partisan agenda, dismissing dollars as finite while weaponizing the federal government to mandate leftism in the culture wars. By August last year, Biden’s platform included plans for another $10 trillion in spending. By May of this year, Biden’s price tags have already hit $6 trillion, with nearly $2 trillion signed and trillions more in the pipeline for Democrats’ central-state planning by way of infrastructure and the expansion of the welfare state.

Yet while spending soars, provoking comparisons of Biden as the 21st-century Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the new president launched his first 48 hours in the White House with a hard-left assault on the culture wars, wielding the power of the pen to unilaterally enact sweeping social policy on issues from the erasure of women’s sports to open borders.

Biden signed 17 executive orders by the weekend of his inauguration, more than were issued in the first month of their presidencies by Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton combined. According to FiveThirtyEight, Biden signed 40 executive orders within his first 100 days, surpassing every predecessor for most orders signed in the same time going back to Roosevelt. It’s a convenient way to circumvent republican governance, when Biden has only signed 11 new bills so far — less than most predecessors — in the absence of a legislative mandate.

Biden only captured the White House by less than 43,000 votes across three states, with a Senate evenly divided and the House narrowly controlled by the same party. In other words, the American public by no means demanded a fundamental transformation of their country, but that’s what they’re getting.

On his first day, Biden signed an executive order effectively eliminating women’s sports with the mandated inclusion of men who identify as women in girls’ leagues at any institution that receives federal tax dollars.

Biden has also aggressively pushed for passage of the Equality Act, a campaign pledge he reiterated in his first address to a joint session of Congress, a majority of whom watched from outside the chamber. Despite the deceptive label, the Equality Act, introduced in March, is by no means a genuine step towards equality. Rather, it punishes Americans who dissent from the leftist dogma on gender identity and sexual orientation.

On immigration, it’s no coincidence the United States faces the worst border crisis in decades just weeks into the Democrat administration. In March, U.S. Customs and Border Protection took in more than 172,000 illegal aliens in the busiest month in more than 20 years as migrant detention facilities overflow far beyond even pre-pandemic capacity.

The influx of migrants was explicitly provoked by Biden’s adamant demands for an open border, dating back to his soft rhetoric on immigration from the campaign trail. Central American caravans began to make their way to the southern border the moment Biden’s election was announced in November.

“He’s going to help all of us. He’s giving us 100 days to get to the U.S. and give us legal [unclear] papers, so we can get a better life for our kids, and for our families,” one Honduran migrant told CNN on the trip in January as Biden prepared to take office.

Within his first 100 days, Biden halted construction on the southern border wall, tried to implement a moratorium on deportations, reinstated Obama-era protections for the undocumented, and ended Trump’s effective “Remain in Mexico” policy that kept asylum seekers on the other side of the border until processed for legal entry.

Biden is all for the left’s critical race theory, a revolutionary ideology to seek the fundamental transformation of American society, tasking White House Domestic Policy Council lead Susan Rice with “rooting out systemic racism” as the focal point of her mission.

In schools, Biden’s Department of Education has pushed grants to make classrooms “incorporate teaching and learning practices that reflect the diversity, identities, histories, contributions, and experiences of all students.” Works encouraged in curriculum to achieve those goals include The New York Times’ anti-American “1619 Project” and Ibram X. Kendi’s “How to Be an Antiracist.”

No issue has been left untouched by the new administration redefining the standards of what it means to run a progressive presidency in the post-Obama era. Biden reinstated taxpayer-funded overseas abortion, called for new restrictive gun laws, and even weighed in on state voting laws to condemn voter ID laws as a relic of Jim Crow, as if the idea black people can’t obtain a valid ID to vote isn’t racist itself.

But The New York Times’ analysis of the new administration is “a nothingburger on the culture wars.”

This (fun) bit aside, the meme is a testimony to how how Biden himself offers the right, well, a nothingburger on culture wars. It’s the most animating & unifying material in the coalition bc of differences on forpolicy, lack of interest in fiscal stuff. But Biden = thin gruel https://t.co/MWz7NyNKrJ — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) April 26, 2021

Corporate Media Feverishly Tries To Hide Biden's Culture War Extremism,"On the culture war, President Biden is AWOL, insist pundits in certain large media outlets.

“Biden side-steps the culture wars, and that’s good for America,” reads the headline of an article by Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson. “Biden is rolling back the culture war. The country should thank him,” adds his Post colleague E.J. Dionne. “Biden wants no part of the culture war the G.O.P. loves,” according to New York Times columnist Thomas B. Edsall.

It’s an open question whether they really think this, or if they know better and are trying to gaslight us. Either way, it’s 180 degrees off the truth. The fact is, Biden has used his executive power to kick the culture war into overdrive.

A Hard Left Turn after Promising Moderation

How so? Let us count the ways.

Biden ordered the entire federal government to focus on “equity” (read: government-mandated racial inequality). He made “racial and ethnic disparities” the government’s first priority in responding to COVID-19. He created a task force to consider how leftists can use the pandemic to combat “systemic and structural racism.”

He ordered the entire government to extend the Supreme Court’s Bostock opinion to all federal laws and regulations, which means, among other things, that schools receiving federal funds must permit biological males to play on girls’ sports teams and use their bathrooms. He ordered the Department of Education to begin rolling back due process rules for college sexual assault cases.

He issued proclamations complaining that the United States has furthered “xenophobic rhetoric,” and has “never fully lived up to the founding principles of this nation.”

He directed the State Department to fund nongovernmental organizations that provide or lobby for abortions abroad, and to consider eliminating “barriers” to the naturalization process like “civics and English language tests, and the oath of allegiance.”

All of that makes the narrative that Biden is ignoring the culture war curious. Even more curious is that the writers making that claim have themselves ignored all the facts contrary to that narrative.

For example, in early March, Politico reporters Christopher Cadelago and Meridith McGraw claimed that “Biden World” was uninterested in the culture wars. They based that conclusion on statements from a pollster and unnamed “Biden aides.” They cited none of the president’s actions.

A few days later, Dionne chimed in with his column about how Biden has allegedly managed to dial back the culture wars. To support that claim, he pointed to a pro-union speech that Biden gave and the president’s attention to the pandemic and economic issues. Like Cadelago and McGraw, however, Dionne ignored all of Biden’s dozens of executive actions.

Then Edsall joined the chorus. His evidence? The supposed grandeur of the administration’s spending plans, quotes from a few experts who said the country must come together, and a couple of strategically selected lines from President Biden’s public appearances. All words, no actions.

Noticing a Pattern?

One of the more galling takes was Michael Collins’s ostensibly pure news piece for USA Today. His claim that Biden was avoiding the culture wars was based entirely on two throwaway lines delivered not by Biden, but by White House Press Secretary Jennifer Psaki.

Biden is avoiding the culture war, Collins argued, because Psaki “punted” when asked about the Vatican’s position against same-sex marriage and a recent controversy over Dr. Seuss Enterprises’ decision to stop publishing several of the late author’s books. Like the others, Collins ignored everything Biden has actually done.

Next was Michael Gerson, who based his claim on a cherry-picked list of “Biden’s chosen issues” — vaccine distribution, social welfare programs, and infrastructure — that overlooked all the issues Biden has chosen for his executive actions. Tellingly, Gerson did not explain how the issues he listed could be Biden’s “chosen” when only a few of Biden’s record-breaking number of executive actions address them.

The corporate media really wants you to believe that Biden is on the sidelines of the culture wars. But the only way to reach that conclusion is to diligently ignore everything that Biden is doing. It’s a curious narrative because it’s not immediately obvious why so many establishment liberal writers (as contrasted to the more radical writers who are celebrating Biden’s aggressive cultural agenda) want to spin it.

Perhaps they’re just copycats without an original idea of their own. But even if so, why parrot this particular narrative?

The answer may lie in public opinion polling showing that Americans either disagree with far-left cultural policies or want the government to focus on other things. Perhaps mindful of this polling, these pundits are trying to hide what Biden is actually doing from the American public.

Take, for example, President Biden’s order that will effectively eliminate sex-specific school sports. A Politico and Morning Consult poll found that 53 percent of Americans support a ban on transgender athletes competing in women’s sports. A Harvard Harris poll found that 55 percent of Americans oppose Biden’s executive order allowing boys to compete in girls’ sports at schools.

The Harvard poll also found that most Americans view the coronavirus, the economy, and healthcare as the most important issues facing the country, but only 13 percent think the same about racial issues. They might not be happy to know that race dominates Biden’s executive agenda.

Would Americans be happy to know that Biden has ordered the entire government to center its economic, health care, environmental, and scientific policies around divisive “racial equity” issues? Doubtful.

Perhaps that explains why these pundits are so determined to direct attention away from Biden’s actions and on to his speeches about spending and COVID-19. After all, fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, and journalists gotta spin, baby, spin.

Trump: Comparisons Of Biden And Carter Are Unfair … To Carter,"Former President Donald Trump said comparing former President Jimmy Carter’s presidency to the Biden administration is unfair.

“I see that everybody is comparing Joe Biden to Jimmy Carter. It would seem to me that is very unfair to Jimmy Carter. Jimmy mishandled crisis after crisis, but Biden has CREATED crisis after crisis,” Trump wrote in a statement Wednesday.

Trump then listed off all of Biden’s self-inflicted crises.

“First there was the Biden Border Crisis (that he refuses to call a Crisis), then the Biden Economic Crisis, then the Biden Israel Crisis, and now the Biden Gas Crisis,” Trump wrote. “Joe Biden has had the worst start of any president in United States history, and someday, they will compare future disasters to the Biden Administration—but no, Jimmy was better!

Trump isn’t the only one to notice the similarities between the two Democratic presidencies.

“Joe Biden is the new Jimmy Carter: -Stagflation -Higher taxes -And rising gas prices 2021 meet 1979,” Republican Rep. Jim Jordan tweeted on Tuesday.

His freakishly condescending and out-of-touch messaging is all kinds of wrong. From being impractical to contradicting his own actions to being just plain obnoxious, here’s a list of problems with Biden’s latest bout of Twitter preaching.

1. Biden Has Been Vaccinated For Months and Still Wears a Mask

Biden received his first dose of the coronavirus vaccine on December 21, 2020, while televised. He received the second shot on January 11, 2021, a few days before his inauguration.

Yet he has continued to wear a mask months after being vaccinated, a move that would seem unnecessary based on his latest comments (and common sense). Vice President Kamala Harris does the same, even though she also received her final vaccine dose in January. Not content with one mask, both have often doubled up even post-vaccination, wearing some combination of a paper surgical mask, an N95 mask, and a cloth one.

Further mask-signaling, President Biden and the first lady were photographed — maskless — hanging out with former President and First Lady Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, who are both in their nineties. It was perfectly appropriate to remove their masks, since they were vaccinated. But when the Bidens walked outside from the Carter home, they both inexplicably donned masks again.

It’s obvious Biden is wearing his mask as a signal, like the Wisconsin bureaucrats who told their employees to wear masks during Zoom calls from home. But it’s signaling more weakness and inconsistency than anything else.

2. His Tone Is Maddeningly Paternalist

“The choice is yours,” Biden says, between getting a vaccine or wearing a mask. No, the choice to get a vaccine or not is mine, period. So is the choice to wear or not wear a mask.

https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/1392939869115142147

Biden is no stranger to condescension. “If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,” he told radio host Charlamagne Tha God in May 2020.

Vice President Harris has come off as condescending too, from smirking during the presidential debates to her comments that young people are “stupid” and make “really bad decisions.” Biden’s tweet is only the latest example of the administration’s attitude: that you’re too dumb to make your own decisions and need to be told what to do.

The paternalism from this joke of a leader who double-masked for months after getting vaccinated is nasty. ""Clean your room or you're getting a spanking. The choice is yours."" Same energy. https://t.co/Ho6RP04jJF — Kylee Zempel (@kyleezempel) May 13, 2021

3. His Simplistic Ultimatum Is Impossible to Enforce

For Biden’s simplistic “vaccine or mask” dichotomy to actually be enforceable, he would have to station a vaccine TSA agent at the door of every establishment in America. Want to go to the grocery store? If you’re not in a mask, you better have a vaccine passport handy. Planning to stop at a restaurant to grab lunch? Same thing. Going to church? Better bring your mask or vaccination card. But don’t worry, “the choice is yours.”

Unfortunately, I wouldn’t put it past some in the Biden administration to try such a draconian approach. But it’s utterly impractical and inconsistent with every ounce of freedom or federalism.

Either Biden means to try imposing such insanity on the American people, or plenty of sane unvaccinated Americans will simply ditch the mask and let everyone assume they’re vaccinated. That kind of personal freedom and privacy sounds fine to me, but it shows how silly and ineffective Biden’s ultimatum is.

4. Does This Mean Kids Too?

Biden’s Centers for Disease Control announced Wednesday it has approved the Pfizer vaccine under emergency use authorization for children as young as 12 years old. Does Biden intend to force masks on preteens ad infinitum unless they also vaccinate?

As of April 2021, 277 of coronavirus-related deaths in the United States were of children under the age of 18. While it goes without saying that each of those deaths is tragic, that represents 0.0005 of all coronavirus-related deaths in the United States, or 0.05 percent.

Forcing children to wear masks indefinitely or get vaccinated is deeply foolish, especially this early in the vaccine testing process. Although the vaccine has been given “emergency use authorization,” it is still not fully approved by the Federal Drug Administration. Taking the shot may be well worth it for older Americans who are more at risk, but the potential unknown side effects on fertility, blood clotting, and more make it much less clear for young people.

5. On The Bright Side, Does This Mean Masks Exempt You From Vaccine Passports?

Fat chance — the Biden administration’s plan for overreach is far more invasive than his “the choice is yours” rhetoric tries to suggest. Back in March, the Biden White House was already working with corporations to develop a “vaccine passport” system.

Don’t let the president’s tweet fool you into thinking even a mask will save you from soon having to show proof of vaccination to fly, attend mass gatherings, and more. If your freedoms as an American citizen aren’t enough to protect from this kind of government micromanagement, a flimsy paper mask won’t do much.

His Returns Show Joe Biden Has Been Dodging Taxes While Urging Hikes,"On Monday, the delayed due date for filing federal taxes for the last calendar year, the White House made a theatrical show of releasing President Biden’s 2020 tax returns. In so doing, the new administration wanted to show a contrast with Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, who did not release his tax returns.

But while the White House emphasized the release of Biden’s returns, it does not want reporters to scrutinize the content of those returns, because doing so would highlight a pattern of hypocritical behavior by the current president and his family. To wit: For the fourth year running, the First Family used a questionable tax loophole to avoid paying more than $500,000 in Medicare and Obamacare taxes — a loophole that the Biden administration now claims it wants to close.

Corporate Profits vs. Wages

The loophole comes because Joe Biden and his wife Jill categorized much of their book and speech revenue as profits from two corporations they created, rather than as taxable wages. Under current law, corporate profits are not subject to payroll taxes, meaning the Bidens avoided paying 3.8 percent in taxes — a 2.9 percent levy that funds Medicare, and a 0.9 percent tax created by Section 9015 of Obamacare that funds that law — on every dollar they categorized as corporate profits rather than wages.

The Bidens exploited this loophole most aggressively in 2017 and 2018 when Joe Biden earned millions through a reported $8 million book advance and various speaking engagements. Because Biden spent 2019 and 2020 running for president, the couple’s income — and therefore their ability to use this loophole — dropped. In 2020, Joe Biden reported no income at all from his corporation, and therefore could not utilize this loophole to reduce his tax bill.

But Jill Biden continued to use this loophole in 2020 on earnings from her corporation. As the chart below shows, the Bidens avoided a total of $516,992 in taxes over the past four years:

2017 Return 2018 Return 2019 Return 2020 Return Total Wages Paid $245,833 $500,000 $308,932 $200,000 Total Corporate Profits $10,048,739 $3,236,764 $228,703 $90,854 Medicare Taxes Avoided (2.9% of Corporate Profits) $291,413 $93,866 $6,632 $2,635 Obamacare Taxes Avoided (0.9% of Corporate Profits) $90,439 $29,131 $2,058 $818 Total Taxes Avoided $381,852 $122,997 $8,691 $3,452

To put this tax evasion into context, while the Bidens avoided $394,547 in Medicare taxes over the past four years, the Urban Institute calculated that the average couple who retired last year would have paid a total of $161,000 in Medicare taxes over their entire working lives.

The Bidens also avoided $122,446 in Obamacare taxes, even as Biden’s campaign spent last year highlighting his supposedly personal connections to, and passion for, that law. The candidate’s actions belied his rhetoric, however: Biden went out of his way to avoid paying Obamacare taxes, using a loophole that tax experts said he put in place solely to reduce his (Obamacare) tax bill.

Hypocrisy Personified

Having dodged more than half a million dollars in taxes over the past four years by characterizing most of his family’s earnings as corporate profits rather than wages, what does Joe Biden now want to do? He wants to eliminate the loophole he so shamelessly — and recently — exploited.

The last paragraph of the administration’s American Families Plan, released last month, includes this language:

Finally, high-income workers and investors generally pay a 3.8 percent Medicare tax on their earnings, but the application is inconsistent across taxpayers due to holes in the law. The President’s tax reform would apply the taxes consistently to those making over $400,000, ensuring that all high-income Americans pay the same Medicare taxes.

Joe Biden knows all about the “inconsistent application” of this 3.8 percent tax due to “holes in the law,” because he exploited those holes himself. Now, after dodging more than half a million dollars in Medicare and Obamacare taxes, Biden suddenly got religion, and wants to close this loophole for others.

The ironies don’t end there. In a recent speech on his tax plan, Biden claimed that “we’re not going to deprive [wealthy] executives” of “their second or third home:”

That choice of words seems very intriguing from someone who, while dodging hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal taxes, used the money he saved to buy a $2.7 million beach house in Delaware and rent this mansion outside Washington:

Mr. President, Audit Thyself

The president’s tax plan also includes provisions to “increase investment in the IRS, while ensuring that the additional resources go toward enforcement against those with the highest incomes.” If Joe Biden believes in this provision so much, he should start by asking the IRS to audit his 2017 through 2020 tax returns, given that tax experts have called his use of the “corporate profits” loophole so aggressive as to potentially violate federal guidelines.

The current febrile atmosphere of cynicism and contempt toward Washington stems in large part from politicians who say one thing and do another. For Joe Biden — who preaches “tax fairness,” yet uses loopholes he wants to eliminate for others — to understand this phenomenon should not take much effort. He only need to look in the mirror.

All Biden Needed To Not Screw Up Was Stay In His Basement. He Failed,"President Joe Biden inherited a nation poised for a tremendous post-COVID resurgence, requiring only mid-level competence to keep things on track. Unfortunately for America, he hasn’t been up to the task.

The biggest issue facing the nation for the past year obviously has been the coronavirus, which has killed more than 600,000 Americans, infected nearly 34 million, and forced the economy into a near standstill last year.

As he entered office, however, the good news for Biden was that multiple vaccines already had been developed and with doses ramping up, thanks to former President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed. The economy was rebounding, and millions of jobs had returned. What was required of the new president was to not screw things up.

But at the four-month mark of his administration, Biden has badly mismanaged things, contributing to a cluster of problems that are increasingly spiraling out of control. Punchbowl News, an inside-the-Beltway email newsletter, downplayed Biden’s predicaments as mere “brushfires,” as though they were minor headaches to be addressed without much concern. But the nation is facing serious problems either immediately or lurking around the corner.

Millions of Americans had to calculate whether they had enough gas in their cars to keep them mobile after a cyber attack on the Colonial Pipeline, which carries 45 percent of the fuel used by the east coast of the United States. With almost immediate gasoline shortages, rising prices, and gas stations shutting down, the nation would rightly expect the president to snap to attention. Instead, administration officials seemed to shrug at the growing calamity and declined to even offer an opinion on whether the pipeline operator should pay a ransom to the hackers.

It’s a “private sector decision, and the administration has not offered further advice at this time,” said Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technologies. This was three days after the attack had shut down the pipeline.

Despite the public nonchalance, the Biden White House was “acutely sensitive to the images of lines outside gas stations before Memorial Day,” reported Axios, which also noted Biden was being likened to former President Jimmy Carter, who oversaw dramatic fuel shortages in the 1970s and a national malaise. This comparison was made somewhat easier by the recent release of a bizarrely proportioned photo of the Bidens visiting the Carters at home just a few weeks earlier.

In the end, despite longstanding warnings against making payments to terrorists — largely because it incentivizes future attacks — the pipeline company paid a $5 million ransom.

While the gas shortages were occupying Americans’ daily lives, there was all-out war brewing in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. Trump had shepherded historic diplomatic agreements between Israel and Arab nations through the Abraham Accords, but Biden seems determined to disrupt the delicate peace in the region.

Biden restored $235 million in aid to the Palestinians, clearly signaling to Hamas — designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the Clinton administration in 1997 — that American support for Israel had weakened. Prominent critics say such a shift “invites precisely the kinds of violence we are seeing in the region today.” As a result, the Palestinian militants are emboldened.

Not content with roiling conditions in other parts of the world, Biden has also caused a catastrophe on our southern border. He campaigned for president promising amnesty for illegal immigrants, taxpayer-provided health care, work permits, support for sanctuary cities, and ending deportations.

Upon assuming office, he began dismantling Trump’s effective policies. This naturally created a border surge. It’s little wonder that migrants quickly began arriving at our border wearing Biden-themed T-shirts.

Despite months of the White House refusing to call the situation a “crisis,” that’s exactly what it is. In April alone, border apprehensions by federal officials jumped to 178,622, an increase from 173,348 apprehensions the previous month. Even more shocking is the fact that April’s number represents a more than tenfold increase compared to April 2020.

Many of those seeking to enter our country illegally are doing so to find work, something that millions of legal residents are declining to do. The April report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics was expected to show more than 1 million jobs added, but came in at only 266,000 new jobs, with the unemployment rate ticking up to 6.1 percent. For an economy that should be roaring through a strong recovery, these were dismal numbers, causing many to charge that federal unemployment benefits were too much competition for employers looking to hire.

Yet Biden rejected the notion that unemployment checks had anything to do with the weak jobs totals. “No, nothing measurable,” he said.

The data show, however, that 8.1 million jobs are currently available in America and small businesses across the country are complaining no one will accept their offers of employment. This is despite businesses offering higher wages, signing bonuses, cash just for showing up to an interview, and other enticements.

Now? There is credible fear of inflation. So what is Biden’s proposed solution to the problem? Why, more of what likely helped cause it, of course.

Coming into office, Biden was set up nicely for a smooth glide toward nearly effortless success. Like a golfer going into the final hole of a tournament with a three-shot lead, he needed only to keep the ball in the short grass to win. Instead, Biden has been in the woods, in the bunker, and in the water, seeing his chances for easy glory fading away.

Russell Brand Rips Media And Big Tech For Colluding To Protect Joe Biden,"English actor and comedian Russell Brand ripped the corporate media’s collusion with Silicon Valley tech giants as “troubling” in his latest video podcast Thursday featuring independent journalist Glenn Greenwald.

In the episode, Brand and Greenwald highlight the media’s reflexive lurch to dispute blockbuster revelations surrounding the Biden family which emerged last fall in the heat of the presidential campaign. Twitter and Facebook notoriously censored stories related to the reporting and blocked links to the New York Post’s stories.

“I’m not a pro-Republican person, I don’t see myself that way,” Brand said, “However, it seems to me – what reason is Hunter Biden sat on the board of an energy company in Ukraine? What reason is James Biden sat on the board, or receiving payments from an energy company in China?”

Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, and James Biden, Joe’s brother, each reportedly profited from lucrative overseas business ventures leveraging the family name to land high-dollar deals which presented grave conflicts of interest in the process. Brand said the Biden’s overseas connections should be public knowledge. He continued:

We’re talking about sleaze, corruption, financial misdemeanors, and relationships between corporations, big business, and politicians. For me, revelations that there are financial connections between energy companies in Ukraine, energy companies in China, and the Biden family are troubling. That should be public knowledge. And it’s even more troubling that Twitter, and Facebook, and the media at large deliberately kept it out of the new because they didn’t want it to influence the election.

While Joe Biden was vice president, Hunter served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, with a reputation for corruption, raking in upwards of $50,000 a month despite no prior experience. While Hunter Biden’s position on the board had already been well known and emphasized throughout President Donald Trump’s first impeachment, the New York Post published a new bombshell in October revealing the Democratic nominee had been lying when he made repeated claims he never discussed his son’s overseas business ventures with either Hunter, “or with anyone else.” Joe Biden even fat-shamed a voter at an Iowa town hall who pressed the candidate on the issue.

Emails from a laptop which evidently belonged to Hunter Biden, which Hunter revealed in April this year “certainly” could be his after Democrats and legacy media declared it Russian disinformation, revealed Hunter introduced his vice president father to a Burisma senior adviser named Vadym Pozharski and the three had an in-person meeting.

Twitter and Facebook suppressed the Post’s reporting, and the paper’s account was even locked on Twitter for weeks. Democrats embraced their routine storyline of Russian disinformation in order to smear the disparaging revelations. On-the-record statements from the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Department of National Intelligence, and the Department of State declared they knew for a fact that it was not Russian disinformation.

Greenwald, who co-founded The Intercept in 2014, resigned from the paper shortly after in the midst of the election when editors refused to publish Greenwald’s criticisms of the Democrat nominee and the Biden family’s potentially criminal conflicts of interest.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/25/russell-brand-rips-media-and-big-tech-for-colluding-to-protect-joe-biden/,2021-05-25
Biden's ATF Pick Refuses To Say If Hunter Biden Should Be Prosecuted For Illegal Gun Purchase,"David Chipman, Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, refused to say during a Senate Judiciary hearing on Wednesday whether Hunter Biden should be prosecuted for an illegal firearms purchase in 2018.

According to a March report by Politico, subsequent reporting by The Federalist, and Hunter Biden’s own memoir, the president’s son appears to have lied about his drug use on an ATF form, a felony that earlier in the hearing Chipman had considered a serious crime. When Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, specifically asked the ATF nominee about the Biden son’s gun purchase, however, Chipman evaded the question.

“Mr. Chipman, you testified to Sen. Lee that is it a serious felony to lie on a background check application, and I agree,” Cotton said. “The ATF form 4473 asks, are you an unlawful user of or addicted to any drug or uncontrolled [sic] substance. If an applicant checks yes, they cannot purchase a firearm.”

The senator continued, recounting the events that transpired around the Hunter Biden gun scandal, saying:

On March 25, Politico reported that Hunter Biden, President Biden’s son, applied for a handgun that was later thrown in the trash and had to be recovered by Secret Service agents in 2018. Politico reported that Hunter Biden completed this background check and answered no to the question of whether he was an unlawful user of or addicted to any drug. Hunter Biden has since published a book and gone on a nationwide book tour conducting numerous interviews stating that he was in fact very much addicted to drugs at the same time that he purchased this firearm. This would mean that by his own admission, hunter Biden lied on that form and, by your earlier testimony, committed a serious felony. Should Hunter Biden be prosecuted for breaking this law?”

“If I’m confirmed as ATF director, it will be my responsibility to enforce all federal laws without political favor,” Chipman said without specifically addressing the Biden question. “I do not know any factors in this particular case, but I am familiar with the press account of it.”

Because the Biden gun fiasco happened in 2018 and the statute of limitations is only five years, Cotton said, “This should be a fairly easy case to investigate.”

“Can I get your commitment that if you’re confirmed, you will in fact look into this matter and refer it for prosecution if you find that Hunter Biden violated a law?” Cotton pressed Chipman.

“Senator, what I will assure you is that if ATF director, I will ensure that all violations of law are investigated and referred,” Chipman replied, again evading the Hunter Biden inquiry. “I’m not sure that it has not been investigated.”

The incident to which Cotton referred to was first reported by Politico and involves a gun that Hunter’s girlfriend Hallie, the wife of his late brother Beau Biden, found when she was rifling through Hunter’s truck on ill-defined “suspicions she had,” according to a Delaware police report. She dumped the firearm into a trash can behind a grocery store, which was across from a high school.

According to a firearm transaction record obtained by The Federalist, the Biden son had purchased that gun, a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver with a talo finish, after replying “no” to a question on an ATF transaction form inquiring whether he was the “unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.”

Hunter’s history of drug abuse is well established. His drug habit contributed to his failed marriage, discharge from the military, and several stints in rehab. Hunter was also suspected of smoking crack cocaine in the VIP room of a strip club he frequented, an incident that occurred in “late 2018.” Hunter purchased the handgun on Oct. 12, 2018, which would be “late 2018.”

In a text allegedly sent by Hunter, he essentially acknowledged as much, implying his drug use was an ongoing issue. Hallie “stole the gun out of my truck lock box … because she was scared I would harm myself due to my drug and alcohol problem and our volatile relationship and that she was afraid for the kids,” the message reads.

BREAKING: Text message from Hunter Biden confirms involvement of Secret Service in his illegal firearm incident pic.twitter.com/1vb8GGJidX — AmericaFest Poso (@JackPosobiec) March 26, 2021

The same text exchange also corroborated Politico’s reporting of Secret Service agents’ involvement, although both the Secret Service and the White House have denied that. Shortly after police and the FBI arrived at the grocery store where the gun had been dumped, two Secret Service agents reportedly visited the gun store where Hunter had bought the firearm earlier that month. They had “badges and identification cards,” according to Politico’s sources, and told the owner to turn over the Firearms Transaction Record from the purchase.

The store owner held onto the form until the ATF could review it because he “suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” according to multiple people with a “firsthand knowledge of the episode.”

Despite Chipman’s unwillingness to commit to investigating and prosecuting the son of the president who nominated him to the ATF post, the nominee is enamored by sweeping gun control proposals, being a policy adviser for the anti-gun group Giffords and supporting a ban on “assault weapons,” an undefined category of firearms and a left-wing talking point. During his Senate testimony, Chipman affirmed his belief that some of America’s most popular semiautomatic modern sporting rifles should be banned outright.

“The AR-15 is one of if not the most popular rifle in America. It’s not a machine gun, it’s a rifle,” said Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas during the hearing. “Your public position is that you want to ban AR-15s, is that correct?”

“With respect to the AR-15, I support a ban as has been presented in a Senate bill and supported by the president,” Chipman said. “The AR-15 is a gun I was issued on ATF’s SWAT team, and it’s a particularly lethal weapon. And regulating it, as other particularly lethal weapons, I have advocated for.”

During the Senate hearing, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said that confirming Biden’s ATF pick would be “like putting a tobacco executive in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, or Antifa in charge of the Portland Police Department.” Twenty Republican attorneys general sent a letter to U.S. Senate leaders on Tuesday, asking the lawmakers to pass on confirming Chipman due to his history of anti-gun activism.

“If the facts are as clear-cut as they appear to be based on Mr. Biden’s own admission, I would expect to see criminal charges forthcoming,” Cotton said after questioning Chipman. “But I would say that when a case is as high-profile as this, if there is not an answer for the American people and public, it severely undermines the confidence in our gun laws, as well as the ATF and the Department of Justice, if there are not criminal consequences.”

Biden Shouldn’t Assume Netanyahu’s Successor Will Be A Pushover,"Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, has fought tooth and nail to hold onto power during a grueling two-year-long electoral standoff with open opponents and sometime-allies denying him the votes to form a stable majority government. But with the prospect of a fifth election in two years, and with it clear that animus for Netanyahu is the sticking point, it appears the logjam is about to be broken.

The decision of Naftali Bennett, the leader of the Yamina Party to the right of Netanyahu’s Likud, to join forces with Yair Lapid, the head of the centrist opposition Yesh Atid Party, has created the likelihood that a “government of change” will be sworn in within the next week. That means that unless he can somehow sabotage that deal at the last minute, after 12 consecutive years as prime minister, Netanyahu will be heading to the opposition benches.

The proposed coalition involves parties of both the right and the left and will rely on the votes of an Arab political party that will remain outside of the government to be sworn in. As such, it’s far from clear whether the Bennett-Lapid alliance can survive for long.

But given the only viable alternative to this scenario is a fifth election and implacable opposition to Netanyahu from a majority of the members of the Knesset, or parliament, it appears Bennett will soon become prime minister as part of a bargain in which he will serve for two years followed by two years of Lapid as the country’s leader.

For many Israelis, this is hard to swallow. Leaving aside the plurality of Israelis that continue to support Netanyahu and his remaining religious party allies, the rest of the electorate is also not entirely pleased with the compromises for both left and right that are obligatory to achieving this outcome. There’s little doubt, however, that President Biden will be among those cheering for the new coalition.

While Biden likes to boast of his long friendship with Netanyahu, there is little love lost between him and the president as well as the rest of the Obama administration alumni that make up his foreign policy team. They rightly viewed Netanyahu as an ally of former President Donald Trump and an implacable foe of their goal of reinstating Barack Obama’s disastrously weak and soon-to-expire nuclear deal with Iran.

President Joe Biden and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken are also seeking to re-establish ties with the Palestinians. President Donald Trump had cut off aid to the Palestinian Authority because of its support for terror as well as its longstanding refusal to make peace with Israel.

Biden has already moved to restore some of that aid even though U.S. law forbids aiding the P.A. so long as it continues to pay convicted terrorists and their families salaries and pensions. In the aftermath of the latest fighting between Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization, Blinken seems also intent on aiding Gaza, something that will inevitably wind up strengthening the strip’s Islamist rulers.

From their point of view, and that of the Democratic Party’s left-wing base, which is increasingly hostile to Israel, Netanyahu’s removal is bound to make it easier to achieve both of their Middle East objectives.

On the surface, that conclusion seems hard to refute. Netanyahu was burdened by all of the baggage he accumulated during his long career. The corruption charges lodged against him may be flimsy but also undermined his authority. Yet it was equally clear that Netanyahu was his country’s most able and experienced statesman, and few would argue that either Bennett or Lapid has his stature or skills as a diplomat and national leader.

Whatever his faults, in Netanyahu’s tenure Israel became both more secure and wealthier as he guided it toward alliances with moderate Arab nations and helped enable its First World “Start-Up Nation” economy to thrive. Indeed, he was coming off a year of unique achievements in expertly handling the coronavirus pandemic and joining the historic Abraham Accords of normalization with Arab and Muslim states.

President Biden, however, would be wrong to either underestimate his successor or to assume that the divided government he’ll lead will be vulnerable to U.S. pressure. The new Israeli coalition will be largely paralyzed on many issues, especially regarding settlements and the peace process. But that’s also because it is predicated on the notion that war and peace issues have been largely decided for the moment.

Indeed, parties of the left and right wouldn’t think of serving with each other had there not been a realization of a consensus that stretches from the moderate left to the right that the PA is no Palestinian peace partner. Similarly, there is an equally broad consensus on the need to stop Iran. Tehran’s aid to terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah comprises a deadly threat to Israel’s security in addition to the existential peril from its quest for nuclear weapons.

While elements of the new coalition will applaud Biden’s dangerous policies, the cabinet will be dominated by those who will largely continue Netanyahu’s policies on both the Iranian and Palestinian fronts. And if, as President Barack Obama and before him Bill Clinton did, Biden tries to intervene by aiding those who would undermine Bennett from the left, that will only make the Israeli right stronger.

Bennett will make history by becoming both the first observant Jew (he wears a kippah) to serve as prime minister as well as the first one who is a child of American immigrants. He knows he will have no future in politics if he is seen as betraying the country’s interests for the sake of office or good relations with Biden, as Netanyahu is already claiming.

The inherent instability of this ramshackle alliance is obvious. But, ironically, the one factor that may ensure its longevity is the certain knowledge that its failure is the only thing that could bring Netanyahu back to power.

Biden’s flirtation with terrorist-funding Palestinians and his obsession with returning to a policy of empowering and enriching Iran gave Hamas and the Palestinian Authority an incentive to gin up the controversies that led to the recent fighting. While Trump left him a stable region that was uniting against Iran and its terrorist allies, Biden’s policy shifts are not so much destroying his predecessor’s legacy as setting the stage for a renewal of violence and chaos.

Rather than planning on aiding Biden’s feckless appeasement of Iran and its terrorist allies, Bennett and Lapid are hoping Netanyahu’s absence will make it easier for them to persuade Biden to change his mind. Should Biden and Blinken ignore their pleas, they’ll find the new Israeli leadership no more likely to accept American decisions that endanger their country than the old one.

Hunter Biden Played Key Role In Deal With Democratic Firm Under Investigation,"President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, reportedly played a pivotal role in securing a deal between the Democrat consulting firm Blue Star Strategies and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

In 2015, Burisma — where Hunter Biden raked in upwards of $50,000 per month in excess compensation despite no prior energy experience — hired Blue Star Strategies in a deal which Hunter Biden served as the primary conduit, according to the Washington Free Beacon Wednesday.

Citing emails from Hunter Biden’s laptop, the Free Beacon reported Hunter Biden wrote to Burisma executive Vadym Pozharski in 2015 encouraging Pozharski to hire Blue Star in effort to court U.S. suport for the Ukrainian company’s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. At the time, Zlochevsky was under investigation by the United Kingdom for paying alleged bribes to secure drilling contracts.

Last fall, Senate investigators also accused Zlochevsky of paying a $7 million dollar bribe to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office to close other investigations in Ukraine and release $23 million in assets frozen by British officials.

“You should go ahead and sign,” Hunter Biden wrote to Pozharski of the Blue Star contract. “Looking forward to getting started on this.”

Blue Star Strategies is owned by former Clinton Administration officials Sally Painter and Karen Tramontano.

According to the Free Beacon, the “ultimate purpose” of the partnership was to shut down cases against Zlochevsky.

“Neither Biden nor the Blue Star founders registered their work under the Lobbying Disclosure Act or the Foreign Agents Registration Act,” the Free Beacon reported.

The arrangement, meanwhile, is under investigation by federal prosecutors in Delaware as part of a probe reported by Politico into Biden’s taxes and whether Blue Star violated foreign agent laws.

Another trove of emails published by the New York Post in May also shed light on Biden’s conflicts of interest surrounding his potentially criminal overseas business ventures while his father served as the Obama White House’s “public face” on Ukraine.

Emails show then-Vice President Joe Biden met with several of Hunter Biden’s business partners at an exclusive Georgetown restaurant in 2015, as opposed to merely Pozharski as revealed in October.

Recent revelations surrounding Hunter Biden’s business dealings have also been plagued by personal scandal.

According to an audiotape published by the Daily Mail, Hunter Biden is heard bragging to a friend about smoking crack with former Washington D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, an infamous addict who once served six months in federal prison after a 1990 FBI sting operation. In the recording, Hunter Biden said the two smoked crack in the bathroom of a local bar while Hunter was a junior at Georgetown University, contradicting his own memoir where he wrote that a teenage arrest scared him from drugs until after college.

New text messages also published by the Daily Mail this week accuse Hunter Biden of repeatedly calling his white attorney the N-word in 2018 and 2019.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/09/hunter-biden-played-pivotal-role-in-deal-with-democratic-strategists-under-federal-investigation/,2021-06-09
15 Times The Biden Administration Snapped At Its Media Cheerleaders,"Joe Biden’s favorite ice cream flavor. Kamala Harris’ oh-so-cool Timberland boots. The Biden family dogs. Playing Mario Kart at Camp David with the Biden grandkids. The president’s early bedtime and fires in the Oval Office fireplace. These are just a handful of the softball topics the corporate media have fawned over since even before Biden took office, a drastic reversal of tone to their antagonistic coverage of the Trump administration.

But the corporate media fan club isn’t enough to keep Biden, Harris, and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki from repeatedly snapping at the occasional reporter who asks a real question. When topics more substantive than ice cream crop up, Biden often falls back on his defensive “Give me a break,” or worse.

Trump certainly lost patience with the media too, after they repeatedly smeared him and invented scandals, like the one insisting he tear-gassed “peaceful protesters” for a photo op at Lafayette Park when it was actually Democrat D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s police who used tear gas on the crowds. But far from the hostile relationship between the press and the Trump administration, Biden has no reason nor excuse to be so snappy with the media, most of whom continue their one-sided love affair unfazed.

Here are 15 times Biden, Harris, and Psaki couldn’t handle substantive questions and snapped at the messengers instead.

1. ‘120 Days’

Just Monday, President Biden snapped at the media and made a factual gaffe in the same sentence. In response to a reporter’s question at the G7 summit about steel and aluminum sanctions, Biden cut him off with the words, “A hundred and twenty days. Give me a break. Need time.” Actually, Biden has been in office for 25 days more than that.

2. ‘That’s a Hell of a Lie’

On the campaign trail in 2020, a reporter asked about the president’s son Hunter and his shady business dealings “There is no controversy about my son!” Biden snapped. “That’s a hell of a lie!”

https://twitter.com/AndrewSolender/status/1320149216761683969

3. ‘Only You Would Ask That’

When Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked Biden in 2019 about revelations that scandal-plagued Hunter had a child he’d previously denied, Biden told him, “Only you would ask that.”

“You’re a good man. Classy,” Biden added with a sarcastic smile.

Doocy: Mr. Vice President I’m wondering if you have a comment on this report & court filing out of AR that your son Hunter just made you a Grandfather again. Biden: No that’s a private matter I have no comment. But only you would ask that. You're a good man, good man. Classy. pic.twitter.com/FwV2sJNuHK — Pat Ward (@WardDPatrick) November 22, 2019

4. ‘You’re Getting Nervous, Man’

CBS reporter Ed O’Keefe asked candidate Biden why he wouldn’t accept an apology from Sen. Bernie Sanders over an op-ed by a Sanders supporter accusing Biden of corruption. Turning to face O’Keefe and reaching for his shoulders, Biden bizarrely snapped “Why why why why why why why!” in the reporter’s face. “You’re getting nervous, man, calm down,” he continued.

5. ‘I’m Not Going To Negotiate With You On That’

On Biden’s “infrastructure” plan, CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond asked, “Where is the room for negotiations with Republicans? What parts of your plan are you willing to do away with, given the definition of infrastructure here is so different?”

Placing a patronizing hand on the reporter’s shoulder, Biden retorted with an awkward laugh, “I’m not going to negotiate with you on that.”

6. ‘I’m Worried About You’

When a reporter questioned the president why he continued to wear a mask after being vaccinated, Biden responded, “because I’m worried about you.” After an awkward silence, he quickly added, “It’s a joke, it’s a joke.”

7. ‘You’re Not Telling The Truth Here’

Univision’s Jorge Ramos interviewed Biden about the Obama administration’s policies of putting minors who cross the border unaccompanied into what the press called “cages” under Trump.

“Many people would say they were cages,” Ramos noted of the facilities. “Look, you know you’re not telling the truth here about the comparison of the two things,” Biden snapped back.

8. ‘Right Up Your Alley’

After CBS reporter Bo Erickson asked for Biden’s response to The New York Post’s revelations of incriminating emails on Hunter Biden’s laptop, Biden called it “another smear campaign,” and snapped at Erickson: “Right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask.”

I asked Joe Biden: What is your response to the NYPost story about your son, sir? He called it a “smear campaign” and then went after me. “I know you’d ask it. I have no response, it’s another smear campaign, right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask.” pic.twitter.com/Eo6VD4TqxD — Bo Erickson CBS (@BoKnowsNews) October 17, 2020

9. ‘Why Are You the Only Guy that Always Shouts out Questions’

After Erickson asked Biden whether he would “encourage teachers’ unions to cooperate more to bring kids back to classrooms,” Biden snapped at Erickson again. “Why are you the only guy that always shouts out questions?” the president responded.

10. ‘Give Me a Break’

Biden is well-known for the phrase “give me a break,” but it was particularly notable when he used it to snap at reporters on only his second day in office. When asked whether his administration’s vaccine goals were high enough, the new president retorted, “When I announced it, you guys said it was not possible. Come on, give me a break, man.”

In reality, corporate media outlets called vaccine goals impossible under the Trump administration. By the time Biden entered office — with the vaccine rollout already well established by Trump — CNN senior medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta called Biden’s vaccine goal “very doable.” Even the reporter’s question asking if Biden’s goal was “high enough” reflects the change in the media’s attitude.

It’s not just Biden snapping at the media. Vice President Kamala Harris was criticized recently for her numerous instances of snapping at questions about her failure to visit the U.S.-Mexico border amid an ongoing illegal immigration crisis.

11. ‘I Haven’t Been To Europe’

When NBC’s Lester Holt asked if she had future plans to visit the border, noting she hadn’t yet been, Harris snapped, “And I haven’t been to Europe.” Biden assigned charge of the border crisis to Harris in March. Meanwhile, apprehensions of migrants trying to cross the border illegally are breaking record highs.

12. ‘I’ve Been to the Border and I Will Go Again’

Just days after snapping at Holt, Harris lashed out again in response to questions about the border crisis. “Why not go to the border as well?” a reporter asked the vice president in Mexico City. “Listen, I’ve been to the border before and I’ll go again,” Harris said with her trademark laugh.

13. ‘I’m Not Finished’

“I’m not finished!” Another cringeworthy answer from Kamala about whether she will go to the border… pic.twitter.com/7VcPxLnMHr — Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany) June 11, 2021

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki is clearly taking cues on how to treat the press from her bosses, running up her own tally of snappy responses.

14. ‘The VP Is Allowed to Get a Snack’

When the New York Post’s Steven Nelson asked Psaki why Harris took time to visit a Chicago bakery instead of going to the border, Psaki retorted, “She got a snack. I think she’s allowed to do that.”

Reporter: VP Harris was seen at a bakery in Chicago, is she still working on immigration?

I think she’s allowed to do that.’ pic.twitter.com/x0WD6WPFVf — NowThis (@nowthisnews) April 8, 2021

15. ‘I Don’t Appreciate The Putting Words In My Mouth’

Politico’s Anita Kumar asked Psaki about the administration’s policy toward China during a briefing in February. “That sounds a lot like the strategy is not to talk to [Xi Jinping] at this time because you’re talking about speaking to allies and making other calls first. Have they requested a call?” Kumar asked. “I don’t have anything more for you … I don’t appreciate the putting words in my mouth,” Psaki retorted.

"At NATO And G7, Biden Advances An ‘America Last’ Foreign Policy","The most important takeaway from the recent G7 and NATO summits in Europe isn’t President Biden’s many embarrassing and unsettling mental lapses, long pauses, and rambling non sequiturs, but the clear message coming out of these meetings: the United States is returning to an Obama-Biden era “America Last” foreign policy that puts the interests of multilateral institutions and international partnerships above the interests of the American people.

That policy shift was perhaps best encapsulated in a quip from President Emmanuel Macron of France, who said of Biden, “It is great to have a U.S. president who’s part of the club and very willing to cooperate.” And of course it’s true. At the close of the G7 Summit, Biden boasted that America is “back at the table,” and described the summit as “extraordinarily collaborative.”

So what did this extraordinarily collaborative club manage to accomplish? One of the G7’s most pressing tasks heading into the summit was what, if anything, it would do about an aggressive and intransigent China. What the group settled on was doing almost nothing.

With each passing week it becomes more obvious that COVID-19 almost certainly originated in a lab in Wuhan, China. We can’t say for sure because the Chinese Communist Party has been blocking efforts to discover the origins of the virus ever since the outbreak began. But at this point, with zero evidence that the virus emerged naturally, the answer seems obvious enough.

Yet all the G7 could manage was a tepid call for a new World Health Organization-backed study on COVID’s origins, as if another investigation by the compromised WHO will yield something more. The G7 also cooked up a plan to dump $40 trillion into infrastructure (a bill likely to be footed largely by American taxpayers) for the developing world to compete with China’s Belt and Road initiative.

At the summit’s close, the group’s final communiqué made no mention of China’s systematic persecution of Muslim Uyghurs or other minority religious groups, and made no real commitment to combat China’s use of forced labor. Instead, the group weakly called on Beijing to respect “fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang.” Yeah, that’ll show them.

Or consider the Biden administration’s plan for dealing with Russia. Biden’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week comes hot on the heels of recent cyberattacks against U.S. infrastructure likely backed by Moscow, as well as Biden’s capitulation on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will give Russia remarkable leverage over Germany’s energy supply.

Democrats complained endlessly that Trump wasn’t tough enough on Russia, but so far Biden has projected nothing but weakness toward Moscow. The president also doesn’t seem up to the task of dealing with Putin.

Ahead of the much-anticipated meeting, Biden gave a bizarre press conference on Monday, pausing for an uncomfortably long time and seeming to lose his train of thought when asked a basic question by CNN’s Jeff Zeleny about whether Biden still considers Putin a “killer.” In the end, he essentially said nothing.

President Biden is asked by CNN’s Jeff Zeleny about if he still believes Vladimir Putin is a “killer” Watch what happens:

pic.twitter.com/D3JcKcQ36I — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) June 14, 2021

But Biden need not say much of anything on Russia. The idea that warmed-over Obama-ism is going to give Putin pause is a joke. Recall that it was on Obama’s watch that Moscow began a permanent occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia, annexed Crimea, started a war in southeast Ukraine, intervened in Syria, established operational bases in the Middle East, and gave shelter to Edward Snowden.

Biden said Monday that in his meeting with Putin this week he’s going to “make it clear what the red lines are.” But after eight years of Obama and Biden’s disastrous foreign policy the whole world knows exactly where the red lines are — and exactly what they’re worth.

In all of this, Biden maintains the long trajectory of his abysmal foreign policy record. Over the past four decades the world has changed much, but Biden hasn’t. He has been wrong on almost every major international issue of his time, often for shallow, partisan reasons.

Indeed, his reflective hostility to President Trump’s foreign policy is reminiscent of his hostility toward President Ronald Reagan’s foreign policy. After a Biden speech at Harvard in 1987, Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen remarked that Biden “has a reputation as a politician whose intellect is no match for his glibness.” Biden’s problem, wrote Cohen, is that he purports to tackle difficult questions like when the United States should use force in pursuing its foreign policy goals, but then never bothers with the details.

He set out three criteria: (1) Only if our vital interests are threatened. (2) Only if the intervention is ‘right.’ (3) Only if the use of force has a ‘high probability of succeeding.’



All of that sounded good, but Biden never bothered to explain his terms. He mentioned Nicaragua as an example of where the Reagan administration had failed to apply those criteria. But these happen to be precisely the criteria the president says he has used. Reagan says Nicaragua is vital, that the fight against an avowedly Marxist regime is ‘right,’ and that the effort to topple the Sandinistas would have ‘a high probability of succeeding’ if only Congress would fund the effort.



Similarly, Biden characterized U.S. escalation in the Persian Gulf as reactive, which surely it is, but he did not say what he would do differently if he were president. Several times, he said the containment policy, first enunciated by Harry S Truman, is outmoded. But he never acknowledged that the Reagan administration agrees — and has set out to roll back communist advances.

Today, Biden seems similarly out of touch. One of the reasons Trump quickly gained so much support in the 2016 GOP primaries, and continues to enjoy broad support among Republicans, was his willingness to criticize the failures of a bipartisan, multilateralist foreign policy that has dominated Washington for decades, and that particularly dominated the Obama White House.

Trump criticized America’s endless wars and interventions overseas, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan, even if it meant going after fellow Republicans. He questioned the usefulness of NATO and argued that America’s allies weren’t paying their fair share. He eschewed multilateral treaties and agreements, preferring to deal with other nations one-on-one. In other words, Trump directly attacked the foreign policy establishment in Washington — the “blob” — and it resonated.

Why? Because such attacks tapped into a general sense among many Americans that, whatever the original justification for entities like NATO and the United Nations and the WHO, they no longer serve the interests of the American people, and our leaders should stop pretending that they do.

Biden, by contrast, wants to return to the foreign policy of the Obama era, in which being “part of the club,” means deferential multilateralism that places the American national interest behind the interests of a vast array of allies and partners and international organizations all across the globe. The very notion of national interest, let alone a foreign policy that serves the national interest, is anathema to the foreign policy blob in Washington.

And so it is once again. The Obama-era foreign policy that Biden is trying to resuscitate — weakness toward China and Russia, deference to a comprised WHO, money for Iran, more U.S. troops and NATO funding for Europe, climate change and wokeness at the State Department and the Pentagon — is not for Americans, it’s for the global institutions and interests that benefit from maintaining a pre-Trump foreign policy status quo that puts America, and Americans, last.

"U.S. Catholic Bishops Aren’t Playing Politics With Communion, Biden Is","Should President Joe Biden, a professing Catholic, be allowed to receive Holy Communion despite his ongoing support for abortion?

Of course not. The entire question is a fake controversy ginned up by corporate media hell-bent on smearing Catholic bishops and faithful Catholics everywhere. Those feigning outrage over the idea that Biden would be denied communion are really just outraged by the church’s moral teaching on abortion, and want to change it. For them, as for Biden himself, this isn’t about religion but politics.

The rather narrow question of whether Biden should be allowed to receive communion is not at all complex or unclear. But Biden’s defenders in the press, and even some inside the episcopacy, are making it seem as though it were.

All Catholics know, or should know, that they are not supposed to present themselves for communion if they are objectively in a state of mortal sin. Supporting abortion — or otherwise dissenting from or promoting contrary positions to the Catholic Church’s fundamental dogmatic teaching — puts one in a state of mortal sin. Therefore, politicians who support abortion shouldn’t present themselves for communion, period.

You don’t have to take my word for it. Back in 2004, then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict XVI, wrote a memo entitled, “Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion: General Principles.” The letter was prompted by the presidential candidacy of then-Sen. John Kerry, a Catholic like Biden who insisted that his ongoing, unrepentant support for abortion shouldn’t bar him from taking communion.

To clear things up, Ratzinger sent a letter to the now-disgraced Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, at the time the head of a task force of U.S. bishops studying the question, and Bishop Wilton Gregory, then president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Ratzinger wrote:

Regarding the grave sin of abortion or euthanasia, when a person’s formal cooperation becomes manifest (understood, in the case of a Catholic politician, as his consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws), his pastor should meet with him, instructing him about the Church’s teaching, informing him that he is not to present himself for Holy Communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of sin, and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the Eucharist.



When these precautionary measures have not had their effect or in which they were not possible, and the person in question, with obstinate persistence, still presents himself to receive the Holy Eucharist, the minister of Holy Communion must refuse to distribute it.

As if anticipating the objections of people like Karen Tumulty of the Washington Post, that bishops who want to deny Biden the Eucharist have not taken the same stance against Catholic politicians who support the death penalty, Ratzinger wrote that “not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia… There may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia.”

All of that is crystal clear. It means that Biden — like any other pro-abortion Catholic politician — should not present himself for communion as long as he persists in supporting abortion. If he does, “the minister of Holy Communion must refuse to distribute it,” as Ratzinger said.

This wasn’t a new teaching in 2004. Decades earlier, in 1974, responding to the legalization of abortion in the United States and other countries, the Vatican’s Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued the “Declaration on Procured Abortion,” which was ratified on June 28 of that year by Pope Paul VI. It traces the Church’s unwavering opposition to abortion through the millennia and states plainly that, “It must in any case be clearly understood that whatever may be laid down by civil law in this matter, man can never obey a law which is in itself immoral, and such is the case of a law which would admit in principle the liceity of abortion. Nor can he take part in a propaganda campaign in favor of such a law, or vote for it.”

The press would like us to think that this is all very complicated, that “conservative” U.S. bishops are just politicizing the issue (it’s worth noting that despite the media’s mischaracterizations, there are no “conservative” or “liberal” bishops, only faithful and unfaithful ones). But when the USCCB voted overwhelmingly on Friday to draft a teaching document on the meaning of the Eucharist, they weren’t weaponizing the Eucharist or playing politics, they were simply reiterating what has always been the Catholic Church’s fundamental dogmatic teaching regarding the Eucharist and mortal sin.

It is rather Biden who has politicized the Eucharist by his ongoing defiance of Catholic teaching on this matter. The media have also politicized the issue by framing it in political rather than moral terms, and so have the dozens of U.S. bishops who have refused to take a clear stand for what they know is right.

Indeed, if it weren’t for political considerations, Friday’s vote by the bishops would have been unanimous. If it weren’t for politics, there would be no need to draft a non-binding document to be approved at a later date.

Such weak half-measures would be unnecessary, because the bishops would say, with one voice, what every one of them knows to be true: Joe Biden should not receive communion. Politics, not the Catholic Church’s moral teaching, prevents them from doing so. Politics is what motivates Wilton Gregory, now archbishop of Washington, D.C., to say he will continue to give the Eucharist to Biden, no matter what the USCCB’s document says.

Biden’s contention that this is a “private matter” (a claim repeated Monday by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki) is nonsense. As far as the Catholic Church is concerned, a politician’s stance on abortion is never a private matter, any more than a politician’s vote on abortion-related legislation is a private matter.

Like every single American bishop, Biden knows that. He also knows he shouldn’t present himself for communion. So does every Catholic child. Cardinal Francis Arinze, who was prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments from 2002 to 2008, said in a speech in 2007 that he is often asked if a politician who supports abortion should receive Holy Communion:

Do you really need a cardinal from the Vatican to answer that? Get the children for first communion and say to them, somebody votes for the killing of unborn babies, and says, I voted for that, I will vote for that every time and these babies are killed, not one or two, but in millions, and that person says I am a practicing Catholic, should that person receive communion next Sunday? The children for first communion will answer that at the drop of a hat. You don’t need a cardinal to answer that.

So let’s dispense with the ridiculous fiction that anyone, from Biden to the bishops to liberal Catholic columnists in the corporate press, is the least bit confused about any of this. They’re not confused. They know what the Catholic Church teaches, and they’d like to change it. It’s as simple as that.

9 Most Insane Lies About Georgia's Voter ID Law In DOJ's Lawsuit,"On Friday, the Biden administration filed a 46-page complaint against the state of Georgia, alleging the state’s Election Integrity Act of 2021 violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. For a lawsplainer of the Voting Rights Act, read here. But for a taste of the surreal state of the U.S. Department of Justice under President Joe Biden, follow along.

1. It’s Still 1965

Given that on occasion President Joe Biden believes he’s still in the Senate, it should come as no surprise that his Department of Justice believes it’s still 1965.

In alleging that provisions in the Georgia voting-integrity law violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the DOJ opened its complaint by proclaiming that the Georgia legislature enacted the law “against the backdrop of Georgia’s history of discrimination against Black Georgians. ” The complaint continued with an entire section headed “The State of Georgia’s History of Discrimination,” which stressed, “the history of official racial discrimination against Black citizens in Georgia with regard to voting is longstanding, well-documented, and recognized by Federal courts.”

The DOJ drafted its complaint as though that reality still exists and acting oblivious to the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County v. Holder, even though a few paragraphs later the Biden administration noted that Georgia had been subject to the preclearance requirement of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act until 2013, when the Supreme Court decided Shelby County.

But as the Supreme Court made clear in Shelby County, since Congress passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965 “things have changed dramatically,” and “conditions have changed significantly.” At the time the Voting Rights Act passed, “the blight of racial discrimination in voting” had “infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century.”

Accordingly, as part of the Voting Rights Act, Congress required states that had maintained tests or devices as a prerequisite to voting such as literacy and knowledge tests or good moral character requirements, “and had less than 50 percent voter registration or turnout in the 1964 Presidential election,” to obtain federal permission before enacting any law related to voting. Georgia was one of nine states subject to Section 5’s preclearance mandate.

However, after recounting the extreme circumstances that originally justified Section 5’s usurpation of state control and disparate treatment of the states, the Supreme Court concluded that “the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions.”

For instance, the Supreme Court noted, by 2009, “the racial gap in voter registration and turnout [was] lower in the States originally covered by § 5 than it [was] nationwide,” and the covered states saw near parity between black and white voter turnout and registration rates. This reality led the Supreme Court in Shelby County to declare Section 5 unconstitutional, and Georgia and her sister states thus free to pass laws regulating voting without seeking federal government approval.

Yet to read the DOJ’s complaint against Georgia, one would think nothing had changed. Or maybe a more apt assessment would be that the men and women running the Biden administration’s DOJ want Americans to think nothing had changed. Well, and that the DOJ honchos don’t like the Shelby County decision and the Supreme Court stripping the power of federal bureaucrats to micromanage state election systems.

2. Georgia Republicans Are a Bunch of Racists

Relatedly, the DOJ’s complaint point-blank accuses the Georgia legislature of racism. In enacting the Election Integrity Act of 2021, “the Georgia General Assembly intended to deny or abridge the right of Black Georgians to vote on account of race or color,” the complaint opens.

Significantly, to sue under Section 2, the DOJ does not need to allege intentional racism. Rather, the federal government need only claim that the challenged “standard, practice, or procedure. . . results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.”

While elsewhere in the complaint the government focuses on the results of the challenged provisions to claim the impact disproportionately affects black voters, the DOJ didn’t leave it there, as it could have, instead of seeing fit to brand the Georgia General Assembly as full of racists.

3. Racists Exist, Ergo, the Law Is Racist

Besides calling the Georgia legislature racist, the DOJ’s complaint wants to hold the state responsible for racists everywhere. For instance, someone created “a GIF with a slow-swinging noose aimed at [an election worker]” and later that same election worker “faced death threats,” the complaint alleges.

Horrible? Yes. Relevant in any way? No.

That didn’t stop the DOJ from including the allegation, as well as another that noted that “one phone caller threatened to behead Reverend Warnock and referred to the church at which he is a paster, Ebenezer Baptist — the church once pastored by Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. — using a vile racial epithet.” The church, the DOJ explained, had to filter comments on its social media pages given the significant number of racist comments related to Rev. Warnock’s candidacy” for U.S. Senate.

Another allegation noted that “during the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial contest, a racist robocall referred to candidate Stacey Abrams as “Negress Stacey Abrams” and “a poor man’s Aunt Jemima.”

Again, horrible and, as the DOJ says, vile. But completely irrelevant to whether the Georgia law violates the Voting Acts Right.

4. A Complaint Is Not a Campaign Ad

The Biden administration’s peddling of random and anonymous racist comments as reflective of both the Georgia legislature and the state as a whole mirrored Democrats’ campaign strategy over the years to convince blacks not to vote for Republicans. The irrelevant allegations merely added some legalese to charges, such as Biden in 2012 that, “They’re going to put y’all back in chains.”

Several other portions of the complaint likewise sounded strikingly similar to campaign commercials touting Democratic candidates. “Vice President Kamala Harris became the first Black and Indian-American Vice President ever elected,” the complaint boosted. And “on January 5, 2021, with strong turnout among Black voters, the State of Georgia elected its first Black Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock, and its first Jewish-American Senator, Jon Ossoff,” the complaint cheered.

The most striking of the allegations came later when the DOJ claimed as a reason to believe the law was racist that “many elected officials in Georgia have not been responsive to the particularized needs of Black residents.”

5. One Thing Has Nothing to Do with the Other

Likewise irrelevant, yet included in the DOJ’s complaint, were references to Stop the Steal, and litigation about claims of voter fraud in 2020.

“Despite a dearth of evidence,” the Biden administration wrote, “accusations of fraud around the absentee voting process and the tabulation of votes circulated widely.” The complaint continued, “lawyers behind several lawsuits seeking to overturn presidential election results in multiple states hosted a press conference at a ‘Stop the Steal’ event” where calls “Georgia Governor Brian Kemp to be locked up,” were made.

The DOJ further stressed that “a barrage of lawsuits alleging voter fraud were brought.” Why, exactly, was that a problem? Here’s the DOJ’s answer: “These lawsuits often included allegations focused on counties containing significant numbers of Black voters and other voters of color.”

Similarly problematic in the DOJ’s view was that at least one Georgia senator whose committee bore responsibility for handling the voting legislation had attended a senate hearing at which unfounded claims of voter fraud were presented. What does that have to do with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act? Nothing.

Probably the most shocking irrelevancy, however, was the DOJ’s beef that “a number of lawmakers in the Georgia Senate, who subsequently helped draft, promote, and pass SB 202, issued a statement in support of an unsuccessful lawsuit brought by the State of Texas asking the United States Supreme Court to overturn Georgia’s election results.”

Not only does this allegation have nothing to do with Section 2, the DOJ also ignored that Texas’s complaint about Georgia’s handling of the election presented a constitutional claim premised on the Electors Clause and the state’s failure to conduct the legislatively mandated signature checks and its use of dropbox voting — something the legislature had not provided for.

While the federal government might find the Electors Clause claim meritless, it isn’t exactly a good look for Department of Justice to criticize a state for seeking redress in the courts for claimed constitutional violations. And it is laughable to further suggest that the Election Integrity Act of 2021 violates Section 2 because some lawmakers involved in that legislation supported Texas’s litigation.

6. It’s a Partisan Law

Equally laughable are the DOJ’s allegations concerning the supporters of the new Georgia voting law.

“On February 17, 2021, SB 202 was introduced in the Senate with only white sponsors,” the DOJ wrote in some sort of “gotcha” moment. The DOJ then outdid itself by complaining that the Senate passed the bill “along party lines with no support from Black legislators,” and the House did the same.

They then complain Kemp signed the law “behind closed doors and before a group of supporters that did not include any people of color. When Rep. Park Cannon, who is Black, attempted to witness the signing, she was arrested.”

Is it strange that the governor would not invite a representative who called the legislation “Jim Crow 2.0” to its signing? Or that she would be arrested after officers told her to stop pounding on the governor’s door during the signing ceremony?

7. Problems, What Problems?

The Biden administration’s complaint also takes a hilarious-if-it-weren’t-so-sad spin on the legitimate concerns that drove passage of the Election Integrity Act of 2021, with the DOJ acting as if there were no problems in Georgia’s administration of the 2020 election.

The DOJ spins began early in its refusal to even acknowledge the name of Georgia’s law, the Election Integrity Act of 2021, instead, saying the bill is known as “Georgia Senate Bill 202,” and referring to the voter-integrity law as SB 202 throughout the complaint.

Then, the Biden administration ticked through the challenged provisions, which include the prohibition on the government from distributing unsolicited absentee ballot applications and the bar on private organizations from distributing duplicate absent ballot applications. The DOJ also objected to the requirement that in requesting an absentee ballot, voters without a state-issued driver’s license provide a photocopy of another form of identification, which could include a utility bill.

The lawsuit further alleged that limits on the time period for registrants to request a ballot, limiting absentee ballot drop boxes, barring out-of-precinct ballots, and banning distribution of food or drink to persons waiting in line all violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

For anyone knowledgeable about the issues that plagued Georgia and other states, the DOJ’s arguments proved guffaw-inducing. Consider, for instance, the DOJ’s complaint that “SB 202” now requires voters to provide identification for requesting an absentee ballot.

“Since 2006, in-person voters in Georgia have been required to show photo identification,” the complaint read, but “prior to SB 202, absentee voters were exempt from this requirement.” “Instead,” the DOJ explained, “election officials would compare the signature on a voter’s absentee ballot envelope with the voter’s signature in the voter file.” But now, to the horror of the DOJ, instead of using a signature match, Georgia requires voters to provide identification to request a ballot then again when the ballot is submitted.

This complaint is pretty rich given that Georgia was previously sued for requiring a signature match and to settle that litigation the state entered into an agreement establishing a stringent process for rejecting applications based on a mismatch in the signatures: In effect, the cumbersome procedures agreed to ended the signature requirement for the 2020 election.

Yet the DOJ now complains that it is too burdensome for black voters to provide their driver’s license or state identification number, or another identifying document such as a utility bill, to request an absentee ballot.

Similarly, in complaining that Georgia’s new law tightens the use of dropboxes, the DOJ ignores two main issues the legislation sought to address. First, Georgia’s legislature had never approved the use of dropboxes. That supposed “authorization” came from the State Election Board.

But the Electors Clause of the Constitution mandates that state legislatures determine the rules for federal elections and not unelected bureaucrats or judges. Thus, the Georgia legislature’s approval of drop boxes actually expanded voting opportunities from what the legislature had previously authorized.

Second, the DOJ’s complaint that the Georgia law limits the number and locations of drop boxes ignores that the flood of drop boxes used in 2020 were not properly monitored and ballots were not properly safeguarded. For instance, earlier this year, Georgia’s secretary of state referred three counties “for investigation after those counties failed to do their absentee ballot transfer forms in violation of Georgia Rules and Regulation.” Also, two weeks ago, the secretary of state announced an investigation into Fulton County following revelations that it “is unable to produce all ballot drop box transfer documents.”

8. Left Hand, Meet Far-Left Hand

While in its lawsuit against Georgia, the Biden administration claims that Georgia’s requirement that voters cast ballots in the proper precinct violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, just a few months ago, the Biden administration agreed that Arizona’s out-of-precinct voting law was valid.

That admission came in the form of a letter to the Supreme Court in the case of Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, following Biden’s inauguration. The Trump administration had previously submitted an amicus curiae, or friend of the court brief, supporting Arizona’s voting-integrity legislation that banned ballot harvesting and required voters to cast ballots in the proper precinct. After the Biden administration took over, it informed the high court that “it does not disagree with the conclusion in that brief that neither Arizona measure violates Section 2’s results test.”

Yet now, the Biden administration claims that Georgia’s statute barring out-of-precinct voting violates Section 2. It’s almost as if the Biden administration has something against the state of Georgia.

9. How Do you Make Sausage?

The bottom line, after nearly 50 pages, is that the Biden administration just does not like the fact that the Georgia legislature passed the Election Integrity Act of 2021, and the complaint unwittingly makes clear that is the real beef the DOJ has with the new law. How else to explain the DOJ’s allegations related to the legislative process, and its complaint, for instance, that one of the law’s bill sponsors had indicated that a future bill would include a provision not later included in the bill as past? Or the tedious detailing of the process by which the bill passed?

It’s almost as if Biden forgot how the Obama-Biden administration squeezed through the so-called Affordable Care Act.

Republicans Who Take Biden’s Word On Infrastructure Spark More Trump,"After President Joe Biden’s changing statements about what kind of infrastructure-labeled spending spree he intends to sign into law, Republicans face a conundrum. GOP senators still think they have a deal with Democrats that will fund infrastructure, not a left-wing laundry list of entitlement spending and Green New Deal power grabs.

But Biden and congressional Democrats are still planning on passing a second bill that will contain exactly the kind of spending spree that Republicans say they oppose. Democrats think they can do it by the back-door strategy of a reconciliation bill that jettisons the need for support from any GOP senator.

That leaves Republican voters wondering if the bipartisan deal mainstream Republicans are touting as proof that they have stood up to Biden and a victory is nothing of the kind. Rather than having forced Democrats to agree to their terms, the left’s determination to get their way on both infrastructure and the rest of their spending plans may mean that Republicans are being rolled by their smarter and more ruthless adversaries again.

The bloated $4 trillion “infrastructure” plan Biden unveiled in the spring included a wide-ranging leftist wish list of spending projects on environmentalism and entitlements. Democrats brazenly deconstructed the definition of infrastructure to come up with a proposal in which anything they liked could fall under its meaning.

Even the most weak-minded of the moderate Senate Republicans understood Biden’s attempt to reboot Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “New Deal” and Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” for the 21st century by calling everything “infrastructure” was a bridge too far. In a Senate split down the middle between the two parties, there was no way this boondoggle could obtain the 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster.

So Biden ultimately agreed to a deal with Republicans that would allegedly limit the spending to projects dictionaries would define as infrastructure. The result was the celebratory June 24 announcement at the White House of the deal. But within hours, the DC Republican establishment was reminded of the perils of trying to be reasonable in an era of partisan ideological culture wars fought by people who don’t care about playing fair.

Just hours after Biden was back-slapping GOP senators and seemingly agreeing to a compromise, the president reversed course and made it clear that, appearances to the contrary, he wasn’t choosing bipartisanship over the desires of his party’s base. Speaking with reporters later that day, Biden said he wouldn’t sign the bipartisan deal unless it was accompanied by another bill — likely passed by a narrow partisan vote via the reconciliation trick — that would contain all the mad ideological spending the Republicans claimed to be negotiating against.

The White House then spent the following two days walking back Biden’s remarks. The president reportedly called the GOP senators he had been dealing with and assured them he wouldn’t veto the bill they thought he had agreed to if the bigger bill wasn’t also put on his desk.

Republicans quickly accepted his assurances. On June 27, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who is not running for re-election next year and was one of the key GOP negotiators on this deal, told ABC’s “This Week,” “I am glad they [the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Democrats’ omnibus spending legislation] have been delinked and we can move forward with a bipartisan bill.”

Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who is deeply unpopular with the GOP base but still a man to be reckoned with in a 50-50 Senate, told CNN’s “State of the Union” on the matter, “I do trust the president.” Only Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sounded a cautionary note , saying Biden had to demand that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer back down on their plans to also pass the bigger-spending bill. But there is little chance of that.

With the enthusiastic support of her caucus, Pelosi has already indicated that she intends to move ahead with the multi-trillion-dollar fake infrastructure spending bill no matter what Biden tells Republicans. Schumer has similar plans. And if at least 10 Republicans listen to Portman and Romney, then Biden will get to sign both bills, just like Democrats want.

Moderate Republicans seem determined not to play hardball in response. Fearful of being depicted as obstructionists and wishing to take credit for more spending, they will stick to a deal with Biden that will just provide Biden a fig leaf of respectability and bipartisanship. Democrats will wind up getting everything they want in legislation that will help transform the economy for the worse and generate even more debt that future generations will struggle to pay off.

At this point, it is necessary to remind those moderate Republicans why Trump essentially hijacked their party from out from under them five years ago.

Over eight years with President Barack Obama, Republicans failed to stop a billion-dollar cronyist stimulus package, the passage of ObamaCare, then a legislative process that allowed Obama’s dangerous Iran nuclear deal. Washington Republicans had amassed a record of failure. They were content to play the role of honorable losers in the same manner as failed presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain.

These GOP failures ultimately led to the rise of Donald Trump, whom these GOP moderates loathe. The same pattern may be repeating itself again now.

Yes, Biden’s inability to publicly stay on message raises new questions about whether he is fully in charge of his faculties at all times. But the main takeaway from the back and forth about infrastructure is that if Democrats are simply working around Republicans to get their way, then rather than negotiate and let Biden have both bills, then perhaps the GOP should adopt a tough negotiating policy that will present him the choice of getting a narrow infrastructure bill alone or nothing at all.

If instead Republican senators trust Biden’s word, they will wind up getting rolled again. That would not only be a disgrace but more evidence that the populist critique of the party establishment as dangerously weak is still right on target.

"In A Healthy Country, The Bidens Would Be Seen As The Picture Of Elite Corruption","The following is a transcript of my radar on Wednesday’s edition of “Rising” on Hill TV.

On January 3rd, 2019, around 7:30 p.m., Hunter Biden sent a text message to his 25-year-old daughter Naomi. “I love all of you,” he wrote, “But I don’t receive any respect and that’s fine I guess – works for you apparently. I hope you all can do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family for 30 years. It’s really hard.”

“But don’t worry,” Hunter continued, “unlike Pop I won’t make you give me half your salary.”

We know this because the Daily Mail just published a screenshot of the message, which was reportedly recovered from Hunter’s infamous laptop. The laptop, like his memoir, continues fleshing out a tragic picture of addiction and dysfunction.

Importantly, however, the addiction and dysfunction are the public’s problem too, given that Hunter was wrapped up in an influence peddling operation in which he traded on his father’s name to carry out lucrative business deals. That makes the sad work of reading his personal correspondence crucial given that his father is the president of the United States.

In this era of media corruption, there are two layers to nearly every story: the substance and the coverage. They are often equally important. In this case, the media’s decision to spend last week squeezing every drop out of Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg’s indictment obviously contrasts with its disinterest in the Hunter Biden saga which, by the way, implicates the sitting president.

Let’s now set that layer aside to focus on the substance of the story. “Unlike Pop I won’t make you give me half your salary,” Hunter wrote to his daughter.

Miranda Devine synthesized information from a handful of the laptop emails in a Fourth of July column for the New York Post. “There’s no direct evidence of such a wealth transfer on Hunter’s laptop,” she wrote. “But what we do know is that, while Joe was vice president, Hunter routinely paid at least some of his father’s household expenses, including AT&T bills of around $190 a month. “We know from an e-mail on June 5, 2010, with the subject “JRB bills” to Hunter from Eric Schwerin, his business partner at Rosemont Seneca, that he was expected to foot hefty bills to Wilmington contractors for maintenance and upkeep of his father’s palatial lakefront property,” added Devine, noting, “Joe’s initials are JRB, for Joseph Robinette Biden.”

Hunter’s complaint about his father taking a chunk of his earnings might sound familiar. It’s basically exactly what we learned from Tony Bobulinski shortly before the 2020 election, even if the media chose not to treat that information credibly.

Here’s more from Devine: “Further evidence that Joe expected to receive a slice of his son’s income was provided by Tony Bobulinksi, Hunter’s former business partner in a firm called Oneida, which was set up to enter a joint venture with the Chinese energy conglomerate CEFC. Bobulinski says that Joe was the “big guy” referred to in a 2017 e-mail who was to be allocated 10 percent equity in the firm: “10 [percent] held by H [Hunter] for the big guy.”

CEFC is a recurring character in the Biden drama. When the FBI caught Patrick Ho, an executive with CEFC, bribing African officials with cash in Chad and Uganda, he made a call. It was to James Biden, whose brother had just departed the vice presidency and was exploring a bid for the Oval Office. Why on earth would a corrupt Chinese business executive make an emergency call to James Biden?

Well, according to Jim, Ho was actually trying to contact his nephew Hunter. Here’s how the New York Times reported on the exchange back in 2018: “In a brief interview, James Biden said he had been surprised by Mr. Ho’s call. He said he believed it had been meant for Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son. James Biden said he had passed on his nephew’s contact information.” “There is nothing else I have to say,” James Biden told the Times. “I don’t want to be dragged into this anymore.”

Part of the point of paying Hunter Biden money to oversee business dealings outside his areas of expertise is so that you can make a call just like the one Ho made back in 2017.

So the new emails make it pretty clear that Hunter Biden’s corrupt foreign influence peddling benefitted the current president of the United States. This is all enormously difficult to keep track of, and perhaps that explains a tiny part of the media disinterest, but we could go on for hours examining emails, texts, and public records outlining this pattern.

Just last week, Fox News obtained a picture of Joe and Hunter Biden sporting wide smiles next to Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire, Interjet CEO Miguel Aleman Magnani, company chairman Miguel Aleman Velasco, and Jeff Cooper, a former managing partner of SimmonsCooper and a Biden donor.

Hunter set up meetings with Magnani and his father’s transportation secretary during the Obama administration. When Hunter and Cooper were working on a deal with Magnani, they were both on a 2016 vice presidential trip on Air Force Two to Mexico.

“I really appreciate you letting me stay at your resort villa . . . but I have brought every single person you have ever asked me to bring to the F’ing White House and the Vice President’s house and the inauguration and then you go completely silent,” Hunter emailed Magnani after takeoff.

It’s incredible and, again, we could go for hours.

Let’s just dwell on one more recent release, this time involving emails that revealed longtime FBI director Louis Freeh dropped $100,000 into a private trust for two of Joe Biden’s grandkids in 2016, literally as he was seeking to pursue “some very good and profitable matters” with the former vice president. What? Seriously — what? Freeh’s firm has had some questionable dealings, which makes the exchange all the more interesting, but $100,000? Explain that as anything other than a huge bribe.

Trump corruption matters. Clinton corruption matters. Biden corruption matters. Now, of course, Biden corruption matters most because it involves the president, and in a healthy media ecosystem, that would be glaringly obvious. Of course, nobody’s asked Jen Psaki about the most recent emails in a briefing. But on the matter of substance, the drip-drip of these emails is steadily exposing Joe Biden’s proximity to—and potential involvement with—rampant corruption. It’s possible none of it was even illegal which, of course, is how they were making good money.

It’s plain as day in Hunter’s text to Naomi. So how much of his dirty money was Joe Biden taking? Is that why he took Hunter to Mexico and China on Air Force Two, facilitating meetings that could lead to profits that could lead to help from Hunter? The White House insists the father and son never discussed Hunter’s business. That’s farcical, but they’re getting away with it.

Corruption will always exist at the highest levels of our government, and probably any government. Influence peddling is wrong because it corrupts the motives of elected officials which leads to corrupted results. It’s wrong because it helps wealthy and powerful people leverage jobs funded by taxpayers to line their own pockets. At risk of sounding like a broken record, in a healthy country, our free press would be highlighting the Biden family as the very picture of elite corruption. They would be pushing relentlessly for answers to the questions they emails continue raising.

Instead, it’s mostly crickets. Sunlight is only a useful disinfectant if people know to look. The limit of the metaphor is that disinfecting corruption from our politics involves people giving a damn. But if the legacy media doesn’t care, and is increasingly untethered from a business model that makes these outlets responsive to the public, nothing will change and all the other versions of Hunter Biden will continue going about their dirty business, unbothered by potential exposure and the collective shrug it might induce.

5 Ways Biden Is Taking A Federal Wrecking Ball To Your Kid's Education,"Fighting not only against taxpayer-funded educators but also the corporate media that is lying about the ins and outs of critical race theory, conservative parents are rightly focusing their energy on eradicating the evil race-based ideologies from their kids’ classrooms. Amid the CRT tug-of-war, however, they shouldn’t forget about the other education disasters that have rolled out of the radical Biden administration.

Here are five education nightmares, courtesy of the president that Democrats and Never Trumpers assured us would be “moderate.”

1. Abolished Patriotic Education Initiatives

Back in January, under the guise of “Advancing Racial Equity,” the Biden administration abolished the 1776 Commission, which aimed to promote patriotism in American education at a time pro-U.S. sentiments were — and certainly still are — under attack.

Focusing on skin color and peddling the notion of ongoing “system racism,” Biden issued an executive order declaring, “It is therefore the policy of my Administration that the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all.”

Part of that order revoked (not revised or repurposed, but completely abolished) President Trump’s executive order that established the Advisory 1776 Commission, which had provided an in-depth report on America’s founding ideals, especially the Declaration of Independence and the fact that “all men are created equal.”

“Of course, neither America nor any other nation has perfectly lived up to the universal truths of equality, liberty, justice, and government by consent,” rightly noted the 1776 Commission report that Biden nuked. “But no nation before America ever dared state those truths as the formal basis for its politics, and none has strived harder, or done more, to achieve them. … The core assertion of the Declaration, and the basis of the founders’ political thought, is that ‘all men are created equal.’ From the principle of equality, the requirement for consent naturally follows: if all men are equal, then none may by right rule another without his consent.”

In the 1776 Commission void, the Biden administration embraces notions of “equity” in which some people are more equal than others and where outcomes are more important than opportunities and natural rights — which leads us to Biden’s role in the race-based issue of the day.

2. Embraced Critical Race Theory

Critical race theory is all either side of the aisle can talk about, it seems, but CRT as an indoctrination tool doesn’t just occur in the elementary classroom. Race-based education also occurs at the adult level, and Biden helped get the ball of race obsession rolling.

In the same executive order, Biden also revoked Trump’s September 2020 order prohibiting race and sex stereotyping in federal agencies.

“Today, however, many people are pushing a different vision of America that is grounded in hierarchies based on collective social and political identities rather than in the inherent and equal dignity of every person as an individual,” Trump’s now-revoked order had read, taking aim at the poisonous ideologies of intersectionality and critical race theory that are presently ripping through educational institutions and destroying national unity. “This ideology is rooted in the pernicious and false belief that America is an irredeemably racist and sexist country; that some people, simply on account of their race or sex, are oppressors; and that racial and sexual identities are more important than our common status as human beings and Americans.”

The Biden administration’s preference instead for an obsession with skin color and intersectional hierarchies isn’t restricted to federal agencies, or even federally funded institutions, as local battles over critical race theory illustrate plainly.

3. Shrugged Off Due Process

Through a March executive order, Biden initiated the repeal or substantial revamping of the Trump-era rule on claims of sexual assault and harassment at schools receiving federal funds. Trump’s rule — which was an attempt to undo the disasters of the previous administration, in which Biden was vice president — had required those schools not only to resolve sexual allegations quickly, but to do so through a clear and fair grievance process that gave due process to alleged victims and the presumption of innocence to alleged perpetrators.

Biden’s order instructed the Department of Education to review the Trump administration and former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’s due process expansions on college campuses, which gave students accused of sexual misconduct a chance to receive a fair trial, investigation, and evaluation. Biden aspires to reinstate at least some Obama-era policies that overhaul Title IX and potentially withhold funding from schools that don’t comply with broader sexual harassment definitions and lowered evidence standards for victims, as he previously promised on the campaign trail.

In May, Biden nominated Catherine Lhamon to the post she held in the Obama administration, where she gutted due process safeguards as assistant secretary for civil rights within the Department of Education.

4. Tried to Expand the Government’s Role in Education

In April, the Biden administration put forward a huge and unaffordable swelling of the federal government’s role in education. Through his so-called American Families Plan, Biden proposed sticking the federal government’s nose not only into public elementary education, but into everything from early childcare to college. It’s worth noting education is a facet of American life not even mentioned in the Constitution, but that hasn’t stopped big-government Democrats from trying to micromanage — and massively fund — it.

“Investing in education is a down payment on the future of America,” Biden said in pushing for a federally funded “at least four years of free education.” What he doesn’t want you to think about, however, is whose dollars will ultimately be making that payment, for whom they’ll be making it, and what kinds of left-wing ideas and violations of individual rights those dollars would be funding (see points 1-3).

5. Gave Tax Dollars to Foreign Students Because ‘COVID’

As part of his exorbitant American Rescue Plan, Biden announced in May that $36 billion of those funds would go toward institutions and students affected by the coronavirus lockdowns. He then issued a Department of Education ruling, however, announcing that both international and even undocumented students could receive those emergency grants.

While American young people are forced to cough up their hard-earned dollars in taxes and pay higher prices for simple goods and services thanks to inflation (barriers to what might otherwise be college savings), the Biden administration shelled out taxpayer funds to non-Americans to attend U.S. universities.

Local fights over critical race theory might well be some of the most important battles your family is fighting now as you pursue an unadulterated education for your child. But as you wade through that educational mess, don’t forget all the other ways Biden is screwing up your kid’s future.

Why Congress Should Demand An Audit Of Biden’s Taxes,"A bipartisan Senate working group has proposed paying for new infrastructure spending in part by providing $40 billion to the Internal Revenue Service. But before Congress even considers the legislation, conservatives rightly skeptical of doling out new funds and authority to the IRS should pose one simple request to the Biden administration: You want to audit other “rich” people? Why not audit yourself first, Mr. President?

While the press has largely ignored it in favor of wall-to-wall coverage of his predecessor’s tax practices, Biden’s returns raise their own set of questions. If the current president declines this offer, Congress should take the matter out of his hands, and propose an amendment to the infrastructure bill requiring the IRS to audit the last four years of tax returns for Joe and Jill Biden.

‘Aggressive’ Use of Loophole Biden Now Wants to Close

As I previously noted, from 2017 through 2020, Joe Biden and his wife Jill characterized the vast majority of their income—more than $13.6 million worth—as profits from two S-corporations rather than wages. In so doing, the Bidens avoided paying nearly $517,000 in payroll taxes that fund Medicare and Obamacare.

While Biden’s budget proposed closing the S-corporation loophole that he and his wife so recently exploited, the tactic currently remains legal—up to a point. The IRS requires that individuals using S-corporations must pay themselves “reasonable compensation” in the form of wages, on which they must pay payroll taxes.

On that count, Joe Biden’s actions in particular raise serious questions. In 2017, Biden reported total income of more than $9.6 million, yet paid payroll taxes on $145,833—only 1.45 percent of his income. His 2018 return followed a similar pattern, in which he paid payroll taxes on just under 10 percent of his more than $3 million of total income.

Earlier this year, Joe Biden cited his taxes as evidence of his ethics, claiming he instructed his accountant that “The foul line is 15 feet away from the basket. Never get me closer than 17 feet, because it really is a matter of the public trust.”

But after reviewing his returns, tax experts called his actions into question. Two years ago, an analyst at the liberal Tax Policy Center called the Bidens’ behavior “pretty aggressive,” while another tax analyst said the Bidens used the S-corporations solely to avoid paying Medicare and Obamacare taxes.

Scrutinizing the Returns

The Internal Revenue Manual does provide for mandatory audits of the president and vice president. But it only does so with respect to sitting office-holders, referencing “the individual tax returns and accounts of the President and Vice President of the United States in office at the time of filing” (emphasis added).

In other words, federal law does not require the IRS to audit the Bidens’ 2017, 2018, and 2019 tax returns, which were filed after Joe Biden left office as vice president, but before he returned to office as president. This is a convenient fact for Joe Biden, because it omits any automatic scrutiny of behavior that the Tax Policy Center raised concerns about.

Therein lies the question lawmakers should ask the Biden administration. A research organization run by the (liberal) Brookings Institution and (liberal) Urban Institute raised legitimate questions about the propriety of his conduct. If President Biden wants to audit others, why shouldn’t he demand that the IRS audit his own returns first—to put to bed any questions about his conduct—before trying to sic the agency on others?

If Biden finds questions about his tax practices too embarrassing to request an audit of his returns, Congress should settle the matter for him. Lawmakers should offer an amendment ordering the IRS to audit his 2017, 2018, and 2019 returns—and force Democrats to go on the record as favoring or opposing it. While the agency normally audits only returns for the last three years (in this case, 2018, 2019, and 2020), the IRS can go back into 2017 if it finds significant discrepancies in the Bidens’ most recent returns—or if Congress instructs it to do so.

‘Not-So Middle Class’ Joe

The left and the media (but I repeat myself) remain fixated on President Trump’s tax affairs. And courts in New York will pass judgment on the propriety of his business dealings in due season.

But the current occupant of the White House has far from clean hands on taxes. Recall first that Biden wants to close a loophole that he exploited mere months ago, and second that he considered renting this house outside Washington a bigger priority than paying Obamacare and Medicare taxes on all his earnings in 2017 and 2018:

For someone with this kind of checkered history to propose siccing IRS agents on others represents the height of cheek. Perhaps Joe Biden will rethink his strategy after spending some time in the barrel himself.

Democrats’ Definition Of ‘Misinformation’ Is What Hurts Them Politically,"Facebook is killing people, misinformation is rampant, and the only people who can save us from ourselves are the all-wise executives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue whose judgment is infallible and whose motives are pure. That’s the message emanating from the White House and the corporate press.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced last week that, due to 12 unnamed people on social media posting what the Biden administration considers to be misinformation, the White House is actively “flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation” and “helping” to “boost trusted content.” Going even further, Psaki said nothing is “off the table” for using Big Tech to quiet opposing views.

Not only is the Biden administration effectively deputizing Facebook to be an extension of the federal government’s communications office, but it also insists that if you’re banned from one Big Tech site for questioning conventional wisdom, you should be banned from all of them.

Psaki maintains the government has “a responsibility, as a public health matter, to raise that issue” of people allegedly dying en masse because of uncensored Facebook posts that don’t comport with the White House’s vaccine messaging. This isn’t a caricature of the White House’s position either. When a reporter asked President Joe Biden directly last week what his message is to sites like Facebook, Biden replied, serious as a heart attack, “They’re killing people.”

This push for censorship is interesting for several reasons, not the least of which is the fact that the same political stripe that ridiculously cried “fascism” for four years under Donald Trump is now taking concrete steps to suppress political opposition, one of the hallmarks of true fascism. It’s also interesting because information changes so rapidly, as Psaki herself admitted.

“Science evolves, information evolves,” Psaki said during the same press conference in which she pledged her commitment to silencing vaccine dissidents online. If anyone should understand the reality of information evolving, it’s the Biden administration.

Everything Is ‘Misinformation’ — Until It’s Not

Last fall when the bombshell Hunter Biden laptop story broke, then-candidate Joe Biden insisted it was Russian “disinformation” and a “smear campaign.” When Fox News’s Peter Doocy later asked Biden about the stories of his son, the then-president-elect hurled one of his bizarre insults at the reporter, saying, “God love ya man. You are a one-horse pony.” Psaki piled on in October, sharing a story to Twitter that claimed, “Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo.”

Tech giants Twitter and Facebook waged a war on the narrative, with one site spiking the stories about the Biden son’s laptop from orbit and the other severely hamstringing them, under the guise of an unsubstantiated hunch that the materials were “hacked” and on the grounds that the stories might have been disinformation. In other words, based on Democrats’ narrative, tech monopolies throttled a timely story in the runup to the highly contested 2020 election, a story that directly applied to one of the candidate’s familial affairs and might have changed the outcome of the race — and they did this with absolute impunity.

When U.S. intelligence agencies determined the Hunter Biden stories were not Russian disinformation, Big Tech shrugged. A week later, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg both admitted they had no evidence that The New York Post’s reporting on Joe Biden’s knowledge of his son Hunter Biden’s foreign business deals was Russian disinformation. Whoops. The conventional wisdom on “misinformation” changed, but the story had already been conveniently censored.

Psaki likewise spread misinformation online just two months before the election when she pushed a fake tale about Trump calling fallen troops “losers” and “suckers” and the Russian bounties story, two narratives the media ran with that turned out to be misinformation. In fact, her misinformation-peddling goes back further. Psaki was a frequent promoter of the Russia collusion hoax in 2017 and throughout the Trump presidency.

But even on the Wuhan virus, Biden’s administration and the so-called public health experts he now demands we trust have a terribly tarnished track record. Note how readily Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris undermined the vaccine during their 2020 presidential campaign:

Here’s a mashup of VACCINE MISINFORMATION from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Does Jen Psaki want Big Tech to CENSOR this?pic.twitter.com/vqnucmZjnj — Kyle Martinsen (@KyleMartinsen_) July 16, 2021

And what about flip-flopper-in-chief Anthony Fauci, who not only knew that COVID-19 likely came from the Wuhan lab and that it potentially “looked engineered” and tried to cover those things up, according to his released emails (which Facebook also censored and erroneously “fact-checked”), but knowingly spread misinformation about masks at the start of the pandemic?

Big Tech censored posts about the Wuhan lab leak theory, which Democrats and the corrupt media called a “conspiracy theory,” yet Fauci’s mask misinformation is still online. Doocy used this line of questioning with Psaki last week with regard to the administration’s collusion with Big Tech to crack down on so-called “misinformation.” The exchange went like this:

“There are videos of Dr. Fauci from 2020, before anybody had a vaccine, and he is out there saying there’s no reason to be walking around with a mask,” Doocy said. “So is the administration going to contact Facebook and ask them to take that down?”

“Well, first, I think what Dr. Fauci has said himself, who’s been quite public out there, is that science evolves, information evolves — and we make that available in a public way to the American people,” Psaki replied. “I have never seen any data to suggest that the vaccines cause infertility. That is information that is irresponsibly traveling.”

“About the science evolving,” Doocy pushed back. “Facebook used to block people from posting that COVID may have originated from a lab. That is something this president now admits is a possibility. So is there any concern that things you are trying to block or have taken down might someday turn out to be—”

“We don’t take anything down. We don’t block anything,” Psaki snapped back, ignoring the fact that she admits the administration is using Big Tech to do its bidding to feign clean hands. “Facebook and any private-sector company makes decisions about what information should be on their platform.”

‘I’m Here to Help’

Doocy is right, and the White House knows it. Today’s “misinformation” is tomorrow’s undeniable fact; it happens all the time, and that reality isn’t lost on the Biden administration.

What’s going on here isn’t really an attempt to save Americans from disease. It’s a desperate attempt by the ruling class to save their own rear ends from information that threatens their ideological goals.

Democrats at the helm of the executive and legislative branches aren’t looking to squash so-called misinformation because it’s the only way to keep people from dying (which still wouldn’t justify their authoritarianism, by the way). Biden, Psaki, and their friends in Congress and Silicon Valley are working to snuff out their opponents’ speech because not only do they think it will help them politically, as it likely did in the 2020 election, but because they believe they can get away with it — again, as they did in the 2020 election.

President Ronald Reagan was right when he said, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.” The Biden administration has gotten disturbingly more specific: “I’m from the government, and I’m here to help Facebook silence you.”

Biden Gets Roasted For Bumbling Through Mostly Empty Town Hall,"President Joe Biden received sharp criticism for his performance at CNN’s town hall on Wednesday, as prominent individuals on both the left and right took to Twitter to bash his awkwardness.

Throughout the event with CNN’s Don Lemon at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, Biden was mocked by politicians, journalists, and others for seeming incoherent as he tried to talk about coronavirus, the partisan Jan. 6 Capitol riot commission, inflation, the filibuster, and more. The president reiterated at one point that attempts by Republicans to introduce election integrity measures are “Jim Crow on steroids.”

“I don’t know about you but I’m thrilled this is the guy in charge of the free world. We should all sleep sound at night,” said Donald Trump Jr. “Hey at least there’s no mean tweets… mostly because this guy wouldn’t be capable of a tweet or even a complete thought.”

“Reagan was younger than Biden is currently when he left office, and Reagan was never this incoherent in public.

CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas told the New York Post the audience size was “typical … for a CNN town hall,” but she reportedly declined to comment on the reason for the small number of people.

In describing the event in full, “Bongino Report” called it a “train wreck,” and National Review editor Jack Butler said it was “contrived” and a “hideous spectacle unbecoming of a self-governing republic.”

Former President Donald Trump has joked about the size of Biden’s events in the past. “Biden comes to Florida, you have like 12, 13 people,” Trump told attendees at a Jacksonville rally last September. “You know, they do the circles. And he has a hard time filling up the circles. Here we probably have 30,000 people or so.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/22/biden-gets-roasted-for-bumbling-through-mostly-empty-town-hall/,2021-07-22
What To Make Of Biden’s Latest Call For Banning Guns,"Last week, asked what he planned to do about crime, Joe Biden said “I’m the only guy that ever got passed legislation, when I was a senator, to make sure we eliminated assault weapons. The idea (that) you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon, whether it’s a nine-millimeter pistol or whether it’s a rifle, is ridiculous. I’m continuing to push to eliminate the sale of those things.” Any gun can fire 20 shots, of course, and Biden has never been articulate, so it would be fair to assume that he meant “fire 20 shots without reloading.”

Online, a disagreement about what Biden meant ensued between House Republicans and PolitiFact. But before getting into that, three things should be noted. First, as has often been the case during his political career, in this instance Biden lied. The legislation Biden bragged about—Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s, D-California, gun and magazine “ban” of 1994-2004, imposed as part of Biden’s 1994 crime bill—didn’t “eliminate” any guns.

The “ban” didn’t apply to the possession of guns already owned. On paper, it banned the importation of semi-automatic firearms it defined as “assault weapons,” but the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) had already done that in 1989, as ordered by President George H. W. Bush, with the blessing of Bush’s “drug czar,” Bill Bennett.

Feinstein’s ban applied to the manufacture of such firearms, but unintentionally allowed manufacturers to keep making the firearms in modified form. As a result, during the “ban,” Americans bought almost three-quarters of a million newly made AR-15s, and no telling how many rifles of similar orientation.

Six months after the “ban” took effect, in a CBS “60 Minutes” segment titled “What Assault Weapons Ban?,” reporter Lesley Stahl called 1994 “the best year for the sales of assault weapons ever.” Frustrated, Feinstein told Stahl, “There is no question that I would have preferred to see an outright ban on the possession of semi-automatic assault weapons in America” and “if I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in, I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren’t there.”

Second, since 1989, Democrats’ federal gun- and magazine-ban legislation, the first of which was introduced by purported communist Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Arizona, has defined such magazines as any that can hold 11 or more rounds of ammunition. Therefore Biden was trying to mislead, saying he wanted to ban guns that can fire “20” or more shots.

Third, while firearms that Democrats call “assault weapons” are used in only 2-3 percent of murders (compared to about 30 percent of murders without firearms of any type), no use of a gun in crime is grounds for banning it, because the right to keep and bear arms is constitutionally protected and, as the Supreme Court said in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), “the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.”

Besides, as the late Jeff Cooper, considered the founder of the modern defensive handgun technique, said in “The Art Of The Rifle,” rifles “may be used by evil men for evil purposes, but there are more good men than evil, and while the latter cannot be persuaded to the path of righteousness by propaganda, they can certainly be corrected by good men with rifles.”

While there is nothing in the legislative history of the Second Amendment to support Heller’s claim that the right to arms includes only such arms as are “in common use” for legitimate purposes, AR-15s, comparable rifles, and handguns that can use magazines that hold 11 or more rounds are the firearms most in common use for such purposes today. For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, in Kolbe v. Hogan (2017), said “in 2012, the number of AR- and AK-style weapons . . . was more than double the number of Ford F-150 trucks sold, the most commonly sold vehicle in the United States.”

However, for the record, violent crime, which began declining several years before Feinstein’s “ban” was imposed, continued to decline as purchases of those firearms in particular, and firearms generally, increased. And since the “ban” expired in 2004, Americans have bought millions more AR-15s, comparable rifles, semi-automatic pistols, and hundreds of millions of magazines that hold 11 or more rounds for those firearms. Also, until Democrat officials stopped prosecuting rioters and began defunding police departments, the U.S. murder rate had declined.

Who’s Right About What Biden Meant?

In response to Biden’s statement, House Republicans, overlooking that Biden said he supported banning rifles that can fire 20 or more shots, said on Twitter, “Biden says he wants to ban handguns.” “Handguns” could be interpreted as meaning “some handguns” or “all handguns,” so PolitiFact assumed the latter and said Republicans’ claim was “false.” It added, “Biden doesn’t want to ban handguns, Biden wants to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. . . . The most popular handguns would face no restrictions under Biden’s policies.”

Adding to the confusion, two conservative websites quoted Biden without including his first sentence, with which, it could be argued, he put the remainder of his statement in the context of “assault weapons.” Both websites, like the Republicans, ignored Biden’s claim relative to banning rifles.

PolitiFact was particularly wrong in claiming Biden’s policies would have no effect on the most popular handguns. The most popular handguns today are those that use detachable magazines, detachable magazines are integral parts of firearms designed to use them (like a gas tank is to a car), firearms that can use detachable magazines can use ones of any size, magazines of 11 rounds or more are made for most of them, and magazines of 20 rounds are made for many of them.

It’s Not News That Democrats Want to Ban Guns and Magazines

In the 1800s, Democrats imposed state laws designed to prevent blacks from being armed. In 1934, a Democrat Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt (who threatened to pack the Supreme Court and threw Japanese-Americans in internment camps) imposed the National Firearms Act. In 1968, a Democrat Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson (who campaigned for universal gun registration and gun owner licensing) imposed the Gun Control Act, which, among other things, prohibited a firearm dealer from selling a handgun to a young adult, prohibited a dealer from selling a handgun to a resident of another state, and limited the importation of firearms to those the BATFE considers “generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes” (emphasis added).

In 1974, thinking they had momentum and seeing the opportunity to rake in cash by sending fundraising letters to hoplophobic leftists, anti-gun activists formed the National Coalition to Ban Handguns and the National Council to Control Handguns (NCCH, later renamed Handgun Control, Inc., or HCI). In 1975, NCCH called for “a ban on the manufacture, sale, and importation of all handguns and handgun ammunition,” and in 1976 advocated a law “to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition . . . totally illegal.”

Into the 1980s, both groups campaigned in particular for a ban on compact handguns which, at the time, typically held six or fewer rounds of ammunition. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, of Chappaquiddick infamy, and Rep. Peter Rodino, D-New Jersey, introduced the necessary legislation.

In 1991, a future president of HCI told the New York Assembly’s Committee on Codes, “There is no reason why a legitimate gun owner needs to have a clip (sic) capable of holding more than six rounds, and thus I would suggest the banning of clips (sic) that hold more than six rounds.” Coupled with a ban on compact handguns holding six rounds or fewer, a ban on magazines holding more than six rounds would have begun to look a lot like a ban on handguns.

Two years later, even six rounds was too many. In 1993, Feinstein told the Senate, “I intend to add an amendment that would exempt semi-automatic bolt action (sic) shotguns and bona fide hunting rifles whose clips (sic) don’t exceed three rounds.”

Since Democrats have worked toward civilian disarmament for more than a century, Biden’s latest comment about banning guns and magazines should come as no surprise.

Here Are Joe ‘Moderate’ Biden’s 10 Most Insanely Radical Nominees,"Do you remember when Joe Biden and his friends in the corporate media promised he would be a beacon of civility and unity if we would just elect him president? Fast-forward to the end of July, and a Senate committee advanced to head up the Bureau of Land Management a Biden-selected eco-terrorist who once booby-trapped trees with spikes in a potentially murderous screw-you to the logging industry. Last week, Biden announced on live television that he intended to break his oath of office by violating the Constitution with another eviction moratorium.

In light of all the radicalism, it’s worth noting Stone-Manning and the embrace of lawlessness weren’t one-offs. As conservatives warned from the get-go, Biden has proved to be a Trojan horse for the ambitions of the party’s far-left faction, as his Cabinet picks and agency nominees testify.

Here are the top 10 most radical Biden nominees, in no particular order, that further reinforce this reality.

1. Tracy Stone-Manning

We’ve already touched on the eco-terrorist. Stone-Manning, whom Biden nominated to head the Bureau of Land Management and whose nomination the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced on July 22, took part in an Idaho tree-spiking incident in 1989.

Tree-spiking, a form of ecoterrorism indulged by some far-left environmental activists, features metal rods hammered into trees that turn into deadly projectiles when processed for logging. Intended to instill fear among people in the timber industry by setting traps of steel that explode on impact with a saw, this tactic has also injured firefighters who already face the dangerous job of extinguishing deadly wildfires.

“Contrary to many stories in the news, Ms. Stone-Manning was not an innocent bystander, nor was she a victim in this case. And she most certainly was not a hero,” wrote Retired Special Agent Michael Merkley or Stone-Manning’s involvement. “She was vulgar, antagonistic and extremely anti-government.”

2. David Chipman

Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said confirming Biden’s pick to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives would be like putting “Antifa in charge of the Portland Police Department.”

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who survived a politically motivated shooting in 2017, called the nominee out for “alarming ignorance” and “clear anti-gun bias,” with Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida adding the pick is “no better than Beto O’Rourke.” Moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins called David Chipman “unusually divisive,” and Sen. Ted Cruz blasted him over “disturbing” allegations of racism against black ATF agents and participation in Chinese propaganda.

They’re not wrong. Chipman, who clocked in 25 years at the ATF and is now a senior policy adviser at the anti-gun group Giffords and was formerly on the advisory council of Everytown for Gun Safety, admitted during a Senate committee hearing that he supports a ban on AR-15s, a modern sporting rifle that is ubiquitous in the United States. As a lobbyist, Chipman fought for handgun licensing and registration and universal background checks. In fact, thanks to gun-grabby politicians and would-be ATF director, Americans can’t get their hands on guns fast enough. Sales have been soaring at the prospect of a Chipman confirmation.

After news broke of Chipman’s appointment, the nominee locked his Twitter account, probably taking cues from other inflammatory Democrats whose Twitter conduct jeopardized their careers.

Chipman’s scorn for gun-owning Americans runs deep. In April, he compared first-time gun owners who purchased firearms during overbearing lockdowns to zombie preppers, and mocked them as being like Joe Exotic from “Tiger King.”

“Secure that gun locked and unloaded and hide it behind the cans of tuna and beef jerky that you’ve stored in the cabinet, and only bring that out if the zombies start to appear,” Chipman said.

During Senate testimony, Chipman refused to say whether he would prosecute the president’s son Hunter Biden for an illegal gun purchase — a gun Hunter later misplaced after his girlfriend tossed it in a trash can near a school. Speaking of misplacing guns, GOP senators have reason to believe Chipman lost his firearm as an ATF agent.

Chipman was also a case agent in the 1993 Branch Davidian compound siege in Waco, Texas, which resulted in 82 deaths. He has also falsely claimed that Waco cult members “used 2.5 caliber Barretts to shoot down two Texas Air National Guard helicopters.” Evidence from a Waco follow-up investigation showed no helicopters were shot down.

3. Catherine Lhamon

Biden nominated Catherine Lhamon to be assistant secretary for civil rights at the Department of Education, a post she held during the Obama administration, where she was in charge of enforcing Title IX against sex discrimination.

During her 2013-2017 stint there, however, Lhamon eroded due process rights for people accused of sexual misconduct on college campuses. She pressed schools to implement a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard and keep legal representation out of the process. For sexual misconduct cases, Lhamon also pushed universities to embrace an adjudication model that relied on a single campus administrator.

The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education blasted Lhamon, saying her Office for Civil Rights “gutted due process protections and violated the First Amendment.”

The office did so through so-called Dear Colleague letters, which are essentially excuses for unelected bureaucrats to legislate. The resulting campus kangaroo courts were so egregious that even some leftist icons condemned them. The late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg famously denounced them “for not giving the accused person a fair opportunity to be heard.”

As The Federalist’s Eddie Scarry wrote, Lhamon would change the due process standard, swapping “presumption of innocence for ‘possibility’ of innocence.”

4. Xavier Becerra

Biden nominated and the Senate confirmed Xavier Becerra to head the Department of Health and Human Services, but that wasn’t Becerra’s first claim to infamy. Almost every GOP senator, except Collins, opposed Becerra’s confirmation due to his lack of qualifications or health experience, radical abortion positions, refusal to call for free and fair elections in Cuba after meeting with dictator Fidel Castro, and his promotion of Obamacare, gun control, open borders, and radical climate plans. Becerra has also advocated for a government takeover of health care and using taxpayer dollars to fund the health care of illegal foreign workers.

Among the most extreme items on Becerra’s resume is the now-secretary’s efforts when he was attorney general of California to sue the nuns of the Little Sisters of the Poor for refusing to comply with Obamacare’s contraceptive mandate on religious grounds.

During his 24 years in Congress, Becerra voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, voted for taxpayer-funded abortions, and voted not to criminalize hurting an unborn child while committing a different crime. As California attorney general, Becerra took the torch from Kamala Harris and continued prosecuting undercover journalist and pro-life activist David Daleiden on behalf of Planned Parenthood. Becerra charged Daleiden with 15 felonies in 2017, the first time anyone in California had been criminally prosecuted for allegedly violating the state’s video recording law.

Before the Senate confirmed Becerra for his current post, 60 pro-life leaders sent a letter urging Senate committees to reject the radically pro-abortion nominee.

5. Rachel Levine

Before becoming the assistant secretary of health in the Biden administration, Rachel Levine was Pennsylvania’s health secretary. Levine, born Richard Levine, is the first transgender Senate-confirmed federal official after having begun identifying as a woman in 2011. Despite Levine’s denial of basic biology and unwillingness to condemn the genital mutilation of children, Biden has placed him at the helm of so-called public health.

A new study has found that #Transgender youth with access to a puberty blocker have decline in chances of suicide + #mentalhealth problems now and in the future. This study is important because it's the first to show this specific association. https://t.co/axYncR0m4l — Dr. Rachel Levine (@SecretaryLevine) January 24, 2020

Before being elevated to that role, Levine botched Pennsylvania’s COVID response. While relegating other elderly Pennsylvanians to the pandemic Petri dishes of nursing homes — where at the time of Levine’s Senate committee advancement, more than 12,600 of them had died — Levine removed his own mother from a care facility to keep her safe.

6. Deb Haaland

After completing just one term in the House of Representatives, Deb Haaland was tapped to lead the Biden administration’s Department of the Interior. Haaland, an extreme environmental activist who was dubbed “Green New Deal champion” by radical squad member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was one of the co-sponsors of the original legislation, which sought an overhaul of the American economy and rapid decarbonization.

In addition to opposing all oil and gas exploration on public property, an industry that provides 40 percent of the budget in her home state of New Mexico, Haaland has also said she’s “wholeheartedly against fracking and drilling on public lands.”

7. Pete Buttigieg

After his stint as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, then as a failed presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg was elevated to be the Biden administration’s secretary of transportation.

In addition to Mayor Pete’s performative clown show of riding his bicycle to Cabinet meetings (after being transported in entourages of black SUVs most of the way), a story that was never debunked despite what Facebook’s phony fact-checkers tell you, he’s also been known to shroud his anti-Christian views in flowery religious language.

The most radical thing about Buttigieg, however, isn’t his leftist sermonizing or his partner Chasten, it’s his support for late-term abortion of disabled children — another thing he pretends the Bible supports (it very much doesn’t).

On an episode of “The Breakfast Club Podcast” during his presidential campaign, Buttigieg defended abortion until the moment of birth. “There’s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath. And so even that is something that we can interpret differently,” Buttigieg claimed. “The most important thing is the person who should be drawing the line is the woman making the decision.”

He doubled down during an episode of “The View” a few months later, refusing to take a position against partial-birth abortion — in which a baby is partially delivered and then brutally killed — when confronted with the issue by Meghan McCain.

8. Alejandro Mayorkas

Alejandro Mayorkas, who insisted the massive surge of illegals over the southern border was not a crisis but a “challenge,” has more things to answer for.

Along with Becerra, Mayorkas, whom Biden tapped to lead the Department of Homeland Security, assisted former President Bill Clinton’s “pardongate” scandal by lobbying for clemency for Carlos Vignali, a convicted cocaine trafficker whose father had contributed to Democrat campaigns.

“U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas provided critical support for the Vignali commutation that was inappropriate, given his position,” said a 2002 House Committee on Government Reform report. “Mayorkas supported the Vignali commutation despite his ignorance of the facts of the case and his knowledge that the prosecutors responsible for the Vignali case opposed clemency.”

Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel in the Clinton administration, testified that it was the influence of Mayorkas, who reached out to Lindsey after talking with Vignali’s father, that sold him on the commutation. Despite federal prosecutor Todd Jones’s warnings against clemency because the drug dealer was “bad news” and a “major player,” Mayorkas opted to meet with Vignali’s father to discuss a potential pardon.

“Over the next two years, Mayorkas would see Horacio Vignali at various community events and at several one-on-one meetings with Vignali,” the report stated.

9. Vanita Gupta

In April, the Senate confirmed Vanita Gupta to be associate attorney general — but not before a handful of state attorneys general urged Biden to withdraw her nomination over dangerous and divisive policy preferences, specifically her support for defunding the police and the openly Marxist organization Black Lives Matter.

Gupta has specifically advocated for “community policing” and stripping police out of schools. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, an interest group where Gupta was president, published a report calling for “end[ing] the use of police in schools as a solution to student discipline.”

“Police officers should have no role in student disciplinary matters,” it said.

Gupta allegedly said every institution in the United States is racist, a claim Sen. Tom Cotton addressed in her confirmation hearing and which Gupta did not deny. She was also forced to apologize for smearing Republicans on Twitter — if you can call admitting to “fall[ing] prey” to “harsh” rhetoric an apology.

10. Kamala Harris

Kamala Harris’s radicalism is enough to fill a book — or several volumes. And now the Kavanaugh-attacker, rioter-bailer, Russia hoaxer, anti-vaxxer (under Trump), border evader, and pro-baby-killer vice president is just one heartbeat away from leading the free world — which probably wouldn’t be free for long if she were president instead of puppet-master.

CNN Caught Lying About Biden Administration’s Illegal Immigration Fiasco,"The crisis on the U.S. southern border continues to escalate, with border agents in June alone intercepting aliens nearly 190,000 times—a number not seen in more than 20 years. So bad is the situation that this week the Washington Post’s editorial board demanded a “cohesive border strategy” from the Biden administration and even CNN’s Brianna Keilar declared the president “has a real problem on his hands.”

While the leftist press has finally acknowledged the problem, the corrupt media remains committed to serving as the propaganda arm of the Biden administration, as most vividly demonstrated by Keilar’s Monday segment on CNN, which ran above the chyron “Biden’s Border Crisis Met with Incendiary Rhetoric from Right.”

Keilar’s segment dedicated a mere 20 seconds to the Biden administration’s border crisis before the “New Day” host pivoted to a nearly nine-minute “analysis” that accused the right of racism and portrayed conservatives’ outrage over the invasion taking place at the southern border as responsible for the mass killings at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018 and at a Walmart in El Paso in 2019.

Keilar then attempted to counter the border crisis’s negative impact on America’s fight against COVID. She began with a clip of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz stating the obvious to all but CNN viewers: “If you don’t want to see this pandemic come back—come back with the Delta variant or many—most of these illegal immigrants coming in having been vaccinated. They’re being put in cages with other people who are COVID-positive. They’re spreading COVID and then releasing COVID in our communities. This is lunacy.”

At this point, Keilar pulled her best Jen Psaki impression, claiming “the Biden administration has been using a Trump administration policy known as Title 42. It means that hundreds of thousands of migrants at the southern border, including asylum seekers, can’t enter because of the COVID public health emergency.” “Again, the Biden administration is enforcing Title 42,” Keilar reiterated, adding “in fact, since Biden took over—took office, over 510,000 people have been expelled under that rule. That is nearly twice as many people as those who were apprehended.”

While intoning these supposedly impressive statistics, CNN flashed the following graphic, showing a huge uptick in June of Title 42 expulsions, which immediately or expeditiously return aliens to the country from which they entered or to their home country. The graph, however, depicted as stable the number of so-called Title 8 apprehensions, in which aliens are allowed to remain in the United States pending further immigration proceedings that may take years to complete.

The CNN graphic is entirely false: The x-axis maintains that the numbers on the y-axis represent the “Title 42 Expulsions” and “Title 8 Apprehensions” for June, but official government statics instead show in June 103,014 Title 42 expulsions and 75,402 Title 8 apprehensions by U.S. Border Patrol, and an additional 1,893 Title 42 expulsions and 8,520 encounters by the Office of Field Operations.

Correctly graphed, these official figures plot much differently and show, not a sharp uptick in the number of alien expulsions under Title 42 in June, but a decline in the Biden administration’s use of Title 42.

It is hard to believe that CNN’s graphic represented an honest mistake given that, in her discussion of the figures, Keilar noted that the 500,000-plus figure of Title 42 expulsions represented the total number since Biden took office, and given that the graphic showed the number of aliens processed under Title 8 at the monthly June tally and not the cumulative figure. (Since the story ran, I have sought clarification from Keilar, CNN, and CNN’s media watchdog Brian Stelter, but without success.)

Given how bad things are at the border, it is unsurprising the Biden administration’s apologists in the press seek to spin his use of Title 42 expulsions, because the truth provides a glimpse into how their border policies have caused the current immigration crisis.

Under the Trump administration, the number of aliens crossing the southern border allowed to remain in our country dropped below 10,000 shortly after the Title 42 order was issued. It remained fairly stable, while the number of aliens expelled shot up. The first month of the Biden administration saw only a slight increase in both figures, until unchecked border crossings increased exponentially, followed by a decrease in the use of its Title 42 authority.

The following graphics likewise show both the substantial increase in border crossings and the Biden administration’s decreasing use in its expulsion authority.

These figures and accurate graphics tell the truth: While the Biden administration continues to use the Title 42 authority the Trump administration established to handle the COVID public health emergency, the Biden administration has significantly reduced its reliance on this very valuable tool to protect Americans. In fact, as of June, the number of aliens expelled under Title 42 fell nearly to the same level as the aliens remaining in the country.

Further, while the president continues to use his Title 42 authority to exclude nearly 90 percent of adults crossing the southern border, the Biden administration refuses to use Title 42 authority when minors—including older teenagers—cross the border unaccompanied by an adult.

This misguided policy has resulted in overwhelmed border facilities and “kids in cages” becoming “kids stacked in cages” during the pandemic. It also encourages further border crossers, putting those children at risk of sexual abuse and trafficking, which also funds criminal organizations that render their home countries even more violent, thus triggering an escalated desire for aliens to escape to America.

The Biden administration has also greatly reduced its use of Title 42 to close the border to alien families during the pandemic. In June 2021, the Biden administration expelled less than 20 percent of alien families who crossed the border.

These realities prompted House Republican Rep. Chip Roy to “introduce legislation for a discharge petition to require the enforcement of Title 42 so that we will turn people away at the border who have COVID rather than forcing this ridiculousness on the American people.” Yet, while reporting Roy’s comments, CNN pretended the Biden administration is enforcing Title 42, then flashed an inaccurate graph to “prove” its point.

The Biden administration also wants Americans to believe that, in response to the border crisis and the increased risk of COVID the Delta variant presents, the president continues to follow former President Trump’s border policies. In fact, just last week, the Biden administration filed an order in the case of Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas—named after Biden Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas—informing the court of the Biden administration’s conclusion that, pursuant to Title 42, it will “continue[] to prohibit the introduction of ‘covered noncitizens’ into the United States along the U.S. land and adjacent coastal borders,” which includes “family units.”

The Biden administration explained that the Centers for Disease Control concluded that the Title 42 order remained appropriate given the particular risks of COVID-19 transmission in congregated settings, the inability to maintain physical distancing at Department of Homeland Security settings, especially given the significant increase in the numbers of migrants crossing the border, the emergence of the highly transmissible Delta variant, “and the uptick in community transmission and hospitalizations along the U.S.-Mexico border.”

Previously, the Biden administration and American Civil Liberties Union had agreed to hold in abeyance the ACLU’s threatened class-action lawsuit that challenged the Title 42 order as it applied to alien families, but following the Biden administration’s renewal of the Trump expulsion order, the parties informed presiding Judge Emmett Sullivan last week that they had reached an impasse. In turn, Judge Sullivan directed the ACLU to file a reply in support of its motion for a preliminary injunction, which is due today.

Following briefing and argument, Sullivan is almost certain to hold that the Title 42 order is invalid when applied to alien families because he had previously held in P.J.E.S. v. Mayorkas that the Title 42 order is invalid when applied to unaccompanied minors. In that case, Judge Sullivan enjoined enforcement of the Title 42 order. However, after the Trump administration appealed that decision to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the appellate court stayed Judge Sullivan’s decision, allowing the Title 42 order to continue to be used to expel minors.

Once the Biden administration took over, his legal team agreed with the ACLU to hold the case in abeyance. Lee Gelernt, one of the lead ACLU attorneys in P.J.E.S. v. Mayorkas, told me the case will remain on hold because, at the moment, “the Biden administration is not expelling unaccompanied minors under Title 42.”

Given the Biden administration’s stingy use of the Title 42 order to expel families, one must wonder if the president’s claim to stand by the Trump Title 42 order is pure politics. While professing his dedication to protecting the border amidst the COVID crisis, he seems happy to allow the court to “force” him to do what he wants to do: abandon any semblance of border security.

One thing is certain: The Biden administration’s buddies in the press will provide any cover necessary to the president, even if that cover requires lies, damn lies, and CNN graphics.

Hunter Biden’s Prostitute Videos Indict His Father And U.S. Intelligence,"A Russian woman, a drug dealer, and two of his compatriots may have stolen a laptop from Hunter Biden in 2018, Hunter told a prostitute in another sex video, leaving the president’s son concerned he may be blackmailed because of his father’s political position.

While the salacious video of Hunter Biden released earlier this week exposes more details about the troubling lifestyle of the president’s son, it reveals much more about a corrupt and complicit media, a corrupt and incompetent intelligence community, and a corrupt and compromised Joe Biden.

Late Wednesday, The Daily Mail published what it called “unearthed footage” of a naked Hunter Biden telling a prostitute that “the Russians have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex!” According to The Daily Mail, “after filming himself having sex with the woman using his laptop in January 2019, Hunter left the camera rolling as he recounted a Vegas bender in which he spent ‘18 days going round from penthouse suite to penthouse suite,’ sometimes costing $10,000 a night.”

The video then captured Hunter telling the prostitute that during the summer of 2018 he had nearly overdosed from drugs while partying in Las Vegas with his drug dealer and two other guys. When he came to later, “there was this Russian 35-year-old, really nice, pure brunette,” Hunter explained. He then discovered his laptop was missing.

“I think he’s the one that stole my computer,” Hunter said on the tape, apparently referring to his drug dealer. “I think the three of them, the three guys that were like a little group. The dealer and his two guys, I took them everywhere,” Hunter explained. “They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex f-cking, you know,” Hunter added. “My computer, I had taken tons of like, just left like that cam on,” Hunter continued, “and somebody stole it during that period of time.”

The prostitute is then heard asking Hunter if he worried the Russian thieves would try to “blackmail” him. “Yeah, in some way yeah,” Hunter replied, noting his father is “running for president,” and that “I talk about it all the time.”

Connections to the New York Post Story

Like the videos, emails, and text messages recovered from the MacBook Hunter Biden abandoned at a Delaware repair shop and reported on by The New York Post in October 2020, the footage published Wednesday by The Daily Mail exposes recent disturbing and illegal behavior by the president’s middle-aged son.

But like the New York Post’s earlier reporting, the issue here is not Hunter’s addiction or his illegal behavior. Rather, the latest video reveals the corruption—and more—of the media and the intelligence community, while also establishing how greatly our current president is compromised.

When the New York Post broke news of the contents of Hunter Biden’s abandoned MacBook shortly before the election, corporate media framed the story as misinformation and refused to report on it. Leftist-controlled social media outlets went further by de-platforming The New York Post and blocking the sharing of the article.

The corporate media’s bias in favor of then-candidate Joe Biden was clear to all but the most hardened partisans on the left, but Wednesday’s reporting from The Daily Mail now reveals another reality: that while the corrupt media ignored the story, even a hooker saw the significance of a missing laptop containing Hunter Biden’s sex videos.

Did he worry about being blackmailed? the prostitute asked, followed by Hunter acknowledging that was a genuine concern since his father intended to run for president. The elder Biden announced his candidacy just two months after his son’s first computer went missing. Yet when The New York Post reported the existence of the Hunter Biden sex videos on the abandoned laptop, corporate media ignored this huge political scandal.

Media-Intelligence Collusion

The corruption revealed, however, extends much beyond the media, to the intelligence community. Here, recall that after The New York Post reported on the contents of the Hunter Biden MacBook, “50 former senior intelligence officials,” led by former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, “signed on to a letter outlining their belief that the recent disclosure of emails allegedly belonging to Joe Biden’s son ‘has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.’”

That letter, clearly intended to turn the Biden scandal into a Trump-Russia scandal, now takes on a new significance in light of The Daily Mail’s reporting.

Hunter Biden believed that sometime in the summer of 2018, Russians stole his laptop, which contained videotapes of Biden engaged in sex acts with prostitutes. Either U.S. intelligence knew of this or they didn’t, but both scenarios are equally damning.

If U.S. intelligence agencies knew of this fact, then why would “50 former senior intelligence officials” proclaim to Americans that The New York Post story had “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation?” Simply put: to counter the scandal and influence the election for their preferred candidate.

Who Is Publishing Disinformation?

Further, re-reading the intelligence officials’ letter in light of The Daily Mail’s reporting reveals how manipulative Clapper and his cronies were. In the earlier portions of the letter, they spoke of a “Russian information operation,” which suggests the information published by The New York Post was accurate, but released by Russia to influence the election. But in closing the letter, they quoted “media reports” saying “the FBI has now opened an investigation into Russian involvement in this case.”

“According to USA Today,” the letter continued, “federal authorities are investigating whether the material supplied to the New York Post by Rudy Giuliani. . . is part of a smoke bomb of disinformation pushed by Russia.”

By quoting USA Today’s claim that federal authorities were investigating whether the reporting on Hunter Biden’s laptop is “disinformation,” former intelligence officials succeeded in changing the narrative of the story. What began as them claiming the story appeared as a “Russian information operation” ended by sleight of hand, representing The New York Post’s story as consisting of “disinformation.”

Surely some signatories of that letter would have known Hunter Biden believed Russians had stolen his laptop with the compromising information. Or, if not, that would just show how incompetent our intelligence agencies are.

Here we are not speaking merely of the former intelligence officials who signed the letter. At the time The New York Post published the videos, emails, and texts from Hunter’s MacBook, in October 2020, intelligence agencies would have been focused on any issues related to the then-Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, for months, which clearly would include risks caused by his addict son.

Collusion, Disinformation, and Incompetence

Did the intelligence community really not know of Hunter’s two missing laptops? If not, that’s pure incompetence.

In December 2019, the FBI seized the MacBook Hunter had left at the repair store. It is unbelievable to think the FBI did not promptly review the contents to determine if it was in fact Hunter’s and to determine whether the material on the laptop created a national security risk. It is also beyond the pale to think agents did not ask Hunter about that laptop.

Yet ten months later, when The New York Post published the video and email messages, someone at the FBI told USA Today they were investigating whether the story was Russian “misinformation.” To date, though, there has been nothing but corroboration of the materials published by The New York Post, so who at the FBI suggested the content was “misinformation?”

Further, after recovering the MacBook from the Delaware repair store, a competent intelligence industry would have then also discovered the second missing laptop—the one Hunter told a prostitute in January 2019 he believed the Russians had stolen. Did agents know of that fact? Did they brief Joe Biden on the fact that the laptops contained information that could subject Hunter, and thus Biden himself, to blackmail?

After all, James Comey briefed Donald Trump on the false but salacious Christopher Steele dossier, so why not brief Biden on the bigger risk that he or Hunter was compromised? Or if they did brief Biden, then why did no one leak that briefing to CNN, as they had with the briefing of the fake Steele dossier?

These questions have nothing to do with Hunter Biden’s disgraceful behavior and everything to do with whether our intelligence community is incompetent and corrupt.

Many Questions with Distressing Answers

Wednesday’s revelation also raises the question of when Joe Biden learned of the second stolen laptop. Did he know it was missing before the intelligence community did? Did he tell intelligence officials so they could investigate to determine if Hunter had been ensnared by Russian operatives?

Finally, while the latest tape concerned only Hunter’s sexual improprieties, the risk that Joe Biden is gravely compromised extends much beyond a potential sex scandal involving his son. Americans need to remember that Hunter’s MacBook contained much more than videos of Hunter engaged in illegal drug use and sex with prostitutes: That laptop also included text messages and emails that implicated “the Big Guy” in a pay-to-play scandal.

So news that Hunter believed Russians stole another laptop raises serious national security concerns over whether foreign adversaries hold sway over the senior Biden based on the president’s own misconduct when he was vice president or a senator.

But don’t expect the corrupt press to pose these questions to the Biden administration—proving they have even lower standards than Hunter’s prostitute.

"No, Biden Can’t Blame Trump For The Afghanistan Withdrawal Disaster","While the Biden administration has already attempted to shift blame to Donald Trump for the scenes coming out of Afghanistan, Biden owns both the decision to leave and the catastrophic withdrawal he oversaw as commander-in-chief.

“When I came to office, I inherited a deal cut by my predecessor—which he invited the Taliban to discuss at Camp David on the eve of 9/11 of 2019—that left the Taliban in the strongest position militarily since 2001 and imposed a May 1, 2021 deadline on U.S. forces,” Biden said in a statement released Saturday.

“Therefore, when I became President, I faced a choice — follow through on the deal, with a brief extension to get our forces and our allies’ forces out safely, or ramp up our presence and send more American troops to fight once again in another country’s civil conflict,” President Biden maintained in the written statement.

Bunk. President Biden was no more bound by former President Trump’s agreement with the Taliban than Trump was required to abide by former President Barack Obama’s Iran deal, known formerly as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Neither agreement bound future presidents because neither deal was presented to the Senate for ratification.

As the current commander-in-chief, Biden holds power to decide every aspect of the withdrawal decision. Biden already extended Trump’s May 1, 2021 deadline to September, and if he believed the Taliban too strong, the Afghanistan government too weak, or the withdrawal decision entirely misplaced, the current president could have changed course.

He didn’t because he didn’t want to.

In contrast, Biden held no bones about executing a sharp course reversal when Trump’s policy positions conflicted with his administration’s.

On his first day in office, for example, Biden officially rejoined the Paris climate accord, from which former President Trump had withdrawn. The Biden administration later waived sanctions on Iran in an attempt to restart the Iran nuclear deal. President Biden reversed Trump’s ban on transgender people in the military and tossed the Mexico City policy to restart funding of international organizations that promote or provide abortions.

The Biden administration also reversed several extremely effective policies Trump adopted to address the border crisis, including Trump’s decision to use Title 42 authority to expel aliens to Mexico or their country of origin, given the public health crisis presented by COVID-19. Biden also ditched the former president’s “remain in Mexico” policy that prevented illegal aliens from absconding within the United States while awaiting immigration hearings. These reversals quickly led to the now record-setting crisis on the Southern border.

If Biden believed it in America’s best interest to remain in Afghanistan for the long-term, for another year, or even for another month, as commander-in-chief he could have made that call.

Further, even if leaving now is in our country’s best interests, Biden bears full responsibility for his failed execution of the withdrawal. Under Biden’s command, the Taliban reportedly seized hundreds of U.S. Humvees, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, and several million-dollar U.S. drones.

No one but Biden is to blame for the administration being “clearly caught off guard by the Taliban’s rapid advances in recent days as the militant Islamic group took over a slew of provincial capitals across the country and encircled Kabul,” forcing Biden to rush thousands more troops to Afghanistan just to safely evacuate American and embassy personnel two full weeks before the August 31 deadline Biden had announced for withdrawing all U.S. forces from Afghanistan.

There is much to debate about the United States’ involvement in a 20-year war in Afghanistan, but it should be clear to all that Biden botched the withdrawal. The only question remaining is exactly how badly.

The Media Can’t Hide From Their Terrible Afghanistan Reporting,"After months of fawning over the septuagenarian president, corporate media already looked bad. But now even they can’t cover for the nowhere-to-be-found Biden as his disorganized withdrawal from Afghanistan descends into heartbreaking chaos, and they look even worse for ever trying to.

On Monday, CNN’s Clarissa Ward reported that nearby Taliban members who were shouting “Death to America” seemed “friendly at the same time.” Her analysis is a fitting soundbite to represent the shallow stupidity of the corporate media’s failed Afghanistan reporting.

Over and over, talking heads scorned the Trump administration’s efforts to get out of Afghanistan as disorganized, foolish, and planless. The messaging about the incoming Biden administration — on Afghanistan and everything else — was that seasoned professionals were finally back in the situation room and the hotheaded Trumpsters who wanted to throw the system to pot were out.

“With Afghanistan decision, Biden restores foreign policymaking process that Trump had largely abandoned,” headlined the Washington Post in April 2021.

“To many in the White House, widely reported accounts of the disagreements [between Biden officials] miss the point, especially in light of President Donald Trump’s habit of not even consulting the military before tweeting abrupt diktats on troop withdrawals,” the Post’s Karen DeYoung and Missy Ryan wrote.

Prior to this week, the propaganda press crowed that incompetence had kept Trump from completing an Afghanistan withdrawal, and lauded the coming victory that withdrawal would be for Biden.

“Trump’s crippling Attention-Deficit-Disorder and the serial incompetence of both him and his team let a huge opportunity slip away — and now Biden will reap the rewards,” said Keith Naughton in The Hill.

“Trump blew it, and now Biden will get the win,” he added, under the headline “Afghanistan withdrawal: Trump fumbles, Biden scores.”

“Leaving Afghanistan the Right Way” was the Wall Street Journal editorial board’s synopsis of Biden’s plan, back in February.

Trump’s “reckless” deadline of withdrawing by May 1 “was driven by Donald Trump’s domestic political instincts — not a strategic calculation,” the board noted. “President Biden is wisely reviewing that decision.”

CNN coverage echoed the description of Trump’s plan as “reckless,” choosing to describe Biden’s approach with a quote from his former boss about Biden’s “bold leadership.”

Journalist Drew Holden also pointed out the tone change between administrations from the New York Times, TIME Magazine, and other corporate outlets.

MSNBC found someone (who now happens to be a member of Biden’s cabinet) to quote saying Trump’s foreign policy decisions were made “impulsively, erratically, emotionally” and then found someone else (a former running mate of Hillary Clinton) to describe the Biden administration’s plans for withdrawal as “the right call.”

Corporate media spent Biden’s entire presidency up to now hyping Biden’s looming exit from Afghanistan, after painting the Trump team as incompetent. Now, the Biden team has woefully failed to deliver. Biden’s failure to have any perceptible strategy in pulling out of Afghanistan is exactly what the media predicted from Trump, and assured us would never happen under the gentleman from Scranton.

And now they look like idiots, who never knew what they were talking about (or if they did, were never honest about it).

As the Biden administration seeks to blame its embarrassing failure on Trump — an excuse that doesn’t hold up under the most basic scrutiny — some in the media will surely seek to cover their own role in the fiasco by doing the same thing. ABC News was already amplifying Biden’s blame game on Monday, making the cop-out halfhearted non-rebuttal that maybe both presidents hold responsibility for Biden’s failure to accompany the decision to withdraw with any kind of strategy for withdrawal.

MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” was running the chyron: “Trump’s role in Afghanistan.”

Others in the corporate media have feigned shock, glibly accepting the claim that the White House and the intelligence community are just as “stunned” as they are.

President Joe Biden and other top U.S. officials have been stunned by the pace of the Taliban's nearly complete takeover of Afghanistan, as the planned withdrawal of American forces urgently became a mission to ensure a safe evacuation. https://t.co/gx4tmJ4AYv — The Associated Press (@AP) August 15, 2021

Still, others are frustrated that after months of pushing the narrative of Biden’s competence they have been definitively shown to be liars. Anyone who denied, overlooked, or downplayed Biden’s incompetence up to now cannot deny his administration’s failure to have an exit strategy in Afghanistan. Not only is the withdrawal chaos showing a complete lack of planning, Biden spent the weekend AWOL and his press secretary is unreachable on vacation.

“At the heart of Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign was a single word: competence,” wrote CNN’s Chris Cillizza on Monday with hands-in-the-air dismay. “After four years of Donald Trump’s incompetence in, well, everything, the Biden argument was that the country badly needed a steady hand on the tiller.”

But now, Cillizza hand-wrings, “the crisis in Afghanistan is front and center in this reexamining of Biden’s competence argument.” Cillizza himself described Biden as “confident and competent” during Biden’s campaign.

Of course, you still won’t see the mealy-mouthed media breathe the same fire toward Biden that they would have directed at Trump had this disaster (and lack of response to it) occurred under the former president.

I can’t begin to comprehend the reaction if Trump took a long weekend, worked for 2 days, flew to Mar-a-Lago and then went radio silent for a weekend at Camp David while all of this was happening — Ben Williamson (@_WilliamsonBen) August 15, 2021

But whether pundits salvage their injured pride by weakly turning on Biden or by continuing to cover for him, his failure to deliver on their promises of his competence has made them look deeply foolish. He has displayed the cluelessness and folly they repeatedly predicted of Trump, and anyone with a brain can see it.

This Texas Court Ruling Proves The Border Crisis Is Joe Biden’s Fault,"Late Friday, a federal court ruled the Biden administration acted arbitrarily in ending the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) the Trump administration established to require aliens to remain in Mexico pending immigration proceedings. Not only is the decision a huge victory for the plaintiffs, Texas and Missouri, in their fight to force the federal government to secure the border, the opinion provides a perfect primer for Americans on immigration law and the border crisis.

The court’s analysis also provides a devastating indictment of the Biden administration, establishing the current invasion of the U.S. southern border is a self-inflicted wound. Here are the key highlights.

People Without Documents Should Be Sent Home

In a thorough 53-page opinion, federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Donald Trump appointee, began with a summary of the relevant immigration law and the history of the MPP. As Kacsmaryk explained, Section 1225 of U.S. immigration code establishes procedures for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to process aliens who are “applicant[s] for admission” to the United States, “whether they arrive at a port of entry or cross the border unlawfully.”

First, an immigration officer must determine whether an alien is entitled to be admitted. If the person is “not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted,” then the federal immigration statute provides that the alien “shall be detained” for removal proceedings.

The immigration statute further provides that aliens without valid entry documents, or individuals who misrepresent their identity, “shall” be removed without further proceedings, unless the alien has indicated an intent to apply for asylum or claimed a fear of persecution. Under federal law, such asylum applicants “shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum.”

As a matter of statutory interpretation, the word “shall” represents a mandatory command, meaning the DHS must detain aliens. However, as Judge Kacsmaryk explained in his opinion, there are two relevant exceptions to the detention requirement.

First, the DHS retains discretion to “parole,” or release, certain aliens “for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” But such “parole” is available “only on a case-by-case basis,” and is not intended “to replace established refugee processing channels,” the court explained. Accordingly, the court held that “any class-wide parole scheme that paroled aliens into the United States simply because DHS does not have the detention capacity would be a violation of the narrowly prescribed parole scheme” contained in federal immigration code.

Second, rather than detain an alien in the United States, Congress has authorized the DHS to return an alien to the “foreign territory contiguous to the United States” from which the alien arrived, pending removal proceedings.

Remember the Surge in Asylum Fraud

After laying out the above relevant statutory framework, Judge Kacsmaryk provided the factual backdrop to the Trump administration’s adoption of the MPP. In 2018, the United States was experiencing an immigration surge at the southern border, with officials encountering approximately 2,000 inadmissible aliens per day. Many of those requested asylum, claiming they were being persecuted, which prevented federal agents from immediately removing the aliens.

Yet, as the court explained, following further proceedings on their claims, only 14 percent of aliens from the fiscal years 2008 to 2019, had legitimate asylum claims. “With so many ‘fraudulent asylum claims,” “the dramatic increase in illegal migration” was “making it harder for the U.S. to devote appropriate resources to individuals who [were] legitimately fleeing persecution.”

Further, the evidence presented to the court established that many of these individuals “disappeared” in the United States and became “fugitives.” From fiscal year 2008 to 2019, 32 percent of aliens “absconded into the United States,” never appearing for their immigration proceedings, and were then “ordered removed in absentia.”

In response to the 2018 surge on the southern border and these troubling statistics, on December 20, 2018, Trump’s homeland security secretary established the MPP program under which aliens from third-countries who entered the United States from Mexico would be returned to Mexico, pending resolution of the removal and asylum proceedings.

The goal of the MPP, as the Trump administration explained, was to ensure “certain aliens attempting to enter the U.S. illegally or without documentation, including those who claim asylum, will no longer be released into the country, where they often fail to file an asylum application and/or disappear before an immigration judge can determine the merits of any claim.”

This Plan Worked

After the DHS issued guidance for implementing the MPP in January 2019, the agency began using it, first in San Diego and Calexico, California and El Paso, Texas, then nationwide. The Trump administration also obtained Mexico’s cooperation, with Mexico committing to temporarily permit aliens who had entered the United States from Mexico without valid documentation to remain in Mexico pending further proceedings. Later, the DHS constructed temporary structures at the American side of the southern border to hold hearings for noncitizens subject to the MPP, allowing for prompt resolution of those claims.

Less than a year after the MPP program was launched, the DHS concluded it had “demonstrated operational effectiveness” and had “returned more than 55,000 aliens to Mexico under MPP.” The DHS further concluded the MPP proved itself “an indispensable tool in addressing the ongoing crisis at the southern border and restoring integrity to the immigration system.” The DHS also found that in areas where the most aliens were returned to Mexico pursuant to MPP, there was “a rapid and substantial decline in apprehensions.”

Statistics cited by the court bore out the DHS’s conclusion: “Since a recent peak of more than 144,000 in May 2019, total enforcement actions . . . have decreased by 64% through September 2019.” Additionally, “border encounters with Central American families—who were the main driver of the crisis and comprise a majority of MPP-amenable aliens—have decreased by approximately 80%.” In total, by December 31, 2020, the DHS had enrolled more than 68,000 aliens in the MPP program.

Additionally, the DHS concluded that the MPP had helped restore integrity to the asylum system, with asylum being granted to those with legitimate claims within months, rather than years. Conversely, because asylum “no longer constitute[d] a free ticket into the United States,” aliens with meritless claims began “to voluntarily return home.”

Biden Knew MPP Was Effective And Still Canceled It

Yet on its first day in office, the Biden administration immediately suspended new enrollments in the MPP, pending further review. Judge Kacsmaryk found the incoming Biden administration had suspended the program even though it knew the DHS had found the MPP effective as a matter of policy and had received warnings about the consequences of repeal from career employees.

Texas and Missouri responded by suing the Biden administration, alleging that in its suspension the federal government had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA. It also allegedly violated Section 1225 of the immigration code, which mandates aliens be held pending removal. Finally, the complaint alleged Biden violated the U.S. Constitution’s mandate that the president “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”

On June 1, the Biden administration, after purportedly finishing a review of the MPP program, announced it was terminating the program. Thereafter, the states amended their complaint, alleging the final June ruling also violated the APA.

Canceling MPP Helped Ruin the Border

In its decision last Friday, the court noted that the Biden administration’s termination of MPP “necessarily increases the number of aliens present in the United States” and that without the program, the federal government is “forced to release and parole aliens into the United States because Defendants simply do not have the resources to detain aliens as mandated by statute.”

The court further stressed that “the termination of MPP has contributed to the current border surge,” explaining that the DHS had previously confirmed that the “MPP implementation contribute[d] to decreasing the volume of inadmissible aliens arriving in the United States on land from Mexico.” Even defense counsel for the Biden administration acknowledged that “it’s fair to say that [MPP] probably deterred some individuals from coming to the United States.”

Indeed, federal data shows that since the Biden administration ended the MPP in January 2021, the number of border encounters jumped from 75,000 to 173,000 in April 2021, and to nearly 189,000 in June 2021. July’s figures, which the court did not mention, are even worse, exceeding 212,000 Southern border encounters.

Texas and Missouri suffer as a result of these increased numbers, incurring higher costs related to the issuance of driver’s licenses, providing public education to students—from $9,000 to $11,000 in Texas—and providing taxpayer-funded health services. Aliens who would have been enrolled in MPP are now released into the United States and committing crimes in Texas and Missouri. Texas already spends more than $100 million a year to house nearly 9,000 illegal aliens in its criminal justice system.

These facts led the court to conclude the states had standing to sue the Biden administration, and the judge found in favor of Texas and Missouri on their APA claims.

Actually, Presidents Can’t Act Like Tyrants

Among other things, the APA prohibits agency actions that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.” In other words, federal agencies “must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”

The court in Texas v. Biden concluded the Biden administration acted arbitrarily by ignoring critical factors in deciding to discontinue the MPP. First, the administration ignored the DHS’s previous finding that aliens without meritorious claims were “beginning to voluntarily return home.” Also ignored was the DHS’ earlier conclusion that the MPP addressed the “perverse incentives” created by allowing “those with non-meritorious claims . . . to remain in the country for lengthy periods of time.”

“The June 1 Memorandum never once mentions these benefits,” Judge Kacsmaryk noted. The memo also failed to address the DHS’ previous finding that 9 out of 10 asylum cases from the “Northern Triangle countries” of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador are ultimately found meritless, and that the MPP discouraged aliens with non-meritorious claims from traveling and attempting to cross the border in the first place.

Second, the court concluded that the Biden administration improperly ignored warnings from career DHS personnel that “the suspension of the MPP, along with other policies, would lead to a resurgence of illegal aliens attempting to illegally cross the border.” From the time the DHS suspended the program in January until June 1, the number of border encounters increased substantially, as career staff had predicted.

Biden Didn’t Care about the Law or Costs

Third, Judge Kacsmaryk explained, the DHS secretary failed to consider “at all” the costs to the states flowing from ending the MPP. The Biden administration’s DHS did more than ignore these factors, the court wrote; the DHS also acted arbitrarily in terminating the MPP based on “questions” it had about the high number of “in abstentia removals.”

The problem, here, is that the DHS assumed—without evidence—that the 44 percent of individuals who failed to appear for immigration hearings presented legitimate asylum cases, as opposed to were individuals with meritless claims who removed themselves once they were denied access to the United States.

The federal court further found that the Biden administration failed to consider the impact ending the MPP had on the DHS’s statutory obligation to detain aliens. “Not once did the June 1 Memorandum discuss DHS’s mandatory-detention obligation,” the court wrote. For all of these reasons, the court found the Biden administration acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and thus in violation of the APA, by terminating the MPP.

Finally, Judge Kacsmaryk considered the appropriate remedy for Texas and Missouri, concluding vacatur of the June 1 memorandum was appropriate. He then issued an injunction ordering the defendants “to enforce and implement MPP in good faith until such a time as it has been lawfully rescinded in compliance with the APA and until such a time as the federal government has sufficient determination capacity to detain all aliens subject to mandatory detentions.”

To ensure compliance, the court directed the government to file monthly reports stating the total number of encounters, the total number of aliens expelled, the government’s total detention capacity and current detention-usage rate, and the number of aliens paroled into the United States. The court entered this injunction on a nationwide basis, then delayed the effective date for seven days to allow the Biden administration to file an emergency appeal with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The Biden administration is certain to appeal, but there is just no way the president can win. Yes, he may prevail in the court of appeals, but Biden will still lose in the court of public opinion. That’s because the district court’s opinion exposed the dirty truth behind the border crisis—it was entirely preventable and the foreseeable result of the Biden administration’s reversal of Trump’s immigration policies.

What To Make Of The Media Blackout Of The Latest Hunter Biden Scandal,"The establishment media have settled a new motto: “If we don’t cover it, it didn’t happen.” The uniform silence of the supposed standard-bearers of journalism in response to last week’s release of another Hunter Biden video confirms the corrupt media’s adoption of this maxim.

On Wednesday, The Daily Mail first broke the story that it had obtained a copy of a video showing a naked Hunter Biden telling a prostitute that in the summer of 2018 he nearly overdosed during a drug-laden binge in Las Vegas. After coming to, a Russian woman, Hunter’s drug dealer, and two of the dealer’s associates remained in the Vegas penthouse, he said, and Hunter later discovered his laptop missing.

“I think he’s the one that stole my computer,” Hunter told the prostitute. “I think the three of them, the three guys that were like a little group. The dealer and his two guys, I took them everywhere.” “They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex f-cking, you know,” the video posted by The Daily Mail showed Hunter saying. “My computer, I had taken tons of like, just left like that cam on,” Hunter continued, “and somebody stole it during that period of time.”

In response, the prostitute asked Hunter if he worried the Russian thieves would try to “blackmail” him. “Yeah, in some way yeah,” Hunter replied, noting his father was “running for president,” and that “I talk about it all the time.”

While BBC monitoring of Russian media reported that by Thursday all three Russian primetime TV news stations had focused on the newly released video of President Biden’s son, American legacy networks and print outlets ignored the story entirely, even while reporting on the upcoming auction of Hunter Biden’s artwork and concerns over influence-peddling.

Coverage of the story remained mainly limited to Fox News and conservative media outlets. While Newsweek ran a piece on the tape, the article’s focus was more on how conservatives were reacting to the news than on the national security implications flowing from the video.

After providing a synopsis of The Daily Mail article, the Newsweek article pivoted, stating, “A number of conservative commentators and lawmakers are discussing the Mail report on social media. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee shared the article and referred to prominent Democratic lawmakers involved in the impeachment of former President Donald Trump.”

Screengrabs of tweets from Huckabee, Mollie Hemingway, Nick Adams, and Liz Wheeler followed, as if the importance lay not in the national security risk revealed, but in conservatives’ response to the video. But as pundit and law professor Jonathan Turley noted, The Daily Mail story “is major news from any standpoint.” Turley continued:

Either the President’s son admitted that Russians have blackmail material on him or the media (or others) have created a fake videotape and falsely framed Biden. One would expect, if it is the latter, that the Biden team will be announcing a lawsuit today. However, like the coverage in most major news outlets, there are only the familiar sound of crickets.

Turley is correct, but understates the significance of the video: If authentic, the video reveals national security risks extending much beyond Russians having blackmail material on the president’s son.

First, given the emails and text messages saved on the MacBook that Hunter abandoned at a Delaware repair shop, it is extremely likely the second laptop (the stolen Vegas one) provided the Russians blackmail material on Joe Biden concerning “the Big Guy” and the pay-to-play scandal under which the elder Biden reportedly received a 10 percent cut.

Second, given how Hunter says the computer was stolen, questions abound over whether Russian operatives had gotten close to Hunter and, if so, what else they may have learned besides what was contained on the laptop.

Third, the incident raises serious concerns about the strength of American intelligence agencies. Did our intelligence communities know of the existence of this video before the Daily Mail published it? Were they aware of the stolen laptop? Do they know who stole the laptop and whether they were Russian agents? Do they know the extent of damaging material in the hands of our adversaries? Did they brief Joe Biden and his national security team on their findings?

The potential blackmailing of Hunter Biden pales in comparison to the real national security risks revealed by the videos, yet the corrupt media couldn’t care less.

That the media is not questioning the authenticity of the video indicates they both believe the videos are real and know a repeat of their performance in October 2020 won’t fly in the public’s eye. That time, in response to The New York Post’s release of similar videos, the corrupt press and intelligence officials spun the video as “misinformation” long enough to squelch the story, get The New York Post de-platformed, and prop up Joe Biden’s candidacy until election day.

So the only option for a press wishing to protect President Biden is to ignore the story.

Democrats Got What They Wanted With Biden: A White House Autopen,"In case you were wondering what President Joe Biden has reportedly been up to lately, besides letting the Taliban take over Afghanistan, here are a few headlines:

“Biden ‘checking‘ if he can overrule states and order universal masks in schools”

“Biden to press private businesses to require COVID vaccinations for employees”

“Biden extends eviction ban”

“Biden calls for half of new cars to be electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030”

“Biden notches big win as Senate passes $1 trillion infrastructure bill”

A lot of action is credited to the new president. One source took the time to list “100 Accomplishments in 100 Days: What has Joe done for me lately,” a worshipful testament so laden with effusive praise it would’ve made Mao Zedong’s palace followers envious.

To name just a few, the author notes Biden has expanded child tax credits, given LGBT people special protections, decreased deportations, extended federal unemployment insurance, provided billions in emergency rental assistance, cancelled student debt for 72,000 borrowers, created more than 18,000 jobs on public lands, stopped drilling in the Arctic, and many more feats – including a momentous change to the White House website to ask for pronouns.

So many accomplishments. All Mao ever did was swim the Yangtze River in his old age at a faster-than-an-Olympic-gold-medalist pace.

The Human Autopen

CNN analyst Julian Zelizer wrote recently of “Joe Biden’s Big Week,” which consisted of a new COVID-19 vaccination mandate for federal employees and the then-looming possibility of passing the big “infrastructure” bill. With unmistakable glee, Zelizer noted “if [Americans] want to learn or work” they better do as Joe says and get the shots – time for “the forceful model.” He also salivates at what can be accomplished if only senators will disregard the legal limits of the reconciliation process and ram through “more robust policy.”

Democrats love the mandates and the bloated government spending they’re getting. And they love that there is a man with a mighty pen who signs off on all of it.

But even as they credit Joe in each day’s stack of headlines, Democrat loyalists posing as journalists surely know Biden has done none of it. He is merely the powerful chess piece in the middle of the board, the pawn with queen-like powers moved by others from square to square to establish control in the game of politics.

Now and then they even admit it. As Zelizer writes: “Unlike other presidents who attract voters through charisma, soaring rhetoric or the promise of bold new agendas, Biden’s selling point was always that he would focus on the task of problem-solving, tackling the nation’s toughest policy challenges.”

Translation: “Never mind the man or his ideas. Just give us our policy changes.” Policy has become a euphemism for political control. It is the great prize, the ability to force change – by law, by regulation, or by decree, if necessary.

‘I’m Not Working For You!’

When the White House had to announce after the G7 Summit in June that the president is “the clear and consensus leader of the free world,” it confirmed that he is not. Russian President Vladimir Putin openly exploits that weakness when he invites Biden to talk, “but on the condition that we do it actually live, online. But with no delays, directly in an open, direct discussion.” Strong leaders relish verbal sparring; weak ones hide behind carefully scripted notes.

Who can name a single inspiring speech from Biden over his 44-plus years of public life? Who can even understand him? Are there any known acts of courage, besides his inexplicable confrontation with the poolside gangster Corn Pop?

A few words do reveal Joe’s character. President Lincoln once said, “You can tell the greatness of a man by what makes him angry.” On the campaign trail, we saw what stirs Joe’s ire.

When a voter dared to question him on policy, the candidate snapped, “You’re full of sh-t,” and “I’m going to go outside with your -ss.” When the worker responded, “You’re working for me, man!” Joe shot back, “I’m not working for you!” Anger sometimes evokes the ugly Freudian slip.

Governed by Handlers, Not President Biden

Joe’s lack of inspiring words matches his flip-flops on key policy positions.

He once said “the military should get involved” in border enforcement, but now there are calls in his camp to dismantle Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He voted for the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act that fast-tracked deportations, but now has the military flying illegal aliens into cities around the nation.

After the radical fringe of his left-wing base demanded an extension of the ban on evictions, he flip-flopped on that too – even after admitting there is no legal authority to do so. Joe will support what he is told to support.

Americans are not fooled. The man who now holds the title of president of the United States, the one who supposedly got a record 81 million votes, couldn’t fill a middle-school-sized auditorium for a much-ballyhooed town hall on a friendly network. Titles can be bestowed, but respect must be earned.

From the beginning, White House operatives have worked to limit Joe’s public outings. The new leader of the free world held no press conference in his first 60 days in office. From stumbling on the steps of Air Force One to stumbling on basic words, Joe’s mental acuity crisis has been exposed. But he can still sign his name.

Even as Biden is president in the legal sense, his powers have been subsumed by others: party officials, bureaucrats, and outside activists. They are the “Biden administration,” the ones who surreptitiously wield the presidential pen from a distance. Democrats got what they wanted in Joe Biden, but America is paying for it.

EXCLUSIVE: FBI Knew Of Hunter's Missing Laptop By December 2019,"The FBI knew as early as December 2019 that Hunter Biden believed Russians had stolen his laptop, which he believed made him vulnerable to blackmail because of compromising evidence on the laptop combined with his father’s presidential ambitions. This explosive revelation establishes that either Joe Biden lied to the American public, or the intelligence community lied to him.

When The New York Post went public in October 2020 with videos, text messages, and emails from an abandoned MacBook laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, Joe Biden told Americans the laptop was a Russian hoax.

But now Brian Della Rocca, an attorney representing John Paul Mac Isaac, has told me that the video of Hunter Biden telling a prostitute he thought Russians had stolen a second laptop, leaving him susceptible to blackmail, was “definitely on the hard drive” of the Biden MacBook abandoned at Isaac’s shop and later seized by the FBI.

This new revelation establishes that, since December 2019, the FBI had knowledge that a second laptop had been stolen from Hunter Biden and that that laptop contained material making the Biden family a national security risk and subject to Russian influence.

Joe Biden surely received briefings on these risks well before his October 2020 denial of the authenticity of the laptop, so the question is: Did the FBI fail to provide Biden a truthful briefing on this intel, or did Biden fail to level with voters?

One week ago today, The Daily Mail published “unearthed footage” of a naked Hunter Biden telling a prostitute that “the Russians have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex!” According to The Daily Mail, “after filming himself having sex with the woman using his laptop in January 2019, Hunter left the camera rolling as he recounted a Vegas bender in which he spent ’18 days going round from penthouse suite to penthouse suite,’ sometimes costing $10,000 a night.”

The video continued with Hunter recounting how he had nearly overdosed during the summer of 2018 while partying in Las Vegas with his drug dealer and two other guys. According to the president’s son, after he regained consciousness, “there was this Russian 35-year-old, really nice, pure brunette,” Hunter explained. Soon after, Hunter discovered his laptop was missing.

“I think he’s the one that stole my computer,” Hunter is heard on the tape explaining. “I think the three of them, the three guys that were like a little group. The dealer and his two guys, I took them everywhere,” Hunter explained. “They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex, f-cking, you know,” Hunter added. “My computer, I had taken tons of like, just left like that cam on,” Hunter continued, “and somebody stole it during that period of time.”

The prostitute then asked Hunter if he worried the Russian thieves would try to “blackmail” him. “Yeah, in some way yeah,” Hunter replied, noting his father is “running for president,” and that “I talk about it all the time.”

In its expose from last Wednesday, The Daily Mail omitted any mention of the source of the video, but The Federalist has now confirmed that the blackmail video was contained on the hard drive of the Hunter Biden MacBook abandoned at a Delaware repair shop, The Mac Shop, Inc.

After that MacBook was abandoned, Isaac informed the FBI of its existence. FBI agents later seized the computer from Isaac in December 2019, but by then Isaac had already made a copy of the hard drive.

Isaac later provided a copy of the hard drive to Robert Costello, who at the time served as a lawyer for former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. In October 2020, Giuliani provided a copy of the drive to The New York Post, which ran multiple stories on the details revealed in emails, text messages, and videos, including evidence of a pay-to-play scandal involving Joe Biden.

When the Post broke the story the month before the 2020 presidential election, other media outlets ran cover for the Democrat candidate, with Twitter deplatforming The Post and preventing users from sharing the story.

While the corrupt media blacked out the story, at the final presidential debate before the election, then-President Trump confronted Biden with the details revealed from the MacBook, calling it “the laptop from hell”:

[Y]ou were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money, and they probably still are. But now, with what came out today, it’s even worse. All of the emails, the emails, the horrible emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice-president when some of this was happening, and it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people.

After denying any improprieties by either himself or his son, Biden responded by telling the American public:

There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant. They have said that this has all the … five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him and his good friend, Rudy Giuliani.

When Trump countered by asking Biden if he was saying the “laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?” Biden said: “That’s exactly what [I] was told.”

At the time Biden professed to voters in October 2020 that he was told the laptop was another Russian hoax, what the FBI or the intelligence community would have likely told Biden was unknown. However, the revelation that, since December 2019, the FBI had a copy of the video showing Hunter saying Russians had stolen his laptop, and the laptop contained sex videos that put him at risk for blackmail because of his father’s plans to run for president, changes the complexion of things.

This new detail means that the FBI knew, not just of the existence of the MacBook with compromising videos and damaging emails and text messages related to Joe Biden, but that there was a second missing laptop, likely with similar information on it, that had been stolen from Hunter and believed to be in the possession of Russians. The FBI also would know that Hunter had spoken on his father’s presidential ambitions “all the time” and saw himself as a potential blackmail target.

It is unfathomable that the FBI or overall U.S. intelligence agencies would not have immediately briefed then-candidate Biden on the situation. During the run-up to the 2016 election, the FBI and intelligence community provided defense briefings to both the Clinton and Trump campaigns as a matter of course. Amazingly, the FBI used one of those intelligence briefings to spy on Donald Trump based on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation launched based on unverified gossip.

Specifically, on August 17, 2016, as part of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation into the Trump campaign, FBI Agent Joe Pientka was tapped to brief Trump, Michael Flynn, and Chris Christie as part of a two-hour meeting warning the team of foreign intelligence threats.” As The Federalist’s Sean Davis previously reported, declassified information would later be established that Pientka had been “selected to attend on behalf of the FBI so he could ‘record’ or ‘overhear’ from Trump, Flynn, or Christie ‘any kind of admission’ that they were colluding with the Russian government to steal the election from Hillary Clinton.”

Even if the FBI hadn’t launched a more-justified investigation into “The Big Guy” based on the concrete evidence contained on the MacBook indicating an illegal pay-to-play agreement involving the former vice president who was then a presidential contender, a defensive briefing to Biden on the risk of Russian blackmail based on Hunter’s stolen second laptop would be indispensable to our national security interests.

In the case of Trump, the FBI would also later insist mere months after first receiving the unverified and now debunked Steele dossier that an Intelligence Community Assessment include details from a former MI6 officer’s memorandums that claimed the Russians had “kompromat” on Trump.

However, because both James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence, and John Brennan, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, objected to including reporting from the Steele dossier in the text of the Intelligence Community Assessment, it was instead included as a separate “annex,” which then-FBI Director James Comey then briefed Trump on in person.

While Comey claimed he told Trump about the salacious “intel” because the press had the information and he expected it to be made public soon, it was the leak to CNN of the briefing itself that provided a “news” hook for the dossier, resulting in it being published in full soon after.

Unlike the unverified Steele dossier, here the FBI had a MacBook laptop containing a Biden Foundation sticker and photographs, videos, emails, and text, providing for easy confirmation of the authenticity of the source information. And on that laptop was a video of Hunter stating he believed the Russians had a second laptop of his that contained similarly compromising material, which created a blackmail risk given Joe Biden’s then-upcoming presidential run.

Surely, evidence that the Russians had authentic “kompromat” on the Biden family would make both a written intelligence briefing and an in-person briefing to the elder Biden essential. In fact, shortly after the Post published its first article covering the material contained on the MacBook, an unnamed “person familiar with the matter” told USA Today that, “at least in part,” there was a federal investigation underway concerning the MacBook “aimed at determining whether Russia has set its sights on a familiar target: Biden’s father, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.”

“Federal authorities,” according to the source, were also “investigating whether the material supplied to the Post by Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is part of a smoke bomb of disinformation pushed by Russia.” There is no evidence, however, indicating the material contained on the hard drive is “disinformation,” leaving open a serious question: Did the FBI lie to Biden, or did Biden lie to Americans?

Biden’s Weakness Will Result In Aggression. Here Are 4 Likely Scenarios,"Even prior to the stunning display of American failure in Afghanistan, President Biden appeared slow-witted and spineless on crucial U.S. national security matters.

For example, Biden handed Russia’s Vladimir Putin gift after gift: extending the START Treaty, lifting Nord Stream 2 pipeline sanctions despite bipartisan legislation and essentially surrendering Ukraine to Russia. During the Biden-Putin summit in Geneva, Biden was tougher with an American journalist than with Putin. After Biden’s advisers and the first lady told the press how extensively he prepared for the meeting, he cut it short.

Biden also responded to the several major cyberattacks traced to Russia—including the meat processor JBS and the Colonial pipeline—by handing Putin a list of critical infrastructure that was “off limits.” Biden claimed Putin would change his behavior if his standing was diminished in the world, showing a fundamental lack of understanding Putin’s motivations.

Rejoining the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran has been Biden’s top priority since taking office, and he was willing to offer Tehran almost anything for it. Tehran refused to negotiate with the United States directly, and operates with impunity in the Middle East.

In July, Iranian intelligence attempted to kidnap Masih Alinejad, an Iranian journalist, from American soil. In August, an Iranian drone attacked an Israeli merchant ship, killing two crew members. Iranian proxies targeted Americas in Syria and Iraq, and Hezbollah increased rocket attacks on Israel. It also appears Tehran attempted to close the Strait of Hormuz using sea mines.

In June, Biden proclaimed “America is back” with “renewed commitment to our allies and partners.” But North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies with troops on the ground in Afghanistan disagree as they scramble to get out their people out due to America’s hasty withdrawal. British paratroopers, prepared for face-to-face combat, have descended on Kabul to rescue British citizens.

Weakness invites aggression, so we should prepare for a tumultuous fall on the world stage. Here’s what to watch for.

1. An American Hostage Situation in Afghanistan

The Biden administration is not even aware of how many Americans are left in Afghanistan. It could be as many as 15,000. The administration canceled a Trump-era bureau overseeing protection and evacuation for American citizens in Afghanistan. Now Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin says the U.S. military does not have the capability to “go in and collect large numbers of people.”

President Obama ensured the Taliban understood the value of American hostages. In 2014, Obama released five Taliban commanders—one of whom is currently among Taliban leadership in Kabul—for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who later pled guilty to desertion and was dishonorably discharged. The abandoned Americans may be used for leverage, either by the Taliban or other extremist groups. What is unfolding in Afghanistan may make the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis may look tame by comparison.

2. A Fresh Terror Attack on 9/11

Jihadists are relishing the idea that the United States weak and can be defeated. The anniversary of the 9/11 attacks has always posed heightened risk of terrorism. On September 11, 2012, jihadists attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, killing Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. On August 13, DHS warned of a heightened risk from al-Qaeda, which released a new issue of its propaganda magazine Inspire for the first time in four years. The massive intelligence failure in Afghanistan does not inspire confidence in this administration’s ability to keep tabs on foreign terrorists.

The administration also appears utterly incapable of stopping foreign threats. The U.S. southern border is wide open. The president claims climate change is the greatest national security threat. Attorney General Merrick Garland says white supremacy is the greatest domestic threat.

The Justice Department has called the Capitol riot investigation one of the largest in American history, even as a Reuters report claims the FBI does not believe the riot was a conspiracy to overthrow the government. Still, those who did not engage in violence or destruction have been held in isolation for six months.

It is clear the Biden administration is distracted and incapable, making deterrence and prevention that much less likely.

3. A Possible Russian Offensive in Ukraine

As Center Senior Analyst Andrei Illarionov wrote in April, Putin was not ready for a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in the spring, but he would be ready by September. Putin may be able to extract concessions from Ukrainian President Zelensky that would negate need for an invasion.

If Putin decides to invade, however, it will likely be after the Zapad-2021 military exercises in mid-September. Military exercises can mask offensive operations, and Putin has used the tactic before.

4. Increased Chinese Pressure on Taiwan

Chinese state media taunted Taiwan after the fall of Kabul, claiming the United States would not come to Taiwan’s aid. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen responded by saying: “Taiwan’s only option is to grow stronger and become more united, strengthening our determination to protect ourselves.” On August 17, China held live-fire air and sea exercises near Taiwan, and sent 11 war planes into Taiwanese airspace.

In March, America’s top military officer in the Indo-Pacific told Congress China could invade Taiwan in the next six years. The Washington establishment is confident the idea of an imminent risk to Taiwan is overblown, but as Center for Security Policy analyst Grant Newsham pointed out in June, the Chinese military regularly increases capabilities faster and better than western analysts assume.

In the wake of Afghanistan, Newsham wrote, Beijing is likely to challenge the United States in multiple ways. This could include confronting U.S. forces in the South China Sea, establishing bases in Africa and South America, intensify the assault on the U.S. dollar, and intensifying nuclear weapons buildup, to name a few.

In the non-Western world, might makes right. Biden’s rhetoric and proclaimed compassion is meaningless, as bad actors pay attention to action. Biden’s incompetence has made the world a more dangerous place.

The Only Way Back Is Firing Biden's Entire National Security Team,"The Taliban’s seizure of Afghanistan — emboldened by President Joe Biden’s senseless decision to rush U.S troops out of the country without a plan — blindsided the Afghan government, the Afghan military, and America’s allies. This reckless decision has led to bipartisan criticism in the United States and from our global allies, and ridicule by America’s adversaries.

Biden’s attempts to blame everyone but himself for this fiasco, his refusal to take press questions for nearly a week (except from sycophantic George Stephanopoulos), and his decision to hide at Camp David while these events unfolded have only intensified criticism.

As commander-in-chief, Biden is at fault for this disaster. But his senior national security advisers also bear responsibility for implementing his irresponsible Afghanistan policies instead of resigning and reporting them to Congress.

It’s important to stress that Biden had bad instincts on national security when he was a younger man. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wrote that Biden “has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”

Now that Biden appears to be suffering from mental decline, he is making national security decisions that are irrational and dangerous. This extends beyond Afghanistan, to nuclear talks with Iran and failing to secure our southern border.

If Biden Can’t Be Replaced Now, Replace His Yes-Men

In a perfect world, Biden would immediately resign, be impeached, or be removed from office under the 25th Amendment for this unprecedented incompetence and dereliction of duty.

To remove the president under the 25th Amendment, the vice president and the majority of the cabinet would need to determine that Biden is unfit for office. Congress would then need to approve that process by a two-thirds vote in both chambers. It is hard to see how a majority of Biden’s cabinet or two-thirds of the Democrat-controlled Congress would agree to such action.

Impeachment would require passage of articles of impeachment by a majority of the House and conviction and removal by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. Democrats will not permit this now, but it might be possible in early 2023 if Republicans take control of Congress in the 2022 midterm elections.

Since removing Biden from office is not possible right now, other action must be taken: replacing his top national security advisers with experts who have the experience, principles, and gravitas to reverse the damage Biden is doing to our national security and will stand up to future unsound and dangerous decisions by this president.

It is pointless now for National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley to claim or leak to the press that they opposed Biden’s decision to rapidly withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan. They knew this decision was wrong and dangerous. They were duty-bound to resign and report Biden’s reckless decision to Congress.

Making this worse, most of Biden’s senior national security advisers are unqualified yes-men. Putting aside buffoonish Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are third-stringers out of their league. And Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin apparently has so little influence with Biden that the president forgot his name at a press conference.

Bring In More Competent People

Blinken, Sullivan, and Austin (as well as Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas) must go and be replaced with more experienced and competent experts. Democrats Sen. Chris Coons, former Rep. Jane Harman, former Rep. Eliot Engel, former Secretary of the Navy Sen. Jim Webb, or defense expert Michèle Flournoy would do a far better job. Deputy secretaries and other lower-level national security officials also should be replaced with more competent experts.

Biden should make CIA Director William Burns – his only competent cabinet-level national security official – national security advisor or secretary of state.

Is there a chance Biden would ever make such moves? There might be, because replacing his national security team would be seen as taking bold and decisive action in response to outrage over his Afghanistan policy and questions about his leadership.

Biden and congressional Democrats also might support this course of action because it would allow Biden to shift the blame for his Afghanistan policy onto others. Although this would be highly unfair and dishonorable, it may be necessary to convince Biden to name some highly qualified and principled people as his top national security advisers.

Biden’s senseless Afghanistan policy and unmistakable signs of his mental decline strongly suggest he is not capable of serving as commander-in-chief. Democrats almost certainly will not agree to remove him, so their Republican colleagues must pressure them to pursue the next best option: surrounding Biden with highly qualified and principled national security experts who will not tolerate more irrational national security decisions.

To safeguard America’s national security and global leadership, we need bipartisan action now to compel President Biden to take this action.

Joe Biden Is Unfit To Lead. He Should Be Impeached.,"Joe Biden is not capable or competent to hold the office of the presidency. If there were any doubt on this point, his press conference Thursday evening in the wake of a pair of coordinated suicide bombings in Kabul should put the matter to rest.

The first blast Thursday killed 13 U.S. soldiers at a Kabul airport gate, along with scores of Afghans. Another bomb at a nearby hotel killed dozens more. Between the two blasts, as many as 170 people perished, not counting the U.S. service members. Hundreds more were injured, and according to U.S. officials there may be more attacks coming.

Whatever the final body count is, Thursday was the deadliest day for U.S. troops in Afghanistan since 2011, and the first time since February 2020 that any U.S. service members have been killed in action there. When the smoke finally clears, one thing is certain: Biden has been derelict in his duty, he is unfit to lead, and he should be impeached.

At his press conference Thursday evening, the president was slow and appeared at times to be confused, his answers rambling and unclear. When the time came to take questions, he said he’d been given a list, and had “been instructed” to call on certain reporters. It was a moment of quiet dread when we all saw confirmed again, before a gaping world, that although Biden is the president, he’s not actually running the country.

Joe Biden: ""They gave me a list here. The first person I was instructed to call on…” pic.twitter.com/1BHTRXyvSa — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) August 26, 2021

Of course Biden’s bizarre behavior at the press conference, although deeply disturbing, does not alone justify impeachment. Rather, it’s his fecklessness and incompetence, his failure to protect Americans in the evacuation of Afghanistan, and his inability to speak clearly and honestly about the situation, that justifies impeachment at this point.

Throughout this crisis, Biden and his White House have been evasive, defensive, and cruelly indifferent to a disaster entirely of their own making. The bare minimum for a commander in chief in this scenario is to be clear and forthright with the American people about what it will take to get Americans out safely, and what will happen if we can’t get them out by the August 31 deadline. Instead, the Biden administration has blamed Donald Trump, ducked questions, stonewalled, and generally contributed to the deadly chaos still unfolding in Afghanistan.

Indeed, what this means for the ongoing evacuation is unclear. It might well be over, at this point. News reports out of Kabul indicate the U.S. military is welding shut the gates of the airport complex, which could mean an abrupt end to evacuation efforts for an estimated 1,500 American citizens, at least, still trapped in Afghanistan.

If that is the case, we are now facing the worst hostage crisis in American history.

Our sources on the ground tell us gates are being welded shut. https://t.co/Fj9u5Up9b4 — Howard Altman (@haltman) August 26, 2021

Some of our allies have already acknowledged as much. On Thursday, many of our North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies announced they were ending evacuation efforts, frankly conceding they are leaving behind citizens still stranded in and around Kabul.

In a press briefing Thursday, Gen. Kenneth Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said he expects these attacks to continue but that the U.S. military will press on with its evacuation mission. It’s unclear, though, what that will look like, given what’s happened and the likelihood it will happen again before the military can get American citizens, to say nothing of U.S. soldiers and equipment, out of Kabul.

For much of the day on Thursday, Biden was again absent and the White House silent. Hours before the president addressed the nation, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke about the attack in Kabul. David Marcus rightly noted how disturbing it was that the British prime minister would speak publicly about the attack before the U.S. president did.

Why am I hearing about the loss of American military lives from the Prime Minister of the UK but not the American president? What the hell is going on? https://t.co/hCUhnAG08W — David Marcus (@BlueBoxDave) August 26, 2021

Indeed, five hours after the attacks on Thursday, the only public communication from the White House was a statement about the celebration of “Women’s Equality Day.”

The administration’s silence continues to be matched by its incompetence. Later on Thursday, Politico reported that U.S. officials in Kabul gave the Taliban a list of names of American citizens, green card holders, and Afghan allies to grant entry into the airport complex, a move that sparked outrage among lawmakers and military officials. “Basically, they just put all those Afghans on a kill list,” one defense official told Politico. “It’s just appalling and shocking and makes you feel unclean.”

Even before the deadly attacks on Thursday, Sen. Lindsay Graham this week called for Biden’s impeachment, citing “dereliction of duty by the commander-in-chief.” Graham is of course a foreign policy neocon who, if he had his way, would continue the war in Afghanistan in perpetuity. But Republican calls for Biden’s impeachment or resignation swelled to a chorus after the Thursday attacks, and rightly so.

Some on the right will protest that impeaching Biden will only give us President Kamala Harris, thrusting from the frying pan into the fire. Maybe so. But at least a President Harris would know what was going on and could be held answerable for it. At least we would know who’s running the country.

Some will also object that any impeachment, given the state of American politics, will perforce be merely political, or be seen as such by half the country. Maybe so. But unlike Democrats’ two impeachments of former President Donald Trump, impeaching Biden over his Afghanistan disaster isn’t about political theater. Recall that Trump was impeached the first time for a perfectly legitimate phone call, and the second time for giving an innocuous speech to his supporters.

The impeachment of Biden, by contrast, would be about basic competence and confidence and Biden’s ability to execute his sworn duties as president. He has shown that he is unfit and incompetent. Now Congress should do its duty, and impeach him.

‘Resign Or Face Impeachment’: Lawmakers Demand Biden’s Ouster,"Thirteen U.S. service members and at least 90 Afghans are dead after suicide bombers attacked the Kabul airport and an adjacent hotel not two weeks after President Joe Biden’s thoughtless and failed attempt to pack up and leave Afghanistan — and many Republican leaders aren’t having it.

Instead of taking responsibility and prioritizing bringing Americans home, the Biden administration has shifted blame onto the preceding administration and evacuated mostly poorly vetted Afghans. According to Politico, U.S. officials have even shared intelligence with the Taliban, with one defense official saying, “Basically, they just put all those Afghans on a kill list.”

Democrats and their Republican friends Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois — neither of whom returned The Federalist’s request for comment about whether they would also call for Biden’s resignation or impeachment — jumped at the chance to impeach former President Donald Trump after he called on supporters to be peaceful. Now the following GOP lawmakers are calling on Biden to resign for his dereliction of duty that has left Americans dead at the hands of terrorists.

Rep. Jackie Walorski

“As the president has said repeatedly, the buck stops with him — and I agree. The buck must stop here,” Rep. Jackie Walorski of Indiana wrote in a statement. “President Biden has demonstrated that he is unfit to serve as commander-in-chief, and, therefore, must resign.”

Rep. Chip Roy

Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, said Congress must take action against the president and secretary of state for their incompetence.

“When he abandoned our men and women in uniform, vacated Bagram (Air Base) and left that base wide open, you damn well believe that Congress needs to take action against him and against Secretary Blinken,” Roy said on Newsmax’s “Wake Up America” on Friday morning. “We need the brass at the Pentagon to be talking about what their hands in all of this are as well.”

Rep. Kat Cammack

Florida Republican Rep. Kat Cammack said that since Joe Biden is a fan of political deadlines, he should have until his Aug. 31 deadline to submit his resignation.

“There needs to be resignations across the board, starting with Secretary Blinken,” Cammack added.

Rep. Jody Hice

The Georgia Republican took to Twitter on Friday morning to offer a list of Biden’s “disasters” in addition to the one in Afghanistan, such as the “southern border disaster,” the “radical woke agenda disaster,” and the “reckless spending disaster.”

“Only 7 months into this… It’s time for the Biden disaster to RESIGN!” Hice wrote.

Rep. Jeff Duncan

Rep. Jeff Duncan, a South Carolina Republican, co-sponsored an article of impeachment with his Georgia colleague Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene again Biden on Thursday for dereliction of duty.

“Impeachment is a very serious matter, and one I do not take lightly. It saddens me that it has come to this, but the President’s actions have proved he is a threat to our national security and the Constitution,” Duncan said in a statement. “It is time to take action and remove the sitting President from office due to his gross negligence that undermined our national security, led to the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, and resulted in a grave humanitarian crisis.”

Sen. Josh Hawley

And Joe Biden is responsible,” the Missouri senator wrote on Thursday on Twitter. “It is now clear beyond all doubt that he has neither the capacity nor the will to lead. He must resign.”

“We must reject the falsehood peddled by a feckless president that this was the only option for withdrawal,” Hawley continued in a statement. “This is the product of Joe Biden’s catastrophic failure of leadership. It is now painfully clear he has neither the will nor the capacity to lead. He must resign.”

Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, a Pennsylvania Republican, took to Twitter last week to document American losses in Afghanistan over the past two decades.

“[T]he U.S. suffered 20,000 casualties, lost over 2,300 soldiers, spent over $2.2 trillion,” Reschenthaler tweeted. “And we have nothing to show for it because Biden just handed the country over to terrorists. RT if you think Biden should resign.”

“There’s nothing Biden, Blinken, Milley, and the rest of the capitulators can say to undue selling out our allies, diminishing our standing in the world, and handing Afghanistan back to the Taliban. Truly unforgivable,” the congressman also told Newsmax’s Logan Ratick, calling for their resignations.

Rep. Elise Stefanik

Rep. Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican who replaced Cheney as GOP conference chair, said on Aug. 26 that Biden is “unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.”

“Our hearts break across the country for the brave service members who made the ultimate sacrifice. Their families are facing unimaginable news today. Please pray for them,” she said in a press release.

“The buck stops with the President of the United States,” she continued. “Joe Biden has blood on his hands. This horrific national security and humanitarian disaster is solely the result of Joe Biden’s weak and incompetent leadership. He is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham

“I think he should be impeached,” the South Carolina Republican said during a Newsmax segment on Aug. 24. “I think Joe Biden deserves to be impeached because he’s abandoned thousands of Afghans who fought with us, and he’s going to abandon some American citizens because he capitulated to the Taliban to a Aug. 31 deadline.”

Rep. Mike Waltz

“Every single person who is responsible for Americans and our allies should resign for their heartlessness and incompetence,” said Florida GOP Rep. Mike Waltz, saying he was “furious” at the actions of Biden, the National Security Council, and the Department of State.

I am furious over President Biden, the State Department, and the NSC’s actions. Every single person who is responsible for Americans and our allies should resign for their heartlessness and incompetence. — Rep. Mike Waltz (@michaelgwaltz) August 20, 2021

Rep. Lauren Boebert

Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert also says, “It’s time for Joe Biden to resign.”

“Resign,” said Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who is known for getting his point across in few words.

Biden Made The Right Decision In A Disastrously Wrong Way,"As the last of our troops leave Afghanistan despite U.S. citizens behind on the ground, bluecheck Twitter is feverishly disseminating an Atlantic essay explaining, per its headline, why “Biden Deserves Credit, Not Blame, for Afghanistan.” Foreign policy tests establishment loyalties these days, as the chattering class supports both President Biden and endless conflict. David Rothkopf’s argument in The Atlantic mercifully gives the Jen Rubins among us cause to celebrate President Biden amid this disaster.

The argument, however, is predicated on a false dichotomy, one that is consuming debate over our departure from Afghanistan and needlessly undercutting the movement against nation-building.

Consider these two back-to-back sentences from Rothkopf’s article: “The White House was indeed surprised by how quickly the Taliban took control, and those early days could have been handled better. But the critics argued that more planning both would have been able to stop the Taliban victory and might have made America’s departure somehow tidier, more like a win or perhaps even a draw.”

In the first sentence is a concession that “those early days could have been handled better.” But the second sentence chastises critics who argued the departure could have been “somehow tidier.” These two points amount to a fatal contradiction in the broader argument of the anti-war left (which, to be fair, has been vindicated on this issue) and the Biden administration.

Even Rothkopf concedes the administration could have handled the departure “better.” The debate, then, is a matter of scale. It’s true our departure was doomed to tragedy. It’s also true the Biden administration made that worse. Rothkopf and Rubin want to argue Biden made it better while simultaneously conceding the administration made mistakes that worsened the situation.

Biden’s defenders’ strongest argument is probably that he either made the inevitable tragedy no worse or even better than it would have been. That’s, of course, different than the argument in Rothkopf’s headline, but even so, it’s a very difficult argument to make given Biden’s botched and harmful predictions, his initial absence from the public and its effect on our response, the high number of stranded civilians, the admittedly unanticipated rate of collapse, and more.

You don’t have to choose Team Biden or Team War. Rothkopf is correct that it’s laughable to watch the foreign policy establishment try to backseat drive through a crisis of their own making, steering down the same roads that got us to this point.

It’s also true that Biden was in a deeply unenviable position, especially with the foreign policy establishment prepared to exploit the tragedy to argue for more interventionism. The visa bureaucracy is not only his fault. Also, all things considered, Rothkopf is right that our troops have accomplished remarkable evacuations and feats of heroism under enormously difficult conditions.

None of this exonerates Biden. None of it means he deserves more “credit” than “blame.” The foreign policy establishment largely values endless war more than partisan loyalties, and is absolutely exploiting and overstating some of Biden’s errors. But Biden’s errors have been costly, and downplaying them to undercut the establishment only helps the blob create isolationist straw men to attack in feverish MSNBC segments and on fancy op-ed pages.

"Biden’s Presidency Is Already A Total Disaster, And It’s All His Own Fault","The first seven months of Joe Biden’s presidency have been fraught with crises. First it was the coronavirus pandemic and the vaccine rollout. Then it was the border crisis. Then it was the economy.

And now Afghanistan, where the Taliban are now reportedly hanging people by the neck from U.S.-supplied Blackhawk helicopters, and the U.S. withdrawal has left behind hundreds of Americans and perhaps thousands of Green Card holders in what now amounts to the largest hostage crisis in American history.

The administration is stumbling from one disaster to the next, with no end in sight and public opinion plummeting on nearly every major issue. In each case, the disaster has been entirely of the Biden administration’s own making. Events are not overtaking Biden, his own rank incompetence is.

(Just about the only disaster facing Biden right now that’s not a result of his administration’s policies is the hurricane slamming into the Gulf Coast. But there’s a decent chance he might well botch that, too.)

The events now unfolding in Afghanistan, where the Taliban control about $83 billion worth of U.S. military equipment, are by far the most dramatic and disturbing display of incompetency and horrible policy from the Biden administration, which recent polling reflects. But the Afghanistan disaster follows a train of incompetence that left the station on day one of this presidency.

As soon as Biden came into office, he signed executive orders that guaranteed we would have a migrant crisis on our southwest border. By reversing a raft of Trump-era policies that had managed to control illegal immigration amid a worsening pandemic, Biden effectively opened the borders, sending the message to would-be asylum seekers that if they could manage to get across the Rio Grande with at least one child in tow, they could stay — and if they sent their child alone, he or she would definitely stay.

The results were predictable: a 20-year record surge in illegal border crossings that continues to worsen by the month. Corporate media has largely stopped covering the border crisis, but July was the worst month for illegal immigration since March of 2000. We’re on track to arrest more than 1.6 million people at the southwest border this year, more than we ever have before.

This historic migrant surge wasn’t inevitable. It was a direct result of Biden’s policies, which played out in an entirely predictable manner.

The same goes for the administration’s COVID-19 response. Biden campaigned on having a plan to “shut down” the virus and end the pandemic, but so far there seems to be no plan at all — or even a coordinated and consistent message from the White House. Contradictory and ever-shifting policies and recommendations on everything from school closures to mask and vaccine mandates have sown confusion and mistrust among Americans desperate to get back to work and their children to school.

Meanwhile, the pandemic itself seems to be getting worse, not better. Monday marked five consecutive days in which COVID-19 deaths exceeded the number of deaths on those dates a year ago, under President Trump.

Biden’s Centers for Disease Control has become lawless, attempting to impose an unconstitutional eviction moratorium on landlords, which the Supreme Court struck down last week, and announcing that it will be pushing for gun control in the name of public health, because that’s really what we need the CDC to focus on right now.

Other pandemic policies from Biden’s team have made economic recovery from last year’s lockdowns well-nigh impossible. Federal unemployment benefits, which the Biden administration has extended to millions of Americans for months now, have exacerbated a worker shortage that’s hobbling the recovery.

And then of course there’s Afghanistan. The Biden administration’s disastrous withdrawal will be the subject of many op-eds and think pieces and, eventually, history books. For now, it suffices to say that each passing day we learn something new about how Biden and the Pentagon botched the job.

Over the weekend, for example, we learned from a report in the Washington Post that on the day Kabul fell to the Taliban, Abdul Ghani Baradar, the head of the Taliban’s political wing, gave U.S. Gen. Kenneth Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, a choice: either American troops secure Kabul, or the Taliban would. McKenzie told Baradar that he only needed the airport. “On the spot, an understanding was reached, according to two other U.S. officials: The United States could have the airport until Aug. 31. But the Taliban would control the city.”

Of course, as we now know, the Taliban couldn’t control the city, and last week 13 U.S. soldiers, along with hundreds of Afghans, were killed by a suicide bomber in a pair of coordinated attacks near the airport.

The corporate press, keenly aware that things are not going well for this White House, will soon back away from their critical tone on Afghanistan and resume their usual routine of running cover for Biden. In the coming days we’ll almost certainly see outlandish and highly suspect polls showing that, aside from Afghanistan, Biden is doing pretty well, actually, considering all the crises his young administration has had to face.

Don’t buy this line. Biden has not been overtaken by events, he is not a hapless victim of history or coincidence. Every problem his White House has encountered, it has made worse. Every crisis his administration has faced has been of its own making. And as bad as things have been thus far, they are going to get worse.

Joe Biden Can't Use Beau To Avoid Answering For Marines' Deaths,"The families of 13 brave young men and women are just a few moments into a grieving process that will last the rest of their days, after an ISIS-K suicide bomber stole the lives of these American service members and 170 civilians in Afghanistan last week. On Sunday, President Joe Biden met with the families of these fallen heroes at Dover Air Force Base as flag-draped caskets descended from the plane where their beaming children in uniform should have been.

Those meetings reportedly didn’t go very well. Although the family of Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum — a young man just 20 years old who died in Kabul last week — went to Delaware, his two sisters and father left the room before the president came in. They didn’t want to talk to the man they blamed for their brother and son’s death.

“You can’t f-ck up as bad as he did and say you’re sorry,” one sister said of Biden, adding that his empty condolences represented a “total disregard to the loss of our Marine.” “This did not need to happen, and every life is on his hands.” McCollum’s grieving mother also blamed “feckless, dementia-ridden piece of crap” Biden for her son’s death.

Only McCollum’s wife stayed, along with the life inside her: the couple’s unborn child who is due at the end of September and who will never know his or her brave daddy. The meeting was “scripted and shallow, a conversation that lasted only a couple of minutes,” the Washington Post reported.

For the widow, the disappointing meeting with Biden was salt in the wound. She said he talked about Beau, recounting his son’s military tenure and later death from cancer.

This isn’t the first time we’ve heard the president reference Beau Biden in the context of the deadly Afghanistan disaster, so it’s unsurprising that the McCollum family would describe the Delaware meeting as “scripted.” In the president’s much-anticipated speech last Thursday, hours after the infamous blast, he compared the loss of his son to brain cancer with the loss of more than a dozen U.S. service members under his leadership.

“We have some sense,” Biden said, “of what the families of these brave heroes are feeling today.”

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki repeated the line during Monday’s press briefing when discussing Biden’s visit to Delaware. “He of course was deeply impacted. He knows firsthand that there is nothing you can say to a family member. There is nothing you can say to someone who loses a child that is going to fill the black hole,” she said, referring to Beau.

Death is sad and scary, and the death of a loved one is a heartwrenching pain. Even more, the death of a child is an acute tragedy only those who have experienced its throes can know.

This is a pain Joe Biden knows well, having lost his first wife and baby daughter in a car accident almost 50 years ago and more recently his son to brain cancer when Beau was just 46 years old. That’s a pain many can’t understand, and it’s a loss that enabled Biden to empathize with others in their grief. Cancer regrettably snuffs out the lives of those we love far too soon and far too often. Biden could relate to that.

But the soldiers who died in Afghanistan aren’t like Beau Biden. The violent death of one’s child overseas at the hands of terrorists is a league of grief all its own. To make matters worse, the families of these slain heroes are left with the sinking reality that these deaths — of their children, brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, and grandchildren — could have been avoided.

The fact is that while the War in Afghanistan was a two-decade-long and bipartisan disaster, it was the failures of the current administration — the lack of planning, the misplaced priorities, the arbitrary attempt to accomplish a symbolic withdrawal by Sept. 11 so Biden could take a victory lap, the failure to protect American lives in the evacuation, and the cruel indifference and inability to be honest about the situation — that led to the sudden loss of so many innocent lives and the subsequent grief and turmoil.

Although the body count might not yet be complete, Thursday was still the deadliest day for American troops in Afghanistan in a decade, and it was the first time since February 2020 that any U.S. service members have died in action there. That’s on Biden, who, as The Federalist’s John Daniel Davidson wrote, “has been derelict in his duty, he is unfit to lead, and he should be impeached.”

“Twenty years and six months old, getting ready to come home from frickin’ Jordan to be with his wife to watch the birth of his son, and that feckless, dementia-ridden piece of crap just sent my son to die,” an indignant McCollum told a radio show over the weekend. “I wanted my son to represent our country, to fight for my country, but I never thought that a feckless piece of crap would send him to his death and smirk on television while he’s talking about people dying with his nasty smirk.”

“This was an unnecessary debacle that could have been handled properly,” she added.

Beneath all McCallum’s raw emotion, that mother is right. She’s justified in blaming the current administration for her loss, for the empty chair at her holiday table this year, for the upcoming sleepless nights, and for her fatherless grandbaby.

That’s why, when Joe Biden redirects the conversation to Beau, he isn’t trying to produce empathy for the grieving families of Afghanistan’s fallen. He’s talking about Beau to conjure up sympathy for himself. It’s easier to manufacture relatability than it is to take responsibility.

But cancer isn’t a suicide bomber whose opportunity was made possible by failed leadership, and Joe Biden’s personal and irrelevant anecdotes aren’t going to bring these young heroes home.

Joe Biden Has Always Thought He Was The Smartest Man In The Room,"President Joe Biden has always thought he was the smartest man in the room, even when it’s clear that he’s not.

Take his response to the Afghanistan crisis, for example. Not only did he delay addressing the nation about the Taliban takeover and subsequent American evacuation problems in Kabul, but he has also refused to take responsibility for the lack of planning associated with the botched withdrawal, and offered flippant looks at his watch and anecdotes about his own son’s death to cancer as a response to the grieving families who lost their loved ones in the Kabul explosion last week.

Any speech that he gives is plagued with nonsensical verbiage, uncomfortable pauses, and weird comments about how he is or isn’t allowed to answer questions from specific people about specific topics.

But Biden’s deluded sense of self-expertise has been fed by corporate media and “foreign policy officials” who defended Biden as a foreign policy expert on the campaign trail and well into his administration.

“Why Joe Biden’s foreign policy experience is both a weakness and a strength in 2020,” Vox wrote in 2019.

Biden even wrote a column in early 2020 titled “Why America Must Lead Again: Rescuing U.S. Foreign Policy After Trump.”

Just a few months before Biden’s approval rating plummeted due to his poor handling of Afghanistan, polling reports suggested the president “Gets High Marks for Foreign Policy.”

Even Biden hinted as early as 1988 that he might “know more about foreign policy” than Gary Hart, his then-rival for the Democratic nomination for president. In that same now-infamous interview, Biden, who was a senator at the time, proudly boasted about his accomplishments to people at a campaign event in New Hampshire.

“I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect,” Biden told one voter who asked him about his educational background.

In addition to claiming that he attended law school “on a full academic scholarship” and was “the only one in my class” to do so, Biden falsely claimed that he completed school in the top half of his graduating class, was rewarded for being an outstanding student of political science, and earned three undergraduate degrees.

These claims are all verifiably false, the Washington Post notes. Biden’s full academic scholarship “was a half scholarship based on financial need,” he finished 76th out of 85 in his class, he was not rewarded for being an outstanding political science student, and his only degree from the University of Delaware was “a single B.A. in political science and history.”

It wasn’t until he was peppered with allegations of plagiarism that the high-achieving student Biden painted himself as was reduced to a guy who flunked a law school class after using pieces of a law review article in one of his papers without citation.

Somehow, Biden’s political career has stayed alive this long, but his egotistical, rash, angry approach to the presidency isn’t going to last forever. Afghanistan exposed Biden’s incompetence even more than his tendency to call a lid on the campaign trail, his speeches fraught with gibberish, or any of his other political blunders did. Biden’s inability to prioritize Americans and keep them alive during a mission designated to bring U.S. citizens home will continue to prove that, despite his insistence, he is not the smartest person in the room and he never will be.

Time To Demand Accountability After Biden’s Failed Victory Lap,"The first third of Joe Biden’s speech defending the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal was full of lies, blaming everyone but himself while also claiming it was a big beautiful evacuation, and done in completely bad faith.

“Mr. Biden described the evacuation as if it were a triumph, and that his Administration had planned for such a contingency in case the Afghan military collapsed. This is, literally, unbelievable. Multiple media reports have revealed that the White House was caught by surprise and preparing for vacation en masse when Kabul fell,” concluded the Wall Street Journal editorial board. “The President even had the ill grace to blame Americans for not leaving Afghanistan sooner, and Afghans for not fighting. But his own government clearly felt no urgency, as the U.S. Embassy had to frantically destroy documents in the final hours.”

The rest of the speech was not as bad — it seemed the writers were very eager to pivot to the popularity of the decision to leave itself, if not among the press or the leadership class, among the voters — which is not an unwise approach. Biden’s Republican critics would therefore be wise to focus on the former portion, not the latter. If a year from now most Americans are saying “hey, it was a mess, horrible, but he made the hard call and at least we got out”, then Biden’s spinners will have succeeded.

The way to prevent that is to sound a note that focuses dead-on on the thing that everyone is actually pissed off about: the disastrous cluster of a withdrawal that looks very much like Biden’s Katrina moment — a catastrophic failure that shakes American faith in the military authority and the capacity of our government to do their jobs. Biden’s declaration of an exceptional performance is the target, and ought to be. That’s what the families of the dead American soldiers care about — they’re not mad about leaving, they’re mad the leaving was so botched that their sons and daughters died. Their priorities should inform Republican critics.

In any Republican administration, Gen. Milley and SecState Blinken would be headed for the exits — instead, Biden maintains that they and their underlings did nothing wrong. He even has the gall to blame desperate people who foolishly believed his words about Afghan stability for not getting out sooner — maybe the most audacious deployment of a “well, but you were out late in that skirt” commentary I’ve ever heard. It was his own falsehoods and those who parroted them that kept people there, and he’s pretending like it never happened.

A more troubling consideration than yelled-out lies would be: is Biden so delusional that he actually believes the spin he’s being given? As we see in this Reuters call, handily leaked by the Deep State, Biden’s concerns the last time he spoke to then-Afghan President Ghani was not the risk for his military, but the need to ‘change perception’.

In the call, Biden offered aid if Ghani could publicly project he had a plan to control the spiraling situation in Afghanistan … Biden lauded the Afghan armed forces, which were trained and funded by the U.S. government. “You clearly have the best military,” he told Ghani. “You have 300,000 well-armed forces versus 70-80,000 and they’re clearly capable of fighting well.” Days later, the Afghan military started folding across provincial capitals in the country with little fight against the Taliban. In much of the call, Biden focused on what he called the Afghan government’s “perception” problem. “I need not tell you the perception around the world and in parts of Afghanistan, I believe, is that things are not going well in terms of the fight against the Taliban,” Biden said. “And there is a need, whether it is true or not, there is a need to project a different picture.” Biden told Ghani that if Afghanistan’s prominent political figures were to give a press conference together, backing a new military strategy, “that will change perception, and that will change an awful lot I think.” The American leader’s words indicated he didn’t anticipate the massive insurrection and collapse to come 23 days later. “We are going to continue to fight hard, diplomatically, politically, economically, to make sure your government not only survives, but is sustained and grows,” said Biden.

So was Biden’s position that he was lying then, that he was misinformed, or that the people underneath him weren’t telling the truth? It would be good to know, considering that the actions that followed led directly to the deaths of hundreds of Afghans and 13 Americans. It would be good to know who made what decision at DOD about leaving behind equipment, at State about processing Afghan interpreters, at the CIA about what we knew on the ground — and if these decisionmakers have any justification for keeping their jobs.

There is one more important aspect that should be appreciated about this moment, and that is the damage it has done to Biden’s brand as an empathetic comforter. The media played this up to an insane degree during 2020, and this colossal blunder and encounters with a host of Gold Star families has done much to eliminate it. The speech didn’t help this any, in word or tone.

Nor will what comes next — images and stories from Afghanistan that would make anyone with a pro-refugee sign in front of their house hang their heads in shame. Those happen to be a lot of the same white suburban voters the Democratic Party needs to succeed, and who made a difference in 2020. Their buyer’s remorse for Biden had already been growing before this moment. Turning it around seems like an endeavor far too great for a president who seems so very small.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/09/01/time-to-demand-accountability-after-bidens-failed-victory-lap/,2021-09-01
Joe Biden Is Lying To Americans About Afghanistan,"Earlier this week, this writer addressed the Biden administration’s instinctive lying on matters big and small, concluding: “When the president allows his key advisors lie to us about a dog bite, the only confidence the American people can have is that he will not be honest with us about these and other life-and-death matters if the truth would hurt his poll numbers or endanger Democrats’ reelection chances.”

Regrettably, recent events confirm that the president’s deceptions and misstatements are intentional and driven by political motives. This was confirmed by multiple events, some the very next day after the previous article published.

The first confirming event was in President Biden’s own words. Biden verified that lying about success in Afghanistan is part of his political strategy.

A Foreign Quid Pro Quo Based on Lies

In a bombshell report on Aug. 31, Reuters reported on an audio recording of a July 23 call between Biden and then-Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. It released a transcript. In the call, Biden stated, “I need not tell you the perception around the world and in parts of Afghanistan, I believe, is that things aren’t going well in terms of the fight against the Taliban.”

Biden then gave Ghani his marching orders: “And there is a need, whether it is true or not, there is a need to project a different picture.” His own words condemn the president: “Whether it is true or not…” As the indispensable Mollie Hemingway noted on Fox News on Sept. 2, “What this phone call shows is that the withdrawal was, like so many other parts of the war, communicated to the American public with lies.” Indeed it was.

But this was even worse. Again, Hemingway: “While the previous president was impeached over a phone call and accused of a quid pro quo, here you actually have a president asking someone to lie on his behalf and conditioning military aid on part of those lies.”

Biden knew Afghanistan was facing an existential crisis: Ghani confirmed disaster was looming if he did not receive stepped-up American aid: “We are facing a full-scale invasion, composed of Taliban, full Pakistani planning and logistical support, and at least 10-15,000 international terrorists, predominantly Pakistanis thrown into this, so that dimension needs to be taken account of.” Ghani also emphasized that continued air support was essential.

Knowing he had the leverage, Biden made clear that continued U.S. military support would be forthcoming only if he was given a plan to project that “different picture.” He said, “You clearly have the best military, you have 300,000 well-armed forces versus 70-80,000 and they’re clearly capable of fighting well, we will continue to provide close air support, if we know what the plan is and what we are doing.”

This shows that in the words of the 2019 Articles of Impeachment against President Trump, President Biden “sought to pressure the Government of [Afghanistan] to take these steps by conditioning official United States Government acts of significant value to [Afghanistan] on its public announcement of the [plan]. President [Biden] engaged in this scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit. In so doing, President [Biden] used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that compromised the national security of the United States and undermined the integrity of the United States democratic process.”

Lying About Abandoning Americans in Afghanistan

Another recent confirmation of the administration’s perfidy (and of this author’s pessimistic prediction) came from the Democrat Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Adam Smith. Smith confirmed that not only were Americans and allies being abandoned to the mercies of the Taliban, but that the president intentionally lied to the American public about it.

In an interview with Brett Baier on Fox News, Smith made clear that what Biden told us about his plans and intention to get all Americans out of Afghanistan before his arbitrary, self-imposed Aug. 31 deadline was completely at odds with what his administration was telling Congress.

Baier first questioned Smith about the president’s prior statements. He played Biden’s now infamous statement in his Aug. 18 interview with George Stephanopoulos when the president promised, “If there’s American citizens left, we are going to stay until we get them all out” (beginning at 1:03).

Baier then contrasted Biden’s promise with the facts on the ground. He played an excerpt from Gen. Kenneth McKenzie’s press conference in which the CENTCOM commander acknowledged there were Americans left behind.

He stated, “None of them made it to the airport and were able to be accommodated.” Subsequent reporting, of course, has amplified that concern, with stories of stranded and missing American citizens, school children, and even an Afghan soldier who had helped rescue then-senators Biden, Kerry and Hagel.

Baier also asked a question that remains on many Americans’ minds: “The president said we were going to stay until all Americans were out… How can we as a country have left Americans on the ground?”

Smith then revealed that the “public message,” including President Biden’s statements to the American people, were not true; they were not what was being briefed to Congress. He first confessed the administration’s incompetence: “The public messaging was all over the map on this.” He then contrasted that “public messaging” with what the administration was saying secretly, behind closed doors: “I had many private conversations, and we got a classified brief last week for the Armed Services Committee. The mission was clear in that context” (emphasis added).

Stop and think about that. What the president, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and others were publicly representing to Americans and the rest of the world was inconsistent—“all over the map”—but the “real mission” as briefed to the Armed Services Committee in a classified setting “was clear.”

Doing One Thing, Telling Americans the Opposite

This secret “real mission” also was decidedly different than the reassurances being served up for consumption by a gullible public, many of whom would not think that the president would misrepresent something this consequential. Smith says the administration told Smith and the Armed Services Committee that they “will have the mission complete by August 31st.”

And what was that “real mission,” Smith asked? He made clear that it was not what the public was being told by the president and his senior advisors: “Publicly the mission was get everybody out, but that really wasn’t the mission… What the mission really was get as many people out as we possibly can by August 31st when our troops come out and try to make sure we maintain the conditions with the Taliban to continue to get people out after that, even after our troops have left. And, no, I don’t think that they made that clear as publicly as they should have. They kept saying things like what the president said when that was not really what they were trying to do.”

Regrettably, Smith’s interview reveals that the president’s representations to the American people that “we are going to stay until we get them all out” was not just an innocent mistake, not just a wishful but unfulfilled prediction. It was a premeditated, calculated lie.

A Deliberate Scheme of Lying to Americans

Biden’s self-congratulatory speech on Aug. 31 also reinforced his fraudulent approach. In his Aug. 18 promise to the nation, the president did not say that we would leave hundreds of Americans behind and protect them with diplomatic efforts from 1,200 miles away in Doha and threats of strikes from “over the horizon,” as he offered on Aug. 31. To the contrary, his Aug. 18 promise was unambiguous: “We are going to stay until we get them all out.”

That promise, like so many others, was not just mistaken. It was part of a deliberate plan and pattern of misleading the American people.

The abandonment of Americans and allies who fought with us, coupled with the lies about the strategy, is a disaster. It is contrary to the military’s fundamental ethos and everything that this country stands for. It compromises both our national honor and security.

But, “whether it is true or not,” this president and his enablers “need to project a different picture”: that the evacuation and retreat was a great success, that it all went according to plan, and that this administration will continue protect our fellow citizens both in Afghanistan and at home. For shame, Mr. President, for shame.

Joe Biden’s Senate Friends Are Not Impressed With His Afghanistan Spin,"President Joe Biden’s friends in the U.S. Senate are more than unimpressed with his administration’s spin on the disaster in Afghanistan.

For weeks, Biden, White House press secretary Jen Psaki, and others in the Biden administration have tried to shift the corporate media’s attention away from their failures with the Afghanistan withdrawal to blame former President Donald Trump and refuse to take responsibility for their actions.

It took days for the president to give a public onscreen address, and when he finally left Camp David to deliver a couple of short speeches about the Taliban’s takeover, he refused to take questions from frustrated reporters in the White House press corps and only repeated rhetoric about why he chose to pull out troops.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of Biden’s old Senate buddies and “personal friend,” is just one of Biden’s former allies who did not hold back from condemning the administration’s botched Afghanistan withdrawal. In 2015, Graham told the Huffington Post, “If you can’t admire Joe Biden as a person, then you got a problem,” but when it came to holding Biden accountable, it did not take long for Graham to call for the president’s impeachment.

“I think he should be impeached,” the South Carolina Republican said during a Newsmax segment on Aug. 24. “I think Joe Biden deserves to be impeached because he’s abandoned thousands of Afghans who fought with us, and he’s going to abandon some American citizens because he capitulated to the Taliban to an Aug. 31 deadline.”

Not only did Graham say Biden “ignored sound advice,” but he also said the president has “been derelict in his duties as commander-in-chief.”

“I think it’s dereliction of duty to leave hundreds of Americans behind enemy lines, turn them into hostages, to abandon thousands of Afghans who fought honorably along our side, to create conditions for another 9/11 that are now through the roof,” Graham told CBS. “And this is Joe Biden being Joe Biden. He’s been this way for 40 years, but now he’s the commander-in-chief. He’s not a senator. He’s not the vice president. These are commander-in-chief decisions. I think the best you could describe is dereliction of duty at the highest level.”

Joe Lieberman, a former senator and the 2000 Democrat vice presidential candidate, slammed Biden despite their time together in the upper chamber.

“Oh, I’m very disappointed. First off, though, we know each other and served together for 24 years. I think the president has been wrong about Afghanistan for quite a long time because he’s been wanting to withdraw our troops and he keeps repeating — and others do, including some in the media — that we just ended America’s longest war in Afghanistan,” Lieberman said on Fox News.

Lieberman said Biden made some decisions that were “tragic and totally unnecessary.”

“Truth is, we had not lost an American soldier since February of 2020 until the 13 were tragically killed by the terrorists as part of the — as a consequence of the decision to withdraw and the botched evacuation plan. So, yeah, I’m disappointed and I think we’re all going to pay for it — first of all, the people of Afghanistan,” he concluded.

Jim Webb, another former senator who spent his time in Congress with Biden, penned an opinion editorial for The National Interest calling out the president for his administration’s callous response to a deadly crisis.

In the article titled “Afghanistan: A Requiem for an Avoidable Disaster,” Webb argued that Biden’s scripted addresses and historical hiding to avoid “his tendency to make public gaffes” came off as careless.

“After the American military was ordered to occupy the Kabul airport following a blitzkrieg of sorts by the Taliban that toppled the Afghan government, he disappeared for days inside the protected isolation of Camp David or at his home in Delaware, from whence he would appear from time to time to read a set of carefully prepared remarks and then again disappear without taking questions,” Webb noted.

Webb also scolded Vice President Kamala Harris’s “tone-deaf diplomatic naiveté” at her meeting with Vietnam’s President Nguyen Xuan Phuc and “the usual ‘not me’ rhetoric that has sidestepped accountability and enabled promotions, advances, and post-career financial rewards for the past twenty years.”

Biden's Approval Tanks After Mishandling Of Afghanistan Crisis He Created,"President Joe Biden’s approval rating following his handling of the Afghanistan disaster is tanking, a new poll from ABC News and the Washington Post indicates.

Pollsters found that only 44 percent of the more than 1,000 adults surveyed approve of Biden’s track record as president while 51 percent disapprove. While Democrats still show overwhelming support for the leftist and his administration, their approval for the president fell from 94 percent to 86 percent over the last three months.

The poll also signals that 57 percent of independents are increasingly frustrated with Biden’s tenure in the White House, a 14-point increase since the 43 percent disapproval rate measured in June. Among Republicans, Biden’s disapproval rate climbed by one point from June up to 89 percent.

The unfurling crisis in Afghanistan as a result of the Biden administration’s botched withdrawal, as well as Biden’s callous attitude toward the families of the 13 service members who lost their lives to a blast right outside the Kabul airport, were also unpopular with those polled. While approximately half of the respondents said they supported leaving Afghanistan, 52 percent of those adults disapproved of how Biden and his team handled it.

Similarly, a poll from NPR, PBS Newshour, and Marist conducted at the end of August shows that Biden’s approval rating hit a new low as his administration attempted to clean up the mess he left behind.

Of the 1,241 U.S. adults surveyed, only 43 percent said they approve of “the job Joe Biden is doing as president” while 51 percent said they disapprove.

“The decline is principally due to independents — just 36% of them approve of the job he’s doing, a 10-point drop,” NPR noted. “That a majority of independents now disapprove of his performance is bad news for Biden and Democrats. They’re a key swing group, one Biden won in 2020 but who now think he’s off track.”

A poll from The Federalist and Susquehanna Polling & Research in late August indicated that Americans disapprove of Biden more intensely than they approve of him. Approximately 32 percent of people surveyed said they “strongly approve” of Biden’s presidency, which dropped to 17 percent for those who said they “somewhat approve” of Biden’s time in office. On the disapprove side, 41 percent of those surveyed said they “strongly disapprove” of Biden. Only 4 percent said they “somewhat disapprove.”

Can Republicans Play Hardball On Impeaching Biden?,"“The president is not going to be removed from office,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell when asked about the growing calls for the impeachment of President Joe Biden as a result of his failures with the Afghanistan withdrawal. Noting that Democrats control both the House and Senate, he bluntly told a Kentucky group it’s “not going to happen,” and added, “I think the way these behaviors get adjusted in this country is at the ballot box.”

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy chimed in on the question already brewing before the Afghanistan debacle, saying it “is so serious it should only be taken” in extreme cases. “If Biden takes an illegal action, we would move impeachment. But we’re not going to move … for political purposes.”

Those views embody the prevalent position of Congress over a two-centuries-long period in which only two presidents were impeached. The common understanding across political parties was that the constitutional requirement of “high crimes and misdemeanors” meant just that: “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

That all gave way to a new threshold during the Donald Trump presidency, though, one that could accurately be called the “Nike Rule”: “Just do it.”

No Limits: ‘Treason,’ Anyone?

From the beginning, Democrats’ lack of restraint and reason was on full display. In an opinion article entitled “Impeach Trump,” a cryptic one-line argument was presented: “It’s not too early to start.” It was published in The New York Daily News on March 2, 2016—almost a year before Trump was sworn in as president.

Just six months after his inauguration, the first article of impeachment was formally filed in the House of Representatives. Three months later, a second charge came. Shortly thereafter, a batch of five new articles were filed. And so it went—for four years.

Along the way, the press was aflush with articles such as these:

Those were published articles. It got much worse on social media.

Say what you will, but Democrats are not afraid to fight. They battle day in and day out, and they don’t break ranks. If anything, they compete to one-up each other in their zealous pursuit of enemies.

Despising Trump’s very existence, they skipped past censure and went straight for the jugular—impeachment. Not only were they not content to allow an election to handle matters, they actually tried him after he had left office.

In the end, the mob was barely sated with a charge of “incitement of insurrection.” Some argued for treason—a crime punishable by death—but to their dismay found it was legally limited to the enabling of a foreign enemy, not a domestic one, as was alleged to have arisen on January 6, 2021. So there was no gallows.

Clearly, there is no limit on the bombastic rhetoric from Democrats, nor are they embarrassed by any of it. Yet Republican leaders still prefer to play the game by different rules that disadvantage their voters. Even after watching the 45th president be pummeled for years by false allegations, corrupt investigations, and endless calls for impeachment—capped by the actual deed pulled off, not once but twice, in his last 14 months in office—they still seem oblivious to the change in war tactics.

They fight like noblemen of old, standing at attention in line in an open field, ready to trade musket balls with the enemy—as they’re picked off from behind trees, one by one. Perhaps they never heard Gen. George Patton’s admonition that “no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country.”

The Constitutional Case Against Biden

Although the Afghanistan matter is drawing the most attention at this time, other known abuses of power should not be overlooked. Congress has a duty to act when high crimes are committed, and there’s strategic value in pursuing multiple issues, as Democrats have shown.

The truth is that Republicans do not have to sacrifice ethics or the Constitution in seeking an impeachment of Joe Biden. There is ample evidence of Constitutional abuses, derelictions of duty, and possible crimes, including the following:

President Biden abused his powers by directing the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to target political opponents under the guise of protecting the United States from “domestic violent extremism.”

President Biden abandoned his oath of office and his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed by refusing to enforce statutes that govern immigration.

President Biden directed private companies to restrict the speech of Americans, thereby corruptly using a proxy to violate their First Amendment rights.

President Biden unconstitutionally enacted a ban on evictions without the approval of Congress and in defiance of the Supreme Court.

Biden abused his powers as an official of the U.S. government to induce foreign investments and payments to his family and himself.

Also, of course, there is Afghanistan, for which a persuasive case can be made for impeachment based on dereliction of duty—or worse. Impeachment of Biden can coexist and possibly further punishing the military and administrative brass whose heads should roll over the disaster as well.

Consider that every move Trump made over four years was critiqued through a lens that portrayed him as a “Putin puppet.” But what about the “the Big Guy?”

Are his equity holdings abroad affecting his decision-making? Why would a president allow China, Russia, and others the chance to rip apart our Blackhawk helicopters and other weapons, revealing classified technology? Is that action itself criminal? As our sailors on nuclear submarines can attest, even the release of pictures of classified equipment is a felony offense. Democrats would not ignore or merely comment on any of this if a Republican were president. As Joe might say, “It’s a big f—ing deal.”

There’s also the video of Biden regaling an audience with the story of his quid-pro-quo with the Ukrainians. Fire the prosecutor “or you’re not getting the billion dollars,” he said. It perfectly mirrors the unsubstantiated charge lobbed at Trump in his first impeachment. As Democrats have made clear, impeachment powers are also not limited to the president’s time in office, and this was a textbook definition of “abuse of power.”

Who with “corrupt motives” recently withheld another $100 million that Congress had appropriated to help “Ukraine to oppose Russian aggression?” That would be Biden—holding up the funds as a reward to the Russians for moving some troops to boost his political capital before the G-7 summit.

In addition, Democrats charged that President Trump had obstructed justice by directing agencies and offices to “defy lawful subpoenas” issued to obtain documents for their investigation. Has Biden unconstitutionally directed officials in Arizona, via the Department of Justice, to defy a lawful subpoena in the production of documents—and routers—related to an investigation of his election?

Democrats would have a field day with any of these. Republicans? They’re too busy coming up with all the reasons they can’t do anything while demanding that voters hand them back control of Congress—but for what? More excuses?

Why Impeach?

Republican leaders are clearly nervous at the mere mention of “impeachment.” Besides their natural inclination to avoid dust-ups that might wrinkle their pressed suits, there is also the pragmatic concern: “Why do this, only to end up with a Kamala Harris presidency?”

The answer lies in another question: Did Democrats ever slow down their impeachment efforts over the “ultra-conservative” VP who would take Trump’s place? No, because their efforts were more focused on Sun Tzu than Mike Pence. They knew that chaos creates opportunity, and “opportunities multiply as they are seized.” Impeachment was just a tool to drive the chaos. Pence would never be president.

If a Harris presidency were to occur, is there any reason to believe the policies would differ substantially from those of the Biden administration, whoever that actually is? And would any president unimpaired by cognitive issues be better able to avoid foreign policy meltdowns?

The Process Is the Point

Democrats figured out the secret to winning a political war: being political. Wield every weapon possible—allegations, investigations, and cries for impeachment. It all discombobulates the opponent, weakens the support of allies, and slows forward movement.

Although presidents historically benefit from a post-election mandate, pushing through key legislation while the iron is hot, Trump’s first 100 days were a “honeymoon from hell.” A full repeal of Obamacare never happened, and other legislative priorities were stalled.

The president commented in October 2017 that the Democrats “are very good at, really, obstruction.” They were just getting started. The next month, that batch of five new articles of impeachment were filed against him, built around a theme that he was a danger to the country. Democrats were already waging an effective political war—without control of the House or the Senate.

Can Republicans play this kind of hardball? Do they understand the value in it?

‘The Supreme Art of War’

McConnell must know there is no shortage of potential impeachment charges. It’s time to learn to battle. Democrats were never shy to act on the slightest rumor from a partisan whistleblower, or the worst interpretation of a perfectly legitimate phone call, or to twist the unruly actions of a few people into a full-blown “insurrection.”

Nor did they wait on majority status to launch their fusillade of impeachment attacks. In the end, they sought to tar and feather the president, even as he packed his bags to leave the White House. And they did, trumpeting, “the president is impeached for life!”

Sun Tzu advised that “the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.” So far, Democrats have done just that to their noble adversaries across the aisle.

Can GOP leaders awaken and summon the will to fight, to give their voters something to vote for in 2022 and 2024? Can they hold Biden accountable? Several members are stirring, and Rep. Kevin McCarthy may be getting the message from voters, so perhaps momentum is building. Take it from Democrats, congressman, it’s not too early to start.

"Under Biden, Hundreds Of Kids Hospitalized With COVID In All-Time High","One day last year, back when Donald Trump was president, CNN displayed an on-screen graphic that blared the devastating headline: “CHILDREN COVID HOSPITALIZATIONS HIT ALL-TIME HIGH.”

The anchor leading the segment astutely noted that this is happening under Trump’s watch and that he was not taking the pandemic seriously, perhaps putting thousands of lives of young children at risk.

Wait, let me check my notes. Actually, that graphic aired just this week on Wednesday and Joe Biden is now president. But oddly enough, the good people at CNN — indeed, the entire national media — have found no story angles that call into question Biden’s leadership as we watch scores of children fall sick and in need of critical care.

No, as the media tell it, none of this is Biden’s responsibility at all. His hands are squeaky clean, even though the latest from his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is that children 17 and younger are being hospitalized with COVID at a rate nearly five times higher than what we saw at the start of the summer.

The CDC further notes that children aged four and under, who are supposed to be among the least vulnerable to severe COVID illness, experienced the “sharpest increase” in hospitalization at a rate now 10 times that of what was happening in late June.

That’s a lot of disease spread under the guy who promised he would “shut down the virus.” That’s a lot of disease spread under the guy who was actually very lucky to have inherited two spectacular gifts from his predecessor: Not just one but three viable vaccines, plus a plummeting trend in new infections and hospitalizations.

Just looking at children, for the week ending Jan. 23, which was the week Biden took office, there was a total of 81 children hospitalized with COVID, according to the CDC. That number trended downward to a low (for Biden’s presidency) of 20 child hospitalizations for the week ending June 19.

Since then, the number has been brought to a boil. In the first week of August, the CDC reported 90 children hospitalized, surpassing the 81 children hospitalized at the start of Biden’s presidency. The second week of August, the number climbed to 97. The week after that, the number was 108.

Those numbers should shake anyone’s core no matter who is president, let alone the man who, with great assist from the media, sold himself as the competent government manager able to bring the pandemic to a swift close.

To be sure, even as Biden’s pandemic performance gets spun by the media, voters appear to have seen it for what it is, at least to some degree. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll showed that approval for Biden on handling the coronavirus has dropped 10 points since June, from 62 percent to 52 percent.

The number of children susceptible to the virus was supposed to be infinitesimal. But then Biden came into office and it has grown at an exponential rate. Kids keep getting sick.

Why shouldn’t he be held responsible? To the extent that the media even bother to mention Biden, it’s to burnish the image they helped create of the president as a tough decision-maker wading into a war zone.

CNN anchor Kate Bolduan began a segment Wednesday going over the latest tragic COVID numbers. “Nearly 1,500 Americans are dying each day from coronavirus and vaccination rates are on the decline once again,” she said. (Fact check: Both true!) Then she got to work assuring viewers that Biden was right on top of things. “And these are two of the reasons that the White House is turning their focus back here again, announcing that President Biden will be delivering what’s being described as a major speech tomorrow, where he will announce a new plan to tackle the pandemic and fight back against the delta variant.”

You hear that, folks? What’s being described (by Biden’s White House team) as “a major speech” is in the works! Those sick kids will be back on their feet in no time!

The segment continued with correspondent Arlette Saenz offering that Biden was “hoping to offer more explanation of the next phase of combating the pandemic.”

We’re in the heat of the worst surge in new infections since the winter but fear not. Biden is here and fighting for you!

Saenz further noted that “the details” of Biden’s forthcoming plan “are still being ironed out” but that the president “will be briefed” in advance.

If that doesn’t steel your spine with confidence, what will?

But compare that to how CNN covered the pandemic under Trump in early October 2020, when the new infection rate was a quarter of what it is now. Jake Tapper said the White House was “failing in the pandemic response.” He also said that Trump, who had contracted the virus, “has become a symbol of his own failures.” Back then, we were averaging a little more than 43,000 new infections per day. A few days ago, we were averaging more than 150,000.

If 43,000 is a “failure” of then-President Trump, what is 150,000 under current President Biden?

Hush, now. Don’t you worry about that. There remains what’s being described as a major speech on the way.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/09/08/under-biden-hundreds-of-children-hospitalized-with-covid-in-all-time-high/,2021-09-08
Politico Published 20 Stories About Trump’s Taxes But 1 About Joe Biden’s,"Last week, the Medicare trustees finally released their long-delayed annual report into that program’s finances. It confirmed the program remains on shaky fiscal footing, concluding the Medicare trust fund that pays for hospital inpatient expenses will become insolvent in 2026, just five short years from now.

President Joe Biden helped contribute to the deterioration in Medicare’s finances. By using a questionable tax loophole to avoid payroll taxes on more than $13.5 million in income from 2017 through 2020, Biden and his wife Jill dodged nearly $395,000 in Medicare taxes, along with more than $122,000 in taxes that fund Obamacare.

But you won’t find any mention of this in corporate media, so I decided to do a little digging to find out how and why.

Saturation About Trump’s Taxes, Little About Biden’s

I examined Politico, a publication many “inside-the-Beltway” types read. It showed a yawning gap between coverage of Joe Biden’s tax affairs compared to coverage of his predecessor.

Between January 21 and August 9 of this year, Politico ran at least 20 separate stories about Donald Trump’s taxes. By contrast, during the same period this year, Politico appears to have run only a single story related to Biden’s taxes, when the Bidens released their returns in May.

That story spent many more paragraphs talking about Trump not releasing his taxes (seven) than it did about Biden’s questionable use of this tax loophole (one). Therefore, some may consider what initially looks like a 20-to-1 disparity of stories about Trump’s taxes vis-à-vis Biden’s more like a 21-to-1, or 21-to-0, gap.

The May story on Biden’s taxes mentioned the Biden administration now wants to close the tax loophole the Bidens recently exploited, but only in passing. As best I can tell, no one from Politico has explored this issue in any depth when discussing the president’s proposed tax increases.

Politico has published articles noting Republicans promoted provisions in the COVID bill even though they voted against the measure. But I have yet to find a single instance of a reporter pointing out that Biden takes credit for Obamacare all the time, even though he went out of his way to avoid paying the taxes that fund that law.

I won’t argue the legal controversies about Trump’s taxes aren’t newsworthy—they clearly are. I have also previously stated that Trump should have released his taxes as president, and should get held to the same legal standard as everyone else if he did in fact violate any tax laws.

But Biden’s taxes are just as relevant as Trump’s, if not more so, given a combination of factors. Those include that Biden is the current president, as opposed to the former president. Also, unlike Trump, Biden has publicly advertised himself as a paragon of virtue regarding his taxes and financial affairs.

In February, Politico published an Associated Press article recounting how “Biden told [People] magazine a folksy story about rejecting the advice of an accountant who had told him years ago that he could bill the Senate for some of the gasoline he pumped into the family car. Biden said he told the accountant: ‘Here’s how I look at it: The foul line is 15 feet away from the basket. Never get me closer than 17 feet, because it really is a matter of the public trust.’” Politico’s reporters know information that would directly rebut Biden’s claims about the propriety of his taxes, but have largely ignored such information.

The Treasury secretary Biden nominated, Janet Yellen, pointedly did not use the loophole the Bidens did to dodge payroll taxes the millions she received in speaking fees. It again raises an obvious question—Why did Biden use a loophole his own Treasury secretary thought improper to use?—that Politico, and corporate media in general, refuse to ask.

Biden also wants to raise taxes by trillions by demanding “the rich pay their fair share,” yet arguably did not do so himself. In fact, the (leftist) Tax Policy Center has described his tactics as “pretty aggressive” and legally questionable.

As noted above, the budget Biden released in April proposed closing the loophole Biden and his wife Jill spent the past four years exploiting—and the Politico reporters who covered the release of Biden’s taxes know that fact. Yet what kinds of articles has Politico chosen to focus its energies on instead? Hard-hitting stories like these:

Incompetence, Or Double Standards?

There are only two seeming possibilities to the disparity in Politico’s coverage. The first is that the reporters don’t know a newsworthy story when it hits them in the face. This scenario doesn’t really add up, however, given that 1) Politico’s reporters know Biden wants to close the loophole he exploited and 2) Politico has shown a willingness to cover politicians’ alleged double-standards, as in the case of Republican lawmakers and Democrats’ “COVID relief” bill this spring.

The other, more likely, explanation lies in applying double standards to Republicans and Democrats. Recall that Politico is the same publication whose employees went into a full-on meltdown when Ben Shapiro wrote for its Playbook newsletter earlier this year. Given the seething rancor in its newsroom when Politico gave a platform to a conservative, it’s entirely possible that ideological bias, and a desire to protect the left’s “Dear Leader,” has led its reporters to overlook Biden’s tax problems in a way that they haven’t for Trump.

Ironically enough, at the time of the Shapiro kerfuffle in January, Politico staffers called the decision to let him write for Playbook “especially confusing given the newsroom’s welcome efforts over the last year to cover issues related to race in a more intentional, elevated, thoughtful way.” Yet, for all its supposed focus on “equity,” Politico wouldn’t run a story on how Biden stiffed paying Obamacare taxes that fund health coverage for poor black kids because he was too busy renting this mansion outside Washington:

Funny that.

Politico Provides Answers—But Not a Response

I asked Politico to comment on my findings and received a response from Brad Dayspring, the paper’s vice president for marketing and communications. (Disclosure: More than a decade ago, Dayspring and I worked in the same Capitol Hill office for roughly one year.)

Dayspring referred me to several articles that in his view constitute examples of “stories holding President Biden and his Administration accountable to their words and actions.” Some of those articles, such as an August piece on immigration, focused on policy, while some focused more on process, Beltway gossip, and personalities.

But as to the specific concerns I raised regarding the disparity between coverage of Trump’s taxes and coverage of Biden’s, Dayspring would say only the following: “As I’m sure you understand, coverage decisions made by editors and the editorial process to report out stories is an internal matter, but I have passed along your opinion to relevant editors for their consideration.”

Actually, I don’t understand. If a government agency had a 20-to-1 gap in the way it treated a particular issue, no reporter in his right mind would accept that agency brushing off inquiries about the gap as “an internal matter.”

So why did Dayspring think he could avoid tough questions about this tangible gap in Politico’s reporting by sloughing it off as “an internal matter?” Does Politico think the transparency and accountability it claims to apply to government agencies should not apply to its own coverage?

More to the point: I raised the issue of Biden’s taxes—and specifically Politico’s lack of coverage of it—with two senior Politico editors last October 11. More than 11 months later, exactly nothing has changed, as my research demonstrates. So I don’t understand why my former colleague Dayspring would suggest I should think “passing along my opinion” to editors might matter now when it quite obviously hasn’t for months.

Just a few days ago, in a story discussing Biden’s response to the disappointing August jobs report, Politico once again exhibited open preferences for leftists. The reporter duly noted the president’s comments about the need for the rich to “pay their fair share”—without saying a word about how Biden refused to pay his “fair share.” It demonstrates how remarks like “we’ll pass along your opinion” amount to a patronizing dismissal of conservative viewpoints—and, for that matter, anyone with the temerity to challenge the accuracy and tone of Politico’s “reporting.”

Don’t Treat Readers as Fools

Dayspring’s response epitomizes why large swathes of the country hate the media. I empathize, because nothing sticks in my craw more than people who hide behind power to avoid admitting their own screw-ups—which is exactly what Dayspring, and Politico, chose to do. I’ve said it before in other contexts, and I will repeat it here: If you make a mistake, own it. But Politico and its editors pointedly refused to do just that, which could create bigger problems.

Much of Politico’s revenue comes from the sale of its “Politico Pro” content, for which lobbying firms and other Beltway-type organizations pay thousands, or tens of thousands, of dollars per year. Regardless of their political affiliations, these firms may find it difficult to justify that kind of expenditure if Politico deliberately ignores important issues like Biden’s taxes, and the implications of the same.

More to the point: I don’t believe these types of sophisticated institutions will much tolerate a publication that treats their customers as suckers—much as Politico seems to assume. This means the institutional arrogance Politico appears willing to display could end up becoming its undoing.

What The Campaign To Suppress The Hunter Biden Story Tells Us,"The Federalist Publisher Ben Domenech was joined by Miranda Devine, a New York Post columnist and Fox News contributor, on the Ben Domenech Podcast to talk about what the corporate media won’t cover, lessons since 9/11, and her new book, “Laptop From Hell: Hunter Biden, Big Tech, and the Dirty Secrets the President Tried to Hide.”

“What sets apart American media in this current moment, from the rest of the world in the attitude the media has toward these partisan debates that we’re going through, and toward other fellow media members?” Domenech asked.

“I always had thought of the American mode [of journalism] as being more protected against pressures to be partisan and to lie and to [push] propaganda,” Devine said, “but it turned out to be more exquisitely vulnerable.” Outlets like The New York Times and the Washington Post are “still capable” of solid journalism at moments, she added, but “they have so sullied the idea of objectivity that they are now routinely publishing propaganda that services one side of politics.”

The Biden administration, furthermore, is demonizing their opponents while bemoaning a lack of national unity, Domenech noted. Meanwhile, corporate media outlets have forsaken their old practice of sticking up for journalists of other political views simply for the sake of their profession’s integrity, with the treatment of the New York Post’s Hunter Biden laptop revelations being a prime example.

The information about Joe Biden from Hunter’s laptop “should have disqualified him from office,” Devine said, “and yet the story was actively suppressed … it was a collusion of Big Tech, Facebook and Twitter, and The New York Times, CNN, Politico, all these august journalistic organizations decided to go mum on it.”

“This suppression campaign, which is all you can call it, got a big assist from the former intelligence community,” Devine added. Fifty “former spooks,” she said, “all signed an open letter to say this had all the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation operation, and that was a complete lie.”

“Do you believe that ultimately we will learn the truth about the various deals that have been done [involving Hunter Biden], the amount of money that has sloshed through into the Biden family coffers?” Domenech asked Devine. “Or is this a situation where even when we do learn it, the power of the media cathedral to spin this narrative the way they want is going to mean that most Americans remain unfamiliar with it?”

“Hunter’s antics, you can only see as part of Joe Biden’s,” Devine said. “Joe used his son as the bagman for the family. This is not a story about Hunter Biden, addict. This is a story about Joe Biden and his 50 years of corruption in the state of Deleware which he then globalized when he became vice president.”

Domenech and Devine also reflected on the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and lessons learned since then. “The feeling of camaraderie and unity was incredible,” Devine remembered. “It was like wartime.”

Since then, however, “the 20 years of war has really profoundly demoralized Americans because you had successive administrations that didn’t know why they were sending soldiers over there,” she added. “Ultimately now we’re trying to grapple with all those years of wasted effort which was brought to an unholy conclusion by the worst person possible in Joe Biden.”

While the American spirit which was on display after 9/11 “is what’s kept everything going and kept us safe,” Devine said, “unfortunately there is this malign influence … now inside this country which is weakening it from within, and that’s coming from the left.”

Republicans should realize that “the left never misses an opportunity to capitalize on misfortune,” she added, and should stop expecting Democrats to work with them in a bipartisan way. “I’m hoping the red pilling that’s happening with the Biden presidency will wake up a lot of people.”

Biden Isn’t Facing ‘Challenges.’ Biden Is The Challenge,"Well-known Washington creature Amy Walters wrote this week on the “challenge” that Joe Biden is facing early in his presidency: “The former senator and vice president looks more like a helpless bystander than an experienced Capitol Hill deal maker…”

That, in a nutshell, is the national media’s preferred framing of the absolute breakdown we’re witnessing under Biden. A collapse that he created and is wholly responsible for.

The media want Biden to look like a “helpless bystander,” a victim of circumstances out of his control. He’s not. He’s the perpetrator of nearly every disaster anyone with eyes can see, from the obscenity at the southern border, to the loss of 13 service members (not fighting, but leaving a war zone), to the stratospheric inflation of household necessities.

We’re led to believe these are simply “challenges” Biden is facing rather than the results of his own deliberate screw-ups.

These are things happening to Biden.

CNN did a remarkable job handicapping Biden’s presidency earlier this week. In a Sept. 20 segment on Jake Tapper’s show, correspondent Phil Mattingly said Biden was “grappl[ing] with one of the most consequential weeks of his first year in office.” The graphic on screen noted that Biden was “faced with foreign policy turmoil…” Mattingly later said Biden was in “a key moment, particularly in the wake of a bumpy last several weeks.”

Let’s take stock of what’s happened during those “bumpy last several weeks”: On Sep. 20, there had been a total of 676,718 COVID-related deaths. Roughly 270,000 of those happened under Biden.

Pretty bumpy!

Also, on Aug. 26, 13 members of the U.S. military were killed during a suicide bombing attack at the airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, where operations were underway to withdraw from our decades-long effort in that sandpit. Eleven of the brave men and women were under the age of 24.

That feels bumpy, too.

In just the month of August, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered nearly 209,000 migrants illegally crossing into the country. That’s the second-highest monthly number of illegal border crossings of Biden’s presidency (far eclipsing the rates under Donald Trump) and his administration still won’t say how many of them — undoubtedly most — will be allowed to indefinitely stay here on the American taxpayer’s dime.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that skyrocketing inflation “is eroding household-spending power,” and that “for the lowest-paid Americans,” wages fell half of a percent compared to last year.

We’re in the middle of a pandemic — a pandemic that Biden promised to “shut down” — and wages are falling for our most vulnerable people. The Journal attributed the problems in large part to “trillions of dollars in federal aid” that has “coursed through the economy.” That’s a reference to the massive welfare program, sometimes referred to as “COVID relief,” passed by Biden and congressional Democrats earlier this year.

That’s kind of bumpy, right?

This is all “bumpy” in the same way that flying on American Airlines Flight 11 was turbulent.

Biden politicized the COVID vaccines by saying he would hesitate to receive one produced by the Trump administration. Now we’re going through the second-worst wave of new infections since the pandemic started. Biden invited all of the world’s destitute to America by promising to take them in at the newly opened border. Now they’re all here.

Biden oversaw our incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Now more than a dozen of our service members are dead and scores more are injured. Biden wanted to pump trillions more into our economy to keep would-be workers at home and give out goodies in hopes to reelect more Democrats. Now we’re suffocating under astronomical food and gas prices.

Biden is not a “helpless bystander” to all of this. These are not “challenges” he is facing. Biden is the accident. He is the challenge.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/09/24/biden-isnt-facing-challenges-biden-is-the-challenge/,2021-09-24
Politico Scoop On Biden Laptop Shows Danger Of 'Disinformation' Police,"Politico thought it broke a major story this week, claiming to have confirmed the authenticity of emails found on Hunter Biden’s laptop, emails that were suppressed by Politico itself at the height of the 2020 presidential campaign.

Playbook claimed on Tuesday that a new book by Politico reporter Ben Schreckinger “finds evidence that some of the purported Hunter Biden laptop material is genuine, including two emails at the center of last October’s controversy.”

The story continued:

A person who had independent access to Hunter Biden’s emails confirmed he did receive a 2015 email from a Ukrainian businessman thanking him for the change to meet Joe Biden. The same goes for a 2017 emails in which a proposed equity breakdown of a venture with Chinese energy executives includes the line, ’10 held H for the big guy?’ (This person recalled seeing both emails, but was not in a position to compare the leaked emails word-for-word to the originals.)

This comes eleven months after blockbuster reporting from the New York Post on the exact topic shook up the election. Politico meanwhile, participated in the seemingly coordinated media smear campaign to discredit the Post’s major scoop.

“Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say,” blared a Politico headline on Oct. 19.

By the time of the election on Nov. 3, the Post’s report had been supported by forensic analyses, corroborating reports, the rare reveal of an active FBI investigation, an on-the-record witness, and on-the-record statements debunking the idea of a Russian disinformation campaign from the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Department of National Intelligence, and the Department of State. Even if the content found on the hard drive turned out to be foreign hoax, it was certainly far more credible than the years-long conspiracy campaign alleging President Donald Trump was as a covert Russian agent.

New York Post editor Sohrab Ahmari pointed out his own paper was suspended from Twitter for weeks, had its links disabled on the platform, was accused of peddling Russian disinformation, and had its traffic suppressed on Facebook, all for reporting what Politico claimed to reveal this week—that Joe Biden lied repeatedly when he denied ever discussing business with his son, and also stood to rake in thousands from Hunter’s ventures.

En-fucking-raging. In case you forgot, for reporting just this, The New York Post, founded by Hamilton, was suspended from Twitter;

accused by of peddling Kremlin disinfo;

had its circulation reduced by Facebook;

and its readers prevented from sharing the story on Twitter. https://t.co/TYfHKRo5u6 — Sohrab Ahmari (@SohrabAhmari) September 21, 2021

Politico confirmed details of the Post’s reporting free of censorship this week, 11 months after the story broke and 10 months after the election. Conclusion: Politico is apparently superior to the nation’s fifth largest paper by circulation.

It’s difficult to overstate the damage done by the media’s cooperative shut down of incriminating information to surround the Biden family. A study commissioned by the Media Research Center in late November surveyed Biden voters across eight swing states after the election and examined their knowledge of several news stories the group felt the media had not fairly or adequately covered, including the Hunter Biden laptop scandal.

Of the 1,750 surveyed, 17 percent said they would not have voted for Biden had they known just one of eight stories presented. Biden carried seven of the eight states where voters were polled, including Arizona, Wisconsin, and Georgia. Trump would still be in office had the incumbent just captured 45,000 more votes across the three tipping-point states.

Would every crisis of Biden’s presidency—Afghanistan, the border collapse, runaway inflation, deteriorating world alliances—happened without the corporate suppression of Hunter’s emails? The answer speaks to the dangers of a disinformation police force with a monopoly on truth.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/09/25/politico-scoop-on-biden-laptop-proves-the-dangers-of-disinformation-police/,2021-09-25
Will Biden’s Border Crisis Cost Democrats Texas Seats?,"As the immigration crisis worsens in South Texas, President Biden’s inconsistent border policies and messaging are not only damaging his approval ratings nationwide, but they could also cost the Democratic Party once-safe seats in Congress.

The Rio Grande Valley is the epicenter of the crisis, and its residents feel the impact of the surge in border crossings every day. Illegal crossings reached a 21-year high in July with 212,672 encounters reported by the U.S. Border Patrol that month alone.

Across southern Texas, car chases have spiked this year, nearly nine-fold in some areas. Ranchers struggle to balance compassion for exhausted immigrants crossing through their property with concerns over personal safety, as well as costs to repair broken fences, trashed land, and stolen equipment. Federal agents also have reported a staggering increase of 4,000 in fentanyl seizures this year in Texas as smugglers exploit stretched border-patrol resources.

Although Democrats now control a trio of House seats representing Texas’ southern-most border with Mexico, voting patterns are making the districts more competitive.

Republicans are heavily targeting all three seats after the 2020 election showed a surprising swing in the GOP’s favor along the Texas-Mexico border. Once deep-blue, the three districts voted for Biden by just two to four percentage points, down from the 17-to-22-point margin Hillary Clinton racked up in 2016. Republicans also have redistricting on their side this year with the GOP-controlled Texas legislature poised to redraw several congressional districts in their favor.

Recent polling from the Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas signaled another reason for Democratic angst: Biden’s approval rating is underwater among Latino voters in the Lone Star State. More than 54% of the state’s registered Latino voters said they disapprove of the job Biden is doing overall, while only 35% said they approve.

When it comes to the president’s handling of the immigration crisis at the border, only 29% of the state’s Latino voters indicated their support while 52% said they disapprove (with the rest undecided). The survey was conducted Sept. 7-14, before more than 12,000 Haitian immigrants amassed under the Del Rio International Bridge, creating a new humanitarian crisis with immigration facilities already stretched beyond capacity.

The shift in voting patterns is already having an impact. Earlier this year, Rep. Filemon Vela, who represents Texas’ 34th Congressional District, which includes the city of Brownsville, abruptly announced his retirement. In 2020, he won reelection by nearly 14 percentage points in a seat generally considered safe for Democrats.

But national Republicans identified Vela as a target after Biden won the district by just four points, down from the 21.5-point Clinton margin. Five Republicans and four Democrats are now running to replace Vela in what promises to be a sharply contested campaign.

Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, the two other Democratic congressmen who represent the Rio Grande Valley, are fighting to keep their seats while taking different approaches to the immigration crisis, even though both strongly campaigned for Biden last year.

Cuellar, who has regularly bucked his party’s leadership over the years, has been an outspoken critic of Biden’s more lenient immigration policies, repeatedly blasting the administration for creating “incentives” for immigrants to make the dangerous journey to the United States instead of instituting “uncomfortable” but effective deportation policies.

The 16-year House veteran was the first lawmaker to provide photos of overcrowded detention facilities in Donna, Texas, when the administration was instituting a media blackout earlier this year. He also led calls for Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden’s point person on immigration, to visit the border months before her trip to Central America in June.

Last week, Cuellar waded into the debate over whether Border Patrol agents in Del Rio were using their horse reins as whips against Haitian immigrants, defending their efforts to stop illegal crossings while acknowledging that all immigrants must be treated humanely. Appearing on “CNN Newsroom” Tuesday, Cueller was asked about the photos of border agents chasing migrants on horses – and one that a host said appeared to be using a “rope or a lasso.”

He quickly came to the agents’ defense. “Certainly, we got to make sure we treat all the immigrants with respect and dignity, but I will say this: Border Patrol has had those horse brigades for a while. They’ve had them for a while, number one. Number two, they don’t carry whips, and they do not carry lassos.”

“Should those be used, even if it is a rein?” the CNN host asked.

“If there was a problem, it should be investigated, and I think that’s it,” Cuellar responded. “But we cannot paint the Border Patrol with the same type of paintbrush. What are they supposed to do, just stand there and let everybody come in? They’re supposed to be enforcing the law.”

After the images surfaced, creating an uproar among civil rights leaders, the Homeland Security Department launched an investigation. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced Wednesday that agents in Del Rio would no longer use horses to try to prevent illegal crossings.

Cuellar has represented South Texas for his entire career, either in the state legislature or in Congress. He won reelection last year by a whopping 20 points but faced a serious challenge during the primary, besting a more liberal candidate by just 3.6 percentage points. The same Democratic challenger, Jessica Cisneros, is running against him again. Republicans suggest that Cuellar is in a lose-lose situation, barely fending off a primary opponent in 2020 and facing a rematch because his immigration views aren’t liberal enough for the Democratic Party even if they represent his district as a whole.

Vicente Gonzalez appears to be even more vulnerable than Cuellar. He won reelection by just 2.9 points last fall after topping his GOP rival in 2018 by 19.6 points. Despite that shift, Gonzalez has mainly defended the administration’s immigration policies, praising Harris’ plan to address the root causes of immigration as “a holistic approach” to “create conditions for people to want to stay in their native countries.”

“We had a good meeting a few weeks ago with the vice president, and I think she has a very good plan to get to the root causes, which will be the only way to ultimately curb the mass migration,” he told CNN in early June. “If we don’t address the root causes, all we’re doing is putting a Band-Aid on it on our border.”

Over the last two weeks, as the Haitian immigration crisis overwhelmed resources in Del Rio, Gonzalez has steered clear of the controversy, refraining even from tweeting about it. But during a Fox News appearance Thursday, host Neil Cavuto pressed him on Biden’s decision to stop allowing the agents to use horses to control the border. Gonzalez called it a “very complex and tough situation that we have to investigate.”

“We certainly need to find an orderly way to deal with the crisis,” he added. “I’m not for just releasing people into the country. We need to have a vetting process before they get here.”

A member of the moderate Problem Solvers Caucus, Gonzalez has pushed back against progressives’ calls to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But he has not joined Cuellar in forcefully criticizing Biden’s approach even as he’s decried the way it has enriched Mexican drug cartels.

Since Biden took office, Gonzalez laments, those cartels are taking advantage of immigrants, charging each of them $6,000 to get to the U.S. border, and raking in more than $1.3 billion in the first few months of this year alone.

The three-term Texas Democrat has so far unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Biden administration to back his idea to establish a processing center for asylum seekers on the Mexico-Guatemala border where immigrants could apply for asylum and fly to the United States only if and when they qualify.

President Trump secured an agreement with Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras to use their militaries to prevent caravans from continuing into the United States, but when COVID hit, he used an obscure health measure, known as Title 42, to deport immigrants immediately without due process for their asylum requests in the name of public health. Biden is under fire from the left for continuing to use the policy to deport thousands of immigrants while releasing others into the U.S. who have requested asylum.

Those deciding to make the dangerous journey north are only coming from certain impoverished pockets of several Central American countries, Gonzalez has asserted. Because of this, the United States needs to make “surgical, thoughtful, intelligent investments that create jobs, create security, that invest in agricultural projects, manufacturing and tourism and ideas that create better jobs for people to want to stay,” he argued.

He didn’t mention that the Obama administration’s attempt to address root causes by sending billions of taxpayer dollars to Central America – an effort Biden led — had virtually no impact on the continued exodus north.

Gonzalez was far more critical of Trump’s immigration policies. Last year, he called on the administration to suspend its COVID immigration restrictions that were dramatically reducing the number of illegal border crossings but swelling border camp populations in Mexico.

“Imagine these people who have gone through a 2,000-mile trek and are now in a one-acre plot of land — thousands of them. Certainly, it’s an easy place for viruses to spread,” he told The Hill newspaper.

“Mexico could probably do more too because I went over there, and it was a mess. It’s not like detention centers on this side, as much as we complain about them. They’re living in squalor — tents on the ground and dirt. Now there’s a place for them to plug in their phones and some port-a-potties, but it’s really bad,” he added.

With the ongoing border crisis continuing to be a drag on Biden’s poll numbers nationwide, Republicans are keeping close track of every statement Cuellar and Gonzalez make on the issue. If their districts keep trending purple next year, Republicans could see a path to retaking the House majority straight through the border territory. No matter the outcome, Democrats will have to invest far more resources than usual to keep these seats in their column next year.

Biden's Lies About Border Whips Are More Proof He's Unfit To Lead,"President Biden’s treatment of Border Patrol is only his latest failure of leadership illustrating his unfitness to hold office.

As The Federalist’s Jordan Davidson has documented, the claims that Biden’s border agents were “whipping” or “strapping” illegal “immigrants” and “running them over” with their horses were bald-faced lies. These lies were concocted, amplified, and spread by an unprincipled cabal of Democrat conspirators in Congress, the administration, and the press. Yet the White House has continued to stand by their initial lies.

RCP's Phil Wegmann Asks Jen Psaki About The Del Rio ""Whips"" Not Existing https://t.co/Ldr4VouVkM — RCP Video (@rcpvideo) September 27, 2021

One of the fundamental principles of leadership is to not blame others, particularly subordinates, for mistakes that are one’s own responsibility. In the vernacular, a good leader does not throw his subordinates “under the bus” to cover his own behind. There is a practical reason for this: It is essential to a well-functioning unit or any organization. Loyalty from the top down will be reciprocated by loyalty from the bottom up. Without both, you will not have a cohesive organization that is able to operate successfully under stress.

Biden violated this principle by throwing his employees – the Border Patrol agents – under the bus in support of a lie to protect his political left flank. That fundamental failure in leadership is one of the reasons Border Patrol morale is scraping the bottom.

One border patrol agent told Fox News, “Would you go to work and do your best knowing that if you do your boss is going to ‘make you pay’?” Another, speaking of the president: “I see the administration wants to fry our agents. He just started a war with Border Patrol.”

The president’s fraudulent charges contribute to the agents’ inability to accomplish their mission effectively. Border enforcement is broken. That is, of course, part of the strategy of this leftist administration and its enablers.

As Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., put it, “Cracking a f-cking whip on Haitians fleeing hardship shows you that this system simply can’t be reformed.” She says it “can’t be reformed” because her ilk are trying to overturn (“fundamentally transform” in the words of then-candidate Barack Obama) that system – our system of government. From top to bottom.

Biden Lacks Moral Courage

A second fundamental trait of good leadership that is absent in this president is honor, which requires moral courage. You cannot have one without the other. One who does not demonstrate moral courage cannot be honorable and is not deserving of the title of “leader.”

Biden has demonstrated neither moral courage nor honor. When the most radical leftists in Congress, such as Tlaib and Reps. Maxine Waters of California, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and other unhinged Democrats accused these “whip cracking cowboys” of “inhumane,” “unfathomable cruelty,” and even of “hunting” people down “like runaway slaves,” what did Biden do?

Did he defend the truth or the hard-working border agents working to stem the invasion of the country? Did he call on any of them to cease the divisive race-baiting rhetoric? No. He caved. Even worse, he promised that the results of any investigation would convict the agents, regardless of the facts: “It’s outrageous. I promise you, those people will pay.”

He knew his promises of punishment were based on calumnious lies, but lacking a scintilla of moral courage or honor, he caved anyway. He surrendered to the most unhinged leftists in his own party because he could not summon up the moral courage to disagree with them.

Others in the administration dutifully fell into line. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said, “I was horrified by what I saw.” Even though there has yet to be an investigation, he also claimed the actions of the border agents in his department “def[y] all of the values that we seek to instill in our people.”

And here is the Border Czarina herself, Vice President Kamala Harris: “What I saw depicted about those individuals on horseback, treating human beings the way they were, is horrible . . .[H]uman beings should never be treated that way and I am deeply troubled by it.”

Part of a Pattern in Biden’s Character

These actions are not just isolated instances of a lapse of judgment or even of moral courage. They are part of a pattern and show Biden’s ingrained character. Without excusing his past pattern of lies, these are of a different order.

His well-documented history of plagiarism and lying about his grades and law school scholarship could be explained as lies told by an insecure man for self-aggrandizement. These falsehoods are worse, because they are an effort to deflect blame to others for his own failed policies.

Instead of taking responsibility for his own bone-headed border decisions, Biden fixes the blame for the chaotic scenes on the border on low-paid employees, without a thought of the effect on them, their families, or their careers. Why should any border agent think that Biden cares a whit about ruining their lives with his lies, when then-Senator Biden did the same thing to a blue-collar truck driver who was involved in a car accident that resulted in the tragic deaths of Biden’s first wife and infant daughter? For years, even though there was no evidence that the unfortunate man either had been drinking or was at fault, Biden falsely accused him of being an “errant driver who stopped to drink instead of drive.”

If he were a brand-new second lieutenant in any branch of the military, Biden’s demonstrated lack of honor and leadership failings would ensure that he would not be allowed to command so much as a platoon. If he escaped being booted out with a less-than-honorable discharge, his demonstrated lack of moral courage would assure his exile to some obscure assignment where he would not be entrusted with safeguarding any equipment, much less any lives.

Biden has not seen fit to correct any of his inflammatory and false accusations. And he will not, because they fit his strategy of telling the American people what is necessary to advance his radical political goals, “whether it is true or not.” We are in for more of the same as long as this administration is in office, unchecked.

"President Biden Governs Through Obvious, Ham-Fisted Lies","Hardly a day passes anymore that President Joe Biden or members of his administration do not stand before the American people and lie through their teeth.

The latest lie to be exposed came Tuesday, when Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he advised Biden to keep 2,500 troops in Afghanistan, and that withdrawing them “would lead inevitably to the collapse of the Afghan military forces and eventually, the Afghan government.” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark Milley said he told Biden the same thing.

The generals’ testimony flatly contradicts Biden’s claim in an August 19 interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that none of his military advisors told him to keep 2,500 troops in Afghanistan, or ever warned him that withdrawing those troops would trigger the collapse of the Afghan military and government. Here is how the exchange went:

STEPHANOPOULOS: So no one told — your military advisors did not tell you, ‘No, we should just keep 2,500 troops. It’s been a stable situation for the last several years. We can do that. We can continue to do that’?



BIDEN: No. No one said that to me that I can recall.

So either Biden was lying or he simply cannot remember what his top military advisors told him about one of the most important decisions of his presidency. Admittedly, the president is slipping in his old age and often seems confused, but the most straightforward explanation here is that he was deliberately lying to Stephanopoulos about what his generals advised.

During the Trump administration, the corporate press embraced the idea that Trump was always lying about everything, that he could not string together two sentences without inserting some falsehood or deception. Media coverage of Trump was premised on this assumption, even for serious matters like the development of the COVID-19 vaccines.

But Trump’s dishonesty now seems quaint compared to Biden’s. Under Biden, lies have become so commonplace and casual, they constitute a mode of governance for an administration that has proven to be hopelessly out of its depth on every major issue and profoundly incompetent in the face of every crisis. If the stakes were not so high, the abject lying — and the media’s willingness to go along with it — would be comical.

Often, the lies are obvious, like when Biden said last week that mounted Border Patrol agents in Del Rio, Texas, were “running over” Haitians migrants and “strapping” or whipping them with their reins, a false claim that was repeated over and over by the press and administration officials after photos of a horse patrol confronting illegal immigrants appeared on social media.

Biden on the lie that border patrol were using whips on illegal immigrants at the border: ""To see people treated like they did? Horses running them over? People being strapped? It's outrageous. I promise you, those people will pay."" pic.twitter.com/Jx79KoYTy9 — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) September 24, 2021

Before Biden even repeated this smear, along with a vile threat that the Border Patrol agents involved “will pay,” the whole story had been proven to be a complete fiction. The agents did not whip or strike anyone. In fact, they did exactly as they are trained to do, using their reins to control the horses and maintain a safe distance between horse and pedestrian.

The photographer who took the viral photos later confirmed he never saw the mounted Border Patrol agents strike anyone, and subsequent video footage of the incident should have settled the matter definitively. Instead of slandering and threatening the agents, the president should have come out and apologized to them profusely.

But Biden appears to be incapable of not lying all the time, even when his abject dishonesty is an insult to the intelligence of every American. It is simply pervasive.

Consider the idiotic lie Biden was peddling last week, that his $3.5 trillion climate change and welfare bill would actually cost zero dollars. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, who is terrible at her job in part because she’s such a clumsy and unconvincing liar, went on to repeat the “zero dollars” false claim on Monday.

What all these lies obscure is rank incompetence on the part of the Biden administration. From the southwest border to Afghanistan to the pandemic response, every crisis that comes along has been bungled by this White House, and in every case the default response of Biden’s team is to lie about what is happening and why.

That is how you get hundreds of Americans left behind in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan after the Biden administration spent weeks claiming it would not leave until every American who wanted to leave was safely evacuated. Specifically, Biden said on August 18 that if there were still U.S. citizens in Afghanistan on the Aug. 31 deadline who wanted to leave, “We’re gonna stay to get them all out.”

We did not, and it seems clear in retrospect that Biden had no intention of leaving any U.S. troops in Afghanistan after Aug. 31, no matter how many Americans would be stranded behind enemy lines as a result.

What we can conclude from this pattern of deception is simply that Biden does not feel the need to give straight answers about any decision he makes or policy he enacts. He will not be honest about what his advisors tell him or about what he intends to do on any given issue.

Above all, Biden has made it clear, through an unrelenting fusillade of lies, that he does not consider himself to be the least bit accountable to the American people, does not think ordinary rules and norms apply to his administration, and does not think he owes anyone an honest word about anything that happens on his watch.

He has decided, that is, to govern by lies. The least we can do, at this point, is be honest about that.

Del Rio Proves Biden Can Stop The Border Crisis Whenever He Wants,"DEL RIO, Texas — The migrant encampment under the international bridge here is liquidated, the 15,000 mostly Haitian illegal migrants who had pooled under it gone to different futures (most paroled into the United States but others flown to Haiti). Bulldozers have erased all trace evidence that anything of much note ever happened here.

Except that much of note did happen during the September 12–24 migrant camp crisis in Del Rio, including two lessons very much worth unpacking from the White House response, which saw this as a political canker sore and therefore swiftly ended it. If retained and refined, these two moves hold the power to prevent a recurrence of new such camps but, perhaps more importantly, to douse the far wider mass migration crisis from which this one spawned.

The Del Rio camp — with its 15,000 temporary inhabitants and all the media attention it attracted — needs to be viewed in proper context as a relatively minor solar flare in a far wider crisis that brings in 50,000 immigrants every single week (on track for 1.7 million for FY2021) across hundreds of miles of America’s southern border, yet weirdly attracts far less media attention.

The Del Rio camp, however shiny a bauble it was for network news cameras, amounts to a typical Texas breakfast hour on any given day, so vast is the crisis that spawned their riverbank shantytown. Two main actionable takeaways from Del Rio that the White House, Congress, and U.S. media should know, study and apply to significantly temper the crisis that birthed Del Rio, are:

Rolling out repatriation flights to home nations as a credible threat proved to be a magic pill for sharply reducing mass illegal immigration and should be retained and expanded to the rest of the border and other nationalities now.

Del Rio revealed a deeply troubled U.S.-Mexico diplomatic relationship that relied on carrots but requires a radically different American approach that involves the stick, which proved miraculously effective during September.

A Clearly Dysfunctional U.S.-Mexico Relationship

The Mexican government caused the Del Rio camp to form, the Center for Immigration Studies has concluded from interviews with immigrants in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, just across from Del Rio. The camp’s formation reveals that Mexico neither respects nor fears the Biden administration’s carrots-based approach to diplomacy, and feels free enough of potential consequences to casually renege on diplomatic bargains.

In this case, the Mexican national interest in setting loose thousands of migrants toward the American border on September 12 seemed especially trivial for trashing a diplomatic agreement with America: creating a nicer environment for Mexico’s cherished El Grito national independence celebrations the week of September 16.

Consider what CIS learned from interviews with dozens of the Del Rio camp’s inhabitants against the backdrop of Joe Biden’s election and opening presidential moves on immigration policy.

By February 2021, it became clear that Biden’s first immigration policy actions — eliminating most interior deportations, getting rid of President Trump’s instant expulsion practices, and fast-track legalizing family groups and children who illegally crossed the border, for starters — had spurred a mass migration event. So Biden’s State Department went to Mexico and cut quid pro quo deals that asked Mexico to slow this migration down.

The administration offered Mexico and Central American nations billions in aid, for instance, as well as coronavirus vaccines. In return, Mexico agreed to a Biden request to keep a Trump-era Mexican National Guard deployment of 9,000 on its southern border with Guatemala.

Specifically, the troops would enforce a Mexican plan to require that arriving immigrants secure Mexican asylum or other legal permissions as a precondition to travel out of the country’s southernmost provinces. But approvals were slow-rolled, often for months.

Thousands backed up in and around the southern Chiapas State city of Tapachula — more than 20,000 Haitians, for instance, applied for Mexican asylum through July. Those who couldn’t hire expensive smugglers to end-run the new requirements were made to wait months for approvals that never seemed to come.

By the first week of September, frustration boiled into violent clashes as mostly Haitian immigrants formed caravans and tried to break through the National Guard. They and guard formations repeatedly clashed in southern Mexican towns and cities as Mexico tried to keep its word to the United States. The Mexican government forces were still battering the caravans for days by the second week of September, clubbing men, women, and children into vehicles for transport back south.

But then, on September 12, the Mexican government suddenly caved, according to migrants who later reached the Del Rio camp. Government officials in Mexico’s deep south had told them all: never mind the papers. They gave the Haitians a three-day grace period to clear out of Tapachula. An exodus of thousands promptly moved northward that day, mostly by bus — toward Del Rio, Texas, a day or two ride away.

The reason local officials gave the immigrants for this gift was the onset of El Grito. Mexico has never publicly confirmed this but it seems likely that the government wanted to grant the immigrant-weary people of southern Mexican states a reprieve from violent clashes that seemed poised to ruin the coming weeklong festivities of parades and cook-outs.

“The government allowed us to leave,” one of those Haitian migrants, who gave his name as Kelson, told CIS. He was with a small group that had just gotten off a bus that departed from Tapachula. The government decision to let everyone leave permit-less was very sudden. “We don’t know why, but a lot of the offices were going to be closing for the holiday.”

He said thousands of Tapachula migrants left town as soon as they could and headed for Ciudad Acuna and Del Rio.

Why Did They Go to Del Rio?

Another Haitian who wrote his name as Donley Vainqueur said he and his family were forced to wait in Tapachula for months, applying for what he termed “passports” to the rest of Mexico. He said every day he would go to check on the status of his application. Then, all of a sudden one day when he went to check, “They [Mexican immigration officials in Tapachula] said, ‘Okay, you can cross for three days because of the days of festivities.’”

Why did they go to Del Rio and not other, more trammeled parts of the Texas-Mexico border? Because it’s free to cross the Rio Grande here, and safe; Mexican cartels in the region are largely uninvolved in human smuggling, according to prior CIS reporting in March 2021 from Del Rio and across the river in Ciudad Acuna.

True to El Grito, Mexican authorities in Ciudad Acuna at the main Rio Grande crossing into the camp told CIS they were under orders not to interfere with the Haitians pouring over the Rio Grande into Del Rio. State police and National Guard could be seen passively observing as hundreds of migrants moved back and forth over the river within feet of them. One Coahuila police officer said they were stationed there to keep order against crime only.

By mid-week of the Del Rio camp crisis-within-a-crisis, however, the Mexican government was somehow made to realize its diplomatic affront.

Mexican Cooperation Is Crucial

Mexico’s central government ordered a sharp about-face with a series of tough enforcement moves, shutting off almost entirely the incoming spigot of migrants, that testify to the criticality of Mexican involvement in U.S. border security when that government is made to care.

After days of purposefully letting all migrants cross into Del Rio, the State Police manning the main crossing this time had that entry point roped off and completely vacant under new orders, the officers told CIS: let no one through.

Not that any migrants wanted to go through by then, because the Biden administration had just begun shipping the migrants back to Haiti aboard Immigration and Customs Enforcement air flights. This tactic, politically unpalatable to the Biden administration but reluctantly acknowledged as highly effective, sent thousands of the Del Rio camp migrants fleeing back into Mexico, no small few boarding southbound commercial buses, on just the chance that they might end up on an ICE flight, all who were interviewed told CIS in Acuna.

But even had they wanted to still cross at Del Rio or elsewhere in the area, they would have found this very difficult in Mexico with its turn-on-a-dime border policies.

In Ciudad Acuna, Mexican National Guard and immigration officials began running systematic raids on all hotels, rousting immigrants and putting them on daily flights out of the Acuna airport back, at least, to the southern Mexican provinces from which they came, members of the guard told CIS. Some credible media reports had it that Mexico would begin its own repatriation flights to Haiti. Meanwhile, National Guard roadblocks went up in central Mexico to turn around northbound buses carrying migrants.

The Lesson to Learn

Did the Biden State Department make some angry and demanding phone calls that included threats? That isn’t known for certain, but it undoubtedly happened. Whatever the Americans told Mexico to do, it did. And this amply demonstrates the sheer power that a more robust American approach to diplomacy with Mexico can have on mass illegal immigration.

None of this should surprise. When he was president, Trump did not rely on paying aid or giving medicines to the Mexican government to do his bidding; he threatened economically destructive trade tariffs on all Mexican exports if Mexico did cooperate with his policies and demands to slow migration on its southern border.

That’s why Mexico originally deployed its troops on the Guatemala border and at the northern border to block illegal immigration and deport most southward if they did not apply for asylum. And it worked for all of the time those threats remained on the table, as CIS reported from Tapachula in January 2020.

It’s a safe bet that Mexico would never have considered unleashing thousands of migrants for El Grito had President Trump been in office with his stick-based diplomacy about the border.

While it’s unclear whether the Biden State Department threatened Mexico mid-week to get its side of the camp under control, the key takeaway from the Del Rio experience is that a different American approach, perhaps one that includes the stick, would undoubtedly go far to eliminate the broader mass migration crisis along all of the U.S. southern border. That’s especially in conjunction with another important lesson learned from Del Rio.

The Repatriation Flights

Perhaps no tactic proved more impactful in ending the Del Rio camp than was the Biden administration’s politically unpalatable resort to the Trump-era policy of repatriation flights to Haiti. That’s especially when done in conjunction with Mexico’s (probably forced) repatriation flights, hotel raids, border closures across from Del Rio, and removal operations of other varieties mid-way through the camp crisis it directly caused for El Grito.

Some estimates suggest that as many as 5,000 of the Del Rio camp’s original residents fled back into Mexico. Migrants leaving on southbound buses and in a public park on the Mexican side across from Del Rio told CIS they were leaving in abject fear of the deportation flights.

Only about 2,500 of the 15,000 were flown to Haiti, but no matter. Those 2,500 texted and emailed warnings back to those still in the camp: Leave! Get out! Don’t go near the ICE buses! They’re going to deport you!

Wholesale repatriation by air did not seem necessary; just a small percentage seemed enough to send Haitians fleeing, dozens of migrants told CIS in Ciudad Acuna, to which they initially fled. Asked why one was going back to Tapachula, one typical migrant who’d fled Del Rio answered, with a touch of anger: “Because Biden said all Haitians coming will be returned to their country. We spent much money to come here. Much, much, much money. And we get nothing now. This is very sad for me.”

Of course, the Trump administration succeeded in reducing a mass migration episode that erupted in early 2019, in large part, by using air repatriation to home countries too. In 2019, for instance, the Trump administration deported 50,000 Guatemalan immigrants in a bid to increase the risk to others that their smuggling fees and effort would not pay off. Many stopped trying to come, unwilling to waste smuggling fee investments.

It remains unclear how long the Biden administration will use the repatriation flight option. Other important questions about it remain unanswered too, such as whether its use will be extended to the rest of the border or apply to the many other nationalities crossing the southern border in large numbers.

We Could Secure the Border If Biden Wanted

The important takeaway was that, even in this one limited experimental use of repatriation flights, it proved highly impactful as a real deterrent that stopped entry into the camp and then reduced the camp’s population almost single-handedly. Air repatriation was the single most effective tool the administration brought to bear in liquidating the camp. This is very much worth knowing because, if ever applied border-wide to a greater number of nationalities, the broader border crisis might be significantly attenuated.

Another key particle of related information worth knowing is how its use plays in migrants’ decision-making. Many of those who fled the Del Rio camp said they planned to disappear into Mexico City or Monterrey or Tapachula to get their Mexican asylum, work, and bide their time until one thing happens, and one thing only: the Biden administration stops the repatriation flights. Then they will return to cross the U.S. border.

Biden Admin: Parents Who Oppose Racism Are Domestic Terrorists,"It is no coincidence that the Department of Justice heeded the National School Boards Association’s call for the Biden administration to target parents critical of critical race theory curricula and dubious coronavirus policies in schools by labeling them domestic terrorists and mobilizing the DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The administration’s National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism mandates just such chilling action.

That little-discussed but hugely significant document codifies a War on Wrongthink, demanding that the full weight of the federal government and private-sector allies like Big Tech be brought to bear against dissenters from Biden regime orthodoxy. Consider “pillar four” of the strategy, titled “Confront Long-Term Contributors to Domestic Terrorism.” It reads in part:

…tackling the threat posed by domestic terrorism over the long term demands substantial efforts to confront the racism that feeds into aspects of that threat. We are, therefore, prioritizing efforts to ensure that every component of the government has a role to play in rooting out racism and advancing equity for under–served communities that have far too often been the targets of discrimination and violence. This approach must apply to our efforts to counter domestic terrorism by addressing underlying racism and bigotry.

On day one of the Biden presidency, the administration issued an executive order lamenting America’s “systemic racism.” In response, it called for the administration to pursue “an ambitious whole-of-government equity agenda.”

It also revoked the Trump administration’s executive order barring training of federal employees in “anti-American race … stereotyping and scapegoating” — an implicit reference to critical race theory and related critiques of America. This revocation could be seen as at minimum a tacit endorsement of CRT, as could the Biden administration’s dissolution of the Trump administration’s 1776 Commission, a group whose work could be seen as challenging CRT.

Administration Backtracked For Now

A Department of Education proposal in April represented a more direct demonstration of the Biden administration’s pro-CRT position. The rule would have prioritized grants for American history and civics programs that “incorporate racially, ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse perspectives,” citing as examples The New York Times’ 1619 Project and “anti-racist” par excellence Ibram X. Kendi.

The rule promoted “culturally responsive teaching,” which Ethics and Public Policy Center senior fellow Stanley Kurtz describes as an “ultra-woke and utterly politicized pedagogy derived from Critical Race Theory.” That rule was ultimately shelved amid a massive backlash, but the administration’s position was made clear: It fully supports critical race theory.

It stands to reason that the Biden administration would see support of CRT as consistent with its “equity” agenda, and therefore opposition to CRT as an impediment to it. “Equity” is a concept firmly rooted in the “anti-racism” of the likes of Kendi. Kendi asserts that “Antiracist ideas argue that racist policies are the cause of racial inequities.” CRT is therefore an anti-racist idea. To critical race theorists, then, opposing them is racist.

Whites As Greatest Domestic Threat

If, as the Biden administration argues, countering domestic terror, the greatest threat of which comes from white supremacism, requires “addressing underlying racism and bigotry,” as the national strategy says; and opposition to CRT is racist; then targeting CRT critics becomes a national security imperative.

With respect to the Chinese coronavirus, the Biden administration’s purported counter-terror strategy quotes from a March 2021 intelligence community domestic violent extremism (DVE) threat assessment noting that “Newer sociopolitical developments—such as narratives of … conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic … will almost certainly spur some DVEs to try to engage in violence this year.”

That assessment followed a January 2021 national terrorism advisory bulletin noting that in 2020 “domestic violent extremists” were motivated by “anger over COVID-19 restrictions” and that “Threats of violence against critical infrastructure … increased in 2020 with violent extremists citing misinformation and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 for their actions.”

Subsequently, an August 2021 national terrorism advisory bulletin warned that:

…anti-government/anti-authority violent extremists will remain a national threat priority for the United States. These extremists may seek to exploit the emergence of COVID-19 variants by viewing the potential re-establishment of public health restrictions across the United States as a rationale to conduct attacks.

The bulletin cited “continued, non-specific calls for violence on multiple online platforms associated with DVE ideologies or conspiracy theories on…alleged reinstatement, and responses to anticipated restrictions relating to the increasing COVID cases.”

Questioning the Government Is a Domestic Threat

The Biden administration of course supports more restrictive coronavirus measures generally, and has vowed to combat policies barring universal masking in classrooms — the kind of policy parents have protested nationwide. Its purported counterterror strategy notes that “domestic terrorists” “espouse a range of violent ideological motivations,” including not just racism but “anti-government or anti-authority sentiment.”

The Biden administration apparently believes challenges to school boards on its favored coronavirus policies reflect such anti-government or anti-authority sentiment, as the DOJ memorandum responding to the NSBA argues that it is compelled to act given “Threats against public servants.” The NSBA notes that “groups” are “spreading misinformation that [school] boards are … working to maintain online learning by haphazardly attributing it to COVID-19.”

The Biden strategy calls for “enhancing faith in government and addressing the extreme polarization, fueled by a crisis of disinformation and misinformation … which can tear Americans apart and lead some to violence … Enhancing faith in American democracy demands accelerating work to contend with an information environment that challenges healthy democratic discourse. We will work toward finding ways to counter the influence and impact of dangerous conspiracy theories that can provide a gateway to terrorist violence.”

Seeking to frighten parents into silence by threatening to sic our nation’s most powerful law enforcement bodies on them for challenging critical race theory, or coronavirus policies, would seem to be perfectly consistent with the Biden administration’s “National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.”

Its reach is virtually limitless if dissent from the regime’s agenda constitutes a danger to “democracy.” At minimum, it should be clear that critics of the regime’s CRT ideology, and coronavirus policies, have been classified as threats.

Parents Speak Up, Get Labeled Terrorists

The irony here, in the case of school boards, is that to justify its call for federal protection, the NSBA cites all of two instances where individuals were arrested at school board meetings for their behavior. Those two arrests concerned disgruntled parents at board meetings, one of whom allegedly struck a school official escorting him from the premises, and another of whom reportedly physically threatened someone and resisted arrest.

These acts are unacceptable, and anyone who breaks laws ought to be prosecuted accordingly. But is this the stuff of domestic terrorism?

Otherwise, the NSBA largely substantiates its concerns by flagging a series of disrupted school board meetings, some ending in the face of “angry mobs”; a report of menacing social media posts threatening several schools without any readily discernible connection to school boards and their positions on CRT or Chinese coronavirus policies; and another report that “A resident in Alabama, who proclaimed himself as “vaccine police,” has called school administrators while filming himself on Facebook Live.”

It appears the NSBA actually got this story wrong. “Vaccine police,” according to the link it includes, was “confronting pharmacists in a Missouri Walmart.”

Once again, is this the stuff of domestic terrorism? Is the threat so dire that it demands, as the NSBA called for, the intervention of no less than: the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, National Threat Assessment Center, and U.S. Postal Service, under laws including the Gun-Free School Zones Act, PATRIOT Act, Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, Violent Interference with Federally Protected Rights statute, Conspiracy Against Rights statute, an executive order to enforce all applicable federal laws for the protection of students and public school district personnel, and any related measure?

So far, the Biden administration has only enlisted a subset of these agencies, but perhaps more is to come. One thing is clear: The Biden administration’s War on Wrongthink, masquerading as a domestic counterterrorism mission, will inflict infinitely more terror on America than will loving and impassioned parents concerned about the education and health of their children in the taxpayer-funded schools.

Democrats’ Carbon Tax Would Harm Already Struggling Americans,"As if middle-class Americans didn’t have enough inflation to cope with, Democrats want to squeeze struggling families even more. The New York Times reported over the weekend that the opposition of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., a key element of President Biden’s agenda has some Democrats considering adding a carbon tax in their $3.5 trillion spending extravaganza.

Imposing a carbon tax would represent but the latest instance of Democrats violating President Biden’s pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class:

I give you my word as a Biden: If you make under $400,000 a year, I’ll never raise your taxes one cent. But, I’m going to make those at the top start to pay their share in taxes. It’s only fair. — President Biden (@POTUS) September 27, 2021

Claims in tweets aside, Biden’s record shows he does not practice what he preaches—not on rich people “paying their fair share,” and certainly not on taking action against global warming. Instead, Biden’s carbon tax would raise prices on struggling families to offset the massive carbon emissions of he and his wealthy friends.

Wyden Carbon Tax Proposal

The Times reported that Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Oregon:

Is considering a domestic carbon tax that could start at $15 to $18 per ton, and that would increase over time … The tax would be applied directly to coal mining companies, large natural gas processing plans, and oil refiners, based on the emissions associated with their products, with one exception: Oil refiners would likely be charged for producing diesel fuel and petrochemicals, but not gasoline—a way to shield most American drivers at the pump.

Wyden claims he would use the revenue to fund rebates for working-class Americans, to mitigate the effects of the tax increases.

How would all this work? For starters, a carbon tax would raise a lot of revenue. Prior estimates suggest a tax on the order of the Wyden proposal would generate roughly $700 billion or so over for the federal government a decade.

Consumers would pay part of these carbon taxes directly, through higher heating and electricity bills. If applied to gasoline, a carbon tax could raise its price by roughly 15 cents per gallon. (The Times indicated Wyden’s current proposal would exempt gasoline from the carbon tax, but this estimate gives readers a sense of how much a carbon tax would raise energy prices, using a “real world” example many can relate to.)

A 2017 Treasury report also suggests that, if applied at the level envisioned by the Wyden proposal, a carbon tax would raise prices for natural gas by nearly double digits. As it is, the Energy Department estimated last week that the average home using natural gas will require $746 to heat this winter—up more than 30 percent from last year’s $573. Prices for home heating oil, electricity, and gasoline would all rise by at least several percentage points under a carbon tax.

A carbon tax would also indirectly raise the price of food, clothing, and other goods that comprise a disproportionate share of working-class Americans’ incomes, as producers raise prices to offset fuel and utility price hikes. As the Times noted, “industries could pass along their higher costs, leaving Democrats vulnerable to claims that they are raising taxes on the middle class, at a moment when inflation and energy prices are [already] rising.”

Even if implemented in a revenue-neutral way, in which the new revenue from the carbon tax gets paid back out in rebates to middle-class Americans, all this redistribution would create government-chosen winners and losers. For instance, while the Times suggests that most individuals with gas-powered cars wouldn’t face a carbon tax on their fuel, Americans with diesel-powered vehicles would—meaning that people who selected “clean” diesel cars a few years ago could end up paying a lot more to fuel their cars. These types of inequities would occur throughout the economy, and could hit many working families hard.

Joe Biden’s Carbon Emissions Are Bigger Than Yours

Given Democrats’ new willingness to raise taxes on middle-class Americans, both directly and indirectly, in the name of addressing the “climate crisis,” it’s worth examining how Joe Biden has addressed that “crisis” himself. Of course, no one expects the president of the United States to fly commercial, but consider just some of the ways Biden behaved when he became a private citizen in 2017:

As Biden traveled the country before announcing his presidential campaign this spring [of 2019], his sponsors provided hotel suites, town cars, and professional drivers, chartered flights and travel expense reimbursement that for some of his appearances reached at least $10,000 per event…. Some contracts [for personal appearances] included at least $10,000 for travel—which was the agreement with the University of Utah—and organizers were told it was standard practice for Biden and his aides to fly privately. Other contracts, like one with the University of Buffalo, included a stipulation for ‘a town car and professional driver’ for Biden and each of his companions.

The same article outlining his luxury—and carbon-intensive—travel habits also noted that Biden also grew his real estate holdings after serving as vice president. In 2017, he and his wife Jill spent $2.7 million buying a 4,800-square-foot “beach house” at the same time they were renting a 12,000-square-foot mansion outside Washington. Because they no longer live at, and never owned, the Washington-area mansion, we can examine the property’s many carbon-intensive features in detail—including five bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, marble fireplaces, a gym, a sauna, and parking for 20-plus cars:

Combine the 4,800 square foot “beach house,” the 12,000-square-foot mansion they rented outside Washington, and the Bidens’ original 7,000-square-foot compound in Wilmington, Delaware, and you have enough as many carbon emissions in a year as most American families could produce in decades, even lifetimes. Yet the Biden administration now apparently wants to make these working-class Americans suffer, as a penance for Joe Biden’s “sins”—the carbon pollution of his luxury lifestyle.

Biden Didn’t ‘Pay His Fair Share,’ Either

That gets into the question of “fairness,” and “paying your fair share.” His own claims to the contrary, Biden doesn’t know a thing about paying his fair share. As I have previously documented, Biden and his wife Jill created two S-corporations, funneling more than $13.6 million in book and speech earnings through the two corporations to avoid paying nearly $517,000 in Obamacare and Medicare taxes.

At the same time the Bidens were dodging these taxes—for programs Joe Biden claims he supports—they were building up both their carbon footprint and their real estate portfolio, buying the “beach house” and renting the luxury mansion outside Washington.

It’s further evidence that the left views themselves as above reproach and above the law: Charging you higher prices, in the form of new energy taxes, to help clean up their luxurious lifestyles. That’s what we call inequality.

Joe Biden’s Phony Civility Schtick Was Always A Lie,"While campaigning for Democrat Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday, President Joe Biden hinted that Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin and anyone else who wears a fleece vest is an extremist.

Corporate media such as CNN framed it as an “extended riff” as part of the president’s larger goal to compare Youngkin to former President Donald Trump and play up the Jan. 6 riots, but Biden’s inclination toward aggressive insults, name-calling, and making his opponents the butt of his jokes is not isolated.

Shortly after he was dubbed “president-elect” by the corporate media in November 2020, Biden preached “unity” as the driving force of his administration. He repeated “unity” mantras during his Inauguration Day speech as well.

“With unity, we can do great things. Important things. We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome this deadly virus. We can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health care secure for all. We can deliver racial justice,” Biden said.

Biden’s corporate media cronies worked overtime to paint him as a moderate and master of civility who, when elected following meddling from Big Tech, press, and other powerful institutions, would reunite a country torn apart by mean tweets sent by his predecessor. But Biden is far from the endearing Scranton guy with an edge of roughness that others have painted him as.

The president’s track record of abrasiveness and vindictiveness stretches back long before he was ushered into the White House. When Biden lost his first wife and 13-month-old daughter in a tragic car accident that also injured his two sons in 1972, he repeatedly mischaracterized the man who was driving the tractor-trailer truck that hit the Biden family station wagon as it rolled into an intersection as drunk. The chief prosecutor who oversaw the investigation into the crash explicitly stated that Biden’s claims were incorrect, and the daughter of the man driving the truck begged Biden to correct the record. But that didn’t stop the now-president or the corporate media from echoing his falsities.

Biden also has a long recorded history of plagiarism and lies about his grades, scholarships, and class rank.

Biden’s ice cream schticks and media stories about his dogs seem to have deceived some people into believing Biden is merely a man of the people, but his treatment of regular Americans tells a different story. While campaigning in Michigan and talking with the blue-collar workers he claims to represent, Biden said one Detroit factory worker was “full of sh-t” after the man said the Democrat is “actively trying to end our Second Amendment right.”

“Don’t be such a horse’s ass,” Biden said.

The president also had several outbursts on the debate stage while millions of Americans were watching. Biden not only yelled, “Will you shut up, man?” to Trump in September 2020 but often repeated, “Come on, man!” and, “Give me a break” at times of frustration.

Even though the press has treated him more than favorably, Biden has also shown he has no patience for reporters who ask questions he doesn’t like. The president has not only snapped at reporters for pushing him to answer basic questions about his son’s shady overseas business dealings but has also targeted them for asking him questions in general.

While Trump was crucified for being vulgar and spouting off on Twitter, Biden’s short fuse is overlooked by the corporate media who pretend they are blissfully unaware of his decades of nastiness. Biden is far from the moderate he was portrayed as during the 2020 presidential election, and the phony civility schtick that the Democrats and the media played up was always a lie.

The Conservatives Suing Biden Over His 'Unconstitutional' Vax Coercion,"Updated Nov. 4, 2021.

At least 19 states have already begun to legally pursue action against the Biden administration for forcing medical coercion on federal contractors but following the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s new emergency temporary standard demanding employers with 100 or more workers mandate the jab, others are looking to sue too. OSHA’s explicit threat that the rule could eventually extend to smaller businesses in the near future has also pushed politicians, attorneys, and business owners to take legal action.

Here are the conservatives who are suing Biden and his administration for forcing the COVID-19 jab on workers.

Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt

Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt was one of the first Republicans to initiate a lawsuit against the Biden administration’s new COVID shot mandate and testing rules.

“I’ve been in discussions with businesses in Missouri, including a trailer manufacturing company in mid-Missouri, who say that this vaccine mandate will crush their business,” Schmitt said in a statement. “We will be on file first thing [Friday] morning to halt this illegal, unconstitutional attempt by the Biden administration and the federal government to impose their will on thousands of Missouri businesses and millions of Missourians.”

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton took to Twitter on Thursday to declare his opposition to the newest “illegal, unconditional regulation” from the Biden administration and announce a lawsuit against the president and his team.

“Biden just announced his plan to wield OSHA to mandate vaccines on private businesses. And I’m announcing my plan to sue him once this illegal, unconstitutional regulation hits the Federal Register,” the TXAG account announced. “Here comes another winning #Texas v. Biden law suit!”

Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen

Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen announced on Thursday that he would sue the Biden administration over the new OSHA rule because “Forcing these injections on Montanans at the threat of losing their jobs infringes on the rights of our state, individuals, and businesses.”

“If a president can unilaterally force people to submit to a medical procedure they don’t want, then there’s seemingly no limit to the federal government’s control over our lives,” the Republican said in a statement. “President Biden’s illegal mandate is an egregious overreach and sets the country down a dangerous path. … We’ve been preparing for this. I’ll be filing a lawsuit tomorrow to stop this lawless order in its tracks.”

Attorneys General In Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee

Attorneys General in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee all banded together on Thursday to file a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky following OSHA’s release of its new vaccine rule proposal.

“The Constitution lays out critical rules by which the executive branch must operate. Congress and the states have their own powers, which the administration can’t just take over because it wants to,” Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also signaled his state’s intent to pursue the federal government for trying to force Floridians to get the jab.

“The rule is going down,” DeSantis said.

South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem

Noem took to Twitter on Thursday to announce “today, we are joining a lawsuit against the Biden Administration’s unconstitutional vaccine mandates.”

“@JoeBiden, see you in court,” she added.

This morning, the Biden Administration released their guidance through OSHA that affects over 100 million Americans.

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita and Gov. Eric Holcomb

Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb directed his administration to pursue legal action against the Biden administration on Thursday to combat the government’s overreach. Attorney General Todd Rokita has repeatedly pledged for months that he would sue the federal government as soon as the mandates manifested.

“This gross example of federal bureaucratic overreach has nothing to do with whether it’s a good idea to get vaccinated,” Rokita said in September. “But it has everything to do with the Biden administration’s total disrespect for individual liberties and the prerogative of states to govern their own affairs.”

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds promised “immediate legal action” against the new OSHA rule in a press release on Thursday.

“President Biden is taking dangerous and unprecedented steps to insert the federal government even further into our lives while dismissing the ability of Iowans and Americans to make health care decisions for themselves,” she said. “Biden’s plan pits Americans against Americans, while forcing them to choose between making a living or standing up for their personal beliefs. Biden’s actions will only worsen the existing workforce shortages and supply chain issues that hinder our economic recovery.”

Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich

Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich on Thursday announced plans to file a new lawsuit against the Biden administration on Friday morning, following up an initial lawsuit he filed when Biden first signaled the requirements in September.

“When faceless government bureaucrats dictate what you must inject into your body, that’s the furthest thing in the world from a safe workplace. The government doesn’t get to be your nanny, and it’s certainly not your doctor,” Brnovich said in a press release.

The Job Creators Network

The Job Creators Network along with businesses such as the Lawrence Transportation Company, Guy Chemical Company, The Rabine Group, and the Independent Bakers Association filed a lawsuit on Thursday against the Biden administration for its “clearly illegal” shot coercion.

“The Biden Administration’s vaccine mandate is clearly illegal and will have a devastating impact on our small business community and our entire economy. JCN is suing the Administration on the grounds that OSHA does not have the authority to impose such a mandate. Even if OSHA did have the power, there is neither the grave danger nor necessity to issue such a sweeping regulation,” JCN President and CEO Alfredo Ortiz said in a statement.

The JCN first announced its plans to push back on the Biden administration after the president released a press release stating his desire for the new rule in September.

“President Biden’s vaccine mandate on small businesses is unconstitutional and a dramatic overreach of federal authority,” Ortiz said at the time. “To hold the Biden Administration accountable and stand up for small businesses, Job Creators Network plans to file a lawsuit to block the implementation of this order.”

The Daily Wire

Conservative publication The Daily Wire, backed by the Dhillon Law Group, Inc. and Alliance Defending Freedom, also announced it would sue the federal government over the proposed rule.

“The Daily Wire will not comply with President Biden’s tyrannical vaccine mandate, and we are suing the Biden Administration to put a stop to their gross overreach,” said Daily Wire Co-Founder and Co-CEO Jeremy Boreing. “President Biden, the federal government, social media, and the establishment media have conspired to rob Americans of their freedoms in the name of public health. They have broken faith with the American people through conflicting messaging, false information, and by suppressing data and perspectives with which they disagree.”

Biden Can't Keep It Straight On Paying Illegals $450K In Reparations,"The latest prong of the Biden administration’s open borders strategy is its negotiations to give away hundreds of millions of dollars to illegal aliens. The Wall Street Journal reported on October 28 that the administration is negotiating to pay criminal illegal entrants as much as $450,000 per person, and up to almost $1,000,000 per family.

The hopeful recipients were arrested for committing a federal crime: illegal entry into the United States in violation of 8 U.S. Code §1325. When arrested, some were separated from the minors accompanying them, whom they claimed were their children. The administration justifies the proposed payments as legal settlements to compensate the illegal entrants for alleged mental trauma from having been separated from family members.

Such separations, of course, are standard when any parent is arrested and detained for any crime. For example, those imprisoned for trespassing at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 were separated from their children when they were arrested.

There can be little doubt that the prospect of getting almost a million dollars from the U.S. government will further incentivize hundreds of thousands of would-be entrants from all over the world to take a chance on winning this particular lottery. Not only do illegal entrants get to stay in the United States, jumping ahead of hopeful legal immigrants, but they may get a windfall of hundreds of thousands of dollars, in addition to free medical care, free public education, and other gratuitous benefits proposed by the Biden administration.

There is no doubt that even President Joe Biden understands how outrageous this proposal is. His first public comments about it show that, like millions of other Americans, he thought such payments should never even be considered. After those initial disapproving comments, however, Biden and others have tried to change the narrative. In the process, Biden has contradicted himself and made an incoherent mishmash of his policy.

After a press conference at the conclusion of the G-20 meeting in Rome, Fox News’ Peter Doocy asked, “Mr. President, is it true we’re going to give $450,000 to border crossers who are separated?” Biden did not respond, but just rubbed his brow and looked down.

Doocy raised the issue again at a press conference six days later, to which Biden simultaneously blamed Fox News for attracting the flood of migrants and accused it of spreading fake news about the proposed $450,000 payments: “If you guys keep sending that garbage out, yeah.” He then added, “But it’s not true … It will not happen.”

Doocy’s question was not a surprise, and Biden’s response was not just a careless slip of the tongue. Biden had almost a week to consider it after the initial Wall Street Journal report and Doocy’s question in Rome. Biden’s quick and unequivocal denial suggests he shares the widespread outrage at the idea of paying illegal entrants up to a million dollars per family when the only reason they had been separated was that they had broken U.S. law.

But one day later, the administration made clear that Biden was, in fact, “perfectly comfortable” with what he had just said, “will not happen.” In a press conference on November 4, Deputy White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre essentially declared Biden’s one-day-old statement “inoperative.”

“[T]he president is perfectly comfortable with the Department of Justice settling with the individuals and families who are currently in litigation with the United States government,” he said.

At another press conference on November 6, Biden denied saying what he had said three days earlier. When a reporter questioned him about his statement to Doocy that the report about payments was “garbage,” Biden said, “I did not say that.”

Biden then squarely contradicted his prior unequivocal denial that such payments would occur. Waving his finger at the reporter, he added, “If, in fact, because of the outrageous behavior of the last administration, you come in across the border, whether legal or illegal, and you lost your child – You lost your child! He’s gone! – you deserve some kind of compensation, no matter what the circumstances. What that would be, I have no idea.”

This latest Biden statement was both dishonest and incoherent. It was dishonest because his new position that it is up to the DOJ and “I have no idea” what the payments should be cannot be reconciled with his original unambiguous promise that “possibl[e]” payments of “up to” $450 thousand per person “will not happen.”

Biden was further dishonest when he mischaracterized what Doocy had asked. Doocy said only that there had been reports that payments of “up to” that amount might “possibly” be made. Biden’s mischaracterization was a clear effort to try to wiggle out of his earlier unambiguous promise that “it will not happen.”

Biden’s November 6 statement also demonstrates the incoherence of his new thinking about the payments. He said all illegal entrants separated from a child deserve the payments, “no matter what the circumstances.” So, according to Biden, fault and illegal conduct are irrelevant; the facts do not matter. That is an incoherent prescription for unlimited payments without any boundaries.

All of those still in jail because of their alleged illegal entry into the Capitol building on January 6 will no doubt be comforted to know that that the president’s view is that they are entitled to compensation for family separation, “no matter what the circumstances.”

The proposed payments to those who have invaded our country are more evidence that this administration has its priorities wrong. If the DOJ can devote hundreds of FBI agents and U.S. attorneys to the investigations and trials of those charged with crimes in connection with their “illegal entry” into the Capitol on January 6, then surely it can devote the necessary resources to investigate and battle the grab for taxpayer money by those who have been charged with “illegal entry” into the United States.

Biden’s initial reaction shows that he shared the outrage over these payments. His handlers changed his position to serve the politics of his open border policy.

How Biden Is Laying The Foundation For A ‘Great Reset’ Of America,"Despite the corporate press framing Joe Biden as an ideological “moderate,” the president has repeatedly called for dramatic policy changes affecting the U.S. economy, many of which are totally out of step with the views of most Americans.

The most important of these changes stem from Biden’s deep ties to the globalist “Great Reset” campaign, a movement started in mid-2020 by the World Economic Forum to “push the reset button” on society and to “reimagine capitalism.” The Great Reset has received the support of numerous world leaders, including Prince Charles, Al Gore, and the heads of the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and countless multinational corporations and banks.

Although there are several large components to the Great Reset, the three primary ways its supporters plan to change the global economy is through (1) large government programs like the Green New Deal; (2) requirements from national governments that companies adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards; and (3) by coercing corporations and other institutions to willingly adopt ESG metrics using massive amounts of “printed” cash from governments, banks, and investors.

What Is ESG?

ESG is an alternative system for evaluating businesses. Instead of looking solely at revenues, profit, customer satisfaction, debt, the quality of goods and services, and other traditional economic metrics, ESG systems score companies based on how “woke” they are.

For example, a company that uses “too much” plastic, emits “too many” carbon-dioxide emissions, or doesn’t have the “right” ratio of Asian to Hispanic workers—all of which are real examples from ESG frameworks—would be ranked lower than another company whose profits might be smaller and products of a lower quality but who scores better in the metrics that elites value.

There is a good deal of evidence proving that Biden backs the Great Reset. The clearest is that a member of his own cabinet, special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry, openly acknowledged in late 2020 that both he and Biden support the Reset. Kerry also promised that under the Biden administration, the Great Reset “will happen with greater speed and with greater intensity than a lot of people might imagine.”

Since becoming president, the Biden administration has promoted various Great Reset initiatives, including the expansive climate and energy programs proposed as part of the “infrastructure” bills still limping their way through Congress.

Yet the actions taken by the White House that have the greatest potential for truly “resetting” the U.S. economy in the long run are Biden’s decision to nominate several controversial figures for key regulatory roles in his administration. Together, these individuals could ensure the Great Reset occurs, and quickly. Let’s look at them a bit closer.

Saule Omarova

The most radical figure nominated by Biden is Saule Omarova, a Soviet-educated law professor at Cornell University. Biden tapped Omarova to run the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), an important regulatory agency that aims to “ensure that national banks and federal savings associations operate in a safe and sound manner, provide fair access to financial services, treat customers fairly, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.”

Omarova, a strong advocate of centralizing economic decision-making, has called for putting much of the consumer banking industry in the hands of the Federal Reserve. She has also said she supports the creation of a “permanent federal institution” called the National Investment Authority (NIA). The NIA’s mission would be to “devise and implement the coherent national strategy of economic development” for the entire country.

Additionally, Omarova has proposed Congress give the federal government a “golden share,” which she defines as “a wide range of legal arrangements giving the government special, exclusive, and nontransferable corporate-governance rights in privately owned enterprises.”

If Omarova were to be granted control over the OCC, she would be situated perfectly to help the White House push or even mandate ESG standards throughout the country by putting pressure on banks to require ESG scores or other, similar metrics that could be required for a business to receive access to financial services.

Gary Gensler

Biden’s choice to run the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, could prove to be Biden’s most important tool for imposing the Great Reset. Gensler, a former high-ranking member of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, is a huge advocate of ESG scores. As head of the SEC, he has directed the agency to develop mandatory ESG disclosure rules for publicly traded companies in the United States, perhaps by the end of the year.

Exactly what will be in those disclosure rules remains unclear, but numerous reports and statements from Gensler indicate that, at the very least, it will include requirements about climate change.

Rohit Chopra

The OCC and SEC aren’t the only agencies being used by Biden to advance the Great Reset. In September, the Senate confirmed Rohit Chopra as the next head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a powerful regulatory agency that has substantial authority over the banking industry.

Chopra has a reputation for being extremely tough on banks and became well-known on Capitol Hill for his important role in the CFPB during its first years in existence. Far-left wing Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was brought in by the Obama administration before being elected to the Senate to help form the CFPB, initially brought Chopra into the CFPB and remains one of his biggest supporters, recently calling him “a fearless champion for consumers.”

According to Quyen Truong, a former assistant director at the CFPB, Chopra has “a commitment to regulatory activism,” and industry analysts appear to be in total agreement that under his leadership, the CFPB will be considerably more aggressive with banks. This is exactly the sort of person Biden would want running the CFPB if he were serious about using banks to push left-wing causes, a key component of the Great Reset.

Perhaps even more importantly, the CFPB under Chopra has pushed the false narrative that lending practices and credit scoring have been infected with “racist and discriminatory policies” that justify radical changes in the financial industry. Although there are many ways this view could be used to advance Biden’s reset, one of the most sweeping is the Biden’s administration’s plan to reduce racial disparities by mandating “inclusive credit scoring” and creating a “public credit reporting agency.”

The new credit scoring agency would be housed within Chopra’s CFPB and put government in charge of formulating and altering credit scores. It’s not hard to imagine how such a system could be abused and eventually transformed into a government-controlled personal ESG scoring system, one that would provide some groups with financial advantages over others, all in the name of battling climate change or fixing racial disparities.

Reversing the Reset

The Biden administration is building the infrastructure needed to ensure the vision promoted by the supporters of the Great Reset becomes a reality in the United States. And by the time Biden’s first term in office is over, the only way to reverse the damage might be for Congress to tear down some of the most important offices and regulatory bodies now being infected with ESG frameworks and staffed by ESG proponents.

Joe Biden Could Bring Down Gas Prices Tomorrow. He’s Choosing Not To,"President Joe Biden can bring down gas prices tomorrow. He’s choosing not to. It’s all part of the plan.

The official White House line for record-breaking prices at the pump remains fixated on blaming the Organisation of Petroleum-Exporting Countries over its refusal to ramp up output as the administration shuts down domestic production.

“Gas prices relate to a foreign policy initiative,” Biden said during a CNN town hall last month. “And that’s because of supply being withheld by OPEC.”

President Biden says he expects gas prices will stay high until 2022. “I don’t see anything that’s going to happen in the meantime that’s going to significantly reduce gas prices” #BidenTownHall https://t.co/2a7F6JKm0H pic.twitter.com/EOxLdHIgYa — CNN (@CNN) October 22, 2021

On Friday, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm laughed at the idea there was anything the administration could do to bring down the cost of gas, once again placing blame entirely on OPEC.

“What is the Granholm plan to increase oil production in America?” asked Bloomberg host Tom Keene.

“That is hilarious,” she said as she tossed her head back with laughter while Americans cope with gas prices hitting all-time highs compounded by inflation.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm throws her head back and laughs when asked if there was a plan to bring gas prices down. pic.twitter.com/9iA3Tzje8C — NewsBusters (@newsbusters) November 5, 2021

“[I] would that I had the magic wand on this,” Granholm said, pretending that she doesn’t in the form of deregulation. “Oil is a global market. It is controlled by a cartel. That cartel is called OPEC, and they made a decision yesterday that they were not going to increase beyond what they were already planning.”

Not only is the administration’s excuse a cheap cop-out from the crisis it created, it’s an insult to the more than 11 million Americans whose jobs comprise the U.S. oil and gas industry as the White House shops overseas for resources its strangling at home.

Gas prices are up more than 60 percent from a year ago, according to AAA travel agency, after sustaining a painful and consistent increase over Biden’s first 10 months in office. The high cost of gas is sending ripple effects across the entire economy with more expensive transportation meaning more expensive goods, since they’re virtually all shipped at least some distance.

Worse, American heating bills are on pace to soar this winter, with the Energy Information Administration (EIA) projecting in October a majority of U.S. households are estimated to pay 30-50 percent more than last year. Those reliant on propane heating, primarily in rural areas, the northeast and northern plains will be hardest hit, with a 94 percent price spike from last year’s six-month season. Such an increase is likely to amount to hundreds more in heating costs with the poorest households to suffer most.

President Biden is entirely responsible for the nation’s surging power prices, with no end to the rise in sight and no plan to stop it.

“At this time, I don’t have anything new to share,” admitted White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday, after Biden made the same concession in prime time less than a month ago.

The Biden Administration just admitted they have no serious plan to counter high gas prices. pic.twitter.com/btnoq5XSxK — Daniel Turner (@DanielTurnerPTF) November 8, 2021

A plan to bring down prices however, would be counterproductive to the president’s goals of phasing out fossil fuels, a primary centerpiece of his 2020 campaign. Biden could bring down gas prices tomorrow and ward off the looming energy crisis this winter by immediately backing off his war against the industry he’s pledged to destroy.

From day one President Biden has done everything in his power to suppress home oil and gas production leading to the price shocks Americans are coping with today. Biden took an axe to the Keystone XL Pipeline, put pressure on Wall Street to cease investment on new projects, banned drilling in the Arctic, and suspended new oil and gas leases on federal land.

Auctions for new leases are still not rescheduled to take place until spring, only put back on the calendar after a federal judge ruled the leasing ban illegal. The wait has hampered operators in the capital-intensive industry to drill with the availability of new nearby leases on the horizon a prerequisite to responsible investment. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland has even hinted at limits on extraction.

At the same time, Biden gave the green light to a new Russian pipeline into Germany, repeatedly begged OPEC to raise output, and demanded American oil producers lower costs after the administration’s cascade of expensive regulation. It’s not that Biden has no plan to bring down power prices, it’s that Biden is implementing a plan to keep them going higher.

The administration admitted this week another pipeline supplying more than half of Michigan’s propane needs is on the chopping block, even as propane users face the steepest spike in heating prices this winter.

“The Army Corps of Engineers is preparing an environmental impact to look through this,” Jean-Pierre said in a Monday briefing. A new environmental assessment under this administration is often a precursor to project termination.

Last week, Biden threw another wrench at the oil and gas industry with new methane rules unveiled while in Scotland for the global summit on climate change. The new regulations aim to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide by 30 percent before 2030. With economic incentives already in place to capture methane, the industry has cut its emissions 23 percent over the last 30 years even as oil and gas production has increased.

“It’s hard to draw a straight line to any particular regulation to higher prices,” Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Denver-based industry trade group Western Energy Alliance, told The Federalist. “[A] combination of policies meant to constrain oil and gas when taken together will raise prices for consumers… Were [Biden] to actually back off some of this regulation, it would send a really strong signal to producers and Wall Street.”

Higher prices coincide with the environmental left’s strategy to eliminate fossil fuels altogether. Just as taxes on smoking encourages smokers to quit, higher power prices encourage Americans to use less fuel.

Biden nominee to lead a branch of the Treasury Department, Saule Omarova, admitted in a resurfaced video the plan is to make American energy producers “go bankrupt.”

Half Of America Thinks Joe Biden Is In Poor Health,"Americans have harbored concerns about President Joe Biden’s age and cognitive state since before he was even the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, but a new Politico/Morning Consult poll reveals just how much they doubt his aptitude.

According to the poll, only 40 percent of voters agreed that Biden “is in good health,” while 50 percent disagreed with that statement. The 10-point gap is worse than seems because it really represents a 29-point plummet since just over a year ago when that same question from Morning Consult showed voters trusting Biden’s health by a 19-point margin.

Voters are now almost evenly divided on Biden’s cognitive fitness, with 46 percent saying he is mentally fit and 48 percent saying he isn’t. Yet again, this 2-point deficit doesn’t capture the full picture of Americans’ rapidly waning trust. In October 2020, voters believed in Biden’s mental abilities by a 21-point margin, meaning their faith in his mind has plummeted 23 points.

While responses to this question fell largely along party lines, Democrats appeared less confident about backing Biden’s mental agility than Republicans were confident about his impairment. While 76 percent of Republicans strongly disagreed that “Joe Biden is mentally fit,” with 10 percent of GOP voters somewhat disagreeing, only 52 percent of Democrats strongly agreed with the sentiment, with a full 26 percent saying they only somewhat agreed.

The real indication of voters’ waning confidence in Biden, who was the oldest man ever sworn in as president and will be 79 on Saturday, is the swing of independents away from him. Among them, only 18 percent strongly agree that Biden is mentally fit, with 34 percent strongly disagreeing.

As Politico noted, the poll also revealed that “voters didn’t find Biden a clear communicator by 20 points, they didn’t find him energetic by 26 points and they did not find he was a strong leader by 17 points.”

According to a recent poll from The Federalist and Susquehanna Polling and Research out last week, Biden’s overall approval has also slipped to just 36 percent, with one in five registered Democrats saying they did not approve of the job Biden is doing as president and 50 percent of independents saying they did not approve of Biden.

As Biden’s approval rating and poll numbers have dropped, he’s tried to shrug them off, telling reporters at the end of October, “I didn’t run to determine how well I’m going to do in the polls.” But with the Biden administration causing or mishandling crisis after crisis, such as the Afghanistan withdrawal, COVID-19, the southern border, inflation, collusion with the National School Boards Association against parents, the supply-chain disaster, and more, there’s little indication his poll numbers will make a comeback anytime soon.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/11/17/half-of-america-thinks-joe-biden-is-in-poor-health/,2021-11-17
Georgia Governor Releases More Evidence 2020 Ballots Were Miscounted,"Last week, Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp referred data to the State Election Board showing “36 inconsistencies” in the results of a Fulton County audit. This development provides yet the latest example of the chaos controlling the November 2020 election—and the corrupt media’s refusal to care.

With only 11,779 votes out of nearly 5 million votes cast separating Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the final tally in Georgia for the 2020 presidential election, the southern state and specifically Fulton County—the state’s most populous county and the home to the Democrat-heavy city of Atlanta—became a focal point following the November general election. After a recount and audit confirmed Biden carried the state, politicians and the press joined forces proclaiming, “Nothing to see here, move along.”

But there was a lot to see there and elsewhere throughout the country: It was just hidden or, in some cases, destroyed. And while nothing will change the fact that Joe Biden is president, election integrity matters and Kemp’s letter is but the latest proof that it must be shored up in America.

Private Resident Sniffs Out Election Inconsistencies

An analysis of the “2020 Risk-Limiting Audit Report” data revealed “36 inconsistencies,” in the Fulton County audit, Kemp wrote in his November 17, 2021 letter to the members of the Georgia State Election Board. These “inconsistencies” were uncovered, not by an election official, but by a retired corporate executive and resident of the Peach State, Joseph Rossi, the letter explained.

Rossi’s analysis compared the official audit data made public by the secretary of state’s office to images of the underlying ballots provided by the county in response to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s open records request. Further, before referring the matter to the Election Board, the letter explained that Kemp’s “office tested the veracity of his work by independently repeating the research Mr. Rossi conducted on each of his 36 claims,” and that analysis confirmed Rossi’s review.

“The data that exists in public view on the Secretary of State’s website of the [Risk-Limiting Audit] Report does not inspire confidence,” Kemp continued, noting “It is sloppy, inconsistent, and presents questions about what processes were used by Fulton County to arrive at the result.” Kemp then recommended the Election Board review Rossi’s findings, determine what negatively impacted the integrity of the audit report, and review the audit methodology used throughout the state.

Duplicates for 20 Different Groups of Votes

Kemp’s letter, while damning, doesn’t do justice to how troubling the “36 inconsistencies” uncovered are. Those inconsistencies are not conflicts relating to 36 different votes, but to 36 different categories of votes. Among other things, the analysis originally undertaken by Rossi, and then confirmed by Kemp’s office, revealed that the audit report included duplicates for 20 groups of votes.

To illustrate this category of “inconsistencies,” the official Audit Report reported double scans of “batch 40,” which contained two votes for Trump and 95 votes for Biden.

A review of the scanned ballots, however, revealed only one “batch 40,” which included 97 votes for Biden and 2 votes for Trump.

Ten more batches included in the official audit results were misidentified, according to Kemp’s analysis. Again, to illustrate, the audit report identified two different vote totals attributable to “scanner 2/237,” but included different totals for each, indicating one of the batches was misidentified.

Further, the actual results for batch 237 differed from both contained in the audit report.

A third category of error detailed by Rossi and confirmed by Kemp involved the state supposedly cataloging of batches of votes that showed 100 percent of the votes being cast for one candidate. There were four such inconsistencies identified and, with the first of the inconsistencies, multiple batches were involved with batches 19, 20, and 21 all awarding Biden 100 votes and Trump zero.

The governor’s internal count, however, showed that not only did Biden not receive 100 percent of the votes, but that none of these batches had exactly 100 ballots.

The second inconsistencies in this category reported 200 votes for Biden in batch 22, and none for Trump. Kemp’s review, however, showed only 97 ballots contained in batch 22—not 200—and Trump receiving 12 of those.

The third inconsistency identified also involved two batches with each recording 100 votes for Biden and zero for Trump, with the governor’s review showing Trump received 23 to Biden’s 78 in one batch (again, not totally 100) and Trump garnering 40 votes to Biden’s 60 in the second batch.

The final inconsistency in this category also contained two batches, with one favoring Biden and one Trump—but the apparent error in Biden’s favor was reporting 950 votes for our now-president to Trump’s 0, while Biden really only received 92 votes to Trump’s 6, according to the governor’s office.

Conversely, the audit report showed Trump received all 130 votes in Batch 2 from Scanner 5, while the breakdown according to Kemp was Trump 5 to Biden’s 94. The net effect of this disparity totaled more than 600 votes in Biden’s favor—exceeding the 537 votes that handed President G.W. Bush Florida, and in turn the presidency back in 2000.

The final category of errors Kemp’s office identified consisted of apparent misallocation of votes. For instance, the audit report listed Biden as the recipient of 77 votes and third-party candidate Jo Jorgensen receiving 23 votes, when the ballot images showed those 23 votes belonged to Trump.

The audit report for scanner 3, batch 89, also showed the votes misallocated between the candidates, with five votes belonging to Biden recorded for Trump. The governor also noted that a second report of votes for the same scanner and batch appeared to be misidentified.

While spelling out these troubling “inconsistencies” in his two-page letter last week, Kemp also bent a figurative knee to the left, which continues to portray any concern about election integrity as an irrational attempt to challenge the 2020 election. These inconsistencies “are factual in nature, pose no underlying theories outside of the reported data, and could not be explained by my office after a thorough review,” Kemp stressed, to assure the populace he isn’t pushing a Kraken-inspired conspiracy theory.

Nor is he disputing or contesting the outcome of the 2020 election, Kemp added, and rest assured, neither was Rossi, Kemp explained: “Rossi never alleged the outcome of the election was in question or asked me to act beyond my constitutional or statutory powers as Governor.”

By handing the investigation off to the State Election Board, which along with Georgia’s secretary of state holds “the authority to oversee elections in Georgia,” as Kemp highlighted in his letter, Kemp seemingly straddled the third-rail of today’s political discourse: the November 2020 election.

One Thing’s Clear: Fulton County Is Untrustworthy

Republicans may (rightly) view Kemp’s letter as pure political theater, but the details released nonetheless serve the interests of election integrity by focusing public attention to numerous factually based problems with the Fulton County audit—and in turn Georgia, as a whole. And those facts are asserted and verified by the governor’s office, and not self-interested private litigants.

Yet Kemp’s referral and the independent analysis conducted by the governor’s office also bolster the claims made in private litigation, specifically the evidence gathered and expert testimony proffered in one such lawsuit brought by lead plaintiff Garland Favorito, challenging multiple aspects of Fulton County’s handling of the election. Among other things, the plaintiffs in that case presented expert witness testimony from David Sawyer, a certified fraud examiner and former partner at Ernst and Young.

Sawyer, who had also worked with the forensic units at PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst and Young, “testified that he viewed the information provided on the Georgia secretary of state’s website from the risk-limiting audit and compared that data with the scanned ballots provided by Fulton County.” From that analysis, Sawyer testified, “there were 1,539 batches of scanned ballot images produced . . . but only 1,283 batches were counted in the Secretary of State’s risk limited audit.”

Sawyer also testified “that the Secretary of State’s risk limiting audit included combined batches, i.e., batches that contained more than 100 ballots in each batch; sequence breaks in the number of batches that indicated there were missing batches; and batches that were counted twice.” Based on his analysis, there should have been about 1,630 batches of ballots counted, which is 347 more than the secretary of state’s risk-limiting audit reported. “These irregularities indicated a ballot scanning error rate of about 21 percent,” according to Sawyer.

While Sawyer’s testimony was publicly available and, like the analysis Kemp’s office conducted, relied on the official audit results compared to the scanned ballot images, much of the press and public ignore such testimony, viewing the experts as paid partisan hacks—even when the testimony comes from highly credentialed individuals such as Sawyer. Sawyer’s testimony also received little fanfare and, at least until Kemp released his letter, was unlikely to garner much attention because a month ago the lower court tossed the lawsuit in which Sawyer testified, finding the plaintiffs lacked standing, or a legal basis to sue.

Favorito v. Fulton County is currently on appeal. But no matter the outcome of that case, thanks to Kemp, the numerous problems with the Fulton County audit are now clearly within the public eye. Whether the Georgia Election Board or Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger will avert their glances again, however, is another matter.

A request for comment from the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office went unanswered.

"If Trump’s Travel Bans Were Racist, Then So Are Biden’s","Will new restrictions on travel from Africa to the United States protect Americans from the COVID-19 Omicron variant? The jury is still out on that, even as reasonable people may worry more that the chance to continue fearmongering is driving some of the alarmism.

But one thing we know for sure is that the same people who are praising Biden’s decision to restrict travel from areas where the new strain has been detected were singing a very different tune when the same tactic was employed by former President Donald Trump. When asked directly on Monday whether Biden was a hypocrite for criticizing measures that he has now employed, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki responded with what can only be described as a brazen lie.

Psaki claimed Biden “has not been critical of travel restrictions — we have put those in place ourselves.” She said Biden’s claim as a presidential candidate that Trump’s travel ban was racist was merely criticizing a tweet and that Biden was consulting with scientists and Trump was not. These assertions are false.

Biden: Trump’s Travel Ban Is Racist

By restricting travel from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi, President Biden is following in Trump’s footsteps. Trump imposed restrictions on travel from China on Jan. 31, 2020. On that same day, Trump extended previous travel restrictions on countries that were deemed hotbeds of terrorism, in a move Democrats labeled a “Muslim” ban though the measures were not imposed on most nations with Muslim majorities.

Speaking and tweeting the day after Trump’s moves, Biden said that by halting traffic from China as well as Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania (four of which are located in Africa), Trump was diminishing “the U.S. in the eyes of the world by expanding his travel ban.” “This new ‘African Ban’ is designed to make it harder for black and brown people to immigrate to the United States. It’s a disgrace, and we cannot let him succeed,” Biden continued.

In the eyes of Democrats and their faithful corporate media cheering section, Trump’s efforts to halt the spread of the disease were nothing but a function of what they termed the former president’s xenophobia. As Biden campaigned successfully on the claim that Trump’s efforts to halt the spread of the virus were unsuccessful and that he would provide better leadership based on “science,” Biden also derided Trump’s travel bans as an extension of his obsession with building walls and more proof of his alleged racism.

Also Biden: Implements a Travel Ban

But flash forward more than a year and a half later, and it’s now apparent that for all of his talk of science and competence, Biden’s performance in dealing with the pandemic is no more successful than Trump’s. He touts vaccines as the only answer to the disease but never gives credit to his predecessor for developing them in record time, despite the skepticism that he and other Democrats evinced — not only about the chances of success but also about the reliability of any medicine developed under Trump.

Even worse, the number of deaths from COVID-19 in 2021 has now exceeded the total who died from the virus in 2020, when Trump was president. Blaming Biden for those deaths may be as unfair as his own specious claims that the death toll in 2020 should be laid directly at Trump’s feet. But it’s equally obvious that, judging Biden’s policies on both travel and vaccine mandates by the same standards he applied to Trump, the current president would be guilty of not only incompetence but also racism.

Biden apologists, like those at The Washington Post, claim that Biden’s criticisms of Trump’s travel bans were more about the tone of his rhetoric than anything else, though even that paper’s “fact-checker” admits the evidence for that defense is, at best, shaky.

But if Trump’s efforts to check terrorism and the spread of COVID-19 disproportionately affected Muslims and later Africans, the same can be said of Biden’s effort that targets only Africans. Clearly, the Africans think so. But leftist publishing and broadcast outlets that routinely labeled Trump’s policy as inherently racist no longer feel that way. Apparently, they have suddenly discovered that the same policies are kosher when applied by a Democrat administration.

Democrats’ Vaxx Mandates Discriminate Against Black People Too

We’ve already seen that the vaccine mandates embraced by Biden and various Democrat-run states and cities have also produced results that show, by any reasonable definition, a disparate impact on black Americans. You don’t need to construct a theoretical scenario to understand that when, as in New York City, the non-vaccinated are banned from all restaurants, theaters, and arenas, this will mean the enactment of a new Jim Crow that affects blacks more than whites. The same is true with those who face being fired from their jobs because of the federal government’s efforts to create both private and public sector vaccine mandates.

It’s possible that Biden, like other world leaders, is overreacting to the new variant. After 21 months of government overreach on COVID-19 precautions, skepticism is warranted. But we do know the attacks on Trump over these issues were nothing but partisan propaganda and had nothing to do with genuine concerns about discrimination.

At the very least, Biden and his supporters are hypocrites. But their willingness to employ measures that hurt black Americans and other unvaccinated minorities — all the while spewing spurious claims that unvaccinated Republicans and Trump supporters are the reason why the virus is still out there — means that if anyone is guilty of embracing measures that disproportionately hurt black people, it is Biden, not his predecessor.

Diplomatic Boycott Of Olympics Shows Biden Admin's Weakness On China,"The Biden administration announced it will hold a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, meaning U.S. athletes will still attend and compete, but the U.S. government won’t send any officials. The Chinese government vowed to retaliate.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration made the decision due to China’s ongoing human rights violations. Activists and human rights organizations have been calling to boycott the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics since 2015. The Chinese government’s recent forced “disappearance” and “reappearance” of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai has only energized the boycotting Beijing Winter Olympics movement. The Biden administration’s announcement is a welcome step.

But the announcement took place at the same time the administration faced criticism of its lobbying Congress to weaken a bill regarding the forced labor of Uyghurs. Those two contradictory actions raise questions about whether the administration is committed to standing up to China and upholding universal values such as human rights.

Last year, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, aiming to “ensure that goods tainted with the forced labor of Uyghurs, and others, in the Xinjiang” do not enter the U.S. market. In July, the U.S. Senate passed its version of a similar bill co-sponsored by Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. But House Democrats stalled the bill until it passed Wednesday 428-1, as the Biden administration asked Democrats to slow and water down the bill.

Resistance from Biden Administration

Two key players led the Biden administration’s lobbying efforts. One is the administration’s climate czar John Kerry, who reportedly lobbied against the bill out of the fear it would dissuade Beijing’s cooperation on climate change. Sens. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., criticized Kerry on social media.

Another key player is Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. According to the Washington Post’s Josh Rogin, “Sherman’s specific criticism relates to a part of the bill that would require a presumption that all products coming from Xinjiang are tainted by forced labor unless the importer can prove otherwise.” Big corporations such as Apple have been lobbying against the same provision since last year. It is not a coincidence that the Biden administration and big corporations’ interests are aligned.

Frustrated by House Democrats’ inaction, Rubio reintroduced the Uyghur forced labor bill as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate Democrats used a procedural excuse to block the vote on Rubio’s amendment. Rubio tweeted, “The Biden Administration is actively working to stop the passage of an anti-slavery bill targeting # China’s genocide. That is why they don’t want my amendment on this to get on the defense bill.”

Why did the Biden administration act as if the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) atrocities against Uyghur Muslims is reason to hold a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics, but not to support a bill that will prevent goods tainted with forced Uyghur laborers’ blood, sweat, and tears from entering the U.S. market?

Administration’s Ambivalence

Since day one, the Biden administration’s China policy has been full of contradictions like these. On the one hand, it continued some of former President Donald Trump’s tough approaches on China, including expanding the Trump-era blacklist of Chinese companies that Americans companies should not invest in.

The Biden administration also deepened the U.S. partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom by establishing the AUKUS. This alliance will begin with helping Australia develop nuclear-powered submarines as a counterweight to China’s naval expansion in the Asia Pacific.

On the other hand, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced plans to bring American executives to China and further deepen Sino-U.S. economic ties as if everything is fine. The Biden administration also repeatedly capitulated to the CCP’s hostage diplomacy.

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) set free China telecom giant Huawei’s senior executive Meng Wanzhou, although Meng admitted she was guilty of some of DOJ’s charges. In return, China released two Canadian hostages it had detained since 2018.

Days before president Biden and Chinese leader Xi Xinping’s virtual summit, the Biden administration sent back to China seven Chinese nationals who were found guilty and served prison terms in the United States. In return, China permitted one U.S. citizen it illegally detained and never formally charged to return to the United States.

During Biden and Xi’s highly anticipated virtual summit, Biden didn’t even bring up important topics such as how the CCP has obstructed an international investigation of the origins of Covid-19.

The Biden administration’s messages on Taiwan are especially confusing. During a CNN town hall, President Biden said that the United States was committed to defending Taiwan if it came under attack from China. The next day the White House clarified that the president wasn’t announcing any policy on Taiwan. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, warned: “Words are important, and we can’t be careless in how we talk about an issue that is so vital to U.S. interests and the security of the Indo-Pacific.”

Ramifications of Incoherent Policy

It seems that after being on the job for almost a year, the Biden administration still doesn’t have a coherent China policy. The mixed signals the administration sent are problematic for three reasons.

First, they do not inspire confidence in the American people that the administration has the competency to protect them and American interests. Consequently, people may not want to lend the administration the popular support it needs to make difficult choices when confronting China.

Second, when the United States needs its allies to establish a united front to stand up to China and uphold universal values, few will follow the U.S. lead because of a lack of confidence that the Biden administration has the political will to see it through.

Third, the CCP may take the Biden administration’s mixed signals as a sign of weakness and be encouraged to take risky actions, such as invading Taiwan sooner rather than later. China’s invasion of Taiwan will not only threaten regional peace but also jeopardize the survival of the liberal democratic world order.

The great power struggle between the United States and China is the most consequential event in our lifetime. Ambiguity in policies and mixed signals could lead to disastrous consequences. The Biden administration needs to show clarity, commitment, and coherence in its China policy.

"Why Did The IRS Audit Donald Trump, But Not Joe Biden?","Is Lois Lerner in charge of determining which politicians to audit at the IRS?

That’s a relevant question from a recent Washington Post article looking into Joe Biden’s taxes. The Post received confirmation that the Internal Revenue Service declined to audit Biden’s returns from the years before he became president. But separate reporting confirmed that the IRS did audit Donald Trump’s returns from the years before he became president.

This raises an obvious question: Why the disparity?

This important question comes as Democrats want to give the IRS $80 billion in new funding over a decade, along with new enforcement authority—including to obtain additional information about ordinary Americans’ bank accounts. It also applies to a government agency that, thanks to Lerner, harassed conservative non-profits, and faces unanswered questions about the mysterious leak of tax records to the leftist website ProPublica.

Given these developments, it’s worth asking whether the audit disparity represents another instance of federal bureaucrats politicizing the tax code—and whether such an agency deserves even more funding and power.

‘Fact Checker’ Analysis

The Post column, from its “Fact Checker” Glenn Kessler, came after he said “a reader”—full disclosure: me—asked him to look into whether Biden paid his proverbial “fair share.” I want to give Kessler credit publicly for examining the matter in detail, unlike reporters at Politico and other outlets like the Associated Press and New York Times, whose reporters, when I raised the issue of Biden underpaying his taxes, gave me a polite brush-off.

That said, Kessler dodged a definitive judgment on either of the two separate issues regarding Biden’s taxes. The first is the fact that, from 2017 through 2019, Biden exploited a loophole he now wants to close—because his own Treasury Department says it allows “business owners, particularly those with high incomes, to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.”

As I had previously explained, Biden and his wife Jill funneled their book and speech income through two S-corporations. Because they characterized most of that revenue as corporate profits rather than wages, they avoided payroll taxes (which fund Medicare and Obamacare) on more than $13 million worth of income.

Kessler said, “Whether Biden is being hypocritical or not is in the eye of the beholder.” To which Biden himself might respond, “Come on, man!” If you spent the past four years using a loophole that your own Treasury secretary declined to employ for her speech income, you have absolutely no right to close it for others—and if you try, you have every right and expectation to get called on it.

‘Reasonable Compensation’ Test

The second question involves whether Biden, having used a legal, albeit politically hypocritical, loophole, did so in an illegal manner. That is, did he deliberately underpay his salary (as opposed to end-of-year profits for the corporation) in a way that violated IRS guidelines on “reasonable compensation?”

On this, the experts Kessler interviewed, as well as others, agreed. Biden likely underpaid himself, and by a substantial amount. After all, in 2017 Biden paid himself only $145,333 in salary—a roughly 37 percent drop from his $230,700 salary as vice president the prior year—while reaping more than $10 million in corporate profits at year’s end. The low salary vis-à-vis his amount of profits, particularly when all the income came from his own intellectual work product—as opposed to, say, a factory or restaurant where dozens of other employees contribute to the business—all suggest Biden violated the IRS guidelines.

Yet Kessler says that “whether his tax strategy was especially aggressive or par for the course is also a matter of interpretation.” The thin reed Kessler uses to cling to this position stems less from the fact that Biden’s actions were appropriate, and more from the fact that several experts said the IRS wouldn’t bother to challenge Biden’s questionable conduct. But speeding is still speeding, whether a cop pulls you over for it or not.

Why No Audit?

That gets to the most interesting nugget in Kessler’s piece: “A White House official said the IRS declined to do any audits of the Biden tax returns in 2017, 2018, or 2019.” Presidents are subject to automatic audit only for those returns filed while in office, and Kessler reported the returns from the time he was out of office did not get extra IRS scrutiny.

But a New York Times article last year confirmed the validity of statements Trump had made about his tax returns remaining under audit: “The records that the Times reviewed….match his lawyers’ statement during the 2016 campaign that audits of [Trump’s] returns for 2009 and subsequent years remained open.”

So why did Trump’s returns get subjected to what the Times called “a decade-long battle with the Internal Revenue Service,” while Biden’s returns got a free pass from the IRS, notwithstanding the articles and public scrutiny of Biden’s conduct? Does the IRS (as it claims) lack the resources to investigate items like the Biden controversy, or is something more nefarious or explicitly political afoot?

Subpoenas Ahead?

Of course, there’s one way to find out. If House Democrats want to investigate the way the IRS administers presidential tax returns—the stated claim behind their subpoena for Trump’s taxes—then they can request documents from the IRS regarding how it handled Biden’s returns for 2017, 2018, and 2019. For instance, they can study whether the public articles about Biden’s use of this loophole prompted any re-assessment of his returns by IRS staff, or should have.

Then again, given the way House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Massachusetts, ignored questions about Biden’s taxes when the issue first emerged two years ago, he and his colleagues might want to keep their focus solely on Trump. But a Democratic majority focused on Trump’s taxes to the exclusion of Biden’s might give Trump added grounds to challenge and quash the subpoenas in court as a political fishing expedition.

Of course, another possible scenario looms: If Republicans take control of the House next year, they can use any legal precedents set in the case of Trump’s taxes to investigate Biden’s. In other words, Democrats should be careful what they wish for on subpoenaing information regarding presidential tax returns, because they just might get it.

16 Of Biden’s Biggest Whoppers About COVID-19 Vaccines,"Image Credit The White House/Flickr

It should be no surprise that President Joe Biden and his administration lied their way through the last year in the White House. As a matter of fact, The Federalist rigorously recorded more than 100 whoppers Biden and his team gladly fed the public and the corporate media. Of those dozens of lies, more than 15 of them had to do with the COVID-19 vaccine. Here are the president’s top 16 lies about the jab.

1. Biden Falsely Claimed ‘All’ Media Smeared Vaccine Plan as ‘Impossible’

Biden kicked off his time in office defending his administration’s goal to vaccinate 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in the White House after a reporter questioned whether the target was too modest.

“When I announced it, you all said it wasn’t possible. C’mon. Gimme a break, man,” Biden snapped.

A few rare articles at major publications cast skepticism on Biden’s plan, but the Democrat’s claim that “all” media had been overwhelmingly pessimistic of the Biden administration reaching the 100 million mark by the end of April proved to be false. The truth is that he was showered with praises from the press and favorable coverage from the beginning.

2. Biden’s Team Told CNN Trump Offered No Plan for Vaccine Distribution

Sources within the Biden administration told CNN they inherited no vaccine distribution plan from the previous White House.

“There is nothing for us to rework. We are going to have to build everything from scratch,” one source reportedly told CNN’s MJ Lee.

There was, however, actually an explicit plan outlined in Trump’s Operation Warp Speed.

The Biden team’s statements were also contradicted by Dr. Anthony Fauci the same afternoon.

“We’re certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution,” Fauci told reporters.

3. Biden Team: Trump Vaccination Plan ‘Worse Than We Could Have Imagined’

After Biden staffers lied, telling CNN there was “nothing for us to rework” in terms of a vaccination distribution plan, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki admitted at the podium during a Jan. 25 briefing that there was a plan — the Biden administration just wouldn’t give proper credit. Psaki told reporters that the plan from the Trump White House was “much worse than we could have imagined.”

.@PressSec says the coronavirus vaccine distribution plan inherited from the Trump White House is ""much worse than we could have imagined."" — Anders Hagstrom (@Hagstrom_Anders) January 25, 2021

The plan inherited by the Biden White House, however, had already put the new administration on a trajectory to reach its goal of getting 100 million people vaccinated within its first 100 days.

4. Biden Said He ‘Misspoke’ When Claiming U.S. Would Reach Only 100 Million Vaccines in 100 Days

Biden said during a Jan. 25 press conference that he “misspoke” when claiming the United States would reach only 100 million coronavirus vaccine shots given out within the administration’s first 100 days, a pace that had already been reached by the Trump administration. Biden then emphasized a hope of reaching 150 million instead.

The White House COVID-19 Response Team tweeted two days later, however, that the Biden administration’s goal of 100 million doses in 100 days hadn’t changed.

The President set an ambitious goal of administering 100 million shots in our first 100 days. To get there, we’ve got to average about a million shots per day. Just one week in, our trajectory is good and we are well on our way to hitting that goal. pic.twitter.com/wnifMdoU8e — White House COVID-19 Response Team (@WHCOVIDResponse) January 27, 2021

5. Kamala Harris Repeated Bogus Claim of White House Starting ‘From Scratch’ on Vaccines

Just a few weeks into the new administration, Vice President Kamala Harris joined in the administration’s lies when she repeated the bogus claim that the Biden administration had been forced to start “from scratch” to handle the coronavirus vaccine rollout.

“We’re starting from scratch,” Harris said, “on something that’s been raging for almost an entire year.”

Even Fauci rejected the assertion made by White House officials in January, as the Trump administration had already reached the 1 million-shots-a-day threshold that Biden has attempted to claim credit for.

6. Biden Claimed COVID Vaccine Wasn’t Around When He Assumed Office

During a CNN town hall on Feb. 16, Biden falsely claimed that the United States did not have a COVID-19 vaccine when he transitioned into the White House in late January.

Against faulty predictions from journalists, so-called experts, and verified Twitter users who cast doubt on Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, the first round of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the United States to health care workers in mid-December following the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use and mass distribution approval. The FDA also applied emergency authorization to the Moderna vaccine in mid-December, approving it for widespread distribution and use long before Biden joined the White House.

Biden received both doses of the Pfizer COVID vaccine before he was inaugurated.

7. Biden Lied Again About Not Inheriting a Vaccine Plan

During his visit to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing plant in mid-February, Biden once again falsely claimed that his administration did not inherit a vaccine plan from Trump.

“Just over four weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country,” Biden said. “My predecessors — as my mother would say, God love ’em — failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office.”

8. Biden Said Goal of 100 Million Vaccine Shots in 100 Days Was Tough for Him to Meet

In a prime time address on March 11, Biden claimed his administration’s initial goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days was difficult to meet.

“When I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was kind of way over the top,” Biden said. “I said I intended to get 100 million shots in people’s arms with my first 100 days in office.”

Again, that vaccination pace had already been met by his White House predecessor. About 1.3 million Americans were vaccinated by Biden’s first full day in office.

9. Biden Overreported Number of Vaxxed American 65 and Older

In his address on March 11, Biden lied about when the COVID-19 vaccine first became available in the United States. He also misspoke about the number of Americans 65 and older who had received the vaccine.

“When I took office 50 days ago, only 8 percent of Americans — after months — only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination,” Biden said. “Today that number is 65 percent.”

The vaccine, however, was not available for months before Biden took office. The first COVID-19 vaccine dose in the United States was administered on Dec. 14, just one month before the new president transitioned into the White House. Biden also lied that 65 percent of Americans 65 years old and above had been vaccinated. As of the time of his address, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that actually 62.4 percent of those 65 and older had received at least one round of the vaccine, not 65 percent.

10. Biden Claimed You Can’t Get COVID if You’re Vaccinated

During a presidential town hall hosted by CNN’s Don Lemon on July 21, Biden claimed you cannot contract COVID-19 if you’ve been fully vaccinated against the respiratory virus.

“We don’t talk enough to you about this, I don’t think,” he said. “One last thing that’s really important is, we’re not in the position where we think that any virus, including the delta virus, which is much more transmissible and more deadly in terms of unvaccinated people, the — the various shots that people are getting now cover that. You’re OK. You’re not going to — you’re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.”

BIDEN: ""You're not gonna get COVID if you have these vaccinations.""



FAUCI: ""Infections after vaccination are expected.""



Both of them can't be right. Who is getting ""flagged"" for ""misinformation?"" pic.twitter.com/LypqsQ14AT — Young Americans for Liberty (@YALiberty) July 22, 2021

According to the president’s own CDC, however, this statement is patently false.

“COVID-19 vaccines are effective,” the CDC website stated. “However, a small percentage of people who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus that causes it. These are called ‘vaccine breakthrough cases.’ This means that while people who have been vaccinated are much less likely to get sick, it will still happen in some cases. It’s also possible that some fully vaccinated people might have infections, but not have symptoms (asymptomatic infections). Experts continue to study how common these cases are.”

Other anecdotes have also shown Biden’s claim to be false. After flying to Washington, D.C., to protest an election integrity bill, at least six Texas Democrats tested positive for COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated. Moreover, staffers in the White House and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office tested positive despite full vaccination status.

11. Biden Admin Mandated COVID Vaccines for Medical Employees Despite Pledging Not To

Biden’s Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough announced on July 26 that he would mandate COVID-19 vaccines for health care employees working in Veteran Affairs. According to the press release, “each employee will have eight weeks to be fully vaccinated” before risking termination.

In March, the White House pledged to leave vaccine passports to the “private sector.”

“We expect … that a determination or development of a vaccine passport or whatever you want to call it will be driven by the private sector,” Psaki said. “Ours will more be focused on guidelines that can be used as a basis. There are a couple key principles that we are working from: One is that there will be no centralized, universal federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential; second, we want to encourage an open marketplace with a variety of private sector companies and nonprofit coalitions developing solutions; and third, we want to drive the market toward meeting public interest goals.”

12. Biden Said There Are More Vaccinated People in the U.S. Than the American Population

Biden falsely claimed that 350 million Americans were vaccinated despite the fact that there are approximately 330 million people in the United States.

“We have roughly 350 million people vaccinated in the United States and billions around the world,” Biden confidently stated.

Moments later, he checked his notes before doubling down on the lie again.

“Well over — what’s the number again? I remind myself, 350 million Americans have already been vaccinated,” he repeated.

13. Biden Blamed COVID-19 Case Spike on Unvaccinated

Biden blamed a COVID-19 spike in September on people who haven’t received their doses of the shot.

“This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” Biden said in a speech, also tweeting that “people are dying and will die from COVID-19 who don’t have to.”

The pandemic of the unvaccinated is a tragedy that is preventable. People are dying and will die from COVID-19 who don't have to.



If you haven't gotten vaccinated, do it now. It could save your life and the lives of those you love. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 8, 2021

“If you haven’t gotten vaccinated, do it now. It could save your life and the lives of those you love,” he wrote.

By making this claim, Biden not only overlooked the fact that vaccinated people are still catching “breakthrough cases” of the virus, but he also ignored the role natural immunity plays in possibly preventing or limiting COVID reinfection.

14. Biden Said COVID Vaccine Prevents Virus Spread (Again)

The president falsely claimed in a speech justifying vaccine mandates that getting the COVID-19 vaccine prevents the spread of the virus from one person to another.

“We’re making sure health care workers are vaccinated because if you seek care at a health care facility, you should have the certainty that the people providing that care are protected from COVID and cannot spread it to you,” Biden said.

Biden’s claim is not only contradicted by the CDC, which admits that the COVID jab doesn’t prevent infection, but it is also contradicted by the countless number of breakthrough cases appearing throughout the United States, wherein vaccinated people still contract the virus and can give it to their neighbors, friends, family, and coworkers.

15. Biden Pledged There Would Be No Vaccine Mandates

Biden pledged in December 2020 he would pursue no such thing as a vaccine mandate for the Wuhan coronavirus.

“I don’t think it should be mandatory,” Biden said. “I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory.”

In office, however, Biden has been aggressive in pursuing coronavirus vaccine mandates, signing multiple for federal employees and private employers with 100 or more people on staff, which were quickly and temporarily shut down by federal courts.

16. Biden Again Implied Vaxxed People Can’t Spread COVID (They Can)

Biden still believes that people who have had the COVID shot can’t spread the virus.

“Everybody talks about freedom and not to have a shot, or have a test. Well, guess what, how about patriotism? How about making sure that you’re vaccinated so you do not spread the disease to anybody else? What about that? What’s the big deal?” Biden asked.

"12 Times Joe Biden Made Up Stories, Lied, Or Said Something Crazy","President Joe Biden has a long list of slip-ups in his political history, and his first year in the White House was no exception. In addition to bumbling through national addresses and mixing up the titles of world leaders, Biden infamously misremembered his past, lied, and even made up several stories to score points with his audience. Here are just a few of such incidents.

1. Joe Biden’s Made-Up Amtrak Story

At a 50th-anniversary event for Amtrak in Philadelphia, Biden said that when he was vice president, a train conductor congratulated him for traveling 1.5 million miles on Amtrak. A Fox News report out on May 5, however, pokes holes in the president’s account.

“When I became vice president, one of the Capitol Hill newspapers estimated that I had taken more than 7,000 round trips on Amtrak over my career,” Biden said. “I think that’s an exaggeration. I’m going to rely on those two conductors. … One of them was a guy named Angelo Negri.”

Biden continued, telling the audience Negri estimated Biden had traveled 1.5 million miles on Amtrak trains around his fourth or fifth year as vice president, which would have been in 2013 or 2014.

“My mom was sick, and I used to try to come home almost every weekend as vice president to see her,” Biden said. “I got on the train and Angelo Negri came up and he goes, ‘Joey, baby,’ and he grabbed my cheek like he always did. … He said, ‘Joey, what’s the big deal? One-point-three million miles on Air Force Two? Do you know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?’ I said, ‘No, Angie, I don’t know.’ He gave me the calculation and he said ‘You traveled 1.5 million miles on Amtrak.;”

As Fox News pointed out, however, an obituary for Negri says the conductor retired in 1993, decades before Biden’s supposed story took place, while he was still a senator from Delaware. Biden’s mother died in 2010.

2. Falsely Claimed U.S. Government Experimented On Tuskegee Airmen

While speaking at a North Carolina event on COVID-19 vaccination efforts, Biden falsely claimed that vaccine hesitancy among black Americans stemmed from past experimentation by the U.S. government on the Tuskegee Airmen.

“The reason why it’s been harder to get African Americans, initially, to get vaccinated because they are used to being experimented on — the Tuskegee Airmen and others,” Biden said.

BIDEN: ""It's awful hard as well to get Latinx vaccinated… Why? They're worried they'll be vaccinated and deported."" pic.twitter.com/gt2mcuAGB2 — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) June 24, 2021

The Tuskegee Airmen were the first group of African-American fighter pilots who served in the Army Air Corps throughout World War II. The Airmen were not connected to the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, wherein more than 600 black men were experimented on by the U.S. government to “observe the progression of a number of diseases, particularly syphilis, untreated in black males.” Biden also made the same false claim in May 2021 during an interview with YouTuber Jackie Aina.

3. Claimed He Was All-Star Player At Baseball Game Where He Went 0-2

Biden told a story about how he hit a ball 358 feet at his second congressional baseball game while hosting the Los Angeles Dodgers at the White House on July 2. The only problem: Biden, a freshman senator from Delaware at the time in 1974, went 0-2 at the game.

“Biden was decked out in Phillies home pinstripes last night as he went 0-for-2 (groundout, strikeout) in the Democrats’ 7-3 loss to the Republicans in the national annual congressional baseball game at Memorial Stadium,” read local coverage of the event.

4. Biden Said He Was A Professor After the Obama Administration, But He Never Taught a Class

Biden claimed he was a professor in between his time as Obama’s vice president and his current tenure in the White House.

While Biden was named an honorary professor and led the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, the Democrat never taught a class during those four years.

5. Confused Biden Said He ‘Used to Drive an 18-Wheeler’

During a visit to the Mack Truck facility in Pennsylvania, Biden claimed he “used to drive an 18-wheeler.”

“I got to,” Biden said.

While newspaper records indicate Biden rode in a cargo truck for hundreds of miles to “observe truckers’ woes,” there is no evidence that he ever operated a truck himself.

There is zero evidence that Biden ""used to drive an 18 wheeler"" The extent of Biden's trucking experience is that he **rode in** a truck once, for one night in 1973 (he made sure to return home by plane though) https://t.co/p9sPMU20W3 pic.twitter.com/A7tmkoOSHB — Zach Parkinson (@AZachParkinson) July 28, 2021

6. Falsely Claimed He Visited Pittsburgh Synagogue After 2018 Mass Murder Speaking before a group of Jewish leaders, Biden claimed he visited the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh following the 2018 antisemitic attack on the worship site that left 11 people dead. “I remember spending time at the, you know, uh, going to, uh, the, you know, the Tree of Life synagogue, speaking with them,” he said. Here’s Joe Biden talking about visiting Tree of Life synagogue after the massacre there. The executive director of the synagogue says Biden is lying — he never visited. Totally normal. pic.twitter.com/GcFjU2u50i — Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) September 2, 2021 The president’s claim was quickly deemed false, however, with Tree of Life Executive Director Barb Feige saying Biden never visited the synagogue following the horrific 2018 attack. “Barb Feige, executive director of the Tree of Life, said that Biden did not visit the synagogue in the nearly three years since the anti-Semitic attack,” the New York Post reported. “In a phone interview, Feige, executive director since July 2019, said firmly that ‘no,’ Biden didn’t visit, even before taking office when he had a lower public profile as a former vice president and then-Democratic presidential candidate.” 7. Biden Repeated False Claim That He Used to Drive A Tractor-Trailer While touting the passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in Minnesota, Biden repeated the debunked claim that he previously drove a tractor-trailer. “I used to drive a tractor-trailer,” the president said during an event at Dakota County Technical College. Joe Biden—who has been a politician for 48 years—repeats the lie that he “used to drive a tractor trailer.” pic.twitter.com/VAehetHba7 — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) November 30, 2021 The statement from Biden is one of several instances of the president falsely claiming that he drove such a vehicle. While speaking at an event in Pennsylvania over the summer, the president proclaimed he had previously driven “an 18-wheeler.” When pressed by Fox News for evidence of such an instance occurring, a White House official pointed to a “December 1973 article from the Wilmington Evening Journal that showed Biden rode in an 18-wheeler on a 536-mile haul to Ohio.”

8. Biden Made Up Story About 1967 Visit To Israel

At the Dec. 1 White House menorah lighting in celebration of Hanukkah, Biden made up a story about a 1967 visit to Israel during the Six-Day War.

“I have known every — every prime minister well since Golda Meir, including Golda Meir,” Biden said in the East Room. “And during the Six-Day War, I had an opportunity to — she invited me to come over because I was going to be the liaison between, she and the Egyptians about the Suez, and so on and so forth.”

Yet Meir was not elected prime minister until 1969, two years after the Six-Day War. The Israeli prime minister in 1967 was Levi Eshkol, who served between 1963-1969.

9. Biden Couldn’t Remember His Secretary of Defense

Biden appeared to forget who his secretary of defense was during a White House event promoting two female generals on International Women’s Day, March 8.

“I want to thank the former general. I keep calling him general, but my… the guy who runs that outfit over there,” Biden said.

10. Joe Biden Confused Titles Of World Leaders

Biden confused the titles of South Korean President Moon Jae-in on May 21, 2021, a day after the U.S. president referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “President Netanyahu.”

Biden called the South Korean president “prime minister” while presenting a Medal of Honor to a 94-year-old Korean War veteran.

“The people in the Republic of Korea haven’t forgotten, as evidenced by the fact that the prime minister of Korea is here for this ceremony,” Biden said, according to the New York Post.

Biden confused Netanyahu’s title the day before in remarks celebrating the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

11. Biden Mistakes Libya For Syria At G7 Summit

Biden mixed up Syria for Libya three times at the G7 Summit in England during June 13 remarks on Russian aggression in the Middle East.

“In Libya, we should be opening up the passes to be able to go through and provide, provide food assistance and economic assist— I mean, vital assistance to a population that’s in real trouble,” Biden said, going on to charge Russia with violations of international norms in Syria, and then again wrongly referencing Libya.

“As long as they’re there without the ability to bring about some order in the region, you can’t do that very well without providing for the basic economic needs of people,” Biden said. “So I’m hopeful that we can find an accommodation where we can save the lives of people in, for example, in Libya.”

12. Biden Gets Corrected At G7 Summit After Insisting On Introduction Of South Africa President

Biden was corrected by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the G7 Summit in England on June 13 when Biden interrupted the host leader to demand he introduce the president of South Africa, who had just been introduced.

“And the president of South Africa,” Biden cut into Johnson’s roundtable remarks.

“And the president of South Africa, as I said earlier on,” Johnson dismissed.

“Oh, you did,” a frail Biden said at the table while others laughed.

“I did, I certainly did,” Johnson finished.

14 Times Biden Straight-Up Lied About His Border Crisis,"President Joe Biden lied about a lot this year, but his deceptions about the crisis on the U.S. southern border just might take the cake.

While Americans saw footage of thousands of migrants pouring across the border with little to no vetting, Biden and his team repeatedly denied that there was ever a problem. Not only did the White House frantically drown out the truth about the border with lies — including that officials were expelling migrants under Title 42, even though federal authorities released thousands of illegal aliens into the U.S. — but the president also prompted corporate media outlets such as Politico to admit that “Everyone’s mad at Biden over migration.”

Here are 14 of Biden’s biggest border crisis falsehoods.

1. Biden Said Administration Was Not Opening New Migrant Centers

Biden falsely claimed during a February interview with Univision that the new administration is merely reopening migrant camps that were operated during the Trump administration even as his White House created new ones.

“They opened up one, one that was a former one used in the administration, in the last administration,” Biden said. “Our hope and expectation is that won’t stay open very long and that we’ll be able to provide for every kid who comes across the border safely.”

https://twitter.com/BonillaJL/status/1365450210227458051?s=20

Border agents opened a new facility in Donna, Texas, three weeks prior to Biden’s interview, according to the Washington Post, while also creating new camps in Del Rio, Texas, and Arizona.

2. Biden and White House Repeatedly Denied Border Crisis as Crossings Surged

Biden denied that there is a crisis at the border after departing a White House briefing in early March evaluating how to provide more than 20,000 beds for the largest projected influx of unaccompanied migrant children crossing the border.

“We’ll be able to handle it,” Biden told reporters as he was escorted out of the room by his vice president.

When asked if there’s a border crisis, Biden says “no”https://t.co/1r8KjY5OKR pic.twitter.com/itA90NEAyo — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) March 2, 2021

3. Biden Claimed Migrants Not Flooding the Border Because of Him

During his first press conference, Biden claimed illegal aliens were crossing the border, not because of his rhetoric and open border policies, but because migrants’ chances of “dying on the way because of the heat in the desert” are lower in January, February, and March and because of the instability in their home countries.

“I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I’m a nice guy. … The truth of the matter is, nothing has changed. … That’s not the reason they’re coming. The reason they are coming is that it’s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one,” Biden said. “Number two, they’re coming because of the circumstances in [their] country.”

Biden believes surge in migrants is due to conditions in their countries & weather that's better for traveling not because he's seen as a ""nice guy"" who's lax on the border

""Does anyone suggest there was a 31% increase under Trump bc he was a nice guy?""https://t.co/eOGI4nbPU4 pic.twitter.com/d7ZAj2sgSI — KPIX 5 (@KPIXtv) March 25, 2021

While Biden seemed convinced that people were flooding the border as part of a normal immigration cycle, Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador recently said it is the new president’s migration policies and rhetoric that sparked hopeful “expectations” and created the border crisis.

“Expectations were created that with the government of President Biden, there would be a better treatment of migrants. And this has caused Central American migrants, and also from our country, wanting to cross the border, thinking that it is easier to do so,” López Obrador said, just weeks after he told reporters that many of those crossing the border illegally view Biden as “the migrant president.”

Some illegal aliens who crossed the border also testified that Biden was the deciding factor for why they chose to come to the U.S.

“So did you come here because Joe Biden was elected president?” ABC’s Martha Raddatz pressed.

“Basically. Basically,” one migrant father replied. “The main thing was the violence in our country. And the second thing, I think, was Joe Biden.”

4. Biden Said Majority of Migrant Families that Cross Border Are Sent Back

Biden said in his first press conference 64 days after his inauguration that a majority of the migrant families crossing the border illegally are sent back.

“If you take a look at the number of people are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back,” Biden said at the White House. “We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming.”

According to Customs and Border Protection data, however, a fraction of the 20,000 family units apprehended at that time had been sent back.

Further, Michelle Hackman, who covers immigration for The Wall Street Journal, reported on March 23 that an internal document she reviewed with her colleagues found that the weekend prior to Biden’s press conference, “only about 10 percent of families were being expelled.”

An internal document we saw over the weekend showed only about 10% of families were being expelled https://t.co/PrmRzEPLZw — Michelle Hackman (@MHackman) March 23, 2021

5. Biden Claimed His Administration Has Control of the Border Crisis

In an interview with NBC’s Craig Melvin on “Today,” Biden falsely claimed his administration successfully reigned in the southern border crisis.

“It’s way down now, we’ve now gotten control,” Biden said.

“Is what's happening at the southern border, is it a crisis?” –@craigmelvin “It is getting urgent action now.” -President Biden pic.twitter.com/NJL44nL5DY — TODAY (@TODAYshow) April 30, 2021

While Biden was promising that the White House and other federal agencies were taking urgent action, a record-breaking 18,870 unaccompanied teens and children were being packed into overcrowded shelters plagued by COVID-19 spread and “dangerous” conditions for longer than the 72-hour limit permitted by federal law.

In fact, southwest border arrests have exceeded 100,000 every month since February, which hasn’t happened since CBP began tracking monthly arrests in 2000. Some months exceeded 200,000.

6. Biden Also Said Trump Admin Didn’t Adequately Plan for Border Crisis

Instead of facing the fact that U.S. Customs and Border Protection took more than 172,000 illegal aliens into custody in March, making it the busiest month for the agency in more than 20 years, Biden blamed the previous administration for not preparing for the influx exacerbated by Democrat rhetoric.

“For example, we have — they didn’t plan for, which it comes every year, this flow, whether it is 22,000 or 10,000, they didn’t have the beds that were available. They didn’t plan for the overflow,” Biden said during his interview with NBC News. “They didn’t plan for the Department of Health and Human Services to have places to take the kids from the Border Patrol and put them in beds where there was security and there were that people who could take care of them. So, there is a significant change right now, a significant change in the circumstance for children coming to and at the border.”

As noted by former Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan, “This is an outrageous claim.”

“In November 2020, CBP under the Trump administration had fewer than 800 unaccompanied alien children, family units, and single adults in custody. In March of this year, that number had exploded to more than 10,000. Even though apprehensions started increasing in 2020, as growing numbers of illegal migrants gambled on a potential Biden election victory and subsequent amnesty, the Trump administration had strong policies in place to quickly and responsibly process and deport most of these individuals. This meant there was no systemic issue with backlogs or overcrowded CBP or HHS facilities,” Morgan said.

7. Biden Asserted the Border Was Under Control

Despite his belief that Trump created the border crisis, Biden falsely claimed it was “getting urgent action now.”

“For example, a month ago, we had thousands of young kids in custody in places they shouldn’t be, and controlled by the Border Patrol. We have now cut that down dramatically,” Biden said in an interview with NBC News.

As noted by The Heritage Foundation, even if the “number of unaccompanied minors in Customs and Border Protection custody has decreased, the numbers are clear: most of those minors are simply being transferred from one government agency to another — in this CBP custody to the Department of Health and Human Services.”

8. Biden Blamed Trump for the Border Crisis (Again)

During his interview with NBC News, Biden claimed that the “one god-awful mess at the border” was created by the Trump administration.

“Hey, look, here’s what happened – the failure to have a real transition. The two departments that didn’t give us access to virtually anything were the immigration [department] and the Defense Department. So, we didn’t find out they had fired a whole lot of people, that they were understaffed considerably,” Biden said.

This statement, former Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said, is false.

“At the Department of Homeland Security, we provided the transition team with more than 200 extensive briefings on homeland security issues, the majority of which dealt with the border, immigration policy, and the processes and procedures we had in place to secure the border and reduce asylum fraud. … During the transition, the incoming Biden administration was made fully aware of the consequences of undoing the effective policies that had fixed the previous crisis and driven illegal crossings down substantially,” he said.

9. White House Said Trump Admin Spurred Border Crisis

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Trump created “an immigration system rooted in destructive and chaotic policies” that spurred the border crisis.

“Our administration immediately jumped into action to address the influx of migrants at the border, something that began during and was exacerbated by the Trump administration,” Psaki said.

.@PressSec says that the influx of immigrants at the southern border is ""something that began during and was something that was exacerbated by the Trump administration."" pic.twitter.com/iacLlRwxVg — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) May 4, 2021

While migrant apprehensions did begin increasing in fall 2020 as many anticipated a Biden victory, border crossings surged during the first few months of Biden’s presidency. Not only did U.S. Customs and Border Protection take more than 172,000 illegal aliens into custody in March, but data also shows that increases between February and March forced CBP to stretch its chart to accommodate the largest numbers it has seen in at least two decades. It had to stretch the chart’s Y-axis again in August to account for the more than 213,000 migrant encounters in July.

10. Border Lead Kamala Harris Falsely Claimed It Was ‘Always the Plan’ to Visit Border

During her trip to the border in El Paso, Texas, after delaying a visit for more than 90 days, Vice President Kamala Harris claimed it was “always the plan” to address the effects as well as the “root causes” of Biden’s border crisis.

“I said back in March that I was gonna come to the border, so this is not a new plan,” Biden’s border lead told reporters.

Despite her claims, Harris was not always set on visiting the border. Not only did her own spokesman say in March that there were no plans for the VP to make a trip to the border in the “near future,” but Harris also laughed off or became defensive when reporters asked her any questions about whether she planned to address the influx of illegal aliens and poor conditions in detention centers for migrant children.

Harris also repeated the lie that it’s not her “first trip” to the border during this administration. The last times the vice president visited the border were before she was elected in October when she campaigned in McAllen, Texas, and in 2018 when, as a senator, Harris protested the Trump administration’s immigration policies in San Diego.

11. Biden Said Border Patrol Whipped Migrants. They Didn’t.

Biden deepened his administration’s lies that mounted Border Patrol agents used “whips” against Haitian migrants at the southern U.S. border by claiming that “people were being strapped” and run over by horses.

“It was horrible to see. To see people treated like they did? Horses running them over? People being strapped? It’s outrageous,” Biden claimed.

The president repeated the administration’s promise to conduct an investigation into the incident, which started after footage and photos on social media went viral, and said that the people involved “will pay.” The White House already announced that Border Patrol in Del Rio would no longer use horses.

“I’ve never seen them whip anyone,” Paul Ratje told KTSM. “He was swinging it, but it can be misconstrued when you’re looking at the picture.”

Mayorkas previously said that despite viral claims amplified by the White House, Democrats, and the corporate media, Border Patrol agents were not whipping Haitian migrants who illegally crossed the border into the United States. One day later, Mayorkas changed his tune and told CNN viewers, “[I was] horrified by what I saw.”

“One cannot weaponize a horse to aggressively attack a child. That is unacceptable. That is not what our policies and our training require. … Let me be quite clear: That is not acceptable,” Mayorkas claimed. “Any mistreatment or abuse of a migrant is unacceptable, is against Border Control policy, training, and our department’s values.”

12. Biden Claimed He Had No Time to Visit the Southern Border

During his CNN town hall on Oct. 21, Biden claimed he has no time to visit the southern border.

“I’ve been there before,” Biden said, echoing an excuse Harris often used before she was pressured into a quick trip. “And I haven’t — I mean, I know it well. I guess I should go down. But the — but the whole point of it is: I haven’t had a whole hell of a lot of time to get down. I’ve been spending time going around looking at the $900 billion worth of damage done by — by hurricanes and floods and — and weather, and traveling around the world.”

Biden also used his wife, First Lady Jill Biden, and her visits to “both sides of the river,” the Rio Grande, as an excuse for his lack of presence.

Despite Biden’s claims that he’s too busy with other important matters to deal with the unraveling border crisis in person, the president had taken multiple vacations and had been flying back to his home in Delaware nearly every weekend where he escaped the scrutiny of visitor logs and pressing White House responsibilities.

13. Biden Said His Administration Isn’t Paying Illegal Immigrants

During a press conference on Nov. 3, Biden denied reports that his administration was planning to provide payouts to illegal immigrants separated at the southern border.

“If you guys keep sending that garbage out? Yeah, but it’s not true,” he said. “That’s not gonna happen.”

The president’s claim, however, was refuted the following day by White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who told reporters that Biden is “perfectly comfortable with the Department of Justice settling with the individuals and families who are currently in litigation with the U.S. government.”

Moreover, the American Civil Liberties Union also contradicted Biden’s claim, with Executive Director Anthony D. Romero telling Fox News that the plan is actively under consideration.

“President Biden may not have been fully briefed about the actions of his very own Justice Department as it carefully deliberated and considered the crimes committed against thousands of families separated from their children as an intentional governmental policy,” Romero said. “We respectfully remind President Biden that he called these actions ‘criminal’ in a debate with then-President Trump and campaigned on remedying and rectifying the lawlessness of the Trump administration. We call on President Biden to right the wrongs of this national tragedy.”

14. Biden Walked Back Claims About ‘Garbage’ Report Detailing Illegal Alien Payouts

Biden walked back claims about a Wall Street Journal report detailing hundreds of thousands of dollars in payouts to illegal aliens and said that he supported a compensation policy.

“If, in fact, because of the outrageous behavior of the last administration, you were coming across the border, whether it was legal or illegal, and you lost your child. You lost your child, [your child] is gone, you deserve some kind of compensation! No matter what the circumstances,” Biden said. “What that will be, I have no idea.”

Biden previously claimed the WSJ report was “garbage” and denied that the “administration is planning to pay illegal immigrants who are separated from their families at the border up to $450,000 each, possibly a million dollars per family.” One day later, Jean-Pierre claimed that the president is “perfectly comfortable with the Department of Justice settling with the individuals and families who are currently in litigation with the U.S. government.”

Biden refused to answer further questions about potential DOJ settlements.

Democrats Prepare To Dump Joe Biden Now He’s Served His Purpose,"When The New York Times begins publishing op-eds saying Joe Biden should not run again, and that he should announce it soon, then the gig is officially up. Biden is a lame duck. Perhaps someone should tell him.

Columnist Bret Stephens is right to note that the president would be 86 years old at the time of the next election cycle, and that he now “seems … uneven. Often cogent, but sometimes alarmingly incoherent.” More simply, Joe is old and tottering—and he’s unpopular to a startling degree.

As Stephens notes, even passage of a multi-trillion-dollar “infrastructure” spending bill didn’t boost his numbers much. He suggests the president liberate his party by freeing new (and younger) candidates to begin exploring a path to the presidency.

Sure, the question of Joe’s future “need(s) to be discussed candidly, not just whispered constantly.” At the same time, can we also ask the other obvious question candidly?

Why did the media cover for an elderly septuagenarian with clear age-related issues, thrusting him into a job he was never truly capable of holding—and subjecting the nation to a dangerous period without a strong leader? It’s fine to have a mea culpa moment, and truth delivered late is better than truth denied forever, but as the nation stumbles along with a puppet president there should be some accountability.

Just a year after a record 81 million Americans voted for Biden, they’re now being told it didn’t work out. Sorry. It’s coming within the timeframe of the traditional presidential “honeymoon,” that brief period presidents are normally at their zenith of political power and brimming to pass a bold agenda.

Perhaps we should give the public some adjustment time to avoid whiplash from this quick pivot. After all, it wasn’t long ago that the Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin was telling them Biden was completely fit for duty, someone who “with his aviator sunglasses (plus his promotion of exercise during the Obama administration), projects vitality and energy.”

Just more than a month before the election last year, a Forbes article claimed Trump and Biden might be “super agers” who would be expected to significantly outlive other men their age. Trump’s activity on the campaign trail perhaps warranted that description, but Biden not so much. He spent more days underground than Punxsutawney Phil and showed frequent difficulty with coherency on the campaign trail, from trying to describe COVID losses “for the past hundred years” to quoting “you know, the thing.”

Days after Biden’s election victory last year, Matt Viser of the Washington Post tweeted that “Joe Biden would often jog onto stage, showing how physically vigorous he is and attempting to dispel questions about his age. Now that he’s the oldest president-elect in American history, that doesn’t change.”

Has it changed now, Matt?

The truth is that establishment Democrats wanted Joe, and they selected him, despite his age and numerous warning signs regarding his mental acuity. He was the blank canvas on which anything could be written, and he could be sold as a “moderate.”

As Bernie Sanders surged in the polls in early 2020 with 45 delegates after the first three primaries and Joe languished in a distant third place with 15, the party took control. Rep. Jim Clyburn stepped in and delivered an influential endorsement in South Carolina that pushed African-American support to Biden’s campaign, propelling him to victory. Stories immediately appeared claiming Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, and Pete Buttigieg had “no realistic path to the nomination.”

Despite trailing early in fundraising behind the well-organized Sanders fundraising machine, the Democrat establishment pivoted to push donations to Biden. As the NYT admitted in an article at the time, “The elite world of billionaires and multimillionaires has remained a critical cog in the Biden money machine.” Bernie’s small-dollar donors were no match for the large bundles of corporate and PAC cash.

With a lot of help from a sycophantic media, Biden was elected president of the United States, without serious inquiry regarding his physical and mental abilities. Now, suddenly, it’s time to plan Joe’s exit before the new Oval Office carpet has fully settled in place?

We should note that it wasn’t Joe stumbling up the stairs of Air Force One that troubled Democrats into questioning Joe’s fitness. They didn’t question his stability when he at times spoke gibberish. They didn’t seem worried when his physical exam failed to report on his cognitive ability.

No, his collapse in the polls is why Joe is suddenly being challenged on the question of running again, and despite Chuck Todd’s protestations, it can’t be blamed on Trump.

It turns out that the public is a bit smarter than Democrats guessed. Reading prepared speeches from a teleprompter is not a substitute for leadership. Neither is putting one’s head down on the presidential podium like a child in the face of tough questions about a military failure in Afghanistan. The blame game can only get a president so far.

After voters finish expressing ire at the press for being misled about Biden’s abilities, perhaps they will turn and express sympathy for the old man who so desperately wanted the job. Having run twice before, the party eventually picked him, but not before the gas had run out of his tank.

Joe may have always been a politician, but the man behind the podium now is not the same as the one who ran in 2008, and certainly not the man who ran in 1988. Stripped of his dignity, he has become a caricature of a president, adorned with all of the symbols of the office, but lacking the substance necessary to perform.

Every Trump voter can still name his key issues: closing the border, beating China, restoring American jobs, making America energy independent, and above all, to “Make America Great Again.” Less than a year into his presidency, it’s hard to recall Biden standing strongly for anything in particular, having served more as an official signer of policy goals for leftist special interest groups than for his own agenda.

The truth is that even as his campaign wobbled toward the finish line last year, they were still struggling to coin a definitive slogan. That few can remember the eventual decision speaks to the vacuousness of this man and this presidency.

Joe is in the process of sinking not only himself but also his party in the upcoming midterms and possibly the 2024 election, so the door to retirement is being planned. Perhaps Democrats will at least give him the courtesy of a final national address, a chance to read from the presidential teleprompter one final time. At the end, he can sign off blissfully with, “Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America … end of message.”

"As His Presidency Founders, Biden Scapegoats The Unvaccinated","A few days after the 2020 presidential election, President-elect Joe Biden pledged to be “a president who seeks not to divide but to unify,” a theme he’d campaigned on. “Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end here and now,” he said in his victory speech. “It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again.”

So much for all that. As Biden’s first year in office comes to a close, he has proven to be one of the most divisive presidents in generations, surpassing even Donald Trump in his vindictiveness and willingness to demonize Americans who disagree with him — even if it means lying about COVID-19.

Consider the events of the past few days. Following a White House briefing last Thursday on the spread of the omicron variant, Biden said, “We are looking at a winter of severe illness and death for the unvaccinated — for themselves, their families, and the hospitals they’ll soon overwhelm.”

The next day, White House COVID response coordinator Jeff Zients repeated this line, saying, “We are intent on not letting omicron disrupt work and school for the vaccinated. You’ve done the right thing, and we will get through this,” he said. “For the unvaccinated, you’re looking at a winter of severe illness and death for yourselves, your families, and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm.”

NOW – White House Covid Response Team declares ""winter of severe illness and death"" for the unvaccinated.pic.twitter.com/lYlbV52jaB — Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) December 17, 2021

So that’s the official administration line: opened schools and businesses for the vaccinated and “severe illness and death” for the unvaccinated, who will overwhelm hospitals with the omicron variant and, by implication, bear responsibility for the pandemic from here on out.

It’s one of the most bizarre and appalling statements from a presidential administration in American history, breathtaking in its dishonest scapegoating and shocking in its callous disregard for the millions of Americans who have decided, for reasons of their own, not to get the Covid shots.

Bullying these people will not persuade them, and neither will lying about the omicron variant. There’s no evidence right now that omicron is going to bring “severe illness and death,” or that it’s even going to cause a surge in hospitalizations. The evidence so far suggests just the opposite.

In South Africa, where omicron first emerged last month, hospitalization rates have fallen by 91 percent amid the current wave. Just 1.7 percent of all Covid patients were admitted to a hospital in the second week of the omicron surge, compared to 19 percent in the same week of the delta surge, according to South African health officials.

What’s more, the omicron variant appears to be milder than earlier strains of Covid-19. “We are really seeing very small increases in the number of deaths,” said Michelle Groome, head of health surveillance for South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases. Others have also noted a decoupling of new Covid cases and deaths in South Africa, whereas in past surges they have been closely aligned.

In South Africa, we’re thankfully seeing a striking decoupling between new Covid cases and ICU admissions and deaths. Whether #Omicron is inherently less virulent, whether this hopeful finding is result of baseline immunity in infected, or a combination of both, is still unclear. pic.twitter.com/xtmCSdpCNc — Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) December 19, 2021

More evidence of this decoupling comes from the United Kingdom, where Covid deaths haven’t surged along with a rising case count from omicron. Indeed, there is no data anywhere to suggest that the omicron variant is anywhere near as deadly as previous strains of the virus, or that it causes more severe illness. The data so far show just the opposite.

I'm noticing a disconnect between cases and deaths. And yet we are supposed to pretend that there is no disconnect to justify the insane panic. pic.twitter.com/1zB4ao1wM3 — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) December 20, 2021

Indeed, if omicron is a more contagious but also a milder strain (as we would expect with a mutating virus in a pandemic), then it makes sense that cases would surge but severe illness and death would not.

Here in the United States, that appears to be what we’re seeing so far: a surge of new cases but a slight decrease in hospitalizations. So instead of freaking out about omicron, prognosticating death and doom for the unvaccinated, maybe it’s time to do what some states, like Florida and Texas, have been doing all along: work to protect the most vulnerable and prevent deaths, ensure hospitals don’t get overwhelmed, and keep schools and businesses open.

In other words, manage the pandemic, which at this point is looking increasingly endemic. (Even The Atlantic has at last come around to this way of thinking — except for science writer Ed Yong, who bizarrely canceled his own birthday party over omicron. Sad!)

Scapegoating The Unvaccinated

So much for Biden’s dishonesty about what a winter surge of the omicron variant will bring to the United States. What about his callousness and contempt for unvaccinated Americas?

It’s hard to imagine a message more calculated to divide the country than what Biden’s White House has put out, essentially diving Americans into an ingroup of vaccinated and an outgroup of unvaccinated, then blaming the entire pandemic on the outgroup — including whatever happens this winter.

The only possible explanation for such messaging is that Biden feels his presidency is in chaos and his legislative agenda has stalled out. If that’s the case, he’s not wrong. Over the weekend, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, announced he won’t support Biden’s Build Back Better legislation, a massive entitlement expansion that would cost some $5 trillion over the next decade. It was the signature piece of Biden’s agenda, and now it’s dead.

On the border, illegal immigration is still surging at historic levels, with the promise of another surge and an ever-deepening crisis this coming spring. Biden has done his best to ignore the crisis, even as a growing number of Americans say they disapprove of his handling of the border.

The economy is struggling, inflation remains high, and Biden’s popularity is sinking to dangerous lows just a year into his presidency. So his last resort, it seems, is to scapegoat the unvaccinated.

Never mind that many of the unvaccinated have already gotten and recovered from Covid, and have foregone the shot because they have natural immunity (a reality that never seems to factor into the Biden administration’s pandemic policies or messaging). Never mind that some people, having seen over the course of nearly two years that Covid is not as dangerous as the media and political elites have made it out to be and that Covid treatment has vastly improved, have assessed their risk and decided not to get the shots.

Never mind any of that. For Biden, blaming the unvaccinated is a way to deflect from the manifest failures of his administration on almost every other important issue.

These are not the actions of a great “unifier,” or even a marginally competent leader. After his inauguration, Biden embraced comparisons to Democratic presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson, who enacted titanic government welfare programs amid great changes in American society.

But more apt comparisons, at this point, would be to inept 19th-century presidents like Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, one-termers whose blundering tenures were marked by chaos, division, and dangerous incompetence.

Records Show Biden Is The Least Accessible President In Modern History,"One of the most infuriating parts of Joe Biden’s presidency—aside from his stupefyingly disastrous policies of open borders, unscientific tyrannical COVID vaccine mandates, energy job-killing executive orders, socialist inflationary spending, and a disgraceful exit from Afghanistan—is the mere fact that he is the least accessible president in modern history.

According to the American Presidency Project, a database compiled at the University of Santa Barbara that tracks presidential interactions with the media, Biden has had the fewest number of solo or joint press conferences of any president since Bill Clinton’s lame-duck year in 2000, a year in which Clinton traveled to 22 different countries, including to India, Pakistan, Egypt, Japan, Germany, Russia, Nigeria, and Vietnam.

The only places Biden seems to travel to are his homes in Wilmington or Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where he’s been at least 25 times (as of October 27) and where he can remain as invisible as possible.

Biden also has the distinction of setting the presidential record for the most number of days (64) without holding a single news conference since taking office. The next highest president on that list is George W. Bush, who waited 33 days before giving his first press conference. Former President Donald Trump held his first press conference just 27 days into his presidency.

Biden is now on record as having held six solo “press conferences,” but even that number is misleading, considering that he almost exclusively calls on pre-selected reporters (who need to be granted access to the East Room by his handlers) and often appears to have the answers to their softball questions written down ahead of time.

As of Nov. 20, Biden had held just nine combined solo or joint press conferences in his first ten months in office, and he still has yet to step foot inside the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, where more reporters would be able to ask him questions. By comparison, Trump held 21 combined solo or joint press conferences in his first year in office, including a whopping 35 solo press conferences in 2020.

While Biden has made a habit of hiding from the White House Press Corps, his handlers have also rarely allowed him to do any interviews. As of December 1, Biden has done just 18 media interviews in the entire year, while Trump had already done 89 during the same point in his presidency. Former Presidents Barack Obama (141), George W. Bush (44), Clinton (53), George H.W. Bush (46), and Ronald Reagan (46) all did significantly more interviews during the same timeframe of their presidency.

When Jen Psaki, Biden’s chief White House propagandist, was recently asked about reneging on her multiple promises that Biden would soon do more interviews, here is how she responded: “I would very much like that to happen. We are always competing with time on the schedule. I’m going to be honest, his schedule has been quite packed. But he would like to do it. We would like to get it on the schedule. So, I don’t have anything to predict or preview for you at this point and time, but hopefully, we will be able to add some local interviews in the next couple of weeks.”

Apparently Biden is much busier than Herbert Hoover, who averaged 67 press conferences during the heart of the Great Depression from 1929-1933, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who found time to average 59 solo press conferences between 1940-1945 in the middle of something called World War II.

Considering that Biden has presided over the worst immigration crisis in U.S. history with more than 2 million foreign citizens set to illegally enter the United States this year, skyrocketing homicides in Democrat-run cities, a Consumer Price Index that is up 6.8 percent in the last year (and at its highest point in 39 years), a supply chain crisis that shows no signs of slowing, and a U.S. Embassy, along with billions of dollars worth of weaponry, that is now in the hands of the Taliban, one would think the American people deserve some answers from their president.

Is it really a surprise that a new NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll has Biden’s approval at just 41 percent, compared to 55 percent who disapprove of performance? The same poll also found that just 29 percent of independents approve of his performance, even though he received support from 54 percent of that crucial demographic in the 2020 election.

Yet even with these abysmal poll numbers, every indication from the White House communications office to the American people heading into the midterms in 2022 is that nothing will change. Biden’s handlers will continue to trot the president out every few days to read scripted remarks from a teleprompter while he adds to his now 76 executive orders before scurrying away from reporters faster than Usain Bolt.

This is what “unity” and “decency” looks like in Joe Biden’s America.

"Taiwan’s Best Hope Of Defense Will Come From Japan, Not The U.S.","U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently said Communist China’s frequent incursions into Taiwan’s air defense zone amount to a “rehearsal” for an eventual invasion of the island. Many China observers are convinced it is only a matter of time before China’s People’s Liberation Army invades Taiwan.

Taiwan is trying to boost its defense. Still, realistically speaking, the difference in military power between mainland China and Taiwan is so enormous that no military experts believe Taiwan can stand a chance against the Chinese military on its own.

Taiwan’s annual military budget is about $13 billion, compared to China’s $252 billion. The Taiwanese military has fewer than 300,000 active personnel with 2.8 million people in reserve, while the PLA has close to 2.2 million active personnel and more than 8 million in reserve. Not to mention that China has built the world’s largest navy, as measured by the number of battleships.

Taiwan needs help with its defense. Unfortunately, it cannot count on the Biden administration, for three reasons.

First, President Joe Biden has no political will to engage in any military confrontation, and his aversion to using force is evident in several recent events. For example, Biden’s insistence on unilateral withdrawal from Afghanistan and ending the U.S. military engagement regardless of the immediate consequences demonstrates he has little appetite for war.

Biden infuriated East European countries by signaling he would host a meeting between Russia and a selected few North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to address Putin’s grievances of NATO expansion. Baltic nations regard such a meeting as Biden’s diplomatic concession to Putin because it would give Putin a chance to sow divisions between Europe and the United States.

Diplomats from Baltic nations made it clear that Russia should not have the power to decide which European country will join NATO. Despite Biden’s harsh rhetoric on Russia, it seems his action is more about appeasement rather than confrontation. How Biden is handling the Russia and Ukraine conflict offers no comfort to Taiwan.

Second, the Biden administration is sending mixed signals to China and Taiwan. The Biden administration has taken measures to address China’s aggressions, including establishing AUKUS, an alliance including Australia and the United Kingdom, to counter China’s naval expansion in the Asia Pacific. Biden also announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, protesting China’s human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims and others.

Yet, at the same time, the Biden administration has gone out of its way not to offend the Chinese Communist Party. President Biden didn’t confront China’s leader Xi Jinping about the origin of COVID-19 during the Biden-Xi summit. When the U.S. State Department issued a “Call to Prevent Genocide” on Dec. 9, it avoided calling out the Chinese Communist Party’s genocide of Uyghur Muslims.

The most bizarre incident happened during Biden’s recent Democracy Summit. White House officials reportedly cut the video feed of a Taiwanese minister during her speech after a map in her presentation showed Taiwan in a different color than China. They were allegedly worried that differentiating Taiwan and China on a map could be seen by Beijing as a U.S. endorsement of Taiwan’s independence. Taiwanese officials are reportedly angry about the White House’s “overreaction” and voiced doubt that U.S. support of Taiwan is not “rock solid.”

It is also concerning that Biden has resisted the call to end the U.S. government’s traditional “strategic ambiguity” approach on Taiwan. “Strategic ambiguity” means the United States won’t explicitly guarantee it will come to the defense of Taiwan should China attack the island. Since the Nixon administration, a succession of U.S. governments has held such an approach to give the U.S. flexibility to deal with Taiwan and Communist China.

But recently, experts argue that “strategic clarity would do much to reassure allies” because “many of whom are confused by Mr. Biden’s muddled rhetoric on Taiwan.” They also point out that as China continues its military buildup and frequent incursions into Taiwan’s air defense zone, a clear commitment to defending Taiwan from Biden may deter China.

So far, Biden has avoided providing strategic clarity on Taiwan. In addition to lacking the political will to engage in military conflicts, some Biden administration officials fear Communist China will not take action against climate change if the U.S. offers military support of Taiwan’s defense.

The third reason Taiwan shouldn’t count on the United States for its defense is that even if the Biden administration wants to aid Taiwan militarily, the current state of the U.S. military is worrisome. The top brass of the U.S. military have gone woke, and they seem to be more interested in winning the domestic cultural war than defeating external threats. The U.S. Navy is under-invested, and the sailors are more up-to-date with their diversity training than their combat readiness.

There are many signs that U.S. military leadership hasn’t taken the military threat from Communist China as seriously as it should. A Pentagon spokesperson declared last month that climate change and China are equally important threats to the United States.

The Pentagon’s recently published Global Posture Review was a disappointment to many because it demonstrates the top brass has no sense of urgency to adjust U.S. military resources and strategies to focus on countering China’s growing military threats. One congressional staffer familiar with the review summarized the Pentagon’s review this way, “No decisions, no changes, no sense of urgency, no creative thinking. Lots of word salad.”

America’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan has shown that U.S. military leaders are distracted and incompetent. Departing without informing allies in advance has also damaged the U.S. credibility and leadership. Suppose China invades Taiwan, and the Biden administration tries to organize an international coalition to respond. How many U.S. allies will want to follow the U.S. lead this time, given their recent experience in Afghanistan?

Despite the Biden administration’s rhetoric, it’s in Taiwan’s best interests not to count on U.S. military assistance if China invades. But Taiwan won’t have to face the PLA alone. Japanese leaders have declared that Japan wouldn’t stand by if China attacked Taiwan. Given the geographical proximity between Taiwan and Japan, Japan regards a Chinese invasion of Taiwan as a direct threat to Japan’s security.

Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe recently warned in a virtual conference that “A Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency.” He also called upon Japan and Taiwan to work together to protect freedom and democracy because “A stronger Taiwan, a thriving Taiwan, and a Taiwan that guarantees freedom and human rights are also in Japan’s interests. Of course, this is also in the interests of the whole world.”

Biden Has Caused More Vaccine Resistance Than Fox News Ever Did,"The Biden blame game went into overdrive on Tuesday afternoon during the president’s omicron update and desperate vaccine push because it’s much easier for Joe Biden to point fingers at Fox News and QAnon followers for vaccine resistance than to take a moment of introspection.

BIDEN: The choice to be unvaccinated ""has been fueled by dangerous misinformation on cable tv… I call on the purveyors of these lies and misinformation to stop it. Stop it now."" pic.twitter.com/gVKxunkrjK — Greg Price (@greg_price11) December 21, 2021

“The unvaccinated are responsible for their own choices, but those choices have been fueled by dangerous misinformation on cable TV and social media,” Biden said.

Let’s make sure we get our terms straight here: By “misinformation,” Biden means anything that hurts him and his friends politically (this would be the same type of “misinformation” his administration pledged to flag for Big Tech overlords to censor). By “social media,” he means any ivermectin and natural immunity posts that escape the watchful eye of his administration and Facebook’s far-left “fact-checkers.” And by “cable TV,” he means Fox News.

“It’s wrong. It’s immoral. I call on the purveyors of these lies and misinformation to stop it. Stop it now,” Biden said in a line that sounded like it was lifted straight out of a Brian Stelter monologue.

To find a root source of vaccine refusal, Biden should stop channel-surfing and look in the mirror. The president, his administration, and his bureaucratic allies have spread way more false information and caused far more vaccine resistance than the talking heads at Fox News ever have.

It started before Biden was even elected, with his now-vice president declaring that she wouldn’t get vaccinated if it were then-President Donald Trump’s recommendation.

The federal government’s credibility on COVID-related decisions only nosedived from there. Biden and federal bureaucrats lied so often to accomplish their goals, it’s hard to keep their many deceptions straight.

Anthony Fauci is an obvious place to start. He first said there was “no reason” to walk around with a mask (with the surgeon general also tweeting “seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!”) before Fauci later admitted that his advice was all a deception to ration personal protective equipment for nurses and doctors. He admitted on a separate occasion that he had arbitrarily bumped up herd immunity threshholds not because of scientific evidence but because he thought he could get away with it.

“When polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine, I was saying herd immunity would take 70 to 75 percent,” Fauci reportedly told The New York Times. “Then, when newer surveys said 60 percent or more would take it, I thought, ‘I can nudge this up a bit,’ so I went to 80, 85.”

And do you remember when Fauci fiercely denied that U.S. taxpayer dollars had been funding gain of function research in Wuhan, only to then admit in May that there was “no way of guaranteeing” how that money was being used? Or when he admitted that masks for vaccinated people are political theater after vehemently denying that very same thing?

Speaking of which, Biden and the Centers for Disease Control are still pleading with Americans to keep covering their faces, so it isn’t just Fauci. This not only cultivates a distrust of so-called health experts, but it also takes away people’s will to get the jab. After all, if otherwise young and healthy people can’t stop masking and social distancing after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, what’s the point?

Based on the Biden administration’s messaging, you can see why folks might not trust that a vaccine will get their lives back to normal. Two years after “two weeks to slow the spread,” the goalposts have shifted so far that getting vaxxed doesn’t mean getting your life back, it means continuing to mask, proving you’re clean to keep your job, and getting in line for booster shots.

Can you blame people for putting off the vaccine when Biden says backward things like, “We are going to protect the vaccinated“? Can you see why they might hesitate after Biden repeated the obvious lie that the vaccinated can’t contract or spread the virus? How about the fearmongering about protecting children when kids up to age 17 have a 99.998 percent chance of survival from coronavirus?

I’d say it’s natural to distrust a man who threated to get you fired if you disagreed with his risk assessment. It’s normal to buck the swamp creatures now telling you what to put into your body after they robbed your children of an education not because of the science but because of special interests.

Perhaps unvaccinated folks would be more likely to heed the warnings of the president and bureaucrats if they acknowledged the science on natural immunity at all. Or if they stopped calling COVID a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” when it’s clearly not. Threatening death and disease for healthy unvaxxed people while patting the vaxxed on the head for doing the “right thing” isn’t the most persuasive tactic.

“You know, these companies and personalities are making money by peddling lies and allowing misinformation,” Biden said on Tuesday in reference to the aforementioned cable TV and social media.

But those who have been paying attention know that “peddling lies” and “misinformation” is a hallmark of this Biden-led COVID regime — and no amount of finger-pointing at Fox News can salvage any of that destroyed credibility.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/12/22/the-biden-administration-has-caused-more-vaccine-resistance-than-fox-news-ever-did/,2021-12-22
"Besides Trump, Biden Is The Most Unpopular President In 80 Years","Image Credit White House Flickr/Photo

After just 12 months in office, President Joe Biden is the most unpopular president the nation has had in 80 years. Overall, only 25 percent of Americans say they are “satisfied” with the Biden presidency, which currently holds a 44 percent approval rating in a new poll from CBS News.

The CBS poll also found that at least half of Americans said Biden’s one-year tenure in the White House has left them “frustrated.” At least 49 percent of those surveyed said they also felt “disappointed” with Biden’s track record, specifically on inflation and Covid-19, while 40 percent claimed they were “nervous” about the future of the country.

“With the exception of former President Donald Trump who clocked in at 40.2 percent approval at this point in his term, according to FiveThirtyEight, Biden’s approval is lower than that of any president at the one-year mark going back to Harry Truman,” Mediaite reported.

One of the major reasons President Biden’s approval is lower than that of any president at the one-year mark going back to Harry Truman, according to a new survey, is the economy.



A whopping 62% of Americans disapprove of Biden’s handling of the economy. https://t.co/cC8zPpSQ0Z — Mediaite (@Mediaite) January 17, 2022

For months, Biden and his team have suffered scathing poll numbers. As early as February 2021, about a month into his presidency, Biden’s disapproval rate shot up to 37 percent while his approval with the American public fell to 57 percent. As the southern border crisis grew worse and Biden’s anti-oil and gas executive orders began to take their toll, Biden’s poll numbers fell even further. After his disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal in August, which resulted in the death of 13 U.S. service members, Biden’s approval was quickly dropping.

“The full poll, which surveyed 800 likely voters on from August 12 through August 18, found that 49 percent of those surveyed approved of the job Biden is doing as president, while 45 percent disapproved,” The Federalist’s Sean Davis noted in August. “However, a sub-sample of 327 likely voters polled between August 16 and August 18 when news of the fall Afghanistan became public found that only 38 percent approved of Biden’s job, while 51 percent of those polled after Afghanistan fell disapproved of Biden’s job so far.”

By September, 50 percent of Americans — fed up with a southern border crisis, inflation, supply chain issues, botched foreign policy, and never-ending Covid-19 lies — said they disapproved of the president and his administration. That number even jumped to 51 percent multiple times in the last quarter of the year.

Vice President Kamala Harris also experienced skyrocketing disapproval as 2021 went on. By November, 51.2 percent of Americans disapproved of Harris’s work as VP. Between her refusal to visit the southern U.S. border, her lack of presence during the Afghanistan crisis, and her inability to give an interview without maniacal laughter, Harris had only gained 28 percent of voters’ approval.

10 Lies Biden Told During His First Press Conference In Months,"President Joe Biden hosted his second solo press conference ever on Wednesday but his attempts to clearly communicate how he plans to fix a country plagued with COVID-19, crime, rising prices, empty shelves, and more were nothing less of a disaster.

Not only did Biden, who was once heralded as the chief unifier of the country, use the presser to repeat rhetoric trashing Republicans, he also did his absolute best to put lipstick on the pig that is the struggling U.S. economy. Unfortunately, no amount of lipstick or whoppers can cover Biden’s terrible and devastating approval rating.

Biden concluded his initial speech by claiming that “the best days of this country are still ahead of us not behind us,” but his optimism is unfounded. Recent polling suggests that only 26 percent of Americans believe the country is headed in the right direction. The majority, however, are left wondering whether Biden will work to fix the myriad of crises he created.

Here are the 10 lies Biden told during his Wednesday press conference.

1. The Nation’s Problem Is COVID

“I know there’s a lot of frustration and fatigue in this country. And we know why: COVID-19, Omicron it has now been challenging us in a way that, it’s the new enemy,” Biden said.

Not only is COVID-19 a virus that’s been around for years now, therefore not making it a “new enemy,” but it’s also not the only thing plaguing voters’ lives or minds. As a matter of fact, while Biden parades around the Capitol encouraging Democrats to abolish the filibuster and legalize illegal voting practices, he’s failing to address the ongoing Southern border crisis, empty shelves, and rising urban crime.

2. Wages Are Up

Early in his speech, Biden claimed that American wages are up. What he failed to address is that real wages have decreased most of the months he’s been in office. Even in months when wages were up, Americans were forced to dig deeper in their pockets to cover their climbing gas, energy, and grocery bills.

That was a lie. Americans have not gotten a raise under Biden's failed leadership.



FACT

3. Biden Created Jobs

Biden tried to circumvent the nation’s economic turmoil by claiming that he created more jobs to stimulate the economy. He ignored, however, the role the government played in creating the recession that caused job loss in the first place. And on the role his own administration played in lining the pockets of Americans with federal cash, Biden was mum.

https://twitter.com/jimmyfailla/status/1483907947294076930?s=20

4. The Supply Chain Crisis Isn’t That Bad

Biden hardly addressed the ongoing supply chain crisis, leading to the often popular #bareshelvesBiden hashtag, and the nation’s rising inflation which continues to plague voters’ lives as they begin considering who to vote for in the 2022 midterms.

The president hinted that the “empty shelves being shown on television” were misleading but even he admitted that they are “a few [percentage] points below what it was before the pandemic.”

5. Inflation Was Already A Thing Before I Took Office

Biden claimed that inflation was increasing long before he assumed office but as recent reports indicate, inflation in the U.S. surged to 7 percent in December 2021, the highest level since 1982.

Biden just FALSELY claimed that inflation has been increasing over the past decade.

6. Republicans Want To Steal Minorities’ Right To Vote

In an effort to promote his campaign to initiate a federal takeover of elections, Biden claimed that Republicans want to take away minorities’ rights to vote.

“No matter how hard they make it for minorities to vote, I think you’re going to see them willing to stand in line and … keep them from being able to vote,” Biden said. “I think you’re gonna see the people they’re trying to keep from being able to show up, showing up and making the sacrifice that needs to make in order to change the law back to what it should be.”

7. Schools Aren’t Closed

“You say we’re not going to go back to closing schools. You said that just moments ago, yet they’re closing in some areas. What do you say to those teachers and principals and parents about school closings?” one reporter asked. “And what can your administration do to help make up for learning loss for students?”

“First of all, I put in perspective the question you asked, very few schools are closing,” Biden claimed. “Over 95 percent are still open.”

Yet, since the rise of Omicron in the U.S., reports of schools closing across the country have also risen leaving working parents desperate for in-person learning once more. Thousands of schools that were scheduled to reopen following Christmas break opted for virtual learning until well into January due to panic over COVID-19 spread.

8. Build Back Better Will Save Americans Money

During the conference, Biden repeated the lie that his Build Back Better legislative package “would actually lower or reduce inflation.”

WOW – Biden repeats the lie that Build Back Better ""would actually lower or reduce inflation.""



This was debunked MONTHS ago, and is based on a misrepresentation of a letter from Nobel Laureates. Good fact-check from the Washington Post. https://t.co/zNwwzTCb7g. — Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) January 19, 2022

This falsehood has been debunked numerous times but that didn’t stop the president from claiming that his legislation, which actually costs trillions of dollars, won’t cost taxpayers a dime.

9. White House Reporters Are The Most Informed Americans Of All Time

Biden told the White House press pool that they are “more informed than any group of people in America.”

Biden calls the press ""more informed than any other group in America"" — Nathaniel Reed (@ReedReports) January 19, 2022

While the statement will probably score him points with openly partisan press pool members, it’s far from the truth.

For more than a year, corporate media reporters who covered Biden’s rise to the presidency and his subsequent time in the White House have overlooked the administration’s failures to laud the Democrat for being a “moral, decent man.” They’ve wasted their precious Q+As with the president on softball questions framed in a positive light, while also failing to ask key ones. They let Biden ramble and frequently fail to point out the obvious lies lacing his winding answers.

10. I Didn’t Compare My Democrat Colleagues To Racists

Biden denied that he compared Democrat filibuster holdouts Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to confederate leaders.

“I did not say that they were going to be George Wallace or Bull Connor,” Biden claimed. “I said we’re gonna have a decision in history.”

""GO BACK AND READ WHAT I SAID!"" Biden yells in response to the (mild) Phil Wegmann beginning to ask a mild question about Biden's comparison of political opponents to racists. Then reiterates the thing that got everyone mad? Holy wow is this weird. — Mollie (@MZHemingway) January 19, 2022

Just last week, however, Biden asked “Do you want to be the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? Do you want to be the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? Do you want to be the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?”

“This is the moment to decide, to defend our elections, to defend our democracy. If you do that you will not be alone,” Biden said.

"The Biggest Botches, Failures, And Mess-Ups Of Biden's First 12 Months","Joe Biden has been in the Oval Office (or that weird set in the Eisenhower building’s South Court auditorium with the greenscreen windows) for a year now, and he’s already managed to make his short presidency known for a long line-up of scandals, botches, and slip-ups.

It’s too hard to narrow the list down to one top failure, although his disgracefully handled Afghanistan withdrawal may be the most sobering and inflation may be the one that played the biggest role in Biden’s tanking approval ratings. Even though Biden’s mess-ups tally up to far more than 12, it’s not hard to remember a Biden-enabled disaster for every month of the septuagenarian’s first year at the stern … or in the basement.

January: Biden’s Radical First Week

On his first day in office, President Joe Biden signed a list of radically left-wing executive orders, including an order requiring that schools must ignore the biological differences between male and female students from the athletic field to the bathroom if they wish to continue receiving federal funding. In Biden’s first week, Press Secretary Jen Psaki also signaled the administration’s plans to reinstate federal funding for abortions around the world with the reversal of the Mexico City policy, and the new president canceled the Keystone XL pipeline.

As Tristan Justice reported at the time, “Biden’s first 48 hours in office have launched the new administration with 17 executive orders, more than were issued in the first month of their presidencies by Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton combined.”

February: Biden’s CDC Worked to Keep Schools Closed

In February, Biden’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced strict reopening guidelines that would keep many schools around the country shut down. “Only K-12 schools in cities and areas with low or moderate virus transmission can fully reopen for in-person learning, as long as physical distancing and mask-wearing is enforced,” Jordan Boyd reported on Feb. 12. “Any transmission rate beyond what is designated as moderate requires hybrid learning or ‘reduced attendance,’ limiting which children are allowed in the classroom at the same time.”

On the same day, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky admitted that far-left teachers unions that have worked to keep students out of school buildings over the course of the Covid pandemic had influence when the CDC created its school reopening guidelines.

March: Working With Corporations to Create Vax Passports

As The Washington Post first reported, the Biden White House spent the month of March plotting with corporations to develop a “vaccine passport” system to force Americans to show their Covid papers in order to participate fully in society. “The passports are expected to be free and available through applications for smartphones, which could display a scannable code similar to an airline boarding pass,” the Post noted.

April: Biden Debuts Radical Social Spending Plan

At the end of April, Biden announced his “American Families Plan,” a list of far-left spending priorities, many of which would become hallmarks of his struggling Build Back Bankrupt agenda. The goals of the proposed $1.8 trillion spending spree included extending government schooling fully into preschool and two years of taxpayer-provided community college.

May: More Unsavory Hunter Exploits Emerge

Scandal follows President Biden’s troubled son Hunter around, as the country learned when the New York Post published damning information recovered from a laptop the younger Biden allegedly left at a repair store in late 2020. But further revelations about Hunter’s exploits emerged in May of last year, adding to the pile of unsavory behavior that may implicate the president himself.

New emails from Hunter Biden’s suspected laptop published on May 26 by the Post show that Joe Biden “met with Ukrainian, Russian and Kazakhstani business associates of his son’s at a dinner in Washington, DC, while he was vice president” in April 2015.

“Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent some time together,” wrote executive Vadym Pozharskyi of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where Hunter sat on the board.

Other emails published by The Daily Mail in May revealed that Hunter Biden bragged he “smoked crack with [former D.C. Mayor] Marion Barry” when he was a student at Georgetown University.

June: Record-Setting Crisis at the Southern Border

Biden’s crisis at the Southern border has been setting records all year, but it was in June that apprehensions surged past 1 million for fiscal year 2021 and border crossings were at the highest levels since 2006. In May alone, “170,000 people were captured, marking a 20-year high,” Gabe Kaminsky reported at the time. June also saw the border state of Texas declare an emergency over Biden’s border crisis, which the president helped cause by reversing Trump-era stances like the “Remain in Mexico” policy.

As the crisis raged, Biden’s border czar Vice President Kamala Harris couldn’t be bothered to visit the actual U.S.-Mexico line, snapping “I haven’t been to Europe” when reporters pressed her on the topic. She finally caved and scheduled a trip, but only after former President Donald Trump announced his plans to visit.

July: Bragging about Working with Big Tech to Silence Dissent

In July, the Biden administration bragged about colluding with Big Tech to shut down perspectives with which the regime disagreed. In a press briefing on July 15, Psaki touted the administration’s policy of “flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation.” A few days later, Psaki admitted there was nothing “off the table” in the effort to smear dissent as “misinformation” and have it removed from social media.

August: Bungled Afghanistan Withdrawal

August saw the largest-scale disaster on Biden’s watch so far, when the administration’s disorganized withdrawal from Afghanistan left 13 American service members dead and thousands of American citizens and allies stranded under Taliban control.

From the administration’s decision to vacate Bagram Air Base before evacuating Americans from the country, to leaving weapons and equipment to fall into the hands of the Taliban, to Biden taking an out-of-touch, hollow victory lap after the service members’ deaths and while Americans remained stranded, to the administration’s ongoing decision to ignore the allies still behind enemy lines, every action taken by the Biden team was a disaster. In the same month, the administration carried out a drone strike targeted at ISIS operatives that actually killed at least 10 civilians, seven of whom were children.

Americans won’t soon forget the harrowing images of desperate people trampling each other in the chaotic race to the Kabul airport, of people clinging to aircraft landing gear and falling helpless from the sky, or of a lone helicopter leaving the roof of the American embassy. There is blood on Biden’s hands, and our allies won’t soon forget it either.

September: Biden Lies to Undermine His Own Border Patrol Agents

After a photo of U.S. Border Patrol agents on horseback was misconstrued by Democrats and their media allies to falsely accuse agents of “whipping” criminals, Biden promised to make his own CBP employees “pay” and the White House banned agents in Del Rio, Texas from using horses going forward.

“It was horrible to see. To see people treated like they did? Horses running them over? People being strapped? It’s outrageous,” Biden claimed, even though the photographer who took the viral photo insisted he’d “never seen them whip anyone.”

October: Biden’s Ed Secretary, DOJ Collude with NSBA to Smear Parents as Domestic Terrorists

On Sept. 29, the National School Boards Association sent a letter to the White House asking Biden to use the FBI and other federal law enforcement to target parents using terrorism laws. A few dayes later on Oct. 4, in response to the letter, Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the FBI and federal attorneys to investigate and address “a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff.”

As it turns out, however, Biden’s own Education Secretary Miguel Cardona appears to have secretly requested the letter from NSBA, presumably to use as a pretense for the administration’s push to target parents unhappy with public schools’ closures, mask mandates, and extremist LGBT and critical race theory curricula.

November: That Tyrannical, Unconstitutional OSHA Vax Mandate

After issuing a September press release threatening a vaccine mandate for private businesses with 100 or more employees, Biden’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) released an emergency temporary standard on Nov. 4 that would require businesses to comply by Jan. 4 or incur fines of up to $14,000 per violation.

The Supreme Court struck this down in January, of course, and the Biden administration knew it was flagrantly unconstitutional all along — but exploiting the delays of the judicial system allowed the administration to bully many corporations into compliance anyway. Never mind the fact that the Biden administration had promised during the campaign that it wouldn’t mandate the Covid vaccine.

December: Supply Chain and Inflation Nightmare

December saw the climax (so far) of Biden’s joint inflation and supply chain crisis, dually caused by the administration’s radical spending and Democrats’ Covid lockdowns. As Americans faced shortages and shipping delays during their Christmas shopping, the Department of Labor released its November figures revealing 6.8 percent year-to-year inflation, or “the largest 12-month increase since the period ending June 1982.”

December’s inflation numbers were even higher, clocking in at 7 percent.

Bonus: January 2022: Compared Filibuster Defenders to George Wallace, Jefferson Davis

In a Jan. 11 speech urging the U.S. Senate to ditch filibuster rules in order to pass his radical and unconstitutional federalization of election laws, President Biden compared his agenda’s critics — which include Democrat Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona — to former Alabama Gov. George Wallace and Confederate leader Jefferson Davis.

“Do you want to be the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? Do you want to be the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? Do you want to be the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?” Biden said. Comparing his critics to notorious segregationists isn’t a good way to start year two of the Biden era.

Who knows what new scandals and embarrassments await the Biden administration in 2022? For the sake of the country, we can hope for fewer than in 2021, but it’s clear the administration has a failed track record only one year in.

What If Trump Had Greenlighted Russia To Invade Ukraine Like Biden Did?,"President Biden was actually operating from a coherent perspective in discussing Russia and Ukraine in Wednesday’s press conference: In every instance, as you go line-for-line in the transcript, his foreign policy—and the fact that he announced it to the world—is one where Russia has leverage over Biden and the president has a personal vendetta against the current Ukrainian government.

When asked whether sanctions would deter Vladimir Putin from attacking Ukraine, our commander in chief replied that Russia “will be held accountable if it invades,” but then clarified: “It depends on what it does. It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera.” Biden then juxtaposed a “minor incursion,” which would lead to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) fight over how to respond, with Russia doing “what they’re capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border.”

In that case, Biden assured the audience—which surely included Putin and his top military leaders—“our allies and partners are ready to impose severe costs and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy.” Biden then proceeded to ramble aloud his internal thoughts on Putin’s thinking before adding, in reference to Ukraine, “My guess is he will move in. He has to do something.”

After the press conference, Biden’s team attempted to walk back his “minor incursion” comment, but it was much too late for that. Putin already noted the greenlight that Biden flashed, not just once, but twice.

The second surrender came when a reporter offered the president a chance to correct himself live, asking, “Are you effectively giving Putin permission to make a small incursion into the country?” Biden laughed, saying, “That’s how it did sound like, didn’t it?”

Significantly, though, Biden did not disavow that understanding, but instead said “the most important thing . . .big nations can’t bluff, number one.” So, to Biden telling Putin we would respond to any invasion, even a minor incursion, would be nothing but a bluff.

Here’s Some Free Intel, Russia

Biden then did the unthinkable—unless you’re in Putin’s pocket, that is: He told our Russian adversary that NATO is split on how to respond to anything “short of a significant invasion.” “There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do depending on what happens — the degree to which they’re able to go,” Biden explained.

Don’t worry, though, Biden seemed to say, because Putin wants some things that we are more than willing to give him. The president then told the world and Russia precisely what we were willing to commit to: no strategic weapons in Ukraine and no NATO membership for Ukraine in the near term.

Biden also made sure to let Putin know what we knew, or suspected, such as that a move from the north, from Belarus, would require Russia “to wait a little bit until the ground is frozen so he can cross.” The president also told his Russian counterpart that we knew they had “people in Ukraine now trying to undermine the solidarity within Ukraine about Russia and to try to promote Russian interest,” making it very important to keep “everyone in NATO on the same page.”

More Presents for Putin

Wednesday’s bowing to Russia, unfortunately was not Biden’s first capitulation.

The Business Insider detailed Biden’s first present to Putin in an article, the title of which presents perfectly the irony laid out below: “Trump was slammed for cozying up to Putin, but Biden handed him a greater gift by waiving sanctions on a gas pipeline that could destabilize Europe.”

That article detailed Biden’s backtracking on the sanctions Trump had imposed against Russia concerning the Nord Stream pipeline that connected Russia to Germany. Congress would later also impose sanctions on the CEO of the company constructing the pipeline, an ally of Putin according to the Business Insider.

While “Secretary of State Antony Blinken promised in March to keep looking for ways to stop” the pipeline, by July the Biden administration agreed to allow the project to go forward, even though Democratic colleagues of the president had also “long opposed the project,” according to the article. Here, the opposition stemmed not merely because “it hands Russia an economic advantage over its European neighbors but because it could cause the US significant foreign-policy problems in the future. Chief among those problems are fears that Nord Stream 2 could liberate Russia to invade Ukraine – a US and EU ally – where Putin annexed Crimea in 2014.”

Because “Russia imports gas through Ukraine,” the article explained, Putin would be hesitant to interfere with its supply route. But with the Nord Stream 2 bypassing Ukraine, “Russia may no longer feel bound by the same caution.”

What On Earth Was Biden Thinking?

After Wednesday’s press conference, the Kremlin likely sees little risk to invading its western neighbor, at least the portions populated by ethnic Russians.

What could possibly possess our commander in chief, the leader of the most powerful country in the free world, to treat Russia and Ukraine as two vying contests on a reality-TV show, with Biden publicly declaring his love for Russia and sending Ukraine packing? And what could possibly cause Biden to change course and reverse the one sanction that seems to stalemate the standoff between Putin and Ukraine?

For four years, Democrats and the leftist press saw an easy answer to President Trump’s every comment related to Russia and Ukraine: kompromat and corruption.

The claim that Russia had leverage over Trump gained traction before his inauguration when a leak to CNN led the network to publish news of what is now known as the Steele dossier. Later published by BuzzFeed, the discredited work of fiction that relied on false “intel” fed to Steele by Russian national Igor Danchenko and that was financed by the Hillary Clinton campaign claimed the Russian government had “kompromat,” or “compromising information,” on Trump.

Russian Collusion Used to Be a Huge Narrative

For years, the anti-Trump contingent used the Steele dossier and its claim that Russia held leverage over the president to fan the flames of a Trump-Russia conspiracy. But the Russia-leverage narrative extended beyond the discredited dossier and continued throughout Trump’s term.

For instance, in a May 2019 article titled, “Donald Trump’s Foreign Policy ‘Is One Where Russia Has Leverage Over Him,’ Former CIA Official Says,” Newsweek discussed a former CIA and defense official’s appearance on MSNBC. Appearing on the cable network’s “Morning Joe,” Jeremy Bash “argued that Trump’s international policies appear to be impacted by Russian ‘leverage over him’” the Newsweek article explained.

“I would say that the president actually is operating from a coherent perspective, in that he totally pushes away intelligence, he doesn’t listen to it, every instance as you go down the line, his foreign policy is one where Russia has leverage over him,” Bash told the MSNBC audience.

Bash, a former CIA official, then identified what he claimed was a series of foreign policy decisions favorable to Russia, including what Bash called Trump’s “decision to denigrate NATO.” Bash also highlighted Trump’s comments about Russia rejoining the G-7 and his supposed “decision to endorse election interference by [Russian President] Vladimir Putin,” to support the case that Putin had Trump in his back pocket.

The Atlantic pushed this same narrative, in its article entitled, “Donald Trump Gave Russia Leverage Over His Presidency.” There, the liberal outlet argued Trump lied when shortly after his inauguration he said, “Russia is a ruse,” and that he had “nothing to do with Russia.”

With these denials, Trump handed Russian intelligence “the ability to unmask Trump as a liar to the American public,” the Atlantic argued, relying on BuzzFeed’s account of the negotiations involving a potential Trump Tower in Moscow. Likewise, “the prospect that the Russians have been in possession of evidence suggesting that the president’s son may have committed a felony,” gave Russia leverage over Trump, according to the article.

Blackmail Is a Powerful International Tool

Susan Hennessey, now a member of the Biden administration’s Department of Justice National Security Division, likewise peddled this theory on a Lawfare podcast, suggesting “the United States is in an incredibly dangerous position where the American president is aware that a hostile foreign adversary potentially has devastating—politically devastating and potentially legally and criminally devastating, if not for him, then for members of his family or organization.”

“Those really are the kinds of conditions where your worst nightmare is about blackmail and influence,” Hennessey added in her discussion of the Kremlin and what it might know about Trump.

While kompromat explained Trump’s handling of Russia, according to his critics, Democrats and their partners in the press claimed corruption governed his interactions with Ukraine. Here, according to the left, Trump used his position as president of the United States to demand the newly elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, launch a supposedly sham investigation into 2016 election interference and the Biden family.

The closely coordinated effort between the anti-Trump deep state, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and the press led to the House impeaching Trump for supposedly “subvert[ing] U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermin[ing] our national security,” to damage his political foe, Joe Biden.

Apply the Trump Narrative to Biden

Using the same lens as the left’s, then, what can possibly explain Joe Biden’s performance Wednesday afternoon? Why would he subvert U.S. foreign policy toward both Ukraine and Russia and America’s relationship with its NATO allies?

It is inexplicable? Or is it? Might Russia have leverage against Joe Biden?

Hunter Biden thought they did, according to a video of the president’s son published by The Daily Mail in August of 2021. The “unearthed footage,” The Daily Mail reported, captured a naked Hunter Biden telling a prostitute that ‘the Russians have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex!’”

As I reported at the time: “The video then captured Hunter telling the prostitute that during the summer of 2018 he had nearly overdosed from drugs while partying in Las Vegas with his drug dealer and two other guys. When he came to later, ‘there was this Russian 35-year-old, really nice, pure brunette,’ Hunter explained. He then discovered his laptop was missing.

‘I think he’s the one that stole my computer,’ Hunter said on the tape, apparently referring to his drug dealer. ‘I think the three of them, the three guys that were like a little group. The dealer and his two guys, I took them everywhere,’ Hunter explained. ‘They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex f-cking, you know,’ Hunter added. ‘My computer, I had taken tons of like, just left like that cam on,’ Hunter continued, ‘and somebody stole it during that period of time.’”

At this point, the prostitute asked Hunter if he feared the Russian thieves would try to “blackmail” him.

“Yeah, in some way yeah,” Hunter responded, adding that his father is “running for president,” and that “I talk about it all the time.”

The risk of blackmail to the president, however, extends much beyond a sex scandal involving Hunter and includes potential text and email messages stored on the stolen laptop that implicate “the Big Guy” in a pay-to-play scandal.

The Dossier Doesn’t Stop There

Not only could this kompromat make Biden beholden to Russia to the disadvantage of Ukraine, the recent charges prosecutors for Ukraine’s Zelenskyy filed against Biden’s pal, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, for treason and supporting terrorism offer a personal motive to explain the president’s actions—at least one as plausible as the one pushed by Democrats against Trump.

Poroshenko served as president of Ukraine from 2014 to 2019, during the time Biden held the office of vice president and then following Trump’s election. In 2014, when then-Vice President Biden was charged with working with Ukraine, his son Hunter became a board member of a Kyiv-based gas company named Burisma. Even though Hunter lacked any experience in the gas sector, he received compensation reportedly upward of $50,000 a month for his services.

The Senate’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee would later release a damning report “detailing a wide array of Hunter Biden’s conflicts of interest, including potentially criminal overseas business activity while his father Joe Biden served as vice president.”

The Senate report also alleged that the owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, “paid a $7 million bribe to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office to close an investigation seven months following Hunter Biden’s addition to its leadership.” Prior to the 2020 election, Trump had claimed that Joe Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor who had targeted Burisma, but Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko denied the accusation.

A leaked telephone call that occurred between then-Vice President Biden and Poroshenko shortly after Trump’s election also tells the story of a bond between the two men. Biden began his conversation informally, “Hey, Petro. It’s Joe. How are you?”

“Very well indeed, as usual, when I hear your voice, my dear friend,” the then-Ukraine president responded.

Biden then proceeded to tell Poroshenko that Trump’s election had surprised everyone and “the incoming administration doesn’t know a great deal about the situation.” He added, as The New York Post put it, that “he had withheld some information regarding Ukraine from his counterparts in the Trump transition team.”

As the call neared an end, Biden noted that after he left the White House, “as a private citizen, I plan on staying deeply engaged in the endeavor that you have begun and we have begun.”

However, Poroshenko would soon also find himself out of office, when in April 2019 Zelenskyy defeated him in the nation’s election.

Thereafter, Trump pushed Zelenskyy to investigate the alleged bribery related to Burisma and any connection to the Biden family. For that Trump was impeached, without the House ever investigating the alleged Burisma corruption underlying the request. Democrats and the press instead sold Trump’s request as purely politically motivated.

Surely, then, they see Biden’s very public sacrifice of Ukraine in the same light: as personal payback for President Zelenskyy’s willingness to do Trump’s bidding, for delving into the Biden dynasty’s affairs, and for targeting his former counterpart, former President Poroshenko. And, surely, they see kompromat behind Biden’s figurative directing of Putin’s troops across the Ukrainian border.

Of course not. Republicans should not see it that way either, because when Joe Biden is involved, nothing should be ascribed to corruption that can be plainly explained by his incompetence.

Root For Biden To Pick The Most Insane Supreme Court Nominee,"With Thursday’s official announcement by Justice Stephen Breyer of his impending retirement, conservatives are strategizing on the best approach to prevent confirmation of a leftist activist justice. Instead, Republicans should be praying that President Biden nominates the looniest, most far-left lawyer possible for a slot on the high court.

Why? Because history has proven that a far-left justice will be no worse than a moderately liberal justice in the casting of Supreme Court votes, meaning there is no downside to a far-left pick, while the upside potential is huge, given that it is Biden appointing the new justice and not a Republican president: Thank you very much, Never Trumpers.

While over the last four decades justices appointed by Republican presidents have demonstrated a penchant to “grow” in office or have proven more moderate or pragmatic than proclaimed during confirmation, the same is not true for Democrat-appointed justices, who vote in near-perfect lockstep over their careers.

Then there are the Republican-appointed justices who do not abandon their judicial philosophy, but conclude that a faithful application of originalism requires them to vote with the leftist wing of the court. Justice Neil Gorsuch provides a perfect example of this phenomenon, providing the fifth vote in several cases in the criminal context, and before him the now-late Justice Anton Scalia.

Conversely, in close or contentious cases, Democrat-appointed justices “represent a block geared toward progressive policy outcomes.” It matters whether these justices are perceived as center-left or hard-left: The desired liberal outcome dictates the decision. So fighting for a less leftist justice serves no purpose.

On the other hand, there are many positives to the conservative cause if Biden nominates a far-left candidate to the Supreme Court. With midterm elections later this year, Biden naming an extremist to the high court positions Republicans perfectly to talk about the importance of elections—and specifically control of the Senate.

The nomination of a far-left candidate will also provide an opportunity during the confirmation process for Republicans to highlight the recent public revelations of the Democratic Party’s true far-left goals. President Biden has already showcased the party’s obsession with identity politics by promising the country his nominee would be a black woman, so men and whites need not apply.

Further, if Republicans maintain decorum and respect during the process, and focus on the nominee’s judicial philosophy and policy, they can score points with a public disgusted by the left’s disgraceful treatment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his family. And the more leftist Biden’s candidate, the more restrained Republicans will appear by comparison.

Moreover, the further left the candidate, the more justified a “no” vote will be for swing-state Republicans, allowing them to vote against the nomination based on principle, and thereby avoid the obstructionist label. Likewise, moderate Republicans or Republican senators in purple or blue states could justify a “yes” vote based on their view that a president is entitled to his nomination.

The more extreme Biden’s candidate, the more this position will inure to Republicans’ benefit when a supposedly far-right candidate finds himself or herself nominated to the Supreme Court by a future Republican president. The same moderate Republicans can point to their vote for Biden’s extremist justice as proof of the consistency of their position that a president is entitled to his nominee, or if they are kicked out of office over their vote for Biden’s nominee, a stronger senator could be in that office. And should Democrat senators en mass vote against a future Republican nominee, the hypocrisy charge will strike more squarely the more extreme Biden’s leftist nominee is.

It is also not just the fight that will benefit the conservative cause: Elevation of a far-left justice to the Supreme Court will advance originalism more than if Biden were to replace Breyer with a milquetoast moderate. That premise may seem counterintuitive because we think of “moderates” in the context of politics and not precedent.

For a Supreme Court decision to be “precedential,” five justices must agree with both the outcome and the analysis. Were Biden to appoint a so-called “moderate,” her vote would tally with the far-left wing of the high court and her reasoning would likely be mainstream enough to, at times, shift Justice John Roberts or Justice Brett Kavanaugh to join with the other two leftist justices to create a majority opinion that binds lower courts.

Conversely, a far-left justice will also vote with Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan but may drag her sister justices too far to the left to entice any so-called moderate justices to join in the decision. Then, either the leftist side will lose or the outcome will favor the leftist position, but the Supreme Court’s decision will be fractured, with several of the justices writing separately, resulting in no binding precedent and only dicta.

Of course, originalism would benefit more from the appointment of an originalist justice, but that is not an option now, as President Biden is our president and Breyer submitted his resignation effective upon confirmation of his successor. So the choice is between Justice Breyer and another liberal justice or a far-left one. Stalling in the hope of obtaining a more palatable liberal will leave us with Justice Breyer and the need to delay an appointment for three years.

Conservatism would be better served by using Biden’s appointment to remind the public that elections have consequences. The more loony left his nominee is, the better that point can be made.

7 Questions GOP Needs To Be Asking About Biden’s Response To Russia,"Before the Biden administration imposes sanctions on Russia, Republicans in Congress and the media should ask some hard-headed questions. In his many years as president, vice president, and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, every single U.S. foreign policy blunder has had Joe Biden’s fingerprints all over it.

Last year’s debacle in Afghanistan showed Biden true to form. And the same team of advisors who oversaw the Afghan fiasco—Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Gen. Mark Milley among them—are issuing dire warnings about Russia. Are you feeling reassured?

There is indeed a strong case that U.S. sanctions could cause severe economic hardship to Russia. But sound strategic thinking includes at least three components: a well-defined objective; the close adaptation of means to that end; and a careful consideration of the unintended but harmful side-effects that may follow. Here are some questions to review whether these criteria are being met in the Biden administration’s policies.

First, what is the objective of the sanctions? Most likely, the purpose of sanctions would be to deter Russia from invading Ukraine or to roll back a Russian invasion if one occurred. But the stakes are extremely high for Russia and for Vladimir Putin: to be seen to yield to U.S. pressure would be a severe blow to the régime’s prestige and might cause Putin to fall. Russia has long premediated an invasion or some lesser (to use Biden’s word) “incursion,” and has prepared for a U.S. blowback. And so far, Putin has not flinched.

But perhaps Biden’s true objective (as many Russians believe) is to bring about régime change in Russia. If so, the Biden administration owes it to the American people and our allies to be much more candid. An attempt to restructure the international order in such a fundamental way could easily lead to a major war. Also, even if we emerged “victorious,” the consequences for all concerned could be catastrophic.

Second, what would be the effects of our sanctions on our friends and allies, including Ukraine? Russia will surely respond to sanctions with counter-measures. Those could inflict a lot of harm on friendly nations. When Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine in 2008, Ukraine’s economy took a 20 percent hit to national production. Does Biden think Ukraine would escape unscathed this time?

Also, what about Germany and other European allies that depend on Russia for natural gas? The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, although not yet opened, has been built to supply Germany’s energy needs with Russian gas. If, as State Department officials are saying, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will be just “a hunk of metal at the bottom of the ocean,” how would Germany obtain its energy?

We can hardly expect Germany to reverse its environmentally driven energy policy and start building nuclear power plants. We cannot construct LNG terminals fast enough to meet Europe’s near-term demands. And even if Russia wanted to sell gas to Germany, how could the Germans pay for it if Biden’s sanctions blocked the payments?

The Biden administration might carve out an exception for those transactions, but that would dilute the force and credibility of its overall policy. Little wonder that Germany, and indeed Ukraine, seem unenthusiastic about the war talk coming out of the Biden administration.

Third, are Americans prepared for Russian retaliation against the United States? There is no reason to think that the United States would be immune to Russian retaliation if our sanctions bit deeply. Since Russian financial institutions would be our primary target, it would be natural for Russia to respond in kind: Putin’s hackers could target our banks, stock exchanges, payment systems, and the like.

Russia could also launch a series of cyberattacks of increasing scope and severity. Are Americans willing to suffer such disruptions of their personal and financial lives?

Furthermore, Russian cyberattacks could provoke the United States to escalate the conflict. Where might such escalation lead? Russia has a modernized and formidable military. It is armed (as we are not) with battlefield nuclear weapons, and appears willing, in an extreme situation, to use them.

Are the American people ready and willing to fight a (potentially nuclear) war against Russia for the sake of a country that is of marginal national security interest to us? It’s unlikely.

Fourth, can the Biden administration count on our allies in Europe and around the world to support our sanctions? What level of enforcement can we expect from them? Our European allies were equivocal in supporting past U.S. sanctions against Iraq and Iran. Would they do better now?

What about our other allies? Russia cannot meet its need for semi-conductors; it has to look to outside sources for that vital commodity. This is a major Russian vulnerability. But can we be sure that South Korea, say, which is a major manufacturer, will not meet that demand, maybe indirectly?

Fifth, wouldn’t sanctions drive Russia and China even closer? The U.S. economic sanctions against Russia in 2014 promoted greater trade between those two nations. Will China stand by and watch Russia be strangled when increasingly the two nations are economic, military, and diplomatic partners? It seems more likely that China would enable Russia to circumvent any sanctions that Biden employs.

Any sensible administration would not want to force Russia into China’s arms. China is our main adversary. Russia, which is certainly not a friend but need not be an enemy, is no such threat. If any foreign nation should be in our cross-hairs for punitive sanctions, it is China, not Russia.

Sixth, won’t crushing economic sanctions hasten the day when powers like China and Russia bring down the global financial architecture that gives the United States such immense leverage? The more often the United States uses sanctions, the more determined our likely targets will be to create alternative global financial systems. Power is best conserved when its exercise is restrained.

Seventh, when have U.S. sanctions ever worked? As international relations scholars have argued, the effectiveness of economic sanctions is highly doubtful. We imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 after its invasion of Crimea: they obviously have not deterred Russia from encroaching again on Ukraine.

U.S.-sponsored sanctions against North Korea have not ended its nuclear program. The United States froze $9 billion in Afghan state assets after the Taliban took power: have those upended the Taliban? The United States maintained sanctions against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq for many years; and against Cuba for even longer. Were these success stories?

Let’s circle back to the start: What is the objective here? The core issue seems to be that Putin wants a promise from the West not to admit Ukraine into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and more generally to accept that Ukraine and Belarus lie within Moscow’s sphere of influence. Biden refuses to make that promise. Is fighting over this issue worth the risks—including, at the extreme end, the risk of war with a nuclear power?

Ukraine is currently not a member of NATO, and we have no treaty obligation to defend it. Moreover, the chance that Ukraine will become a member of NATO anytime soon is very low. It is too corrupt (as the Biden family should well know) and its political institutions too feeble to permit that. So Biden is asking the West, and the American public, to bear the costs and risks of his Russia policy for the sake of a hypothetical question about NATO’s future membership.

Republicans should not go along with this. Let Biden and his accessories in Congress, the media, and the permanent bureaucracy have full ownership of the Ukraine matter. Donald Trump is right: this is a matter for the Europeans to handle.

Republicans should also be searching for explanations of the Biden administration’s overwrought attitudes, including his lurid vision of the sacking of Kiev. Is a desperate Biden, faced with an overwhelming electoral disaster in next November’s midterms, “wagging the dog”?

Are the elites who manage our national security apparatus promoting international conflict, as usual, to advance their careers, burnish their credentials, and ratify their claim to be useful? And is the Democratic Party, obsessed by its irrational hatred and suspicion of Russia, letting its fantasies rip once again?

Sanctions rarely if ever achieve their intended effect. They usually do more harm than good. Republicans should not follow Biden into the abyss of sanctions. Certainly not unless he answers their questions first.

Biden's Failures Set Republicans Up To Win Big In November,"President Joe Biden’s agenda has thus far been a failure. Not only has the president created a myriad of border, economic, overseas, and Covid-19 vaccine mandate crises but he’s also been unsuccessful in jamming radical legislation through the Democrat-controlled Congress.

While Biden’s inability to get things done is unfortunate for Democrats, it’s a big win for Republicans who hope to see a red wave in the 2022 midterms.

As Byron York noted in his newsletter, the “centerpiece” of the Biden agenda, the Build Back Better plan, is dead without support from every Democrat in the Senate. And as the bill stands right now, it never has and it never will garner full endorsement.

“Well, the Build Back Better, as it has been presented over, what, the last seven, eight, nine months — that bill no longer will exist, OK? … My biggest concern, and my biggest opposition — it did not go through the process,” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., long considered a swing vote when it comes to progressive legislation, told CNN’s Jake Tapper this week. “[Republicans] should have at least the opportunity to have input. It should have gone through the committee. These are major changes. It is going to change society as we know it. And those changes, there should be a hearing. There should be a markup. And then you’re going to have a better product, whether your friends on the other side vote for it or not. But they have to have input.”

Without its signature legislation, the Biden administration has no political clout with the American people who are mulling over which party should win their votes in the upcoming 2022 midterms. Gone are the days when Biden took credit for lining Americans’ pockets with government cash and here are the days he ignores the rampant inflation, rising gas prices, bare grocery store shelves, and increasing crime.

Biden kicked off his time in office with a plethora of executive orders undoing the Trump administration’s work on the border, removing bans on overseas taxpayer-funded abortions, immediately ending the Keystone XL pipeline, and mandating that any federally funded schools must allow biological males to claim to be female and vice versa.

Eventually, Biden’s focus migrated to passing radical legislation such as parts of the Green New Deal masquerading as a national infrastructure plan but it soon became clear that without the presidential pen, Biden was powerless to get anything else done.

Every time the White House initiated a new push to pass bills, progressives and less-leftist legislators bickered about what exactly should be included in the administration’s massive legislative packages. Thankfully, the majority of Democrats wouldn’t budge an inch, meaning soft Republicans haven’t been able to sacrifice key conservative principles to negotiate with progressives.

As a result, Americans, struggling to come to terms with a country still trying to recover from government lockdowns, record-breaking border apprehensions, skyrocketing inflation, radical indoctrination in schools, and vaccine mandates, turned their backs on the “unity” chief and named him one of the most unpopular presidents in 80 years.

Biden’s polling first began to falter following his botched Afghanistan withdrawal and only became worse as his first year in office went on. Just one year into Biden’s presidency, 56 percent of Americans disapproved of the job he was doing. The devastating number came out the same week Biden’s effort to force the Covid-19 jab on Americans working for private companies was dealt a fatal blow by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Americans quickly realized that under Biden, the country was not headed in the right direction, and they want change. A recent CBS poll found that at least 40 percent of Americans claimed they were “nervous” about the future of the country.

Democrats only have a razor-thin majority in both the House and the Senate. Their small margin for error and Republicans’ determination to regain control could create the conditions that frustrated Americans have been asking for. Combine that with historical records indicating that the party that controls the White House more often than not loses seats in the midterms, and the GOP could see a red wave sweep the November election, which The New York Times already vehemently detests.

Biden and Democrats have already signaled that they will throw fits if the 2022 election results do not favor Democrats. Biden even went so far as to say that the midterms could “easily be illegitimate.” Their attempts to do damage control after spending a year getting nothing done shouldn’t sit well with Americans.

Why Would Biden Ask Liar Anita Hill About His Supreme Court Nominee?,"Reporter April Ryan recently asked White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki whether President Biden has consulted Anita Hill on his Supreme Court nomination process for replacing retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. There are many reasons Biden would not do this, starting with the fact Biden thought Hill lied in her allegations against Clarence Thomas.

Also, Hill has long criticized Biden for the way he allegedly treated her during Thomas’s shocking 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Why would he consult her?

As a senator, Biden chaired those Thomas-Hill hearings. After Thomas testified, Hill claimed Thomas had sexually harassed her when she worked for Thomas at the Department of Education and then at Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Yes, that’s right, Anita Hill, a Yale-educated lawyer, actually followed her alleged harasser to another job.

Hill testified, Thomas testified, and then several witnesses testified for Hill and another group supported Thomas. Not a single one of Hill’s coworkers came forward to support her allegations. Many colleagues, including many women, sided with Thomas and raised serious issues about the veracity of Hill’s claims. At the end of the hearings, a NY Times/CBS poll showed that the American people believed Thomas by a margin of 58 percent to 24 percent. Only 26 percent of women believed Hill.

Several senators have said that Biden told them he did not believe Hill. Sen. Orrin Hatch said, “Biden told me personally that he didn’t believe her. He said, ‘I don’t know why she did this.’”

In his memoirs, Sen. Arlen Specter, the lead Republican senator questioning Hill during the hearings, wrote that Biden told him in 1998, in a taped interview, that he believed Hill was lying to Specter about a key part of her testimony—whether, in the couple weeks before the hearing, she had discussed with Democrat Senate staffers the idea that all she had to do was make her allegations and Thomas would withdraw without her ever having to come forward by name.

Hill, who had been discussing in detail alleged conversations with Thomas and others that happened many years earlier, told Specter she could not remember any such conversations. According to Specter:

After this exchange Biden recessed the committee. Biden told me in November 1998, ‘It was clear to me from the way she was answering the questions, she was lying.’ ‘At that point I truncated the hearing and recessed it early for lunch,’ Biden said. ‘I turned to my chief of staff and said, ‘Go down and tell her lawyers that if her recollection is not refreshed by the time she gets back, I will be compelled to pursue the same line of questioning the Senator [Specter] did. Because it seems to me, she did what he said.’’

Sure enough, when Hill came back to testify after the lunch break, she had changed her story. Hill’s efforts to say she had not lied or changed her story perfectly demonstrates how she was willing to lie about everything, and why men and women overwhelmingly did not believe her, including Biden.

On the day Thomas was confirmed, I was with Thomas and some friends at his home when Biden called Thomas to congratulate him on his confirmation, telling Thomas he was a “person of character,” and not to get down about what had just happened to him. Does that sound like someone who believed Hill?

Since the Hill-Thomas hearings, the left has driven a baseless story that Biden had unfairly treated Hill, and, in fact, owed her an apology. Hill trafficked in this lunacy too, even saying it was fair to call Biden a liar.

But Biden never reached out to Hill until 2019, when he decided to run for president. With the Me Too movement in full swing, Biden called Hill and then went on “The View” to say he always believed Hill from the beginning. Even though Biden has a long history of lying, he still couldn’t bring himself to apologize for the way he had allegedly treated her, saying, “I don’t think I treated her badly.”

Hill snapped back to criticize Biden for his comments, but went effectively stone-cold silent as Biden emerged as the front runner. Even after Biden was credibly accused of sexual assault by a former staffer, Tara Reade, Hill was silent for weeks until The New York Times published a story weeks later that essentially forced Hill to issue a feeble written statement that there should be an independent investigation into Reade’s charges. Of course, there never was one, and Hill never raised the issue again.

Hill has always been more interested in using sexual harassment allegations as a political weapon against Republicans than actually caring about the issue. Soon after her Thomas allegations, Hill appeared on “Meet the Press” to smear Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey, who had raised sexual harassment and assault claims against President Bill Clinton. Hill stated it was important to look at how Clinton has “been on women’s issues generally and … there are larger issues other than just individual behavior.”

Hill’s revealing comments explain why she apparently said little to nothing about the very credible sexual assault charges against Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo until after he resigned. In contrast, she was quick to attack Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he was baselessly accused of sexual assault charges by Christine Blasey Ford and other shockingly absurd allegations. Like Times Up and other so-called feminist writers who have weaponized this issue, Hill has undermined making progress on efforts to stamp out sexual harassment.

Biden and his allies on the left used a willing Hill to try to take down Thomas. They failed. Too bad for them. Thomas has been on the Supreme Court for 30 years, and has been called, even by his critics, “the most important legal thinker of his generation, and the most significant judicial appointment of the last forty years.” Many now call it The Thomas Court.

Even if Biden ends up calling Hill to pander to the left again, don’t for a minute think that he believes her. He would again be using her as she used him in 1991.

Russia Is The Foreign Distraction Biden's Been Waiting For,"Image Credit The White House / Flickr

President Joe Biden has a myriad of domestic crises to deal with, but instead of taking on the issues that matter most to voters, he’s focused on a conflict with Russia over Ukraine.

While Americans struggle with unchecked inflation, bare grocery shelves, ongoing tyranny in the name of curbing Covid-19, rising urban crime, and trouble at the southern U.S. border, Biden is using Russia’s conflict with Ukraine to deflect attention from the fact that his administration is failing on the homefront.

For months, Biden’s popularity with voters has tanked. More than half of Americans disapprove of the job Biden has done, and even more, 72 percent, say the country is headed in the wrong direction. Even Biden’s own party is distancing itself from the president’s atrocious first year in office, especially after he failed to pass the Build Back Better plan despite having a Democrat-controlled Congress and wishing death on the filibuster.

That’s why the White House was excited when it realized that a U.S. response to an invasion across the globe could be the distraction voters needed to get their minds off of Biden’s domestic shortcomings.

Earlier this month, the Biden administration encouraged media coverage of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Biden even told the world last week that because of the nation’s “significant intelligence capability,” he knew Russia would invade Ukraine, and corporate media outlets and warmongers ran with the story.

So far, though, voters aren’t buying it.

New polling shows that even Russia can’t save Biden from his disastrous track record. According to a Gallup poll conducted at the beginning of February, only 36 percent of U.S. adults approve of Biden’s handling of the situation with Russia. That’s one point less than Americans’ approval of Biden’s handling of the economy, which sits at 37 percent.

After Biden’s botched Afghanistan withdrawal, which cost at least 13 American lives and stranded thousands more, plenty of voters, at least 56 percent, disapprove of the president’s handling of foreign affairs — especially when there are so many issues he is ignoring at home.

Gas prices are up, drugs smuggled in by crime rings are pouring across the southern border as are hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens, and Americans in cities are fighting off increasing violent crime, but mum’s the word from the president.

Biden and his team have epically failed in multiple ways. Despite the administration’s greatest efforts to call U.S. attention to a foreign conflict, Americans affected by Biden’s incompetence won’t forget all of the domestic crises he overlooked to focus on the Democrats’ favorite scapegoat: Russia, Russia, Russia.

Biden Speech Forgotten Even After Corrupt Press Gushed It Was 'Popular',"President Joe Biden’s 2021 speech to Congress wasn’t anything remarkable, but that didn’t stop members of the corrupt press from gushing over the Democrat’s rhetoric like it was his next big inaugural address.

In his hour-long speech last April, Biden promoted his administration’s aggressive Democrat agenda to a handful of masked legislators who cheered him on.

Some pundits such as Federalist Publisher Ben Domenech had the wisdom to call Biden’s speech for what it was: a “complete tissue of lies” that was “a political blip immediately forgotten.” Now-CNN+ Anchor Chris Wallace, like many others in the corporate media, however, was quick to fall for Biden’s unity schemes, empty promises, and statistical lies.

“You know, I think this is going to be a popular speech with the American people,” Wallace, who worked for Fox News at the time, said. “He offered a lot of stuff. Four trillion dollars will buy a lot of stuff, from millions of jobs to child-care to community health centers, all kinds of stuff, community colleges.”

In his analysis of the address, Wallace parroted Biden’s lies about taxing the rich and said those, too, would score the president political points with the American public.

“And the other thing that’s pretty popular is he said, ‘You’re not going to have to pay for it,’” Wallace said. “’Big corporations are going to pay for it. People making more than $400,000 are going to pay for it.’ But the vast majority of people watching tonight aren’t, so offering a lot of stuff and saying you aren’t going to have to pay for it is pretty popular.”

Wallace’s groveling came just a few months after he called the president’s Jan. 20, 2021 inaugural address the “best inaugural address I ever heard.”

“I think it was less an inaugural address and more part sermon, part pep talk and talking directly to the American people, saying, ‘Hear me out,’” Wallace gushed in last year. “‘We have a right to dissent peacefully, but our disagreement must not lead to disunion.’ It was a call to our better angels, a call saying, ‘Look, we’ve got tremendous challenges — Covid, the economy, racial injustice, climate change — but there’s nothing we can’t do if we come together.’”

Biden’s 2021 speech garnered support from other corporate media talking heads, who were bursting with praise for the Democrat and let him off the hook for lying. CNN White House correspondent John Harwood said Biden filled his address with “plain, non-political, non-ideological language” despite polling suggesting Americans thought the opposite.

“Veterans, single moms, poor kids, those suddenly without jobs and health care, Biden grounding his speech in plain, non-political, non-ideological language invoking the people he wants to help,” Harwood tweeted.

much different rhetorical style from recent predecessors



no showmanship, poetry, lyricism, lip-biting emotion



direct, conversational, under-stated — John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) April 29, 2021

Some outlets such as the New York Times took the liberty of calling Biden’s speech a “victory lap” before he even gave it.

CBS painted Biden’s message as “hopeful” while MSBC’s Chris Hayes fawned over Biden’s ability to “give a speech like this 99 days into his term.”

Again, some of this is good timing, but the jobs numbers he's touting now are actually unprecedented. And lots of the criticism on the right/business press is that the economy is growing too fast! — Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) April 29, 2021

Instead of Biden’s few and far between speeches in early 2021 gaining popularity with the American people as Wallace and others wrongly predicted, Biden’s radical congressional address only garnered 11.6 million viewers, less than half of the people who tuned into former President Donald Trump’s lowest-rated speech.

Sure enough, Biden’s promises didn’t change much for good in Washington D.C. or the nation. Instead, Biden’s time in office has not only exacerbated the nation’s economic turmoil but created more crises at the southern U.S. border, inland, and overseas. Gas prices are up and the American families Biden promised to refrain from taxing are paying much more for essential goods thanks to rising inflation, which economists call a “hidden tax.”

Biden is scheduled to deliver his first official State of the Union address next week to a full Congress, a significant change from last year’s speech, which was plagued with unjustifiable Covid-19 restrictions and mask theater. This time, the president is expected to use his position to push his administration’s expensive legislative agenda. If Wallace and other corporate media talking heads are smart, they’ll refrain from giving Biden’s speech glowing coverage that doesn’t match Americans’ true feelings about this administration.

17 Absurd Lies Biden Told During His State Of The Union Speech,"In a desperate bid to console a nation reeling from crises he created, President Joe Biden delivered his first official State of the Union Address on Tuesday.

The Democrat attempted to downplay his plummeting approval by promising to do better in his second year in office but instead offered a speech riddled with falsehoods and contradictions.

While Biden’s address was supposed to breathe new life into his presidency, Americans are meanwhile plagued with rising prices, a southern border crisis, and now an overseas conflict that leaves them feeling like “the State of our union is in crisis because of Joe Biden.” Here are 17 absurd lies Biden told during his State of the Union speech.

‘Freedom Will Always Triumph Over Tyranny’

Biden opened his speech by praising the lack of Covid-19 theater in the legislative chambers and claiming that “freedom will always triumph over tyranny.”

The audacious claim comes just a few months after the president tried to force the coronavirus jab on American workers, pushed his administration to work with Big Tech to censor his political opponents, and smeared Republicans as domestic terrorists for caring about their children’s education.

Powerful Sanctions Stopped Russia

Days after Biden said U.S. sanctions against Russia weren’t expected to “prevent anything from happening” in the Ukraine conflict, the president claimed that he leveraged powerful punishments against Vladimir Putin, which stopped the Eastern European in his tracks.

“A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world,” Biden said. “And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy.”

Twenty-four hours before Biden’s contradictory statement, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the sanctions “are meant to have a deterrent impact” against Russia.

Vice President Kamala Harris, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and other Cabinet members also promoted sanctions as a way to stop Putin from invading Ukraine.

I’m Always Honest

Biden told Americans, “I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised,” but The Federalist’s regularly updated lie tracker proves that claim is far from the truth.

Well, that's a lie…



""To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised."" – Joe Biden — Nathan Brand (@NathanBrandWA) March 2, 2022

‘The American Rescue Plan Worked’

Biden touted the American Rescue Plan as a significant boost to the economy that “helped working people and left no one behind,” but he neglected to mention it was this sudden influx of federal cash in a slowly rebounding economy that contributed to the inflation and rising prices plaguing Americans today.

Trump’s Tax Cuts Only Helped the Rich

Biden repeated the popular lie that former President Donald Trump’s tax cuts helped only the rich even though they actually increased worker earnings and opened up job opportunities across the board.

Biden lies about the Trump tax cuts, saying they only benefited the rich. — Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) March 2, 2022

His false claim earned a round of boos from the Democrat politicians in the audience who were eager for a chance to take a jab at Trump.

Biden lied. In 2018, following passage of the TCJA, the top 1% paid more in income taxes than the bottom 90% of taxpayers – combined. Sounds like their “fair share.” #Bidenlied. — Andy Puzder (@AndyPuzder) March 2, 2022

‘I Created Lots of Jobs’

Biden touted the rising U.S. job record as one of the highlights of his first year in office but failed to mention that the only reason the job rate is growing is that millions of people are returning to work after tyrannical bureaucrats shut down the economy for months in the name of stopping the spread of a virus.

Biden lied. 6.5 million people returning to work following pandemic lockdowns is not the same as creating 6.5 million new jobs. #Bidenlied. — Andy Puzder (@AndyPuzder) March 2, 2022

Buying American Products Is a Priority

Biden said buying American products is a priority for his administration but has conveniently avoided reinstating U.S. energy independence by cutting off Russian oil supplies and lifting his ban on American drilling.

Biden’s lie also ignored the fact that the White House recently defended buying at least $1.3 billion worth of Covid-19 rapid tests from China to disseminate to Americans instead of relying on locally-sourced ones.

‘Our Economy Roared Back Faster Than Almost Anyone Predicted’

Biden claimed that “our economy roared back fast than anyone predicted,” but as average Americans suffer the consequences of a prolonged supply-chain crisis and inflation, it’s clear that the price hikes once touted by the administration as short-term are here to stay for a while.

“Our economy roared back faster than anyone predicted.” – Biden before blaming said economy on inflation and supply chain crisis — . (@JoeConchaTV) March 2, 2022

The Solution to Inflation Is ‘Lower Your Costs’

Biden claimed that the solution to inflation is for businesses to “lower your costs, not your wages,” but anyone with a brain knows that in order to stay open, companies must raise their prices to pay for increasingly expensive goods. If businesses are forced to raise their wages, they will also raise prices for consumers who have to bear the burden or suffer the consequences of understaffing.

Biden: ""I have a better plan to fight inflation: Lower your costs, not your wages."" — Philip Melanchthon Wegmann (@PhilipWegmann) March 2, 2022

My Tax Plan Will Lower Costs and the Deficit

“My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit,” Biden claimed.

The truth is, however, that Biden’s tax plan would “result in a net increase in the deficit totaling $367 billion over the 2022-2031 period, not counting any additional revenue that may be generated by additional funding for tax enforcement,” according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Biden again falsely claims that his #BuildBackBroke agenda won’t raise taxes.



💡 Fact check: a @TaxPolicyCenter report shows that Biden’s tax plan will raise taxes on 75% of families in one year, and 95% in 10 years. Another @WhiteHouse lie. — Congressman Greg Murphy, M.D. (@RepGregMurphy) March 2, 2022

You know how Joe Biden always lies? Well he just claimed only gun manufacturers are immune from prosecution & no other industries are…did you know vaccine manufacturers are immune from prosecution??? #SOTU — Nathan Dahm (@NathanDahm) March 2, 2022

Anyone Making Less Than $400k Doesn’t Have to Pay More Taxes

Biden also repeated one of his favorite falsehoods that anyone making less than $400,000 a year doesn’t have to pay any more in taxes.

Experts, however, agree that his promise not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year is ambitious and not realistic because those who fall below the mark are still subject to consequences from a highly taxed economy.

Biden just repeated the lie that no one making less than $400,000 will pay ""a penny more"" in taxes.



Buddy, we're all paying the tax of inflation. #SOTU — John Cooper (@thejcoop) March 2, 2022

Let’s Lower Cost of Insulin (After I Raised It)

Biden called for lower insulin prices amid what he said is a drug price crisis. What the president didn’t acknowledge, however, is that he undid a rule enacted by Trump that effectively lowered insulin and epinephrine prices for Americans

Joe Biden is the one who raised the price of insulin after Trump lowered it.



Unlike you, we have our minds and can still remember things, Joe.



Give the lies a rest. #SOTU — Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) March 2, 2022

Funding Police Is Necessary

Funding for police, Biden said, is suddenly a big priority for his administration, but when rioters called for harm and financial cuts to police forces around the country during the 2020 summer of rage, Biden refused to condemn them.

The president also allies himself with Democrats who proudly call for “racist” police forces to lose their funding.

Here are 7 minutes of Democrats saying we need to defund the police. It’s amazing they try to say they never argued for this. pic.twitter.com/1t24aghO4T — Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) March 2, 2022

The Right to Vote Is Under Assault

Biden claimed the “right to vote is under assault” by states passing voter-integrity laws but failed to mention that Democrats and their cronies in Big Tech and the corporate media were the ones conspiring to rig the 2020 election. As The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway reported:

Hundreds of laws and processes were changed in the months leading up to the election, sometimes legally and sometimes not, creating chaos, confusion, and uncertainty. Tech oligarch Mark Zuckerberg, one of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful men, spent $419 million — nearly as much as the federal government itself — to interfere in the government’s management of the election in key states.

Pro-Democrat propaganda in the media and censorship of conservative voices and damning stories such as the New York Post’s report on Hunter Biden also contributed to the plot to take over elections.

Gun Manufacturers Are Immune to Lawsuits

Biden said gunmakers are immune from prosecution even though manufacturers can be sued if a firearm is faulty or malfunctions.

Big Biden Lie: gun manufacturers are the only industry that can’t be sued.



Truth: If guns malfunction, the manufacturers can be sued. Not so with vaccines! — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) March 2, 2022

On the other hand, many of the manufacturers who created the Covid-19 jab are immune to prosecution, despite Biden’s claims that the gun industry is the only one afforded special privileges.

You know how Joe Biden always lies? Well he just claimed only gun manufacturers are immune from prosecution & no other industries are…did you know vaccine manufacturers are immune from prosecution??? #SOTU — Nathan Dahm (@NathanDahm) March 2, 2022

‘We Need to Secure Our Border’

Biden said he wants to secure the southern border and that he’s taking swift action to do so. The truth is, however, that more than 100,000 illegal migrants are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border each month after the administration touted open borders and overlooked the humanitarian crisis for more than a year.

Biden not only started his presidency by stripping border protections enacted by Trump but welcomed illegal migrants with open arms. As a result, Border Patrol encountered at least 2 million illegal aliens at the southern border in 2021 alone and are expected to encounter even more in 2022. Many of these illegal aliens were released into the U.S. with loose instructions to report to ICE facilities but didn’t.

Abortion Is Health Care

“If we want to go forward — not backward — we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose,” Biden claimed during his speech.

Killing babies in the womb, however, is not health care. Not only does the heinous act take the life of an unborn child, but it has detrimental effects on women’s physical and mental health.

"In Russian Diplomacy Leaks, Biden Exposed Scary Weakness On China","The Biden administration’s weakness and incompetence were on full display in a New York Times article last week recounting the White House’s repeated—and failed— attempts to urge China to help avert war in Ukraine. The purpose of the article was to allow senior administration officials to take their duplicitous Chinese counterparts to task, but the account reveals above all that White House officials are out of their depth in dealing with China.

It is nearly impossible to read the Biden administration’s side of the story without perceiving the weakness, gullibility, and ineffectiveness that the Biden White House unwittingly presents. Administration officials describe how they were “repeatedly rebuffed” by Chinese officials even as the Americans scrambled for “half a dozen urgent meetings over three months” to try to avert the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The article repeats how “Each time, the Chinese officials… rebuffed the Americans,” as if to drive home the humiliating point.

These rebuffed Americans are quickly recast as duped Americans. Biden officials disclosed to The New York Times that they shared intelligence with their Chinese counterparts only to be double-crossed when the Chinese quickly leaked that intel to the Russians.

To add insult to injury, the Chinese also told the Russians that the Americans were “trying to sow discord,” and promised Moscow that Beijing would not interfere with Russia’s war plans. The Biden officials who leaked these details must not be aware of how embarrassing they are.

The article then provides a background on the growing public partnership between the Russian and Chinese autocrats, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, with their countries’ ties appearing stronger than any time since the Cold War. U.S. officials figured that if anyone could talk Putin out of an attack on Ukraine, it was Xi, given that Putin and Xi have met 37 times as national leaders. But Xi didn’t, and Chinese officials “persistently sided with Russia.” The Biden officials were for some reason puzzled about why.

The next few paragraphs incidentally unravel this mystery, although the Times author and the unnamed Biden officials don’t see the answer in their own account. It’s worth explaining it here, if only for the benefit of the Biden officials. America and China opened up 50 years ago, and for the first 40 years of that partnership the relationship between America and China grew stronger. For the last ten years, however, China has grown closer to Russia.

When China was weaker and threatened by what was then the Soviet Union, it turned toward America. After decades of aid, investment, technology transfer, education, and lucrative trade with the United States, China is now much stronger than Russia. Its population is much larger, its gross domestic product is ten times bigger, and its technologies (many stolen from the United States) are better. China has much less to fear from Russia, and thus can leverage Russia against America—the only remaining superpower stronger than China.

One way to pit Russia against America is to give tacit support for a Russian war in eastern Europe that will consume America and her allies, while letting China see how the West responds to an invasion analogous to what China has planned for Taiwan. And that’s exactly what China did.

A cynic might even point out that such a war and its fallout might displace the world’s unpleasant memories of China’s horrifying behavior in unleashing and spreading the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic and stonewalling investigations into the virus’ origins. In addition, Russia might even be reduced to a client state to supply commodities to China. That wouldn’t be a bad turn of events by the Chinese against a country that used to threaten them.

But back to the Times story. What comes next should remind Biden officials, and all Americans, of the Wuhan pandemic. When Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine, China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the United States, not Russia, was “the culprit of current tensions surrounding Ukraine.”

“On the Ukraine issue, lately the U.S. has been sending weapons to Ukraine, heightening tensions, creating panic and even hyping up the possibility of warfare,” she said. “If someone keeps pouring oil on the flame while accusing others of not doing their best to put out the fire, such kind of behavior is clearly irresponsible and immoral.”

Hua then refused to call Russia’s attack on Ukraine an “invasion” when pressed by reporters. Such rhetoric should sound familiar, because less than a year ago The New York Times reported on how China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeatedly floated conspiracy theories accusing the United States of starting the coronavirus pandemic. Nonetheless, Biden officials were somehow surprised at Hua’s remarks: “Hua’s fiery anti-American remarks as Russia was moving to attack its neighbor stunned some current and former U.S. officials and China analysts in the United States.”

President Biden should discover which officials were stunned by Hua’s remarks and replace them with competent realists. The same goes for the administration officials who leaked this story to The New York Times without realizing how it exposes their own weakness and incompetence, and President Biden’s.

The article then jumps to another case of naivety, this time courtesy of an on-the-record statement from Evan Medeiros, a former member of President Obama’s National Security Council, who laments: “They claim neutrality, they claim they stand on principle, but everything they say about the causes is anti-U.S., blaming NATO and adopting the Russian line…The question is: How sustainable is that as a posture? How much damage does it do to their ties with the U.S. and their ties with Europe?”

Medeiros teaches about U.S.-China relations at Georgetown University. In case his rhetorical question ever appears on a Georgetown exam, here is the answer: China’s posture is sustainable for as long as American officials keep falling for it without imposing consequences.

The article then recounts a meeting between U.S. officials and the Chinese ambassador, Qin Gang, at the Chinese Embassy in November, in which the Americans tried to trap the ambassador in a “gotcha!” moment by letting him know they caught China helping Russia evade sanctions after Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea. The Americans warned the ambassador against helping Russia again, saying the sanctions would be tougher this time, and that China’s “global image could suffer” if Russia invaded Ukraine. “The message was clear: It would be in China’s interests to persuade Mr. Putin to stand down.”

Yet when the Chinese calculated their own interests, they concluded it was very much in their interest to give Putin the green light. Perhaps they assumed Europe’s desperation for Russian gas would expose America’s bluff on sanctions. Or maybe Beijing wanted to study how the West would rally against the invasion of a sovereign nation analogous to Taiwan.

Conceivably, China didn’t have a problem with Russia being embroiled in Eastern Europe and heavily sanctioned by America. Perhaps that’s even what they wanted. But whatever it is, Biden officials are utterly lost.

The Biden administration’s diplomatic efforts failed in the short term. Yet their weakness and incompetence, on full display in Times articles they planted, are the real risk this American security.

China is America’s most formidable adversary. The White House should understand that, but obviously doesn’t. President Biden should hire a staff that isn’t so lost in dealing with Beijing, and that can strike back in more effective ways than leaking stories about their angst toward China to The New York Times.

Biden’s State Of The Union Promise To ‘Fund Police’ Was Pure Lip Service,"In Tuesday’s State of the Union address, President Joe Biden claimed he wants to restore safety and control crime. He denounced efforts to “defund” the police. But with congressional elections coming up, he lacked any useful proposals.

During the State of the Union, Biden claimed that “the American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption.” However, last year, even liberal fact-checkers acknowledged: the bill “did not stipulate that the relief funding had to be used on police officers or for other law enforcement initiatives.”

Biden’s own Treasury Department summarized the spending this way:

The Rescue Plan will provide needed relief to state, local, and Tribal governments to enable them to continue to support the public health response and lay the foundation for a strong and equitable economic recovery. In addition to helping these governments address the revenue losses they have experienced as a result of the crisis, it will help them cover the costs incurred due responding to the public health emergency and provide support for a recovery – including through assistance to households, small businesses and nonprofits, aid to impacted industries, and support for essential workers.

Where does this mention police or prosecutions as priorities?

Biden’s claims look a real change from what he said during the presidential campaign. Back in July 2020, when asked if Biden supported “redirect[ing] some of the funding for police into social services,” he responded: “Yes, I proposed that kind of reform.”

But you don’t need to go back to the campaign to see how superficial Biden’s words were on Tuesday. See what he said when he went to New York City last month and gave a major address on crime. What did he propose?

Did Biden point out that the Democrats in New York City cut the police budget by $1 billion per year? No.

Did he note how New York’s bail reform has let violent criminals out on the street only to commit more crime? No.

Did he criticize district attorneys in New York City or elsewhere who are not prosecuting violent criminals? No.

Did he express concern over the large numbers of inmates released from jails and prisons? No.

Of course, those calls would have upset many Democrats. But, unfortunately, besides lip service that he wants to reduce crime, he didn’t offer any of these obvious concrete proposals during his State of the Union address. On Tuesday, Biden offered no specific proposals to ensure funds go to the police.

Targeting Guns Instead of Criminals

Instead, the only specific proposals focused only on gun control. Biden ignores that over 92 percent of violent crime has nothing to do with guns.

He talked about the need to “repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued,” which is a lie. People can sue gunmakers if they sell a gun illegally or make a defective gun. Biden wants to make gun manufacturers civilly liable for misuse of firearms they sell. That means people could sue manufacturers and sellers whenever a crime, accident, or suicide occurs with a gun. The end goal is to put gun makers out of business. Imagine if you could sue Ford the next time someone gets intentionally run over with an F150.

He talked about an assault weapon ban, but in his New York City address, Biden talked about banning any semi-automatic gun that “can hold” a large capacity magazine. He has repeated that theme many times over the last few years. The problem is that any semi-automatic gun manufactured today “can hold” or has the “ability” to hold a magazine of virtually any capacity. About 85 percent of all handguns made were semi-automatics that “can hold” magazines. Almost as many rifles also fit that definition.

At the same time that Democrats are eviscerating law enforcement and prosecutions, Biden wants to make it difficult for people to defend themselves. Semi-automatic guns provide critical self-defense benefits. If we force law-abiding victims to rely on single-shot guns, they could find themselves in trouble. If they face multiple criminals or fire and miss their target, individuals may not have the time to manually reload their gun.

Biden talked about passing background checks on the private transfer of guns, but not using these background checks to create a national gun registry. He put together nearly one billion firearm purchase records. The government now has a searchable digital database containing 866 million transactions, including some 54 million made in 2021 alone. Federal law explicitly prohibits the creation of a federal firearm registry, but Biden is making one anyway.

This national gun registry isn’t complete because not all states have background checks on the private transfer of guns, and Biden hasn’t yet gotten all the transaction records that licensed gun dealers have. Federal agents can now type in a person’s name into a computer and possibly come up with all the guns they purchased.

It isn’t rocket science to understand why crime is increasing, and it isn’t the fault of gun owners. Many parts of the country are in dire need of basic law enforcement. But despite nice rhetoric, Biden is refusing to face the crime problem seriously.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/02/bidens-state-of-the-union-promise-to-fund-police-was-pure-lip-service/,2022-03-02
Corrupt Media Predictably Hype Biden’s Dishonest SOTU Speech,"President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address was nothing short of a disaster but the corrupt corporate media predictably gushed over it and tried to spin his terrible track record.

Pundits gladly harped on Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene shouting during Biden’s speech but when it came to fact-checking the lies pouring out of the president’s mouth, most of the corrupt press fell short.

The same corporate media outlets that eagerly fact-checked every minute of former President Donald Trump’s addresses and tweets were suddenly silent on the falsehoods in Biden’s lie-riddled speech.

CNN, as usual, was one of the greatest offenders with analysts and hosts who, despite running an article noting inconsistencies in both Biden and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds’s speeches, had nothing but praise for the president.

“Biden made a deliberate attempt to reach out to Republicans during the address. The most overt attempt was perhaps when he repeatedly said ‘fund the police,'” CNN’s Oliver Darcy wrote in the Reliable Sources newsletter. He also gave a shoutout to the NeverTrumper and Russian collusion hoaxer Jonah Goldberg for being an “honest conservative commentator” and eating up Biden’s “fund the police” line.

Finally, a line that will be memorable. ""Fund the Police."" — Jonah Goldberg (@JonahDispatch) March 2, 2022

Jake Tapper also gushed over Biden’s speech and said it was “strong.”

“I have to say, considering his speaking talents and challenges, it was a fairly solid performance,” Tapper commentated. “That is quintessential Biden, and he saved it for the end, ‘the State of the Union is strong because you the American people are strong.’ Very Biden.” Tapper has apparently forgotten that it was Trump four years ago who said “the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.”

CNN political contributor Van Jones took his flattery further and declared that “Uncle Joe is back.”

“I thought he was being the leader – nobody believes in these American ideals more than Joe Biden. It showed tonight. He has spent his entire career standing for American unity at home. He stood for that. And for American ideals abroad. I have not seen unity in this country like I saw at the beginning of that speech, and I don’t want to step on that. … I was impressed with the energy,” Jones said.

“I am proud tonight we have a leader like him,” Jones added. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said he agreed with Jones’s analysis.

“I thought it was very energetic, I thought, I appreciated the fact that he said this isn’t just about ideals. It’s also about our security, and I think that is a point he has to make again and again and again,” Axelrod noted.

Other CNN talking heads took to Twitter to suck up to the president and his team.

Here's the biggest difference between a Biden SOTU and Trump SOTU. Biden says we, Trump said I — repeatedly. — Joe Lockhart (@joelockhart) March 2, 2022

ABC and CBS pundits also glorified Biden’s speech live on-air.

“Jon, you looked at me halfway through this address and took note that there were very few overt partisan moments where the President went after the other party or things they had done other than the tax cut from the previous administration, but he didn’t mention the former president by name,” ABC’s David Muir told chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl.

Karl agreed that the address “didn’t have a partisan edge to it.”

“In fact, the overriding message was one of unity,” Karl claimed.

CBS senior White House correspondent Ed O’Keefe gladly conveyed that his sources at the White House were proud of the president’s efforts to be “bipartisan” promote a “unity agenda.”

The Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin couldn’t find much to say about Biden’s domestic policy blunders or mid-speech gaffes but gladly praised the president for giving a speech that wasn’t “overly long.”

Biden delivered. An inspired address on Ukraine. A signal he's heard the public on inflation. Some bipartisan proposals. Not overly long, which always helps. — Jennifer ""Pro-privacy"" Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) March 2, 2022

NBC’s Michael Beshloss said the speech restored his confidence that “we have a President who wants to be leader of the Free World.”

Once again we have a President who wants to be leader of the Free World. — Michael Beschloss (@BeschlossDC) March 2, 2022

Late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert called Biden’s speech “a roller coaster ride of rip roaring reasonableness.”

The New York Times also jumped on the celebratory bandwagon by claiming that Biden “spoke in a strong voice.”

While Joe Biden’s assertion that “the State of the Union is strong” is quite a reach, the corporate media happily carried the White House rhetoric throughout their coverage of the State of the Union because it fits their agenda.

The same favorable press coverage happened last year after Biden delivered his 2021 speech to Congress. Members of the corrupt media were quick to overlook Biden’s unity schemes, empty promises, and statistical lies because they wanted to boost his presidency.

Debunking Biden’s SOTU Border Baloney Line By Line,"Despite creating the nation’s biggest border crisis to date, President Joe Biden pretended during his State of the Union Address on Tuesday that things on the largely neglected southern border are going great and that any problems are not ones he created — but rather ones we can all fix together.

Biden and his “border czar” Vice President Kamala Harris successfully avoided visiting the U.S.-Mexico border for months while agents struggled to manage the influx of migrants and narcotics being smuggled into the United States. Now that the Biden-Harris ticket’s approval ratings are tanking, the president has the audacity to claim that “if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the border and fix the immigration system.”

“We can do both,” Biden insisted during his speech to the nation.

The Democrat’s rosy rhetoric, however, could not be further from reality. While the White House was focused on pumping federal cash into an already inflated economy, pushing the nation back into energy dependence, and botching a withdrawal from Afghanistan, millions of illegal aliens and illicit drugs poured across the U.S.-Mexico border with little-to-no scrutiny.

Just one year after stripping the border protections enacted by the Trump administration, Biden said he wants to secure the southern border and that he’s taking swift action to do so. The truth is, however, that more than 100,000 illegal migrants are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border each month after the Biden administration touted open borders and a “pathway to citizenship” for illegals for more than a year.

The president claimed on Tuesday that he has already begun to secure the border by installing “new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.” What Biden didn’t mention is that these new “scanners” were designed to monitor vehicles crossing at legal ports of entry but have no power over smugglers who infiltrate the border illegally.

Since Biden assumed office in January of 2021, Border Patrol agents encountered more than 2 million people along the southern border and seized record numbers of lethal, illicit drugs. In vulnerable border areas such as South Texas, fentanyl seizures went up by 1,066 percent. Biden can brag about new border technology all he wants, but his scanners are worthless if they don’t catch the drugs that are brought across the border by illegal aliens. Even if the scanners were used outside of legal ports of entry, many border agents are too preoccupied with babysitting makeshift migrant camps to arrest smugglers.

Biden also claimed during his address that “we’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers,” but the president’s pledge to quash human smuggling at the border is at odds with his administration’s commitment to shipping unaccompanied minors via covert “ghost” flights to different states with hardly any transparency or vetting.

As a result of these resettlement flights, federal officials have lost track of almost 40 percent of migrant children who were released from border officials’ custody between January and May of last year. This lucrative scheme, which has been condemned as child trafficking by people like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, simply incentivizes human smuggling, not discourages it.

For illegal aliens who haven’t been resettled in other states, the president bragged that his administration is working hard to instate “dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster.”

These judges will also most likely hear the cases of repeat border offenders, many sustained by U.S. tax dollars handed out by federally funded aid organizations, who have been trained to recover “repressed memories” of circumstances that would qualify them for asylum and residence.

Biden concluded his short mention of the border on Tuesday by parroting the same rhetoric that inspired aliens to flood the U.S. border in the first place.

“We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land — my forefathers and so many of yours. Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, and essential workers. Revise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite. It’s not only the right thing to do — it’s the economically smart thing to do,” Biden said.

Biden’s gross lack of attention to his border crisis has created a myriad of problems for states and frustrated Americans. Instead of laying out a plan to actually secure the U.S.-Mexico border during his annual speech, Biden lied to Americans and denied any responsibility for the ongoing humanitarian crisis plaguing the nation.

The border isn’t going great, and no amount of falsehoods from Biden or any other politician trying to downplay the crisis can distract from the record-shattering number of illegal aliens and drugs coming into the U.S. every day.

We've Got Three More Years Of Biden Making The World More Dangerous,"Fifty years ago this week, President Nixon signed the Shanghai Communique with the People’s Republic of China. It was a bold act of statecraft that helped drive a wedge between Communist China and the Soviet Union.

For most of the Cold War, the United States had a clear and guiding mission: defeat the Soviet Union and communism, divide our enemies, and protect our allies. Today, the enemies of the United States have taken on the reverse mission: defeat Western democracy, divide the United States and her allies, and protect autocracies.

The Sino-Russian alliance and the regimes they prop up from Caracas to Tehran form a dangerously formidable opponent. It is vital that our elected leaders meet that challenge. Sadly, they are far from meeting that task.

As a candidate for president, Joe Biden promised he would mend our supposedly broken alliances, “bring the adults back in charge,” stand up to Russia by arming Ukraine, and make America more prosperous. Across all these accounts, he has failed.

Biden has isolated our allies and partners in the Middle East so badly they would not even vote with us at the United Nations to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. His administration repeatedly blocked and stalled military assistance to Ukraine, and only promised Stinger missiles to them last week after dovish countries like Germany and the Netherlands had already committed them as well. Inflation is higher than it’s been in 40 years and gas prices are on the rise even further.

Biden Sacrifices America For Climate Change

As my former boss, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has stated many times, each administration governs with guiding principles for its foreign policy. For the Trump administration, it was America First. This is the lens through which we viewed all foreign policy decisions: what was best for the American people?

It led to enormous and transformative victories around the world: four peace deals brokered in the Middle East with the Abraham Accords. The world’s most deadly terrorists, ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Qassem Soleimani, were taken off the battlefield forever. Our diplomatic pressure campaign against the Chinese Communist Party’s covert 5G espionage program, Huawei, reduced that threat.

For President Biden, however, his foundation is climate change and the supposed restoration of American standing in the world. That has led to a first-year track record on national security that is nothing less than abysmal. Because of repeated capitulations across the world, our enemies no longer fear us — a catastrophic development made evident by revelations that Iran is daring to plot kidnapping and assassination plots against American citizens on our own soil.

Biden’s Foreign Policy Failures

Within four months of Biden taking office, Hamas was attacking Israel; after seven months, Kabul fell to the Taliban; and within 13 months, we have the first major ground war in Europe since 1945. Today, we are on the brink of losing our democratic partner, Ukraine, to a power-hungry dictator.

The Biden administration’s strategy to prevent the war from taking place was laughable. Their approach relied on scaring Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin with the threat of undisclosed sanctions when Biden had already folded on Nord Stream 2 and New START, and had failed to respond to the Russian hack of the Colonial Pipeline. Biden sought to deter Russia from invading and failed. Now Canada and the Europeans are picking up the slack — who would have guessed we’d be taking cues from them?

These are just a sampling of the failings we’ve seen in Biden’s first year. Without a fundamental change, what do the next three years look like? We could see China mount a deadly invasion of Taiwan. North Korea could use nuclear extortion to change the status quo on the Korean peninsula. Iran could cross the nuclear threshold and hold the Middle East and Israel hostage to its threats. Our top generals have already warned that Al-Qaeda and ISIS are likely to regain their ability to strike outside of Afghanistan in the coming months.

Putin will be listed in history next to other evil men, from Adolf Hitler to Mao Zedong to Joseph Stalin. He only respects the language of power, and he is fluent in every form of deception. But President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken were naive enough to believe that Putin could be dissuaded solely through rhetoric and the weak threat of sanctions.

Importantly, they lack a critical skill in national security officials: the ability to understand, predict, and disrupt the devious plots of our enemies. Just two weeks ago, Blinken repeatedly lamented that he “did not understand” why Putin would attack Ukraine when he could work on combatting climate change instead. Read that again: our own secretary of state admitted he can’t understand how our adversaries think.

Misguided Ideology

The mounting disasters are not just a coincidence or bad luck — they are a direct consequence of individuals who believe misguided ideologies that oppose American exceptionalism, American power, and the fact that America has been the greatest source for peace and prosperity in the history of the world. When you can’t stand up for America at home, you will never stand up for her abroad.

We’re in a new era of hard power where autocrats don’t care if we post pictures of solidarity or hashtags for days on Twitter. Biden and his team need to get serious. Only strength will deter these regimes, which is why it is so vital we continue the task of rebuilding our military strength and nuclear abilities.

Here’s a scary fact: the United States has not designed or built a new nuclear warhead since the end of the Cold War, and we no longer have the infrastructure to create new nuclear weapons. The average age of the nuclear warheads in our stockpile is over 25 years — older than most of the soldiers tasked with operating the weapons.

Today, China has the world’s largest standing ground forces, the largest navy and coast guard, the largest sub-strategic missile force, and the largest air force in the Indo-Pacific. Russia has been serially cheating on its nuclear treaty obligations, under which China isn’t even constrained. Despite such rising threats, Biden’s defense budget request for this year was the equivalent of a 5 percent cut after accounting for inflation. How is the United States supposed to deter Russia and China when our leaders apply the disastrous logic of “defund the police” to our military?

Despite Biden’s repeated failings, he has doubled down on the ideology and outlook that led us to the abdication of American power. He has not evaluated his failings and changed course. His next major blunder may be if he inks a proposed nuclear deal with Iran that would provide the regime a rapid path to a nuclear weapon and $90 billion in no-strings-attached sanctions relief.

Change of Course Urgently Needed

Biden needs to change course and can only do so through new leadership in his national security team. But there have been no firings — except of an Army colonel who dared speak out about the failed approach in Afghanistan.

Recently, a top State Department diplomat working on Iran negotiations was pushed out for disagreeing with the pending capitulation to the regime’s nuclear extortion in Vienna. Biden needs to stop the leadership decay in his administration — and he’s got to stop listening to the naïve lackeys who are pushing the few good men out.

One of the greatest differences between democracies like the United States and autocracies like Putin’s Russia is that our elected officials are supposed to serve the people, not the other way around. We evaluate our leaders by their results and hold them accountable when they can’t perform.

By any measure, Biden and his top foreign policy officials have failed the American people. They should resign their offices. If they do not, the American people must vote them out. That starts this November by electing new leaders to Congress who will hold the Biden administration accountable and restore American leadership and strength.

Full List Of Every Lie Biden Has Told As POTUS: 223 And Counting,"Updated Feb. 7, 2023. Two hundred twenty-three lies and counting.

More than two years into President Joe Biden’s time in the White House and the end to his lies is nowhere in sight. Here is part three of The Federalist’s rigorous coverage keeping the Biden administration accountable with substantive fact-checking throughout the president’s tenure.

You can find part two of “The Full List Of Every Lie Joe Biden Has Told As President” here.

223. Chuck Schumer Is Minority Leader

Before his State of the Union speech even began, Biden greeted Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as “Senate minority leader.” Schumer has been the majority leader since Biden took office in 2021.

222. More Jobs Created in Two Years Than Any Other President

“I actually created, with the help of many people in this room, 12 million new jobs,” Biden said during his State of the Union address. “More jobs created in two years than any president has created in four years. Because of you.”

Biden didn’t create new jobs, as he often likes to claim. The only reason the job rate is growing is that millions of people are returning to work after tyrannical bureaucrats shut down the economy for months in the name of stopping the spread of Covid-19.

221. Fastest Growth in 40 Years

On Feb. 7, 2023, during his annual speech to Congress, Biden repeated his infamous lie that he initiated the “fastest job growth in 40 years.”

Records show, however, that employment from May 2020 to January 2021 under Trump grew by 12.5 million. During approximately that same time period, the unemployment rate also declined by 8.3 percent.

In January alone, American payroll jobs under Biden fell by more than 2.5 million.

220. Inflation Is ‘Coming Down’

Another lie Biden repeated during his State of the Union address is that inflation in the U.S. “is coming down.”

Yet, two years after the president greenlit the beginning of Democrats’ expensive spending spree, Americans are suffering from gas prices still well above $3 per gallon, weathering a recession, and paying 60 percent more for eggs than they did in 2021. Biden may not be responsible for the fastest job growth in the last four decades, but inflation under his watch rose at its fastest rate in 40 years.

[READ: Biden, Media Taunt Struggling Americans By Insisting 6.5% Inflation Is A Good Thing]

Biden tried to blame the nation’s economic misfortune on the pandemic and the “unfair and brutal war in Ukraine,” but the truth is, inflation in the U.S. directly coincides with the time he took office.

219. Democracy Faced ‘Greatest Threat Since Civil War’ on Jan. 6

President Biden forgot about the attacks on Pearl Harbor, 9/11, and the repeat episodes of violence at the Capitol when he claimed at the 2023 State of the Union that the riot on Jan. 6, 2021, was the “greatest threat since the Civil War.”

Look at McCarthy’s reaction as Biden repeats the lie that the Jan 6 riot was the greatest threat since the Civil War.

[READ: Jan. 6 Is Important Because It’s Epiphany, Not The Solemn Anniversary Of A Fake Insurrection]

218. I’m Responsible for the Largest Deficit in U.S. History

Biden wants to take credit for cutting the national deficit “by more than $1.7 trillion — the largest deficit reduction in American history” in his first two years in office.

“Under the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a row. Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor,” Biden said at the 2023 State of the Union.

The truth is, federal spending under Biden increased more than $10 trillion since his first month in office. That’s more than any other president spent in his first two years in U.S. history.

217. Republicans Are Trying to Cut Social Security

Biden pledged to halt desperately needed cuts to bloated entitlement programs as Congress debates raising the debt ceiling.

“If anyone tries to cut Social Security,” the president said during his annual address to Congress, “I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.”

The Democrats’ reconciliation bill passed last summer, however, raided nearly $300 billion from Medicare to boost insurance companies by removing leverage from negotiations on drug prices.

""If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.""

216. Fires Have Burned an Area the Size of Missouri

President Biden tried to claim during his State of the Union speech that more wood had been burned by forest fires than the area of the entire state of Missouri.

“More timber has been burned than I’ve observed from helicopters than the entire state of Missouri,” Biden said.

In 2022, however, 7.5 million acres burned, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Missouri’s forests span 14 million acres, and the state itself is 44.6 million acres large.

The remark appears to have been made off-script according to what the White House released as the president’s prepared speech.

215. Biden Repeats Claim that Fast-Food Workers Sign Noncompete Agreements

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy could be seen chuckling in the background at the State of the Union when Biden complained that fast-food workers were signing noncompete agreements with employers.

“A cashier at a burger place can’t walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make a few bucks more,” Biden said.

Biden claims that McDonald’s cashiers sign noncompete agreements which prevent them from working for other burger chains. 😂 pic.twitter.com/cXyPHE7lvk — John Curtis (@Johnmcurtis) February 8, 2023

Biden made the same claim at a business roundtable in July 2020, earning the then-candidate a “false” rating from PolitiFact.

214. Biden Blames Crime Wave on Covid After Democrats Defunded Police

During the 2023 State of the Union, Biden blamed the coronavirus lockdowns for the nation’s recent crime wave.

Covid left scars, the president said, “like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.”

It was the Democrats’ rush to “defund police,” however, that left cities and neighborhoods vulnerable to criminals who remained free to roam the streets. Democrats in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and New York cut police funding by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of the social justice fever that took over the country. More than a dozen cities saw the highest homicide rates ever reported as a result.

According to a poll from Politico last year, 3 in 4 Americans blamed the crime spree on the efforts to defund police.

213. I Re-Upped Funding for Cancer Research

One of Biden’s top priorities going into his 2023 State of the Union speech was his “Cancer Moonshot” initiative, which allocates funding to cancer research and care.

“Jill and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead,” Biden said.

Biden may have restarted the program to “provide more support for patients and families,” but it was his pet legislation, the ill-named Inflation Reduction Act, that cut cancer research spending by nine times as much as his program is supposed to put toward it.

212. Immigration ‘Reform’ Will Secure the Border

During his annual address to Congress, Biden pointed to his “new border plan” as evidence that he’s finally doing something about the millions of illegal border crossers flooding the U.S.

But his plan to grant “legal” status to illegal border crossers from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela only emboldens corrupt cartels and does nothing to stop the pipeline of fentanyl responsible for taking American lives, something several hecklers pointed out during his speech.

Biden said his “comprehensive immigration reform” would “fix” the national security threat that American border woes have become. In reality, that legislation would only encourage the millions of migrants overwhelming Border Patrol agents to keep paying the criminal organizations that control northern Mexico to escort them to the U.S.

211. Mass Shootings Went Down After Assault Weapons Ban

Biden claimed during the State of the Union that the federal assault weapons ban, which barred the manufacturing of semi-automatic rifles for civilian use from 1994 to 2004, caused mass shootings to drop.

“In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled,” Biden said.

That’s a lie based on a flawed study that claimed the ban reduced mass shooting deaths. Accurate data recorded during the ban shows that more so-called mass shootings occurred during the firearm prohibition. Even after the ban expired, mass shootings did not increase, as Democrats suggested they would.

210. Life-Saving Pro-Life Laws Are Extreme

During his State of the Union address, Biden wrongfully characterized pro-life legislation in several red states as “extreme” for limiting women’s ability to kill their unborn babies.

“Already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans,” he said.

In reality, it’s Biden’s abortion-on-demand throughout all nine of months of pregnancy agenda that is extreme. New polling suggests 7 in 10 Americans support limiting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy.

Biden also criticized Republicans for trying to pass what he said is a “national abortion ban.”

As pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America noted, the GOP has not proposed a total ban on abortions. It has just worked to bring U.S. abortion law up to speed with other civilized countries, which recognize abortion beyond 15 weeks gestation as a barbaric practice.

209. ‘I’m Here to Be President for All Americans’

In addition to promising unity via bipartisan cooperation, Biden falsely claimed during his address to Congress on Feb. 7, 2023, that he is “here to be president for all Americans.”

Yet the few times Biden gave formal addresses in 2022, he demonized the half of the country that didn’t vote for him. His smears against “MAGA Republicans” shows he has no tolerance for conservative voters or their values.

A president for all wouldn’t sic his Department of Justice on parents concerned that their children’s education stays indoctrination free or a pro-life father who rightfully defended his son from a deranged abortion activist.

208. Biden Claims ‘No’ Blame For Inflation

Biden refuses to take responsibility for the inflation crippling the nation despite its clear connection to his administration and policies.

“Do you take any blame for inflation?” a reporter asked the president on Feb. 3, 2023.

“Do I take any blame for inflation? No,” Biden replied.

“Why not?” the reporter countered.

“It was already here when I got here, man! Remember what the economy was like when I got here?” Biden asked.

REPORTER: ""Do you take any blame for inflation?""



BIDEN: ""No.""



REPORTER: ""Why not?""



BIDEN: ""It was already there when I got here, man!"" pic.twitter.com/ErvzSQVC4n — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) February 3, 2023

The economy before Biden’s inauguration may have suffered from government-mandated lockdowns, but that suffering drastically increased in March of 2021 shortly after Biden took office, when the new administration greenlit Congress’s $1.9 trillion spending bill.

Since then, inflation rose at its fastest rate in 40 years and still hovers far above pre-pandemic price hikes.

207. Biden Says He Began Career as Civil Rights Activist

President Biden told congregants at Georgia’s Ebenezer Baptist Church on the Sunday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day that he began his career as a mid-20th-century civil rights activist. Biden said he “started off as a 22-year-old kid on the east side in the civil rights movement.”

While at Ebenezer Baptist Church, Joe Biden once again claims he was a civil rights activist: “When I started off as a 22-year-old kid on the east side in the civil rights movement.”

On his first campaign for president, however, Biden disputed his participation in the movement.

“I was not an activist,” Biden said at a Washington press conference in September 1978. “I worked at an all-black swimming pool in the east side of Wilmington, Delaware. I was involved in what they were thinking, what they were feeling. I was involved, but I was not out marching. I was not down in Selma, I was not anywhere else.”

206. Biden Says He Went to a Black Church as a Teen

President Biden also told congregants at the Ebernezer Baptist Church that he went to a predominantly black church as a teenager.

BIDEN: ""I used to go to 7:30 mass every morning in high school and then in college, before I went to the Black church. Not a joke.""

Members of the president’s supposed former church, however, don’t remember him.

205. Biden Claims He Taught Classes at UPenn

While speaking at the North America Leaders’ Summit in Mexico City on Jan. 10, Biden claimed he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania “four years after being vice president.” While Biden was paid nearly $1 million by the university, he reportedly never taught a class there.

204. Biden Blames J6 Rioters for Capitol Police Officer’s Death

During an overtly political speech marking the two-year anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, Biden falsely claimed that Officer William “Billy” Evans died as a result of “threats by these sick [Jan. 6] insurrectionists.”

Contrary to the president’s assertion, Evans was killed three months after the Jan. 6 riot in April 2021 by a Nation of Islam supporter who killed the officer by running him down with a car. The instance marks the second occasion in which Biden has conflated Evans’s death with the events of Jan. 6.

203. Biden Says Guns’ Only Use Is to ‘Kill People’

In a commemorative statement honoring the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting, Biden falsely claimed that the only use for weapons like those used in the shooting is to “kill people.”

“I am determined to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like those used at Sandy Hook and countless other mass shootings in America,” Biden said in an official statement. “Enough is enough. Our obligation is clear. We must eliminate these weapons that have no purpose other than to kill people in large numbers.”

Americans have and use guns for a variety of reasons including hunting, range shooting, collecting, deterrence, and protection. In some cases, the guns that Biden refers to as “assault weapons” are more effective at activities like hog hunting than other types of firearms.

Additionally, those who use guns as self-defense tools are taught not “shoot to kill,” but only to shoot if necessary to stop, slow, or disarm someone who is threatening their life.

202. Biden Accuses Republicans of Suppressing Voters

“They are trying to succeed where they failed in 2020,” Biden said during a speech at Union Station in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 2, 2022. “To suppress the right of voters and subvert the electoral system itself. That means denying your right to vote and deciding whether your vote even counts. Instead of waiting until the election is over, or starting well before restarting now. They’ve emboldened violence and intimidation of voters and election officials. It is estimated that the more than 300 election denier on the ballot all across America this year.”

In reality, it’s Democrats and Democrat operatives such as Marc Elias who oppose Republican-led election integrity laws around the nation and conservative attempts to make voting safer and more secure.

In Georgia, where Biden encouraged businesses to boycott the state over its “Jim Crow 2.0” election integrity law in 2021, early voters are turning out in record numbers. Even during early voting in the primaries, Georgia’s non-white voter turnout boomed.

201. White House Says Biden ‘Always Condemned Political Violence’

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told a room full of corporate media reporters on Nov. 2, 2022, that Biden “has always, always condemned political violence.”

“It doesn’t matter, again, if you’re a Republican, an independent, or a Democrat,” Jean-Pierre said.

Biden has, however, failed to equally apply his condemnation of political violence.

When radical abortion activists violently attacked at least 75 life-saving pregnancy centers and pro-life groups, assaulted at least 89 Catholic churches, and threatened to harm Republican-nominated justices following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson opinion leak, Biden failed to personally address it.

Biden was also silent when climate rioters led an insurrection at the Department of the Interior in October 2021.

Even before his presidency, Biden neglected to quickly condemn the rioters, looters, and vandals who inflicted billions of dollars worth of damage on the nation’s cities in 2020. It took Biden months to condemn those attacks. He was also silent when Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker, and Maxine Waters urged violence against Trump and his supporters.

200. Biden Says Incomes Outpaced Inflation Last Quarter

“Although it may not feel that way, people’s incomes went up the last quarter more than inflation. Economic growth is up, price inflation is down, real incomes are up, and gas prices are down,” Biden said during a gubernatorial campaign event for Charlie Crist in Florida.

While inflation was up a reported 8.2 percent in September, wages and salaries only increased by 5.1 and 4.2 percent since September of last year.

199. Biden Says He Attended HBCU

During a Democrat campaign event in Florida, Biden said he received his education at a historically black college or university, or HBCU.

“I’m a big fan of HBCUs. I got my start at one of those other HBCUs, Delaware State University,” Biden told a cheering crowd.

While campaigning for @CharlieCrist in Miami-Dade County, @JoeBiden claims that he went to college at a HBCU (Historically Black institution) Delaware State University.

198. Biden Falsely Claims His Son Died in the Iraq War

Biden incorrectly claimed his son died in Iraq, presumably during the Iraq War.

“Inflation is a worldwide problem right now because of a war in Iraq. … Excuse me the war in Ukraine. I’m thinking of Iraq because that’s where my son died.”

Biden’s son Beau did die — but of brain cancer. Beau passed away in the United States in 2015, nearly four years after the end of the Iraq War in 2011.

197. Biden Says U.S. Has ‘Lowest Inflation Rate’ Globally

During a speech on Nov. 1, Biden incorrectly claimed the United States has “the lowest inflation rate of almost any country in the world.”

Biden: ""We have the lowest inflation rate of almost any country in the world."" pic.twitter.com/t1436gw0Qc — Greg Price (@greg_price11) November 1, 2022

As of September, the rate of inflation in the U.S. is 8.2 percent. Even though countries use different measures to calculate their inflation rates, the U.S. still had a larger increase in the cost of goods and services than many developed countries including Canada (6.9 percent), Japan (3 percent), Australia (7.3 percent), and Italy (5.79).

While many countries around the globe are suffering from price hikes, the U.S. inflation rate quadrupled, rising faster than Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Brazil, New Zealand, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Japan, India, China, and others

196. Biden Blames ‘Soaring’ Gas Prices on Putin (Again)

“Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in March sent gas prices soaring, literally, around the world. Not just here, but around the world,” Biden said in a speech on Nov. 1.

https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1587489793239310343?s=20&t=zoxuWsJKnzqcEUQyjGOuXg

The president claimed that it’s “because of the action we’ve taken since then, [that] gas prices have actually come down.”

Not only were gas prices “soaring” long before Russia’s leader chose to invade Ukraine, but Biden’s decision to deplete the Strategic Petroleum Reserve shortly before the midterms is a political one, not a sustainable one.

As Chuck DeVore, the chief national initiatives officer at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, wrote for The Federalist, Biden’s reliance on reserves is just an artificial and temporary solution for an ongoing problem.

“Should the SPR draws stop, or … shift back to refilling the reserves, what would happen? Oil prices would immediately spike, with gasoline prices following quickly,” DeVore wrote.

195. Biden Lies About Price of Gas

During an address on Oct. 27, Biden falsely claimed that gas prices were far higher when he took office than they are now.

“The most common price of gas in America is $3.39, down from over $5 when I took office,” Biden said.

Biden: ""The most common price of gas in America is $3.39, down from over $5 when I took office.""



The price of gas was $2.33 when Joe Biden took office. pic.twitter.com/3MD4qighrA — Greg Price (@greg_price11) October 27, 2022

Not only is the national average for gas currently hovering around $3.76 per gallon, not $3.39, but gas was only around $2.39 per gallon when Biden assumed office.

194. Biden Claims He ‘Signed a Law’ Wiping Student Loan Debt

Biden falsely claimed that his executive order shifting student loan debt onto taxpayers was actually a bill Congress passed and that he “signed” into law.

“It’s passed. I got it passed by a vote or two,” Biden said during a Now This presidential forum on Oct. 23.

Here is the full clip for all you clowns who say it’s out of context. Biden first falsely claims he “signed a law” to cancel student loan debt, then says he “got it passed by a vote or two.”



??????? pic.twitter.com/JKdKde24db — Jake Schneider (@jacobkschneider) October 24, 2022

Biden’s attempt to bail out Americans with college loans by making other debt-free Americans foot the bill is controversial and could, as the president himself once admitted, be illegal. That’s why a federal appeals court temporarily blocked Biden’s plans to shift student loan debt onto taxpayers on Oct. 21.

193. Biden Claims He Hasn’t ‘Stopped or Slowed U.S. Oil Production’

To defend releasing even more oil reserves, Biden lied that he has not “stopped or slowed U.S. oil production.”

“Let’s debunk some myths here. My administration has not stopped or slowed U.S. oil production,” Biden claimed. “Quite the opposite.”

Joe Biden:



""My administration has not stopped or slowed U.S. oil production."" pic.twitter.com/J85rmKhEl1 — TheBlaze (@theblaze) October 19, 2022

Oil production may technically be up from its pandemic plunge, but it’s still nowhere near the pre-Covid levels achieved under Biden’s predecessor — and any growth since then is not thanks to Biden. Even before he set foot in the White House, Biden declared a war on oil and fossil fuels. Once elected, the president used some of his first days in office to halt the Keystone Pipeline and effectively shut down public oil land leasing. He’s also tried to stop new oil projects and has threatened to eliminate the fossil fuel industry by 2050.

All of these actions have hiked gas and energy prices for Americans.

192. White House Says Fetterman Not Disabled

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at an Oct. 17 press conference Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. and Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman was “just as capable as always” five months after a major stroke.

“The president has found him to be an impressive individual,” Jean-Pierre said, claiming Fetterman is “just as capable as always and who’s carrying out his office.”

Fetterman, however, still struggles to communicate and experiences issues processing what people say. The Democrat Senate nominee remains unable to speak clearly.

John Fetterman gave a speech in Montgomery County yesterday.



Here are the highlights. pic.twitter.com/8udMddHAcQ — Greg Price (@greg_price11) September 12, 2022

In mid-October, a reporter for NBC News defended her coverage of a one-on-one interview with Fetterman wherein she claimed, “In small talk before the interview without captioning, it wasn’t clear he was understanding our conversation.”

Fetterman will require closed captioning for his debate with Republican celebrity television doctor Mehmet Oz. The debate will be held on Oct. 25 which is weeks after early voting in Pennsylvania has already begun.

191. Biden Lies About Effects Of Dobbs

During an address at a Democratic National Committee event on Oct. 18, 2022, Biden claimed that when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, “Women all across the country, starting in my house, lost a fundamental right.”

Biden on Roe being overturned:

Not only is Jill Biden far beyond child-bearing age but many states have used the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, which gave states the power to decide abortion law, to expand their baby-killing radicalism.

Delaware, where the First Lady technically resides, allows abortion through “fetal viability,” which is considered between 24-26 weeks gestation.

190. Amid Recession, Biden Says Recession ‘Hasn’t Happened Yet’

In an attempt to cover up his role in exacerbating the nation’s economic crises, Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Oct. 11 that the U.S. is not in a recession.

“Should the American people prepare for a recession?” Tapper asked, shortly after Biden accidentally yet accurately called Democrats’ latest expensive spending package the “Inflation Act.”

“No,” Biden said. “Look they’ve been saying this now, every six months they say this. … It hadn’t happened yet. There’s no guarantee that they’re going to be a recess- I don’t think there will be a recession. If it is, there will be a very slight recession. That is, we’ll move down slightly.”

Q: ""Should the American people prepare for a recession?""

Back-to-back negative quarters, which signal the U.S. is in a recession, were first reported in July. Not only did the nation’s gross domestic product drop by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of 2022, but inflation reached yet another record high, which severely damaged Americans’ purchasing power.

189. Biden Lies that He Lost an ‘Awful Lot’ of His Home to a Fire Years Ago

During a speech to Hurricane Ian victims on Oct. 5, 2022, Biden falsely claimed that he lost an “awful lot” in a 2004 kitchen fire at his Delaware home.

“I know from experience how much anxiety and fear concern is to other people. … We didn’t lose our whole home, but lightning struck and we lost an awful lot of it about 15 years ago,” Biden said.

Joe Biden claimed today that he lost ""an awful lot"" of his home in a fire from a lightning strike 15 years ago.



According to a report from the time, the lighting strike caused ""a small fire contained to the kitchen"" that ""was under control in 20 minutes."" https://t.co/l5l9eJ7MK3 pic.twitter.com/8yxvkUABPa — Greg Price (@greg_price11) October 5, 2022

According to the fire chief at the time, the fire, caused by a lightning strike, was contained in under 20 minutes.

Biden similarly told voters in New Hampshire in November of 2021 that his house burned down with First Lady Jill Biden inside of it.

“I know, having had a house burn down with my wife in it — she got out safely, God willing — that having a significant portion of it burn, I can tell: 10 minutes makes a hell of a difference,” Biden said.

188. Biden Claims Humans Make Hurricanes Worse

President Biden claimed Hurricane Ian was the firm proof of manmade climate change while touring the devastation in Florida on Oct. 5, 2022.

“I think the one thing this has finally ended is whether or not there is climate change and we should do something about it,” Biden said.

Data on hurricanes, however, only dates back about 100 years. Even President Barack Obama’s science adviser Steve Koonin said, “Humans have no detectable impact on hurricanes over the past century.”

187. Biden Claims Roman Catholic Church Changed Position on Ending Unborn Lives

During remarks at the Democratic National Committee Reception on Sept. 22, Biden falsely claimed the Roman Catholic Church caved on allowing exceptions for abortions in the case of rape and incest.

“My generic point — and I happen to be a practicing Roman Catholic — my church doesn’t even make that argument now. And so we’re in a situation where things have changed a lot. But they’ve gotten more extreme in their positions,” Biden said.

While certain Catholic-identifying politicians such as Biden and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi regularly tout abortion, the Catholic Chuch still maintains that killing a baby, whose life began at conception, is a sin.

“Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law,” paragraph 2271 of the Church’s Catechism states.

Even Pope Francis has publicly condemned Biden’s support for abortion as an “incoherence.”

186. Biden Pretends Inflation Isn’t Hurting Americans

During his “60 Minutes” interview with Scott Pelley on Sept. 18, Biden argued inflation is not as bad as it seems.

“Let’s put this in perspective,” Biden said. “Inflation rate month to month was up just an inch. Hardly at all.”

“You’re not arguing that 8.3 is good news?” Pelley asked, noting that the annual inflation rate for August was up 0.1 percent from July and more than 8 percent since the same time last year.

“No, I’m not saying it’s good news, but it was 8.2 or 8.2 before. You’re making it sound like all of a sudden, my God, it went to 8.2 percent,” Biden said.

As Pelley noted, “It’s been the highest inflation rate, Mr. President, in 40 years.” Americans are struggling to pay their grocery and energy bills, which have cost hundreds of extra dollars compared to previous years.

“I got that,” Biden retorted. “But guess what we are. We’re in a position where, for the last several months, it hasn’t spiked. It is just barely, it has been basically even.”

Joe Biden doesn’t seem to remotely understand how bad inflation is for average Americans. Grocery costs were up 13.5% over last year for example. He’s acting like forty year high inflation is no big deal. Crazy. pic.twitter.com/u7KBrwloZU — Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) September 19, 2022

185. Biden Falsely Claims Energy Costs Came Down

In the same “60 Minutes” interview, Biden claimed energy prices have come down, but data for August inflation show energy costs are up 23.8 percent since August of 2021.

184. Biden Says His Expensive Spending Plans Will ‘Get Control of Inflation’

Moments after denying that inflation is spiking, Biden claimed that it’s his administration’s plans, including massive spending plans such as the misnomered Inflation Reduction Act, that will “get control of inflation.”

“Is the economy going to get worse before it gets better?” “60 Minutes” interviewer Pelley asked.

“No, I don’t think so. We hope, we hope we can have what they say a soft landing,” Biden said. “…I’m telling the American people that we are going to get control of inflation. And their prescription drug prices are going to be a hell of a lot lower. Their health care costs are going to be a lot lower. Their basic costs for everybody. Their energy prices are going to be lower.”

Despite Biden’s self-professed optimism about the economy, reports from financial analysts including those at the Congressional Budget Office say Democrats’ spending will make inflation over the next five years much worse, not better, as Biden and his party claimed.

183. Biden Repeats Civil Rights Activist Fib

During a Labor Day speech Biden claimed that, as a child, he became “very engaged in my case in the civil rights movement.”

“As a kid, I worked a lot in the movement,” Biden said.

Not only did Biden himself admit in 1987 that he was “not out marching” and “not down in Selma,” but even the media have repeatedly debunked Biden’s false assertions that he was “an activist.”

181. Biden Says Inflation Reduction Act Will Not Raise Taxes On Americans Earning Less than $400K

During an Aug. 16 signing ceremony for the Democrat Party’s $740 billion “Inflation Reduction Act,” Biden claimed that “no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes” once the legislation takes effect.

Biden’s assertion, however, runs contrary to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which estimates that Americans earning less than $400,000 a year “will pay an estimated $20 billion more in taxes over the next decade” as a result of the bill, “which also sets aside $80 billion to hire 87,000 IRS agents.”

180. Biden Says ‘Zero’ Inflation in July Following 8.5 Percent Rise

July’s consumer price index yielded a whopping 8.5 percent inflation increase since the same time last year, but according to Biden, July actually had no inflation whatsoever.

“I just want to say a number: zero,” Biden said in an address on Aug. 10. “Today, we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation in the month of July. Here is what that means: While the price of some things went up last month, the price of other things went down by the same amount.”

Though the CPI figures were down slightly from the 9.1 percent recorded in June, the prices for everyday necessities such as groceries and electricity continue to shoot upward, with the latest numbers showing a 10.9 and 15.2 percent increase, respectively, since last year.

179. Biden Claims He Has Cancer

In a “climate crisis” speech about fossil fuels in Massachusetts on July 20, Biden incorrectly claimed that he has cancer caused by oil pollution in his home state. Biden said that growing up, pollution in Delaware was so bad that his mother had to use windshield wipers to “get literally the oil slick off the window.”

“That’s why I and so d-mn many other people I grew up [with] have cancer,” Biden said.

Biden says that his mother using windshield wipers to ""get literally the oil slick off the window"" is ""why I and so damn many other people have cancer."" pic.twitter.com/YIoBlZadRJ — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) July 20, 2022

The White House physician quickly released a statement clarifying that Biden “remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

The physician noted that Biden “has had several non-melanoma skin cancers removed” before.

178. Biden Pretends He Wrote Law Review Articles About Right to Privacy

During a speech about the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision, Biden claimed he had written “a number of law review articles” about the right to privacy referenced in the now-overturned Roe v. Wade decision.

“And I have written, way back, a number of law review articles about the Ninth Amendment and the — and the 14th Amendment and why that privacy is considered as part of a constitutional guarantee. And the — they’ve just wiped it all out,” he said.

Biden may have helped pen close to 19 law review articles — and even flunked a law school class after plagiarizing portions of someone else’s law review article in one of his papers — but has never had a review published on the “right to privacy.”

As The Washington Post noted, the closest thing Biden has to a law review on the 14th Amendment is a 1991 opinion article in the Philadelphia Inquirer.

177. White House Silent on Biden’s Hunter Lies

When asked about Joe Biden’s voicemail indicating that he knew about Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said she could not “comment on any materials from [Hunter’s] laptop.”

Biden previously promised to “always level” with the American people but has repeatedly lied about his son’s financial activity despite copious evidence that he may have been involved in some of Hunter’s transactions.

176. Biden Lies About Billionaire Tax Rate

Biden tweeted that there are approximately 790 billionaires who are taxed at an average rate of 8 percent. He went on to claim that “I believe that no billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, an electrician, or a cop.”

As Carol Roth, a former investment banker and economic commentator noted in a Twitter thread investigating the president’s claims, Biden’s assertion that billionaire tax rates are low is not only misleading, but it’s also false.

According to Roth, the study the White House used to determine what Biden claims is the billionaire tax rate does not rely on normal factors such as tax records and income. Instead, it included unsold stock.

“What they are using is not INCOME at all, it is stock appreciation, NOT realized. This is a made-up proxy of a wealth tax,” Roth tweeted.

As Roth noted in her analysis, “this is not how income tax works, and it is straight up a lie to say this an income tax rate for billionaires and portray it as an average tax rate of the ‘wealthiest.’”

Roth said the Biden administration intentionally “took a one time event and used it to compare to yearly taxes.”

175. Biden Repeats ‘Fastest-Growing Economy’ Lie

Biden told Jimmy Kimmel during a June 8 interview that the U.S. has the “fastest-growing economy in the world.”

Not only did the American economy shrink last quarter, but it is also plagued with record-high inflation and gas prices, a supply-chain crisis, and a baby formula shortage that has put several babies in hospitals.

174. Biden Says Trump Abused Constitutional Authority

During an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Biden agreed with accusations that Trump passed out executive orders “like Halloween candy.” He also accused the former president of abusing “the Constitution and constitutional authority” by issuing executive orders.

“I have issued executive orders,” Biden said after promising he wouldn’t issue executive action on guns, something he has already done. “But what I don’t want to do is emulate Trump’s abuse of the Constitution and constitutional authority. I mean that sincerely because I often get asked — look, the Republicans don’t play it square, why do you play it square? Well, guess what. If we do the same thing they do, our democracy will literally be in jeopardy.”

While Biden blames Trump for what he says is an excessive amount of executive orders, the facts show Biden is on track to outpace the former president’s executive authority tally. During his first few months in office, Biden clocked more than 42 orders. Trump, on the other hand, issued 33.

173. White House Says Economy Is ‘In a Better Place’ Now than Historically

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters in a press briefing on Tuesday that Biden’s administration believes “the economy is in a better place than it has been historically.”

Jean-Pierre: ""What we're trying to say is that the economy is in a better place than it has been historically."" pic.twitter.com/KIO61OnGNN — Greg Price (@greg_price11) June 7, 2022

Not only do voters reject this lie, but so do the facts. Inflation in the U.S. has reached record highs nearly every month recently as the supply-chain crisis and national staffing shortage drag on. Since Biden assumed office, gas prices have more than doubled.

There’s also a baby formula shortage that began when Biden’s Food and Drug Administration shut down a plant. It took months for the White House to address the critical crisis that left several young children and babies hospitalized.

172. White House Repeats Lie that Semiautomatic Gun Ban Decreased Mass Shootings

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeated the lie that Congress’s 1994 semiautomatic gun ban decreased mass shootings.

“When he — when we talk about the executive actions that he’s taken — more than any president at this time of their administration — those are real steps that this president has taken. And not just as president, during his Senate years, in 1994, the banning of assault weapons; that is something that he led on,” she said during a press briefing on June 6. “And if we even look at what happened those first 10 years of that — of that assault [weapons ban] was in law — into law, it actually brought down mass shootings. And when it — when it expired in 2004, 10 years later, we saw mass shootings triple.”

A 2004 study funded by the Department of Justice, however, found that the Clinton-era ban was not the reason shootings decreased in the U.S.

“We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury,” the report stated. “The ban’s impact on gun violence is likely to be small at best, and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. AWs [assault weapons] were used in no more than 8% of gun crimes even before the ban.”

171. White House Says Biden Believes Excessive Federal Spending Helped Economy

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told members of the press on June 6 that Biden believes his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan actually helped the economy instead of contributing to its problems.

“I want to say the Rescue Plan has really been able to help us, put us in an economic, a place where we’re stronger. And … this is something that we have to really continue to remember, we are in an economic crisis. And the president met that moment by putting forth the American Rescue Plan, by Democrats on the Hill voting for that plan, and really putting us in a place where we look at today in a much stronger economic situation where we can actually deal with inflation head-on,” Jean-Pierre said. “We have a lot of work to do and we understand what the American people are feeling, but we are in a stronger place to take that on.”

It’s a repeat talking point from the administration but one that holds no water against record-high inflation and gas prices.

170. Biden Claims He Initiated Fastest Economic Recovery

During a speech on June 6, Biden claimed that “my plans have produced the strongest, fastest, most widespread economic recovery America has ever experienced.”

Biden also bragged about “record jobs, new record small businesses, and wages rising,” but he did not mention that inflation has far outpaced those hikes for months now. The president also did not mention that gas prices have more than doubled since he assumed office in January of 2021.

Meanwhile, Americans deal with a prolonged supply-chain crisis, inflation, and rising gas prices that the administration refuses to take responsibility for.

169. Biden Says Gun Manufacturers Have Blanket Immunity that Doesn’t Exist

President Biden claimed gun manufacturers enjoy blanket immunity on how their firearms are used.

“We should repeal the liability shield that all protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons,” Biden said in a gun speech on the evening of June 2. “They are the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity.”

BIDEN: Gun manufacturers ""are the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity."" pic.twitter.com/OsmclOQyZx — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) June 2, 2022

Biden’s claim, however, enjoys no merit. Suing a gun company for a gun that fires when the trigger is pulled is akin to suing the Coors Brewing Company because beer got people drunk.

The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which became law in 2005, protects firearm manufacturers from liability for weapons used in a crime. Companies, however, may still be sued for negligence, breach of contract over gun purchases, and weapons defects.

168. Biden Says Deficit Cut Under Him Will Be Largest in History

“The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the deficit will fall by $1.7 trillion this year – the largest reduction in history,” Biden wrote in his WSJ op-ed.

That’s a misleading claim, however, that doesn’t capture just how huge Biden’s budget deficit remains. History shows that this year’s $1 trillion deficit will be “the 7th worst on record.”

167. Biden Claims Economy Was Already Bad Before Covid-19

“Things should also look different from the decades before the pandemic, when too often we had low growth, low wage gains, and an economy that worked best for the wealthiest Americans,” Biden wrote in his opinion editorial detailing “My Plan For Fighting Inflation.”

From 2017 to 2019 under Trump, however, GDP growth averaged 2.54 percent. Hourly earnings were also up 2.97 percent and outpaced the 2.13 percent inflation rate.

“In 2019, median household income saw its largest increase on record. The unemployment rate hit its lowest rate in nearly 50 years, poverty rates for all races were the lowest on record, and income inequality declined,” the America First Policy Institute determined.

166. Biden Repeats Putin Price Hike Lie

“The price at the pump is elevated in large part because Russian oil, gas, and refining capacity are off the market,” Biden wrote in his inflation article in the Wall Street Journal.

Gas prices started rising long before the Russia Ukraine war. When Biden assumed office and waged a war on domestic oil and gas production by shutting down drilling and pipelines, gasoline prices rose significantly. From Biden’s inauguration to the week Russia invaded Ukraine, gas prices in the U.S. rose from $2.38 per gallon to $3.53 per gallon.

165. Biden Claims He Inherited ‘Stalled Economy’

Biden wrote in his inflation op-ed that “In January 2021, when I took office, the recovery had stalled.”

Shortly before Biden was inaugurated, however, the economy measured an annualized growth rate of 4.5 percent.

164. Biden Says Americans Are Better Paid Under His Administration

Biden claimed in his Wall Street Journal op-ed that “millions of Americans getting jobs with better pay” now that he is in office.

While earnings under Biden have risen 5.5 percent, real wages are down 2.8 percent and prices keep rising above the current 8.3 percent rate.

“The average American has lost about $1,350 in purchasing power from President Biden’s inflation tax,” the America First Policy Institute calculated.

163. Biden Claims He Initiated ‘Fastest Decline in Unemployment on Record’

In his opinion editorial detailing “My Plan For Fighting Inflation,” Biden falsely claimed that his administration is responsible for “the fastest decline in unemployment on record.”

“The job market is the strongest since the post-World War II era, with 8.3 million new jobs, the fastest decline in unemployment on record, and millions of Americans getting jobs with better pay,” he wrote.

Records, however, show that employment from May 2020 to January 2021 under Trump grew by 12.5 million. During that time period, the unemployment rate also declined 8.3 percent, which is 5.7 percent more than the fall measured under Biden’s watch.

162: Biden Repeats False Cannon Claim

Shortly before Biden signed an executive order on policing, he repeated his claim that when the Second Amendment was created, “You couldn’t own a cannon.”

“You couldn’t own certain kinds of weapons. There’s always been limitations,” he said while arguing in favor of more restrictions on Americans’ rights to keep and bear firearms.

Not only were cannons legal when the Consitution was drafted, but they are also legal now. Revolutionary and Civil War-era cannons that don’t take a cartridge can be bought and sold as saluting and signaling devices in the United States. Certain modern artillery cannons that do take cartridges are classified as destructive devices and are legal and regulated under the National Firearms Act.

161: Biden Lies About Number of Times He’s Visited the Middle East

During his commencement speech at the U.S. Naval Academy in May, Biden claimed he has been to Iraq and Afghanistan “38 times.”

“I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 — I think 38 times,” Biden stated.

Not only did his own campaign confirm in 2019 that this was not true after the first time he stated this falsehood, but even The Washington Post fact-checked him on the erroneous claim.

Biden also implied that his son Beau Biden died in combat even though he passed away from cancer.

“My son spent a year in Iraq, won the Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal. I lost him,” Biden said.

160: Biden Says He Received Appointment to Naval Academy

Biden told graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy at their May commencement that he had received an appointment to attend the academy in 1965.

“Before I begin my speech, a thought crossed my mind as I was told the class of ‘72 is here. I was appointed to the academy in 1965 by a senator who I was running against in 1972,” Biden said. “Never planned it that way. I wasn’t old enough to be sworn in. I was only 29 years old when I was running. He was a fine man, and his name was J. Caleb Boggs.”

Biden went on to say that he declined to attend the academy “because I wanted to be a football star” and “you had a guy named Staubach and Bellino here.”

“So I went to Delaware,” he added.

Joe Biden falsely claimed he “was appointed to the [Naval] Academy in 1965” while speaking to Naval Academy graduates today.



Biden graduated from the University of Delaware in 1965, making that impossible. pic.twitter.com/oSTmjeqSLb — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) May 27, 2022

At the time described in Biden’s claim, however, the future president was graduating from the University of Delaware. The football players he mentioned as deterrents to his dream of being a football star had also previously graduated, Roger Staubach in 1965 and Joe Bellino in 1961.

159: White House Says Biden Came Up With ‘Ultra MAGA’ Label Himself

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki claimed in a May 10 press conference that President Biden came with the “ultra MAGA” label to define his political opponents all on his own.

“It’s the president’s phrase, and the president made those comments himself,” Psaki said.

The Washington Post revealed on May 13, however, that the label is the product of a “six-month research project” by the left-wing group Center for American Progress Action Fund with former Harvey Weinstein apologist Anita Dunn.

158: Biden Says There Was No Vaccine Available When He Took Office

The White House claimed no coronavirus vaccine was available when President Biden took office in a May 12 tweet.

Operation Warp Speed however, a project to fast-track development for the pandemic disease, produced vaccines in record time. In fact, about 1.3 million Americans were given inoculations on Biden’s first day in office, surpassing the vaccination pace President Biden pledged of 100 million doses distributed in his first 100 days to mark another accomplishment of Donald Trump.

Biden even received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine before taking office.

157: Biden Claims Roaring Economy He Inherited Was On ‘Brink Of A Great Depression’

At a May 11 address in Chicago, President Biden portrayed himself the savior an economy nearing collapse, except the economy was on a rebound from the short-lived pandemic recession that lockdowns threatened to restrain.

“We had an economy on the brink of a Great Depression,” Biden said, despite the nation’s economy not contracting until a year into the president’s term.

According to data from the Department of Commerce, quarterly GDP remained positive until this year, when it decreased 1.4 percent in the first quarter. Real GDP growth under Biden’s first quarter in office was higher than it had been in at least three years as the economy recovered from Democrats’ shutdowns.

156: Biden Claims Vote To Block Abortion Bill Was Partisan. But Joe Manchin Also Voted No

President Biden condemned Republicans on May 11 for their unified rejection of an abortion guarantee written into federal law ahead of a potential decision from the Supreme Court to terminate Roe v. Wade as ruling precedent.

“Once again – as fundamental rights are at risk at the Supreme Court – Senate Republicans have blocked passage of the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that affirmatively protects access to reproductive health care,” Biden said.

But West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, also rejected the bill.

Manchin explained his opposition to the bill on Capitol Hill.

“I respect people who support” it, Manchin said of the bill, which would prevent states from passing restrictions on abortions before fetal viability, and would further allow women to kill their unborn babies if a physician determined the baby was “a risk to the pregnant patient’s life or health” — which could easily be interpreted to broadly include a variety of things under the banner of emotional health.

“Make no mistake. It is not Roe v. Wade codification,” Machin continued. “It’s an expansion. It wipes 500 state laws off the books.”

155: Biden Once Again Blames Inflation on Putin and Covid Pandemic

Inflation reached a four-decade high last month, but, contrary to what Biden said during a speech on economics, Vladimir Putin and Covid-19 are not chiefly to blame.

“There are two leading causes of inflation we’re seeing today,” Biden said. “The first cause of inflation is a once-in-a-century-pandemic … [and] a second cause: Mr. Putin’s war in Ukraine.”

BIDEN: ""There are two leading causes of inflation we're seeing today""



1) ""a once-in-a-century pandemic""

2) ""Mr. Putin's war in Ukraine""



MORE: https://t.co/IVmGxHlAWA pic.twitter.com/Hs1Zw0gmdH — NEWSMAX (@NEWSMAX) May 10, 2022

Inflation, especially for fuel, was already a problem long before the Russia-Ukraine conflict began because Biden waged an open war on the domestic oil and gas industry. On his first day in office, the Democrat nuked the Keystone XL pipeline because it threatened his green energy agenda. Since then, Biden has also canceled Arctic drilling leases and rained down taxes and regulations on domestic production.

Since Biden first assumed office in January of 2021, prices of gasoline, food, rent, and other items have skyrocketed. These price hikes only worsened after Congress passed Biden’s $1.9 trillion federal spending bill.

154: Biden Says Inflation Is His ‘Top Domestic Priority’

During an inflation speech, Biden claimed that tackling inflation is his “top domestic priority.”

“I want every American to know that I am taking inflation very seriously and it’s my top domestic priority,” Biden said.

Biden says he’s “taking inflation very seriously” but so far this week, his administration has been far more preoccupied with rejecting the Supreme Court’s leaked Dobbs v. Jackson draft opinion, which could see the court overturn Roe v. Wade, than soothing American consumers’ fears about a recession.

He also gave no indication that he plans to reinstate the American energy independence achieved under the Trump administration to lower gas prices, which rank as one of the highest inflation jumps each month.

153: Biden Said Robert Bork Thought Government Gave Americans Rights

Biden claimed Judge Robert Bork, the Supreme Court nominee he infamously torpedoed and smeared for his “original-intent judicial philosophy,” believed the government gives people rights.

“Bork believed the only reason you had any inherent rights was because the government gave them to you,” Biden said.

While Bork did appear to reject natural law as a guiding legal philosophy, he acknowledged its existence and never claimed to believe that inherent rights come from the government. Instead, Bork referred to rights in his confirmation hearings as something that could be transferred between parties but did not clarify how they were bestowed.

“What a court adds to one person’s constitutional rights, it subtracts from the rights of others,” Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois quoted Bork saying before asking whether Bork still believed that.

”Well, yes, Senator,” Bork said. ”I think it’s a matter of plain arithmetic.”

152: Biden Accuses ‘MAGA Crowd’ of Being ‘the Most Extreme Political Organization … in American History’

In a rant about the Supreme Court’s leaked Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization opinion signaling the end of Roe v. Wade, Biden accused the “MAGA crowd” of being “the most extreme political organization that’s existed in American history,” before adding, “recent American history.”

Joe Biden says that overturning Roe v. Wade could lead to LGBT children not being allowed in school classrooms:



""This MAGA crowd is the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history."" pic.twitter.com/WyW6j52ju0 — Greg Price (@greg_price11) May 4, 2022

Biden failed to acknowledge that there are far more extreme and violent groups operating within the U.S., who have initiated deadly terrorist attacks on Americans, than the millions of people who voted for and support former President Donald Trump.

He also falsely suggested that the SCOTUS ruling on Dobbs would allow states to bar LGBTQ students from attending class with other students.

“If you have states change the law saying that children who are LGBTQ can’t be in classrooms with other children. Is that legit under the way that the decision is written?” he asked.

There is no mention of LGBT children or classrooms in the Dobbs draft.

151: Biden Blames Putin for Months-Long, Record-High Inflation

Inflation reached a 40-year high last month, but Vladimir Putin and Covid-19 are not to blame, contrary to what Biden likes to suggest.

“I know that families are still struggling with higher prices. I grew up in a family where if the price of gas went up, we felt it. Let’s be absolutely clear about why prices are high right now: COVID and Vladimir Putin,” Biden wrote in a tweet on April 20.

The truth is, inflation, especially for fuel, was already a problem long before the Russia-Ukraine conflict began because Biden waged an open war on the domestic oil and gas industry. On his first day in office, the Democrat nuked the Keystone XL pipeline because it threatened his green energy agenda. Since then, Biden has also canceled Arctic drilling leases and rained down taxes and regulations on domestic production.

Since Biden first assumed office in January of 2021, prices of gasoline, food, rent, and other items have skyrocketed. These price hikes only worsened after Congress passed Biden’s $1.9 trillion federal spending bill.

150: Biden Repeats Lie that Buying American Products Is a Priority

Despite his refusal to utilize the U.S. oil industry to achieve energy independence, Biden said buying American-made products is a priority for his administration.

“From Day One, every action I’ve taken to rebuild our economy has been guided by one principle: Make it in America. That means using products, parts, and materials built right here in the United States of America,” the president tweeted.

Biden told a similar lie during his State of the Union address shortly after the White House defended buying at least $1.3 billion worth of Covid-19 rapid tests from China instead of U.S. manufacturers.

149: Biden Claims He Was A ‘Full Professor’ At The University Of Pennsylvania

Biden repeated a claim on April 14 that he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, this time claiming “full” professorship despite his 2017-2019 tenure being an honorary position.

“For four years I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania,” Biden said during an event on supply chains in Greensboro, North Carolina.

Joe Biden says he was a ""full professor"" at UPenn.

Biden however, didn’t teach at the university, according to a spokesperson for the former vice president at the time he was hired.

The Daily Pennsylvanian headlined a piece ahead of Biden’s arrival, “No one is really sure what Joe Biden will be doing at Penn.”

According to the New York Post, Biden raked in more than $900,000 from the university despite rare appearances.

148: Biden Says You Couldn’t Buy Cannons When Second Amendment Passed

During his gun violence speech on April 11, Biden repeated the lie that cannons couldn’t be bought when the Second Amendment was ratified.

“You couldn’t buy a cannon when the Second Amendment passed,” Biden claimed.

147: Biden Says Gun Manufacturers Can’t Be Sued

Biden said gunmakers are immune from prosecution even though manufacturers can be sued if a firearm is faulty or malfunctions.

“Gun manufacturers have more immunity from liability than any other American industry,” Biden falsely claimed. “So they’ve never had to take responsibility for the death and destruction their products cause.”

BIDEN: ""Gun manufacturers have more immunity from liability than any other American industry."" pic.twitter.com/2Qkz50AL2W — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) April 11, 2022

Biden also claimed that gun manufacturers are “the only outfit in the country that is immune,” even though many of the manufacturers who created the Covid-19 jab are immune to prosecution.

146: Biden Claims His Family Worried About Gas Prices As a Kid

“I grew up in a family like many of you where the price of a gallon of gasoline went up, it was discussed at the kitchen table,” Biden claimed.

But, as RealClearMarket’s John Tamny noted after Biden told a similar lie in February, Biden “was born in 1942. When Biden was growing up, the price of gasoline was flat. And it was cheap.”

A chart from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows the price of crude oil nearly flat from the 1880s until the 1970s — far after Joe Biden’s childhood.

145: Biden Says ‘Nothing’ Stopping Domestic Oil Production Even Though He Is

Biden said there’s “nothing standing in the way” of domestic oil companies ramping up production as gas prices skyrocket but his claims are far from the truth.

Even before he assumed office, Biden pledged to take down the domestic oil industry in favor of pushing his green agenda. This involved canceling the permits necessary for the Keystone XL pipeline, halting new oil and gas leases, and more recently, delaying permits for drilling on federal land.

144: Biden Falsely Claims Transgenderism Is ‘Safe and Healthy’

Biden told parents of children suffering from gender confusion that “affirming your child’s identity is one of the most powerful things you can do to keep them safe and healthy.”

Despite Biden’s claims, encouraging young children to take hormone blockers, bind, or engage in other physically altering “treatments” or dangerous and risky procedures is not safe nor healthy. In addition to causing a myriad of harmful side effects including sterility, severe dysfunction, and other health problems, pushing children to embrace an identity different than their God-given sex often leads to transition regret as well as an exponentially higher risk of suicide.

143: Biden Says He Never Watched KBJ’s Confirmation Hearings

Biden told reporters that he “didn’t get a chance to see any of” Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearings last week even though the White House said he did.

“The president watched portions of Judge Jackson’s hearing yesterday and today,” a White House staffer announced in a press briefing last week.

It is unclear if Biden simply forgot that he viewed the hearings or if the White House lied about how the president spends his time.

142: Biden Repeats ‘Very Fine People’ Lie to Smear Trump

During a press conference at the NATO summit in Belgium, Biden repeated the lie that Trump called the Charlottesville white nationalists “very fine people.”

The man literally began his presidential campaign on a lie. pic.twitter.com/hJlu8EDFCG — Greg Price (@greg_price11) March 24, 2022

Transcripts show that Trump’s “very fine people” line was in reference to the peaceful protesters on both sides who were civilly expressing their opinions about Confederate statues.

“But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group — excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name,” Trump said.

Trump specifically said he was “not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally,” but Biden still brings up the hoax on occasion.

141: Biden Says Unemployment Claims Down

Biden claimed that because unemployment claims are down because “our labor market is strong.”

Today we learned that the number of new unemployment claims is now lower than it was before the pandemic in 2019.



Our labor market is strong. — President Biden (@POTUS) March 17, 2022

The truth is, restaurants, hospitals, and businesses across the nation are struggling to stay open amid staffing shortages caused by an influx of federal cash. Record numbers of people left their jobs and even the labor market last year after multiple rounds of stimulus checks. Currently, more than 11 million jobs need to be filled and there aren’t enough workers willing to take those positions.

140: Biden Denies Cutting Off Domestic Oil Production

Shortly after he announced Russian oil would no longer be imported into the U.S., Biden claimed that he never stifled the U.S. oil and gas industry.

“It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production. That is simply not true,” Biden insisted.

PANTS ON FIRE: Biden says some high gas prices could be b/c of price-gouging & it's a lie to say he's stifled domestic energy.



""It's no time for profiteering or price gauging…It's simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production."" pic.twitter.com/PtJNHDufYy — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) March 8, 2022

The truth is, Biden has done nothing but sabotage the U.S. oil and gas industry and replaced it with his green energy policy agenda. The president used his first year in office to wreck domestic production by suspending oil and gas leases, axing projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office, canceling Arctic drilling leases, and pushing a cascade of taxes and regulation on the industry.

As a result, domestic gas prices were rising dramatically well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Painful prices at the pump have quickly become a sore spot for Americans, many of whom have indicated they’re looking for a change in the November midterms.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/08/heres-the-full-list-of-every-lie-joe-biden-has-told-as-president-part-three/,2022-03-08
Biden Doesn't Want Your Gas To Be $4,"Gas prices in the United States hit a new all-time high under President Joe Biden’s watch on Tuesday, clocking in at an average of $4.17 per gallon, surpassing the previous record of $4.11 set in 2008.

A friend told me he recently saw prices jump 50 cents from the time he drove to work to the time he drove home. A gas station in Florida I stopped at last month had two “I did that” stickers on it. After someone had apparently tried to rip them off, someone else took a blue ballpoint pen and scrawled “FJB” on the front of the gas pump. Similar stickers have popped up in growing numbers all around the country.

the gas station in beverly i’m at has had to rip off four biden “i did that” stickers on this pump pic.twitter.com/WHtZzYgioF — kaitlin (@thefactualprep) February 11, 2022

It’s obvious to everyone paying attention (except for Biden and his corporate media comms shop… but that’s redundant) that the Democrat administration’s policies, not just the Russians, are to blame for rising prices at the pump. The third week of February, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine started, the average price of U.S. gas was $3.53 per gallon, compared with $2.38 the week Biden took office: a $1.15 difference. (That fact hasn’t stopped Press Secretary Jen Psaki from lying through her teeth to blame the spike entirely on Russia.)

But, bumbling though they are, the Biden administration did not just achieve rising gas prices through accidents and incompetence. Your pain at the pump isn’t just unforeseen collateral damage of the White House’s policies — it’s a very intentional result of it.

That’s right: Biden wants staggering gas prices to force you from being able to drive where you want, when you want, as much as you want to. It’s all a part of his green energy agenda, which panders to radicals on the far-left side of Biden’s ever-further-left party.

A video from Americans for Tax Reform shows Biden at a campaign rally pledging, “We are gonna get rid of fossil fuels.” Asked “would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?” by CNN’s Dana Bash during one of the Democratic primary debates in 2019, Biden responded “No.”

“We would — we would work it out,” he continued. “We would make sure it’s eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those, either — any fossil fuel.” Eliminated.

In the same debate and at many other moments, Biden has made clear his desire for the United States to erase gas-driven cars for electric vehicles. “My plan calls for 500,000 charging stations around the country so by 2030 we’re all electric vehicles,” he said at the time (a plan he’s unlikely to reach in the next eight years). If they want to get rid of your car, don’t think they wouldn’t start by trying to squeeze your gas tank dry.

When Biden’s damage control team has tried to soften his anti-oil remarks, even leftists can see through it. “Of course Biden meant what he said about fossil fuels. There is a price to fighting climate change,” headlined an op-ed in the Washington Post in October 2020.

His actions have backed that agenda up, too, from canceling the Keystone XL pipeline to suspending new drillings on federal lands to moving us away from the energy independence the U.S. established under former president Trump. That agenda has been apparent even in the Biden administration’s tone-deaf responses to the current spike in gas prices.

Psaki’s No. 1 takeaway from the gas crisis is to remind everyday Americans that it’s a good time for “reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,” as if rising prices play directly into the gleeful administration’s hands.

No 1 point from @PressSec about energy production is that energy production is up & it’s “a reminder” to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel. https://t.co/TCbwJmtAC1 — Philip Melanchthon Wegmann (@PhilipWegmann) March 6, 2022

Vice President Kamala Harris, who has failed in every sector she’s been appointed to take charge of, spent Monday afternoon with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg promoting the administration’s anti-gas messaging and suggesting that perhaps Americans should just eat cake buy electric cars.

The average cost of an electric vehicle is $56,437, “equivalent to an entry-level luxury car.” But the financial reality that most Americans don’t have 50 grand to drop on a Tesla didn’t stop Harris from fantasizing about a world in which all of your gas-guzzling trucks, minivans, and school buses are in the junkyard.

“Imagine a future: the freight trucks that deliver bread and milk to our grocery store shelves and the buses that take children to school and parents to work. Imagine all the heavy-duty vehicles that keep our supply lines strong and allow our economy to grow. Imagine that they produce zero emissions,” she said.

“We have the ability to see what can be unburdened by what has been and then to make the possible actually happen,” she continued, in her trademark word salad.

Press Wield Biden's Russia Excuses To Gaslight Americans About Gas,"The propaganda press is wielding the Biden administration’s excuses about Russia to gaslight Americans about skyrocketing prices at the gas pump.

Despite the fact that domestic gas prices rose dramatically well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Joe Biden and his team refuse to take responsibility for rising costs at gas stations. When the price of gas shot up nearly 50 cents more per gallon this week, the White House scrambled to set a narrative that once again exonerated the Biden administration from a self-inflicted crisis that could hurt Democrats in the 2022 midterms.

“It’s going to go up,” Biden claimed on Tuesday shortly after he halted Russian oil imports to punish Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine. “Can’t do much right now. Russia is responsible.”

“Putin’s war is already hurting Americans at the gas pump,” Biden added in a press conference. “Since Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian borders … the price at the gas pump in America went up 75 cents. … I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.”

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also lied about the effects Biden’s poor energy policy has had on Americans, blaming the Russian-Ukraine conflict for rising gas prices. “The increase,” she said, “is a direct result of the invasion of Ukraine.”

One day later, the corrupt media predictably latched onto this convenient narrative in their own coverage of the record-high gasoline price spike.

“‘Putin’s price hike’ will be borne by American consumers,” ABC News tweeted, echoing the Biden administration’s talking points.

Outlets such as CNN smeared Republicans for pointing out Biden’s obvious role in exacerbating the country’s energy troubles and making Americans pay for his ignorance.

“[Republicans] largely ignored the global factors left over from the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine that are weighing on gasoline costs,” CNN claimed. “And they accused Biden of leaving Americans vulnerable to energy shocks overseas by canceling the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada when he first took office. They claimed he doomed Americans to high gasoline prices by pausing oil and gas leases on public lands and by suspending oil leases in Arctic refuges to fight climate change.”

Politico claimed that “they have also used the topic to criticize Biden for limiting domestic oil and gas production that they argue can fill the gap created by a Russian import ban.”

Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell also recently accused the GOP of “laying a trap for Biden on Russian energy sanctions.”

MSNBC and NBC also jumped at the opportunity to pile on Republicans instead of indicting Biden for his policy failures.

“Republicans cheer Russian oil ban and jeer Biden for rising gas prices,” NBC reporters Sahil Kapur and Scott Wong wrote.

Next phase to watch from Republicans:

– many pushed for russian oil ban. Will they work with WH to find way to pump more fast and ease economic burden on consumers? OR cheer on higher prices / blaming Biden for inflation? — Stephanie Ruhle (@SRuhle) March 8, 2022

The truth is, Biden has played an explicit role in limiting the U.S. oil industry but the corrupt media are conveniently ignoring his track record when they cover rising prices at the pump.

On his first day in office, Biden nuked the Keystone XL pipeline because it threatened his green energy agenda. Over the last year, the president has also canceled Arctic drilling leases, rained down taxes and regulation on domestic production, and publicly declared war on oil and gas.

Instead of turning to domestic production to fill the hole left by Russian imports, Biden is considering buying oil from other corrupt pro-Moscow regimes.

CNN, ABC, The Washington Post, and other corporate media outlets aren’t mentioning the president’s anti-oil agenda in their coverage of expensive gas. Instead, most of them are refusing to mention him at all but they are happy to use the White House’s talking points.

Since before Biden assumed office, corrupt outlets have tried to absolve him of any blame for crises he created. The drastic jump in gas prices after Biden waged a war on oil and gas, unfortunately, is no exception.

We Knew From His Campaign Joe Biden Would Set Foreign Policy On Fire,"American voters usually prioritize domestic issues over foreign policy during presidential elections. But several major blunders just in President Biden’s first year show the danger of not closely scrutinizing presidential candidates’ records on foreign policy.

During the 2020 election, foreign policy-related questions barely came up in any of the debates between President Donald Trump and Biden. The presidential debate commission in fact pulled foreign policy from their debate topics, perhaps to hide Biden’s weakness.

A YouGov survey in 2020 showed that 77 percent of Americans believed domestic issues were more important than foreign policy when choosing the next U.S. president. Additionally, people may have assumed foreign policy was Biden’s strong suit, since he was a U.S. senator for three decades and vice president under President Obama for eight.

Such an assumption couldn’t be further from the truth. Robert Gates, a defense secretary in the Obama administration, said Biden has “been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”

Trump Was the Clear Foreign Policy Champ

In contrast, foreign policy was one of the bright spots in the Trump presidency. He orchestrated the historical Abraham Peace Accords among Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. His pivot to the Indo-Pacific was far more successful than President Obama’s pivot to Asia initiative.

Under Trump, the United States took a hard line on China, improved its relationship with India (the only Asian power that could check China), and expanded cooperation with allies by establishing the Quad, an unofficial alliance with Australia, India, and Japan. However, since most corporate media were anti-Trump, few wanted to give him any credit for his foreign policy accomplishments.

Instead, major media criticized Trump for being “soft” on Russia for his entire presidency. After Trump left the office, Fareed Zakaria of CNN finally admitted, “the Trump administration was pretty tough on the Russians. They armed Ukraine. They armed the Poles. They extended NATO operations and exercises in ways that even the Obama administration had not done.”

The combination of low public interest in foreign policy and a media that was willing to do everything to get Biden elected resulted in little scrutiny of Biden’s extensive foreign policy failures.

Joe Biden Botched Things From His First Day

During his campaign, Biden promised the American people that he would “go toe-to-toe” with Russia. But just within his first 48 hours in office, Biden delivered two gifts to Russia.

First, he rescinded the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline project, which would have created tens of thousands of jobs for American workers and delivered 830,000 barrels of oil daily from Canada. The cancellation of Keystone was the first of a series of the Biden administration’s “war on fossil fuel” policies that have strangled the U.S. energy industry and ended U.S. energy independence.

Biden’s energy polices not only hurt American workers and the American economy, but also had foreign policy repercussions. His policies caused gas price inflation, and provided Vladimir Putin the financial resources to cause nuisance worldwide, including invading Ukraine.

Biden’s second gift to Putin was to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, with Russia for another five years without fixing the treaty’s many flaws. For example, it doesn’t limit Russia’s capacity to pursue nuclear weapons outside the treaty. And China isn’t part of the agreement, even though China has been rapidly building its nuclear weapon capacity.

On Iran, rather than taking advantage of the leverage gifted by the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” economic sanctions, Biden jumped right back to the disastrous 2015 nuclear deal. His appointment of Robert Malley as his special envoy to Iran — a man with a long history of sympathy to Iran’s authoritarian regime and overtly anti-Israeli sentiments — signals that appeasement is now U.S. foreign policy.

Groveling Before China and Russia

China is the most significant strategic rival of the United States, and the Biden administration’s China policies are full of contradictions. It extended some of the Trump administration’s policies, such as adding Chinese companies to an economic blacklist over alleged human rights violations and imposing a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics. Yet Biden’s secretary of state refused to call China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims a “genocide,” and the U.S. Department of Justice quietly shut down its China-focused anti-espionage investigation.

The first sign of how Biden’s domestic policy would affect his foreign policy occurred during a high-level Sino- U.S. meeting in Alaska in March 2021. Biden and his team have often publicly criticized the United States, and through an executive order, Biden promised to address systemic racism in the country. China’s diplomats employed that same rhetoric to dress down American diplomats and attack America’s moral leadership in Alaska. The U.S. diplomats couldn’t mount a strong rebuttal because Democrats believe it.

All these were early warning signs that Biden’s foreign policy would end up empowering America’s adversaries at our expense. Then came the Biden administration’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. It revealed how incompetent and unfocused the Biden administration is. After it, Biden’s approval rating dropped 8 percent.

Americans don’t like to see our military and government humiliated by a group of ragtag militants. We were distraught over the loss of 13 American soldiers during the withdrawal. America’s embarrassing retreat from Afghanistan emboldened adversaries from Moscow to Beijing to Tehran to achieve their aggressive geopolitical goals.

Now Comes Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine

Biden’s poor handling of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a perfect example of how one foreign policy failure led to another and Biden’s domestic agenda constrains his foreign policy. Biden waited until Russia attacked Ukraine to impose his first round of economic sanctions.

After Germany announced it will finally increase its defense budget, Biden followed by stepping up new rounds of severe sanctions. However, he initially exempted Russia’s energy sector from sanctions, hoping energy imports from Russia would help check U.S. gas inflation caused by Biden’s anti-energy policies. Putin uses every dollar we pay for his oil and gas to finance his war on Ukraine as energy prices continue to rise.

Only after huge domestic pressure did Biden announce he will finally ban Russian oil imports. This means even more pain for Americans, as it will likely hike gas prices even further, and gas prices affect the price of just about everything Americans buy.

Yet as recently as his State of the Union speech Biden has made it clear that he remains committed to his “green energy” agenda that means strangling U.S. energy, causing high prices for Americans. Rather than rescinding his ruinous energy policies, the Biden administration is actively courting other authoritarian regimes from Saudi Arabia to Venezuela, hoping to increase their oil imports.

One Horrific Failure After Another

Even more incredibly, while sanctioning Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration reportedly has relied on Russia to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, which would shower another murderous regime with billions of dollars with no guarantee of any change of behaviors. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s chief negotiator, openly bragged that Iran has gotten more than it had expected.

The Biden administration has refused to share any details with the U.S. Congress and the American people. But we can be sure that any good deal for Iran’s mullahs will harm Americans’ safety, our national security, and peace in the Middle East.

Biden’s foreign policy blunders have weakened America’s international standing and sped up America’s decline. Biden’s flaws, especially his stubbornness and refusal to change course even when proven wrong, have become a significant obstacle to America’s prosperity and security.

As the saying goes, “Elections have consequences.” One of the biggest lessons learned from the Biden presidency is that foreign policy and domestic issues are often closely intertwined.

Biden’s presidency still has three long years to go and will encounter many more foreign policy challenges, including the biggest one: China’s likely invasion of Taiwan. If past history is an indicator of the future, thanks to too many Americans’ foolish votes for a known foreign policy bungler, China may end up replacing the United States as the dominant superpower in the new autocracy-friendly world order at the end of Biden’s first term.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/09/we-knew-before-he-took-office-that-joe-biden-would-set-foreign-policy-on-fire/,2022-03-09
"When It Comes To Oil, Biden Never Planned To Put America First","President Joe Biden stood up in front of the nation last Tuesday evening and claimed he wanted to prioritize buying products “made in America.”

“Folks, when we use taxpayers’ dollars to rebuild America, we’re going to do it by buying American. Buy American products. Support American jobs,” Biden told Congress last week.

The Democrat rambled to the nation about the importance of making sure “taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses” and even took a shot at the Trump administration in the process.

“Every administration — Democrat and Republican — says they’ll do it, but we’re actually doing it,” Biden boasted.

Biden can lie about prioritizing U.S. products all he wants, but if the last two weeks have taught us anything it’s that the current administration never actually planned to put America first.

One week after his whopper-riddled speech, Biden announced he would cut off oil imports from Russia as punishment for invading Ukraine. But instead of directing U.S. oil and gas companies to ramp up production, the Biden administration began to orchestrate deals with oil-rich Moscow allies and American enemies such as Iran, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia to compensate for the Russian crude imports, which doubled last year.

Already, the White House sent a delegation to Trump-sanctioned Venezuela to discuss pumping the nation’s state oil into the United States, and as President Nicolás Maduro said, “for the stability of the world.” Venezuela produces 500 percent more methane than U.S. producers, but Biden, who justified his war on U.S. oil by claiming he wanted to prioritize green energy, seems to have turned a blind eye to that fact and appears to be willing to strike a deal anyway. The White House also seems unbothered that just a couple of years ago, the United States tried to overthrow the Maduro regime but is now hoping it will sell Americans oil.

Biden is also considering a trip to Saudi Arabia to negotiate and possibly stimulate more oil production that could be exported globally. As Axios noted, “Biden has chastised Saudi Arabia, and the CIA believes its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was involved in the dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi” but now he seems willing to orchestrate a bargain.

While most of the West was quick to denounce Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine, countries such as Venezuela and Iran have both boosted their relationships and support for the disgraced nation in the last couple of weeks. Even over the last year, Russia, communist China, and Iran have all signaled their willingness to team up and exploit the Iran deal against the United States. The Biden administration previously sought Moscow’s assistance in reviving the Iran nuclear deal, and despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow is still involved in those negotiations that could yield more foreign oil imports to the United States.

Under former President Donald Trump, the United States moved to ditch dealing with corrupt governments for oil and achieved energy independence. But when Biden assumed office, he sabotaged the U.S. oil and gas industry, hoping to replace it with his green energy policy agenda.

The president used his first year in office to choke domestic oil and gas production. He suspended oil and gas leases on public lands, nuked projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office, canceled Arctic drilling leases, and rained down taxes and regulation on the energy industry.

As a result, domestic gas prices rose dramatically well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but Biden refuses to take responsibility. Shortly after he announced Russian oil would no longer be imported into the United States, the president denied cutting off domestic oil production to boost his green energy agenda.

“It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production. That is simply not true,” Biden insisted.

PANTS ON FIRE: Biden says some high gas prices could be b/c of price-gouging & it's a lie to say he's stifled domestic energy.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also lied about the effects Biden’s poor energy policy has had on Americans, blaming the Russian-Ukraine conflict for rising gas prices. “The increase,” she said, “is a direct result of the invasion of Ukraine.” Psaki also claimed that “there was an anticipation” of rising prices.

The same Democrats and corporate media who decried Trump’s “America first” policy and smeared his “Made in America” campaign as a “hypocritical joke” tried to run interference to save Biden’s butt and spin his poor choices, but even their propaganda is falling short with voters.

If Biden cared about putting America and Americans first, he would encourage domestic oil production and lift his restrictions on the oil and gas industry. Instead, Biden and his administration are embracing the struggles caused by stifling American oil and gas production and risking his chances with Americans angry about rising gas prices to promote his green energy agenda.

“It should motivate us to accelerate a transition to clean energy. … Loosening environmental regulations … will not lower energy prices. … Transforming our economy to run on electric vehicles powered by clean energy … will help,” Biden said.

After all, nothing will fulfill Biden’s goal to create a “100 percent clean-energy economy” like forcing Americans to buy $7 a gallon of foreign gas until they can’t afford it any longer.

Gas prices in West Hollywood, California are as high as $7.55.

Bill Maher And Bari Weiss Should Apologize For Backing Joe Biden,"As we face disaster after disaster in just the first year of Joe Biden’s presidency, it’s a good time to remember the anti-woke liberals who disdained Donald Trump and praised Joe Biden as moderate, “decent” ‘ol Uncle Joe from Scranton. That view of Biden was always ridiculous. But amid today’s roiling war and inflation, the disaster that is the Biden presidency now renders such a foolish judgment obscene.

These folks likely will never recant their view that Trump is horrid. Fine. But will they now admit that Biden is horrid as well? If they don’t, they don’t deserve to be taken seriously.

It’s questionable whether they deserve to be taken seriously either way, as the case for Biden’s awfulness before his presidency was manifest. He was always a venal, mendacious, and fraudulent mediocrity.

He lied about his academic record. He publicly slimed and slandered Clarence Thomas, Janice Rogers Brown, and Miguel Estrada. He was a plagiarist. He was wrong about every foreign policy matter in the last 50 years. He said Mitt Romney would put black citizens “back in chains.” He has been credibly accused of sexual misconduct.

Unlike Trump, who focused his fire on his rich or powerful opponents, Biden rails against the little guys who dare to challenge him by calling them “fat” and insisting “you ain’t black.” His corrupt international financial dealings—“ten percent for the big guy” and “son of a b-tch that prosecutor was fired”—are beyond reasonable dispute.

Perhaps the wickedest Bidenism known for certain before the election was how Biden lied, frequently and with abandon, about the tragic car accident that killed his wife and child. Biden claimed repeatedly that the other driver was drunk. That was a vicious lie, as the police report made clear. Indeed, the police record indicates Mrs. Biden was at fault in the accident.

The driver and his family pleaded with Biden to correct the record. He didn’t for years. His refusal means the poor man went to his grave burdened with the calumny that his drunkenness had caused the accident. That is profoundly evil. Joe Biden did that.

All of this was known at the time of the 2020 election. But some Very Good Liberals put their fingers in their ears and their hands over their eyes and ignored all this evidence. They did not only hold their noses to vote for Biden. They went out of their way to praise him.

These are the liberals who publicly go aghast at woke nonsense, critical race theory, and transgender extremism, people like Andrew Sullivan, Bari Weiss, and Bill Maher.

There is no better example than Sullivan. In an August 19, 2019 New York Magazine article roasting Trump, Sullivan opined: “I don’t think Biden’s age matters much.” Despite the very public Biden character problems recounted above, Sullivan embarrassingly gushed about Biden: “[D]ecency is the heart of his candidacy. And voting for Joe Biden feels like voting for some things we’ve lost and have one last chance to regain. Normalcy, generosity, civility, experience.”

That was absurd, but perhaps it served a psychological need at the time to draw a Manichean contrast between the two candidates. Still, it would be delusional to maintain that position today. Does Sullivan still think Biden’s age does not “matter much” and that he represents “decency, normalcy, generosity, civility, experience”?

Similarly, Weiss, formerly of The New York Times and now at Substack, wrote on January 22, 2021 that “Biden is an eminently decent and kind man. That fact that his decency seems positively refreshing is a tragic sign of where we are.” Decent? Kind? Does Weiss still believe that?

And then there’s Maher. As late as April 23, 2021, Maher on his “Real Time” show praised Biden, unironically, as “completely on top of things.” Maher gushed that Biden was “focused and sharp” and “getting things done” on racial injustice, income inequality, Afghanistan (!), and climate change.

Maher has recently criticized Biden. But has he ever recanted his statement that was ludicrous when uttered, and is even more so now, that Biden is “completely on top of things?”

These obvious flaws in political judgment pale in comparison to those of 70 “Former Republican National Security Advisors for Biden.” “Serious people” like Richard Burt, Clyde Prestowitz, Winston Lord, William Webster, John Warner, Chuck Hagel, Carla Hills, John Negroponte, and Richard Armitage opined that Trump was a clear and present danger.

By contrast, they wrote “Joe Biden has the character, experience and temperament to lead this nation. We believe he will restore the dignity of the presidency, bring Americans, together, reassert America’s role as a global leader, and inspire our nation to live up to its ideals.”

Again, this was absurd when written. Now it seems downright Orwellian. Have any of these “experts” apologized or recanted in any way? On the contrary: that statement remains active to this very day at defendingdemocracytogether.org.

One notable exception is podcaster Sam Harris. On July 21, 2020, Harris tweeted “[t]here’s almost nothing Biden could be guilty of that would disqualify him in an election against Trump.” In an infamous January 20, 2021 tweet, Harris shared with the world his “overwhelming gratitude for the adults in the room.” To his credit, in the wake of the Afghanistan debacle, Harris admitted he was wrong: “Publicly eating these words . . . syllable by syllable.”

It is now March 2022, and the case for “eating words” of praise for Biden’s decency and competence has grown stronger with each roiling disaster, be it Covid lies and lockdowns, soaring gas prices and inflation, the border crisis, or war. But we have yet to see the Andrew Sullivans, Bill Mahers, Bari Weisses, and esteemed “Republican National Security Advisors” man up and apologize.

Come on, Andrew. Let’s hear it, Bari, Go for it, Bill. How about you, Dick Armitage? We’re waiting.

The NYT Doesn't Care If You Know Big Tech Rigged Biden's Election,"On March 17, 2022, The New York Times stated it had verified the authenticity of a laptop and its data as belonging to the president’s son, Hunter Biden. This was the same laptop holding information that Twitter, Facebook, and other corporate media immediately suppressed when The New York Post, a right-leaning competitor of The New York Times, reported on it three weeks before the 2020 presidential election.

If they had known about one of the Biden family scandals, such as the Hunter Biden laptop information, 17 percent of Joe Biden’s voters wouldn’t have voted for him, found a 2020 post-election poll. This means big tech’s suppression of this story likely made enough difference to tip Joe Biden into his low-margin win in the Electoral College.

Back in October 2020, Twitter and Facebook immediately responded to The New York Post’s publication of information from Hunter Biden’s laptop by effectively banning it from their platforms that effectively monopolize public discussion. Twitter punished the Post for reporting the repeatedly authenticated laptop information by suspending its account for two weeks.

“What this means is that, in the crucial days leading up to the 2020 presidential election, most of the corporate media spread an absolute lie about The New York Post’s reporting in order to mislead and manipulate the American electorate,” commented independent investigative reporter Glenn Greenwald.

Major National Security Implications

That laptop provides evidence Joe Biden was involved in Hunter Biden’s pay-for-play schemes with foreign oligarchs, an obvious national security risk. Some of these corrupt deals involved Ukraine, a notoriously corrupt country that is currently petitioning the Biden administration to engage militarily with Russia on their behalf.

Russia also has blackmail material on Hunter Biden, according to videos from his laptop, and the FBI knew about this as early as 2019, according to Federalist reporting: “This explosive revelation establishes that either Joe Biden lied to the American public, or the intelligence community lied to him,” wrote Federalist Senior Contributor Margot Cleveland in 2021.

Other Hunter Biden business deals involved China, the United States’ top security threat. Texts between business partners indicate Joe Biden was financially involved in Hunter Biden’s China deals, contrary to Joe Biden’s public claims.

China also has blackmail material on Hunter Biden and possibly on Joe Biden. All of this means major conflicts of interest for the president’s foreign policy at a time of significant global instability. It also was deliberately hidden from the voting public by collusion between big tech companies and the Democrat Party.

Hiding Democrats’ Dangerous Scandals

The same presidential administration that benefitted from Big Tech hiding damning true information is openly colluding with Big Tech to maintain and expand these information operations. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in July 2021, “We’re flagging posts for Facebook that spread disinformation.” Soon after, Psaki confirmed, “We’re in regular touch with social media platforms…about areas where we have concern.” You might call it a public-private partnership.

Democrats have demanded that the Biden administration create a task force to suppress “misinformation” and “disinformation.” What did corporate media and big tech call the laptop information they suppressed in 2020, only for The New York Times to confirm in 2022? That’s right: “Disinformation.” In fact, as Greenwald notes, intelligence operatives immediately enacted a real disinformation campaign against the New York Post reporting in 2020, pushing the false narrative that the Hunter Biden laptop was “disinformation.”

That’s called projection, and you should assume that’s one of the things going on every time the media runs some wild news cycle—such as accusing the Republican president of treasonous collusion with Russia when it’s actually the Democrat presidential candidate who did that.

Reinforcing the Power Hierarchy

This New York Times article, after all the lies and manipulations about the Hunter Biden laptop, is also a chilling public affirmation that the ruling class believes Americans are helpless to choose their own government. They’re even bold enough to confirm their power openly.

Just like requiring only the hired help and those under the thumb of government agencies to wear masks while their masters wine and dine mask-free, The New York Times openly revealing that corporate media including itself, Twitter, and Facebook lied and got away with it is a hierarchy flex. It’s a display of their power. They are saying, “We can lie to Americans and get away with it.”

They’re also flexing their power to say things they won’t allow their political opponents to say. Again, Covid is another clear example, as when Trump advisors such as Scott Atlas faced vicious media smears for pointing out facts that The New York Times finally acknowledged months later, such as that kids don’t need to wear masks and it’s perfectly safe for them to go to school. In the intervening time, children needlessly suffered, but The New York Times doesn’t care. They owned the rubes, and that matters more to them than truth or children’s suffering.

People this corrupt don’t deserve to have media platforms, control of the presidency, or any power of any kind. At the very least, those who use their power this cynically should be respected by absolutely no one.

Big Tech Is a Threat to Democracy

Big Tech is also clearly manipulating public discourse for highly partisan ends. Social media has become what the “big three” cable news networks were decades ago: falsely “nonpartisan” manipulators of elections. Like ABC, CBS, and NBC, Twitter and Facebook’s ability to control culture and politics through brain drips feeding lies into millions of Americans’ minds needs to end, yesterday. This is not a pissing contest. It’s about our continued existence as a nation.

Greenwald notes the corporate press and big tech “all ratified and spread a coordinated disinformation campaign in order to elect Joe Biden and defeat Donald Trump.” That’s not a democracy, no matter how many slogans about that word propaganda outlets put out. It’s tyranny.

When elections are an elaborate charade and their outcomes are openly manipulated by giant special interests, we don’t have self-government, self-determination, democracy, constitutional government, representation, or any of the above. For those of us who love these things because we believe they are our God-given and precious rights and responsibilities, this is a dark reality to behold.

One might call this world the left wants to live in Chinese communism with American characteristics. Well, I don’t want to live in that world, and neither do at least 74 million other Americans. We’re not going to keep being abused by our own government quietly. And we’re not going to believe these liars, no matter what they say.

8 Joe Biden Scandals To Investigate After Admittal Hunter’s Laptop Is Legit,"Last week, The New York Times quietly acknowledged that the emails recovered from the MacBook Hunter Biden abandoned at a Delaware computer store were authentic. The admission came nearly a year-and-a-half late, after the corrupt media — legacy and social — buried the scandal the New York Post broke just weeks before the November election.

Merely admitting the laptop is legitimate is not enough. Rather, by concurring in the authenticity of the laptop and the emails, the supposed standard-bearers of journalism have also implicitly acknowledged the validity of the scandals spawn by the porn-filled MacBook. And notwithstanding the salacious source of the documentary evidence of the scandals, the scandals are not about Hunter Biden: They are about now-President Biden.

Here are the eight Joe Biden scandals deserving further coverage.

1. Pay-to-Play in Ukraine

The most obvious scandal bared by the emails and text messages contained on Hunter’s laptop concerns the influence profiteering Joe Biden apparently participated in during his eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president, with Ukraine featuring heavily in the pay-to-play scheme.

The New York Times, in its likely “get ahead of the story,” coverage from last week, touched on the Ukrainian angle by noting Hunter’s connection to Burisma and then quoting emails recovered from the laptop indicating the younger Biden leveraged his dad’s position — then as vice president. But the Times’ surface coverage of the Burisma scandal doesn’t nearly suffice.

Surface it was: The Times made no mention of Hunter’s appointment to Burisma Holdings Board of Directors at a reported salary of $50,000 per month during his dad’s time as vice president. Hunter Biden had no experience in energy. So, a deep-dive on the entire Biden-Burisma connection is a first step.

2. China Gets in the Game

Ukraine is but a patch on the influence-peddling undertaken by Hunter on behalf of “the big guy,” as the younger Biden referred to his dad. China also played a large role in the family enterprise, as demonstrated by, again, passing coverage in November 2021. Then, the Times reported, in brief, that Hunter Biden’s joint global equity firm, the Bohai Harvest Equity Investment Fund, had helped coordinate the purchase by a Chinese mining company of the world’s largest cobalt source in the Congo.

That deal gave China control over a huge chunk of the world’s known cobalt supplies — an ingredient necessary to make electric car batteries. And the role of Hunter Biden’s company, Bohai, in the transaction again connects directly to Joe Biden, as Hunter reportedly launched that new joint enterprise with Chinese business partners less than two weeks after he traveled to China on Air Force Two with his then-vice president father.

In exploring this scandal, the press needs to push beyond the emails recovered from Hunter’s abandoned laptop, and do what Tucker Carlson did when the pay-to-play scandal first surfaced: talk to Hunter’s former business partner Tony Bobulinski. Bobulinski provides further proof that this scandal reaches the top of the Biden family.

3. Moscow, Kazakhstan, and More

While Ukraine and China likely hold the most significant revelations, once those threads are pulled, investigators should move on to Moscow, which according to a Senate report, holds another possible scandal. That report documents that Hunter also received a combined $3.5 million from the wife of the former Moscow mayor, a Kazakhstan investor, and several other individuals. After all, there is no reason to think that a person willing to let his son sell access to the vice president of the United States would close the money train to just a few countries.

4. Ukraine’s Firing of the Prosecutor Investigating Burisma

With the elite media now deigning coverage of Hunter’s laptop appropriate, the public knows the Burisma scandal was real and threatened to be spectacularly devastating to the elder Biden. That makes questions concerning then-Vice President Joe Biden’s demands that Ukraine fire the state prosecutor who was reportedly investigating Burisma ripe to revisit.

That prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired, according to statements Joe Biden made during a 2018 event, after Biden threatened to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee if the Ukrainian government refused to ax Shokin. A video of the event captured Biden recounting the event:

I said, I’m telling you, you’re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you’re not getting the billion. I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours.’ If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a b-tch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.

While the Obama administration attempted to spin Biden’s push for the firing of Shokin, by claiming the international community had demanded Ukraine terminate the state prosecutor, a State Department official contradicted that claim during congressional testimony. George Kent, who worked on issues related to Ukraine at the State Department, reportedly told lawmakers it was the Obama administration that “spearheaded the efforts to have Shokin removed from his position as the top federal prosecutor in Ukraine.”

Biden needs to answer questions anew over his threats to withhold money from Ukraine unless the country removed the state prosecutor responsible for investigating Burisma. Democrats have impeached a president for less.

5. Obama-Biden Administration Ignoring Conflicts of Interest

Biden also needs to answer questions about his decision to ignore the clear conflicts of interest involved with him negotiating with the same countries Hunter was shaking down. Of course, since “the big guy” was in on the scam, bowing out over conflicts of interest is the lesser of the evils, but it is still worth investigating to assess how Biden handled the concerns raised by the Obama administration’s State Department.

Here, the testimony of the State Department official charged with issues related to Ukraine again proves significant. Kent told lawmakers that after learning Hunter sat on the board of Burisma, he raised concerns with the vice president’s office about the relationship.

“I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest,” Kent testified before House members in October of 2019. “The message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president’s son Beau was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time … That was the end of that conversation.”

The question for now-President Biden, then, is whether anyone in his office raised concerns about the clear conflicts-of-interest with him personally, and if so, why did Biden ignore the problem?

6. The Intelligence Community’s Briefing of Biden

Another scandal reaching President Biden concerns his interactions with the intelligence community after the FBI, and presumably the CIA and other such agencies, learned in December of 2019, that Hunter Biden believed Russians had stolen Hunter’s laptop, rendering the Bidens susceptible to blackmail.

Here, it is important to understand that there are two separate Hunter Biden laptops at issue. The most-discussed laptop was actually the second laptop. That laptop was the one Hunter had abandoned at the Delaware repair shop. Then, after the repair shop owner discovered concerning material on the MacBook, the store owner handed it to the FBI in December of 2019. The owner of the repair shop, however, had first made a copy of the hard drive, which resulted in The New York Post’s coverage in October 2020.

But there was another laptop — one Hunter believed Russians had stolen from him when he was binging on drugs with prostitutes in the summer of 2018 in Las Vegas. While the public did not learn about the existence of this earlier laptop until August of 2021, the FBI knew about it as early as December 2019, when they took possession of the second laptop Hunter had left at the repair store.

Among other material contained on the second laptop was a video of Biden recounting the circumstances of his first laptop disappearing with some Russians. Significantly, on that video Hunter Biden said his first laptop contained a ton of material leaving him susceptible to blackmail, since his father was “running for president” and Hunter talked “about it all the time.”

It is inconceivable that the FBI and the intelligence communities did not brief Biden on this discovery and the risk of blackmail, given that former FBI Director James Comey briefed Trump on the fake Steele dossier. On second thought, that is the initial question reporters should ask the president: “Did the FBI brief you, Mr. President, on the fact that Hunter believed Russians had stolen a laptop containing compromising information?”

From there, an inquiring press should investigate to ensure that Joe Biden did not direct the intelligence community to bury this national security risk to protect himself or his son.

7. Possible Collusion to Interfere in the 2020 Election

An honest press should also investigate whether now-President Biden or anyone connected to his then-presidential campaign pressured reporters, media outlets, or companies such as Twitter and Facebook to censor the Hunter Biden story. And what about the “fifty former intelligence officials” who publicly declared the laptop resembled a Russian disinformation campaign—something clearly untrue? Did Biden or his campaign coordinate with those individuals, several of whom had endorsed the Democratic candidate, in the release of the letter?

Given that polls show that 17 percent of Joe Biden voters would not have voted for him in 2020, if they had known about the Biden family scandals, the collective burying of the laptop scandal represents the most significant interference in elections ever seen in our country. So, “Did Biden or his campaign have anything to do with the decision to kill the New York Post’s reporting on Hunter’s MacBook?” And “What about the ‘fifty former intelligence officials?’”

From there the follow-ups flow quickly: “Who was involved in the push to silence the story and who were the executives or ‘journalists’ who bowed to the demands?” “Who coordinated with the intelligence officials?” “Were any threats or promises made?” “What were they?” “What did Joe Biden know?” “What about other Democrats and the Democratic National Committee?”

8. Joe Biden Is a ‘Lying Dog-Faced Pony Soldier’

The final Joe Biden scandal the press should push President Biden to answer concerns his lies to the American public. While there are too many to count, two merit further questioning.

First, the media should demand Biden answer for lying to the country when he seethed, “I have never discussed, with my son or my brother or with anyone else, anything having to do with their businesses. Period.” The evidence overwhelmingly shows that Biden not only knew of the family business deals but was part of them.

The second bold-faced fabrication from Biden came during his pre-election debate with Trump, when Trump raised “the laptop from hell.” When Trump asked Biden if he was saying the “laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?” the then-Democratic candidate replied, “That’s exactly what [I] was told.”

Unlikely. Biden also countered with this doozy, which again raises the question of whether Biden had a role in the intelligence officials’ statement:

There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant. They have said that this has all the … five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him and his good friend, Rudy Giuliani.

We can now add The New York Times to Giuliani. It remains to be seen, though, whether the Old Grey Lady and the other legacy outlets will report on the further scandals the laptop revealed—the ones that reach the president of the United States.

The Hunter Biden Emails Warrant A Special Counsel To Probe Joe Biden,"The New York Times conceded the authenticity of the Hunter Biden laptop 18 months after early right-leaning reporting on the computer was roundly smeared by Democrats and a complicit media establishment as Russian disinformation. The necessary appointment of a special counsel to investigate its explosive revelations documented by the New York Post is even tardier.

For decades, Hunter Biden leveraged the family name to broker international business deals. In October 2020, the Post published emails from the abandoned hard drive of the Delaware laptop not only discrediting then-candidate Joe Biden’s repeated claims he never spoke business with his son, “or with anyone else,” but also that the former vice president stood to make a handsome profit from his son’s corrupt deals.

“You’re a damn liar, man,” candidate Biden said before going on to fat shame an Iowa voter at a town hall for confronting Biden over his son’s lucrative overseas ventures. At the time of the exchange, questions were circulating based on evidence to emerge from Trump’s first impeachment saga about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma. Hunter was raking in upwards of $50,000 a month in excess compensation despite no prior experience in the industry. He landed the gig while his father served as the White House point man on Ukraine.

“We all know Trump has been messing around in Ukraine,” the Iowa voter said to Joe Biden. “But, you on the other hand, sent your son over there. He not only worked for a gas company, but he had no experience in … You’re selling access to the presidency just like [Trump] is.”

Their concerns were well-founded at the time, and even more warranted 10 months later.

Less than three weeks from Election Day 2020, The New York Post published a series of emails contradicting candidate Biden’s claims of ignorance of his son’s business operations and showed the family engaged in conflicts of interest while serving in the upper echelons of U.S. government.

Not only did Hunter Biden introduce his vice president father to a senior Ukrainian business partner in 2015, but emails in 2017 revealed stemming from business across the globe thousands of dollars were supposedly set aside for “the big guy.” An unnamed source who was on the email discussing “remuneration packages” told Fox News the day after it was published the ambiguous reference was directly to Joe Biden. Tony Bobulinski, a former business partner of the Biden’s, went on record a week later to confirm the identity of “the big guy” as the former vice president slated to receive 10 percent of a cash and equity deal.

“Hunter Biden called his dad ‘the Big Guy’ or ‘my Chairman,’ and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing,” Bobulinski wrote in a statement sent to The Federalist and other outlets.

On Fox News with Tucker Carlson, Bobulinski continued to blow the whistle on Joe Biden’s entanglement in his son’s overseas business ventures, asserting the Democrat candidate who would go on to be president was “compromised” by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

The implications are enormous. Many big questions remain unanswered about President Biden’s personal involvement with his son’s extensive and potentially criminal business ventures.

After President Donald Trump was falsely accused based on fabricated intelligence of seeking to undermine American interests as a Russian asset, Democrats landed their own special counsel with unlimited resources that operated for years. The Russiagate saga, amplified by a deep state operation within the FBI, in turn undermined Trump’s first years in the White House and ended with nothing to show.

In Biden’s case, however, credible testimony exists from on-the-record sources and a “Laptop From Hell,” as described in the title of Post Columnist Miranda Devine book on the subject, to launch a special counsel probe beyond the current DOJ investigation into Hunter Biden’s taxes. As Devine outlined Sunday, the White House is ignoring poignant questions such as whether Hunter Biden actually divested from Chinese state-owned enterprises.

“[Psaki] told us last year that Hunter was in the process of divesting his 10% share of the Chinese investment firm BHR Partners, which is co-owned by the Bank of China and has $2.4 billion of funds under management. Last November, Hunter’s lawyer told the Times he no longer owns a share of BHR,” Devine wrote.

But, according to online records of the Chinese business registry Baidu, as of Wednesday, Hunter’s company Skaneateles LLC continues to hold a 10% stake in BHR. Hunter is still named on corporate records as sole governor of Skaneateles, although the company is listed as ‘revoked’ on the website of the Washington, DC, Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. That is because a $300 ‘reinstatement fee’ has not been paid, the Washington Examiner reported this month.

With even the New York Times, the bulwark paper of corrupt media, conceding the authenticity of material blowing back the curtain of the Biden family business ventures, it’s past time Attorney General Merrick Garland recognizes the need for an independent investigation.

Republicans have called for one in the past, repeatedly. If Garland refuses to agree, congressional Republicans ought to demand his explanation, and ramp up the pressure if elected to the majority in November.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/22/the-hunter-biden-emails-warrant-a-special-counsel-to-probe-the-big-guy-joe-biden/,2022-03-22
Did NYT Admit Biden's Corruption So Democrats Can Get Rid Of Him?,"It is painfully obvious, as was predictable, that Joe Biden’s presidency is a dumpster fire. As demonstrated by the party’s destructive callousness towards children, the elderly, and the poor during their Covid lockdown frenzy, Democrats care about none of these real-world results of their policies. But they do care about polling, and Joe Biden’s is abysmal.

According to even heavily politicized polls, Biden is at least performing as badly as Donald Trump. Biden is between the third- and fifth-most ratings-underwater president ever in American history at this point in his first term.

Biden of course also has the advantage of a wildly favorable press and social media monopoly while Trump had the strong headwind of a wildly negative one. That factor obscured for a great many of American voters actions that easily demonstrated long before his election that Biden was unfit for the presidency.

Now that he’s president, however, and very publicly bungling essentially every major issue all the way up to U.S. national security, Biden’s weakness and incompetence have been impossible for the corrupt media to entirely cover up. Biden’s appalling withdrawal from Afghanistan may have been the first major blow to public confidence in his governing ability, and it’s been followed by blow after blow: the repercussions of ending U.S. energy independence, historic inflation caused by massive government spending, aggression by America’s foreign foes, a tacitly open border with human trafficking of historic proportions, not to mention fueling America’s legalized mass killings of unborn infants and forcing schools to inflict gender dysphoria on the children in their care.

So yes, the polls look bad. That’s why Democrat officials suddenly switched away from their Covid mania, lifting mask mandates in blue states, ending the daily falsified “body counts” on TVs and newspapers, and jumping immediately into European war hysteria. But that’s not been enough to turn those polls around. Historic indicators presently suggest a “red wave” in the upcoming midterms.

That brings us to The New York Times’s recent “limited hangout“: its highly suspicious, very late acknowledgment that, hey, that laptop containing evidence that Joe Biden is just as corrupt as his son Hunter Biden told Russian prostitutes — that laptop is real, and so is its data. Yes, the United States’s top foreign adversaries likely have blackmail material on the U.S. president, and likely paid him some very big bribes.

Oh, and yes Twitter and Facebook did use their global communications monopolies to rig the election for Joe Biden by hiding this information (and who knows what else).

Why would The New York Times do this — and Facebook and Twitter not ban this information release just like they did before? Well, one explanation is hierarchy reinforcement. As I wrote Monday, like forcing their “minions” to wear face masks, the ridiculously belated laptop confirmation also equals the ruling class “flexing their power to say things they won’t allow their political opponents to say.”

There’s another explanation, though. It’s that Joe Biden is no longer useful to the ruling class. After being used to win an election, he’s now making it impossible for them to credibly foist on Americans the idea that his party could win another one with him on their masthead. The donkey is showing through the lion skin, and so they need a new donkey.

So while it seems utterly legitimate to insist on accountability such as appointing a special counsel to investigate the Biden family’s apparent corruption, that also could relieve the Democrat Party of their greatest liability. They’d probably deeply appreciate that, in fact. Biden got the ruling class what they wanted, and they don’t need him any more. Getting rid of him now would in fact be highly convenient for maintaining their power.

There’s only one problem with that. Kamala isn’t at all going well for them either.

Biden Administration Is Cooking The Books On Illegal Immigrant Arrests,"The Biden administration has delayed for months an annual illegal immigration report that contains crucial statistics about this key national security issue, as the U.S. border crisis keeps breaking records since Joe Biden took the presidential office.

While everyone is distracted by #KJB hearings & Ukraine – our southern border is wide open & getting worse due to the purposeful abuse of office by @JoeBiden & @SecMayorkas. Just today, @CBP began dumping dozens (told approx. 100) illegals in Uvalde. CC: @BillFOXLA (1/2) pic.twitter.com/wUqlT4L1q3 — Chip Roy (@chiproytx) March 23, 2022

The Biden administration has published some immigration enforcement statistics in its “ICE Fiscal Year 2021 Annual Report.” This was recently required by Congress and is largely a narrative-driven report that provides a topical look at all parts of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), from customs operations to personnel hiring and oversight processes.

It is significantly different from the detailed immigration enforcement-focused report called the “ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Report” that the agency has published by the end of every calendar year for at least the last decade — with the exception of last year. As of this writing, the Biden administration has not published this very important report, leading some to conclude that the data contained therein is a damning indictment of the administration’s enforcement policies. (Here’s the fiscal year 2020 version).

The recently released report does not include the many charts and tables that make up the missing enforcement report, effectively preventing Congress, the media, and the public from analyzing the effects of the Biden administration’s controversial guidelines that have severely limited the ability of ICE officers to enforce immigration law. Instead, the report includes only a handful of numbers and percentages, and messaging that is difficult to verify. Perhaps most troubling is that the Biden administration decided to develop a largely meaningless metric that is meant to trick people into thinking the Biden administration is taking public safety more seriously than the Trump administration.

In the new report they claim that ICE “arrested 12,025 individuals with aggravated felony convictions—nearly double the 6,815 arrested the previous fiscal year” and “ICE removed an average of 937 aggravated felons per month — the highest level ever recorded since ICE began collecting detailed criminality data.” One ICE officer I spoke with calls this “a complete manipulation of the data” and many ICE officers share that sentiment, including an officer interviewed by the Washington Times, who said, “I can tell you definitively there were more aggravated felony arrests in 2020.”

The Biden administration’s attempt to put a positive spin on its dangerous enforcement guidelines through this unreliable data is more troubling than most realize.

Misleading on Aggravated Felony Reporting

For purposes of immigration, Congress defines a number of crimes as “aggravated felonies,” such as murder, rape, and drug trafficking, but also considers a crime to fit in this category if it is “a crime of violence” or a “theft offense or burglary offense” for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. The list is detailed and how states define and punish crimes creates some complexity in the law. Aliens convicted of aggravated felonies face a number of consequences including swift deportation, ineligibility for asylum, and a bar from lawfully re-entering the United States.

Over the past year, as confirmed by ICE officers who spoke with the Center for Immigration Studies, the Biden administration has repeatedly directed ICE field offices to mark arrests as “aggravated felon arrests” at every opportunity, where applicable. The program ICE officers use to create a system of record for managing cases allows for the entry of large amounts of information, ranging from basic information like name, birth date, and nationality to more complex information like criminal and immigration history. As with any system, too much information can be problematic (either for efficiency or legal reasons, for example) and officers generally put as much information as is sufficient for carrying out their responsibilities, which is, generally, either the removal or release of a foreign national.

One bit of information officers can add to the system when arresting an alien is whether the alien is an aggravated felon. Historically, ICE officers have generally not been keeping track of this metric because it has been largely irrelevant as to whether an alien is deportable, and because it can be difficult to determine whether criminal acts in an alien’s record count as an aggravated felony.

As inferred by ICE officials on the media call announcing the new report, the same criminal act committed by two people in two different jurisdictions may or may not make the person an aggravated felon due to the laws of each state and different rulings in circuit courts, for example. Until the past year, ICE officers have not been pressured to figure out whether an alien fits the definition of “aggravated felon” and, as a result, this information has not been tracked in any meaningful sense.

Politicizing Data

What the public has not been told is that the numbers appear higher in FY2021 due to the Biden administration repeatedly demanding that officers make it a priority to determine whether an alien should be labeled an aggravated felon and then record that determination into the system. In the past, some officers have clicked the “aggravated felon” button, but since there was no pressure to make this determination — which usually would require an officer to locate an ICE attorney and have them run a legal analysis — many officers did not bother to make it. There was generally no need for this under the Trump administration because ICE officers were allowed to deport an illegal alien for violating immigration laws, felon or not, as intended by Congress.

Not only has the Biden administration been pressuring ICE officers to record whether aliens fit the definition of an aggravated felon, the ICE unit responsible for putting together the latest report has been proactively reaching out to ICE field offices and requesting that they take a second look at certain cases and retroactively flag them as “aggravated felon” cases in the system, where possible. This was not done in previous years, but the administration nevertheless decided to compare its new FY2021 data to data from FY2020 when officers were not being pressured to keep a record on apparent aggravated felon cases. This is a scandalous effort by the Biden administration to politicize law enforcement data in an attempt to mislead the American people about the true effects of its policies.

Other Data Shows Drop in Enforcement

Notably, the recent report includes the number of “offenses associated with” the illegal aliens arrested last year. Among the population of criminal aliens arrested in FY2021, the following crimes were on their records: 1,506 homicide-related offenses; 3,415 sexual assaults; 19,549 assaults; 2,717 robberies; and 1,063 kidnappings.

About four months of that fiscal year were under the Trump administration, so it’s possible many of these arrests occurred before the Biden administration’s guidelines were issued. Either way, those numbers are much lower than what occurred under FY2020, which saw the following crimes on records of aliens arrested: 1,837 homicide offenses; 4,385 sexual assaults; 37,247 assaults; 3,816 robberies; and 1,637 kidnappings.

Similarly, according to data on ICE’s webpage regarding the cooperative program 287(g), whereby sheriffs identify criminal aliens in their jails and assist with the transfer to ICE custody, ICE took in fewer criminals through the program in FY2021 than it did in FY2020. Arrests of aliens through 287(g) convicted of assault were down 57 percent. For weapons offenses it was down 52 percent, arrests of aliens convicted for dangerous drugs were down 49 percent, arrests of aliens convicted for homicide were down 43 percent, and arrests of aliens for sex offense convictions were down 29 percent.

Some of these criminal acts would seem to fit the criteria of an aggravated felony, but with the Biden administration claiming an increase in arrests of aggravated felons, and the data showing arrests in these categories down, something doesn’t add up. The discrepancy can be explained by the Biden administration’s misleading use of inconsistently labeled and unreliable aggravated felony data. The Center for Immigration Studies recently obtained additional ICE data that further supports the conclusion that the Biden administration is manipulating the data.

Bottom line, the definition of aggravated felon is inconsistent across the country, it has not been consistently recorded in ICE’s systems, and consequently the metric has never been considered accurate or meaningful enough to be included in prior ICE reports. On top of this, even the crime data that ICE has reported is an admission that our communities are more dangerous because of the administration’s bad policies. The Biden administration has created a misleading narrative out of thin air and is hopeful that the public, and the courts, will not notice they’ve cooked the books.

The Biden administration must be forced to release the data from the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Report so an honest evaluation of its policies can be conducted.

4 Takeaways From NYT’s Attempt To Control The Hunter Biden Narrative,"Last Wednesday, The New York Times reported on the continuing criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, and in doing so finally acknowledged the emails recovered from the laptop abandoned at a Delaware repair shop were authentic. Since then, much of the media’s coverage has focused on the corrupt press’ burying of the laptop scandal The New York Post broke shortly before the 2020 election.

There is much more to be gleaned from the Times’s article, though, including these four takeaways.

1. If the Laptop Is Legit, So Are the Scandals the Laptop Exposed

The first key takeaway from The New York Times article concerns what it means for the scandals spawned by the October 2020 release of the emails and text messages contained on Hunter Biden’s MacBook. The supposed standard-bearers of journalism ignored those scandals for the last year-and-a-half by framing the material “Russian disinformation.”

Now that the Times has acknowledged that the Biden-related emails and other documents recovered from the abandoned laptop are authentic, that means the scandals they exposed are also legitimate. As summarized at The Federalist here, there are eight Joe Biden scandals that deserve investigation.

2. The Times’s Record of ‘Getting Ahead of the Story’ Suggests More Developments Are Coming

Beyond what Wednesday’s article on Hunter Biden means more broadly related to the scandals exposed by the abandoned MacBook, the substance of the Times’s coverage suggests a huge story about the president’s son is about to break. Here, it is helpful to remember that the Times is the newspaper of record for stories needed to soften the landing for Democrats embroiled in scandal. In this case, the tells are all there that the Times is offering an assist to the Bidens by getting ahead of the story to come.

Just as Press Secretary Jen Psaki smooths her copper coif before dropping a doozy, the Times alerts observant readers to the real story when it identifies its source for information harmful to a Democrat as a “person familiar with the investigation.” The Times used that technique ten times in its coverage of the Hunter Biden case.

Another sure give-away is the Times’s burying of the lede. That is an understatement of what the Old Grey Lady did when it titled its coverage of the investigation into Hunter Biden as “Hunter Biden Paid Tax Bill, but Broad Federal Investigation Continues.” The article then opened with:

In the year after he disclosed a federal investigation into his ‘tax affairs’ in late 2020, President Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, paid off a significant tax liability, even as a grand jury continued to gather evidence in a wide-ranging examination of his international business dealings, according to people familiar with the case.

With a proper title, such as, “Prosecutors Find Evidence Hunter Profited by Selling Access to Vice-President Father,” serious reporting would open by alerting the audience to damning evidence accumulated by federal prosecutors that suggests Hunter Biden criminally profited from his dad’s position as Barack Obama’s vice president.

The Times’s tactic of preemptively providing defenses to hypothetical criminal charges should also alert readers to the inevitability of an indictment against Hunter. For more on the preemptive defense of Hunter see point 4 below.

3. Prosecutors are Investigating Some Serious Stuff

So, what might those inevitable charges be? Of course, it is impossible to know for sure unless and until an indictment drops, but it is inconceivable that the Times would air the Biden family’s dirty laundry unless the reporters believed the entire household hamper was soon to be dumped in the middle of town.

Revisiting the Times’s article from last week, then, with the premise that the reporting seeks to “get ahead of the story,” suggests federal prosecutors may have some serious charges in mind for the president’s son. Tax evasion seems the most likely charge Hunter will face, given that the Times reported that the president’s son paid more than $1 million in tax liability while spinning any such criminal offense as Hunter’s mere “failure to pay all his taxes.”

A second charge floated by the Times concerns violations of “the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, which requires disclosure to the Justice Department of lobbying or public relations assistance on behalf of foreign clients.” Here, the Times’ efforts to frame Hunter’s potential violations of FARA as unintentional — and thus not criminal — suggests the Delaware U.S. attorney has a solid FARA case in the works.

The Times’s coverage, however, indicates federal prosecutors are looking at much more serious charges related to payments Hunter Biden received from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, as well his financial interests in Kazakhstan and China. Publicly available evidence already suggests Hunter Biden profited from these, and potentially other foreign interests, by selling access to his father when the elder Biden was vice president, which the Times casts as possibly allowing for a “money laundering” charge against Hunter.

In last week’s article, the Times reveals that prosecutors have accumulated significantly more evidence suggesting Hunter profited from these relationships, with prosecutors allegedly investigating “payments and gifts Mr. Biden or his associates had received from foreign interests, including a vehicle paid for using funds from a company associated with a Kazakh oligarch and a diamond from a Chinese energy tycoon.” The Times also reported that prosecutors have “sought documents related to corporate entities through which Mr. Biden and his associates conducted business with interests around the world.”

The Times further revealed that federal prosecutors have “issued scores of subpoenas,” related to “Hunter Biden’s foreign work and for bank accounts linked to him and his associates.” They even traveled to Little Rock, Arkansas, according to The Times, to interview Ms. Lunden Alexis Roberts, who sued Hunter for paternity payments, questioning her about Hunter’s business dealings. As for the emails recovered from the abandoned MacBook, federal investigators have authenticated those as well.

All of these details the Times reported in its article purportedly focused on the tax case against Hunter Biden. Other than the details confirmed by Roberts’s lawyer, the information came principally from “people familiar with the investigation,” which means one of two things: someone with the prosecutor’s office talked, or someone connected with Hunter Biden did.

History provides a pretty good hint of the answer — and its reason: Hunter Biden’s team likely gave the Times the heads-up to the case being crafted against the president’s son to allow the liberal mainstay to massage a narrative before any potential charges became public. Given the details shared with the Times by people familiar with the investigation, then regurgitated by the Times for the public, it seems some pretty serious charges may be in store for Hunter.

4. Downplay the Charges, Build the Narrative, and Beta-Test the Defenses

As noted above, the Times’ preemptive countering of several hypothetical criminal charges indicates the leftist paper’s coverage of the Hunter Biden case seeks not to inform the public but to form a gentle narrative on which the president’s son can land when the expected indictment drops. Here it is not merely the many defenses the Times lays out, but the entirety of the article that also downplays the potential charges and paints the most sympathetic scenario possible for Hunter Biden.

Consider, for instance, the Times’s framing of Hunter Biden and his apparent pay-to-play scheme. “Hunter Biden is a Yale-educated lawyer,” the article notes early on, claiming that the “broader investigation” stems “from work he did around the world” that “intersected with his father’s public service.”

It seems unlikely, though, that prosecutors are investigating “work” Hunter Biden did around the world, although not as unlikely as the claim that President Biden’s lifelong political career parlayed to his family’s financial advantage is “public service.”

The Times also succeeded in presenting the Hunter Biden-Burisma scandal as one really about Trump, writing: “Hunter Biden’s work for Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy company, became a flashpoint in his father’s race in 2020 against President Donald J. Trump and helped set off the events that led to Mr. Trump’s first impeachment.”

Apparently, the Times will need another year or two before it can also acknowledge Donald Trump’s concern about Biden family corruption in Ukrainian was legitimate and that Trump’s impeachment was pure politics.

Then there was the Times’s reference to Hunter’s “serious drug addiction and other problems during the period” the potentially illegal conduct took place. Add to those facts that Hunter was also “dealing with the illness and death of his brother Beau,” and the Times seems to suggest these sad circumstances mitigate the seriousness of any forthcoming charges.

The remainder of the article presents various counters to the charges, such as that Hunter repaid the back taxes by taking out a loan — oh, the horror. The Times then pretends paying the government back lessens the import of a tax evasion case.

On a potential FARA charge, the Times suggests Hunter attempted to comply with the law and that any violation was unintentional, meaning at best he should be held only civilly responsible. And on the most serious charge floated by the Times, money laundering, the paper presents that case as connected to the FARA charge, suggesting it would be inappropriate to charge the president’s son with money laundering if he is innocent of violating FARA.

Until the Delaware U.S. attorney announces charges, if any, against Hunter Biden, it is impossible to know the criminal jeopardy the president’s son may face. But, given that when the Times reports on stories harmful to Democratic interests it proves prescient, odds are good that some serious charges are in the works.

Hunter Biden’s Laptops Are Now An Active National Security Threat,"On Friday, The Daily Mail reported that emails recovered from Hunter Biden’s laptop show he helped an infectious disease research company pursue projects in Ukraine. Those emails confirm portions of charges Russia made the previous day that an investment group run by the now-president’s son had funded a company conducting research at biological laboratories in Ukraine.

While these developments add another scandal to the long list of Biden family dirty laundry, the more urgent concern for the country should be the continuing threat to our national security posed by a compromised President Biden and the possibility that Russia has access to the catalog of compromising material contained on Hunter’s laptop.

Mere weeks before then-President Donald Trump and Joe Biden faced off in the November 2020 presidential election, The New York Post published emails obtained from a laptop Hunter Biden had abandoned at a repair shop in Delaware. Those emails revealed that during the elder Biden’s time as Barack Obama’s vice president, Hunter engaged in a pay-to-play scandal, trading off his father’s position to strike deals with players in Ukraine and China. The venture was a family one, with Joe “the Big Guy” Biden listed in one email as set to receive a 10 percent cut of one pending deal and Hunter telling his daughter in another message that “pop” took half of his earnings.

Even after a former business partner of Hunter Biden’s confirmed the authenticity of the emails, the supposed standard-bearers of journalism buried the scandal and social media outlets censored both the story and The New York Post. Worse still, “more than 50 former senior intelligence officials” signed a letter framing the Hunter Biden emails as Russian disinformation.

Among others, former CIA directors or acting directors John Brennan, Leon Panetta, Gen. Michael Hayden, John McLaughlin, and Michael Morell signed the letter. In doing so they gave then-candidate Joe Biden cover to lie to the American public, which he did when Trump confronted him about the scandal during a presidential debate.

Are you saying the “laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?” Trump asked Biden.

“That’s exactly what [I] was told,” Biden countered. “There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant,” Biden professed to the American public before they went to the polls and elected Biden our commander in chief.

But even The New York Times has finally admitted the laptop was real and the emails were legitimate. Initially, that admission proved significant because it likewise legitimizes the scandals spawned from the documents recovered from Hunter’s abandoned laptop. However, the trajectory of the scandal changed Friday with The Daily Mail’s exclusive.

“Emails from Hunter’s abandoned laptop show he helped secure millions of dollars of funding for Metabiota, a Department of Defense contractor specializing in research on pandemic-causing diseases that could be used as bioweapons,” The Daily Mail announced last week. The article continued: “[Biden] also introduced Metabiota to an allegedly corrupt Ukrainian gas firm, Burisma, for a ‘science project’ involving high biosecurity level labs in Ukraine. And although Metabiota is ostensibly a medical data company, its vice president emailed Hunter in 2014 describing how they could ‘assert Ukraine’s cultural and economic independence from Russia’– an unusual goal for a biotech firm.”

The Daily Mail added more details about Metabiota and Hunter Biden’s role in brokering relationships for the research company in Ukraine. Included throughout the article were copies of the emails ostensibly obtained from Hunter’s laptop that confirmed The Daily Mail’s reporting. The article also added details shedding light on Hunter’s “business” dealings in Ukraine during the time his father served as vice president and America’s point person on issues related to that country.

Friday’s exclusive is not the first time The Daily Mail has published never-before-seen material from Hunter Biden’s laptop. Last August, the outlet published “unearthed footage” of Hunter Biden telling a prostitute that, in the summer of 2018, another laptop went missing and he believed Russia had stolen it. At the time, Hunter also expressed concern that the laptop might prove fodder for blackmail since it contained compromising material.

What distinguishes the emails contained in last week’s Daily Mail article from those published last year is that the most recent release came the day after Russia’s State Duma speaker, Vyacheslav Volodin accused President Biden with being “involved in the creation of bio laboratories in Ukraine,” with Volodin claiming that “an investment fund run by his son Hunter Biden funded research and the implementation of the United States’ military biological program.”

Soon after Volodin made the charge on Thursday, the Telegraph called Russia’s accusation of Hunter Biden funding Ukrainian biological laboratories an “unsubstantiated claim” “designed to build on negative coverage about [the] president’s son in Right-wing US media.” But with Friday’s release of previously undisclosed emails from Hunter Biden’s laptop, Russia’s claim, at least concerning Hunter Biden’s connection to Ukrainian biological laboratories, appears accurate.

While none of the emails released on Friday support Russia’s claim that the Ukrainian labs were used to research or create bioweapons, propaganda need only hold a sliver of truth to serve its purpose. And the cache of emails contained on Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop provides Putin and his comrades enough evidence to seemingly confirm the Russian government’s earlier claim that Hunter Biden helped implement a bioweapon program in Ukraine. This false framing also provides Russia ammunition to justify its attack on its neighbor to the west.

Russia’s ability to point to the Hunter Biden emails as confirmation of its claims of a biolab in Ukraine raises a serious question with huge national security implications: How did Russia know the day before The Daily Mail’s exclusive that the Hunter Biden’s investment fund, Rosemont Seneca, had invested in Metabiota and been involved in Metabiota’s operations in Ukraine?

The timing of events last week suggests Russia has access to the same emails as The Daily Mail or that Vladimir Putin’s agents might well have obtained access to Hunter Biden’s first laptop—the one the president’s son believed Russians had stolen in 2018. In either case, the Biden family corruption documented on the laptops has gone from a potential national security risk to a real one—and in the midst of a war launched by Russia on a country bordering North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.

Together, the Biden family, the intelligence agencies, and the corrupt media—social and legacy—hold full responsibility for the danger Americans now face. Biden knew full well how compromised his family was, and that there were two laptops, not one, with evidence of the corruption floating about. Yet Biden lied to the American public, with an assist from the former high-level members of the intelligence community who signed the letter suggesting the laptop scandal represented Russian disinformation.

Then there is the FBI which, by December 2019, had access to the abandoned laptop and thereby also knew that Hunter believed Russians had stolen his laptop in summer 2018. To date, there has been no indication that the FBI provided Joe Biden a defensive briefing on the national security risk posed by those laptops. Or if FBI agents did brief Biden on the risks in a timely manner, that means he nonetheless lied to the American public and ran for president knowing the propaganda at Putin’s fingertips.

Even when coupled with the complicity of former members of the intelligence community, all of Joe Biden’s lies would mean nothing if the media had done its job and reported the story when it still matter. It’s too late now, however: Biden is our commander in chief and Putin potentially holds a cache of compromising information perfect for propaganda purposes.

"No, Biden’s Putin Gaffe Was No Reagan Moment","After President Joe Biden went wildly off-script in his speech in Warsaw, Poland, on Saturday, members of the corporate media jumped to compare the gaffe to President Ronald Reagan’s “tear down this wall” moment. But the comments couldn’t have been more different.

“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden ad-libbed about Vladimir Putin at the very end of a half-hour of prepared remarks. White House officials immediately began doing damage control for the president’s radical and dangerous call for regime change in Moscow, telling the press, “The President’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change.”

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith did similar clean-up, and multiple White House sources confirmed the line wasn’t in Biden’s prepared remarks.

In stark contrast, the iconic line in Reagan’s speech at the Brandenburg Gate had been discussed and debated in White House circles for weeks, and was very intentionally included by Reagan — it was no spur-of-the-moment line that accidentally said more than the president meant.

“In his early drafts of the speech, [John Kornblum, the top U.S official in Berlin] included a direct call to Gorbachev to open the Wall,” The Washington Post recorded. “Back in Washington, White House speechwriter Peter Robinson was similarly inclined and weeks of heated debate ensued.”

Robinson recalled telling Reagan that some people on the eastern side of the wall would be able to hear him, and asking what the president wanted to make sure they heard.

“And the president said, ‘Well, there’s that passage about tearing down the wall. That’s what I want to say to them. That wall has to come down,’” Robinson remembered.

But while Reagan loved the line, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and Secretary of State George Shultz didn’t. Robinson said the speechwriting team got seven different drafts of the speech in their back-and-forths with the National Security Council and the State Department, all of which edited the line out.

“It was only when Air Force One landed in Berlin that a White House official approached Kornblum and said Reagan had decided,” the Post continued.

Reagan’s line — which only years later would become iconic — was a far cry from Biden’s flub, which was so obviously not well thought through that a fawning Politico Playbook on Sunday morning resorted to calling it a “gaffe from the heart.”

That didn’t stop talking heads from holding Biden’s whoopsie up to Reagan’s time-tested line. Max Boot did so in a WaPo op-ed titled “Biden’s support for Ukraine and opposition to Putin were no ‘gaffe,’” in which he found himself admitting that actually, “the fact that Biden’s aides rushed to walk back his remarks with lame explanations … suggests that this was indeed a gaffe — one of many that Biden has committed over his long political career.”

CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller said on Twitter Saturday that Biden’s accidental line “tops Reagan’s 1987 ‘tear down this wall’ speech.” Reuters’ Michel Rose wrote, “‘For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power’ is Biden’s ‘Tear down this wall’ moment.” Jennifer Rubin of the Post and MSNBC said the speech was “akin to those at the Brandenburg Gate by JFK and Reagan.”

Not to be outdone, the Lincoln Project’s Rick Wilson opined that “Biden did ‘Tear Down This Wall’ for our era,” while the group’s Tara Setmayer gushed, “Pres. Biden may have just given his ‘tear down this wall’ speech. Wow.”

There are several obvious differences between the two presidents’ remarks — such as the fact that Reagan was known as a master communicator and Biden is infamous for his gaffes, or that Biden’s line was far more incendiary than his predecessor’s. But the most glaring distinction is that Reagan intentionally included the line after weeks of thought, while Biden appeared to go off-script out of old-guy indignation and frustration. They’re nowhere near the same thing, no matter what media sycophants desperate for a moment of good PR for the self-sabotaging Biden administration say.

"Give WaPo, NYT No Credit For Grudgingly Noting Hunter's Laptop Is Real","Nearly two years after the New York Post reported that Hunter Biden exploited his dad now-President Joe Biden’s political connections for profit, the same corporate media that throttled coverage of the Biden family’s scandalous dealings are reluctantly admitting that Hunter’s abandoned laptop at the center of the controversy is legitimate.

Over the span of two weeks, both The New York Times and The Washington Post ran articles coyly confessing that the laptop — abandoned at a Delaware repair shop and later reported on by the New York Post and other conservative outlets and confirmed by his business associate — is indeed Hunter’s.

The NYT’s confession was conveniently buried under a mound of information about a federal investigation into Hunter’s taxes and The Washington Post’s admission is couched with language blaming “sloppy handling of the data” for a lack of full transparency and vetting.

Even though the same corporate media outlets that intentionally stifled the Hunter stories in 2020 have begun to acknowledge the laptop’s veracity, they don’t deserve praise for largely ignoring (and actively suppressing) the red flags about the Biden family business right before Biden was elected. The press’s sudden willingness to reveal already-reported details about the Biden family is no proper apology.

Only now, more than one year into Biden’s presidency, are the same publications that ran articles arguing that “we must treat the Hunter Biden leaks as if they were a foreign intelligence operation — even if they probably aren’t” willing to report that thousands of emails and other documents left behind by the president’s son are legitimate and that some of the documents and communications on the Mac “illustrate the ways in which his family profited from relationships built over Joe Biden’s decades in public service.”

Documents and communications uncovered on Hunter’s laptop in 2020 indicated that the president’s son used his dad’s political power to leverage deals with oligarchs in Ukraine and China, and possibly even gave a cut of his foreign business dealings to Joe Biden, who is indicated by a reference to “the big guy” in a key cash and equity deal. Even before the laptop was discovered, Republican Sens. Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley warned that Hunter’s shady business dealings could be potentially compromising for the then-Democratic presidential nominee.

One month before the 2020 election, however, the Democrats, corporate media, and Big Tech actively worked to conceal the damning story from the public and discredit and suppress any outlets that did report on it.

Shortly after the New York Post reported on the laptop, Politico rushed to publish a letter signed by dozens of former intelligence heads from the CIA, Department of Defense, National Security Agency, and more smearing the laptop story as “Russian disinformation.” These so-called “experts” admitted that they had never seen the laptop nor that they had any evidence to suggest that their “Russia, Russia, Russia” theory was accurate, but the letter quickly became the basis for the left to wage a censorship war on anyone and everyone who amplified the Hunter corruption narrative.

Even when current intelligence leaders confirmed that there was never any evidence that the Hunter laptop story was disinformation, Democrats and the media kept spreading the lie that the laptop was somehow not worth reporting on.

Despite a forensic analysis by a security researcher and former National Security Agency operative confirming what other outlets reported about the laptop nearly two years ago, WaPo still won’t admit that the Russian disinformation smear used by the retired intelligence community, corporate media, and Big Tech to justify throttling legitimate reporting on the Biden family business is completely false.

As a matter of fact, the publication goes out of its way to justify the argument used to intentionally downplay the findings on the laptop and mischaracterize them to save the elder Biden from criticism.

“Hackers sometimes create fake email accounts or gain access to authentic ones as part of disinformation campaigns — a possibility that cannot be ruled out with regard to the email files on Biden’s laptop,” WaPo noted shortly after claiming that “The Washington Post’s forensic findings are unlikely to resolve [the disinformation] debate, offering instead only the limited revelation that some of the data on the portable drive appears to be authentic.”

The New York Times and Washington Post are way too late to the game and do not deserve any praise for their perfunctory disclosure.

The corporate media spent months concealing important information from the public based on a phony accusation. The press may admit that Hunter’s laptop is legit, but don’t mistake their inch for a mile. The same people who knowingly bought into and spread the Russia collusion hoax colluded to deplatform and discredit their political and ideological enemies in the run-up to a highly-contested election. Only now, nearly two years later, have they begrudgingly confessed part of the truth. Their confession is nothing but a necessity as more information is revealed about the Biden family business which they are choosing to ignore.

Biden's Lack Of Strategy On Ukraine Shows He's Got None For U.S. Either,"The White House said this week it plans to release up to 180 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves, a million barrels a day for 180 days, to help bring down near-record gas prices that were climbing before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but have since spiked. It will be the largest release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve since it was established in the early 1970s, and it probably won’t work.

The specific reasons it probably won’t work — congestion on the Gulf Coast, a possible reduction in supply from Saudi Arabia and other oil producers, the fact that 180 million barrels over the next six months isn’t enough to offset the loss of Russian oil exports — are not as important as what the announcement tells us about the Biden administration’s plan for Ukraine and how it fits into an overarching national security strategy for the United States.

What it tells us is this: Biden has no plan for Ukraine, and no overarching national security strategy for the United States.

The forthcoming release of oil is not unique in this respect. It’s just the latest in a string of seemingly haphazard, impromptu policies and pronouncements from the Biden administration that have sown confusion among our allies and projected weakness and indecision to the wider world.

Some fault Biden for not doing more to help the Ukrainians, some for doing too much and risking open war with a nuclear power. What these critics should share, though, is the belief that Biden’s contradictory signals over the past month — halfhearted and constantly shifting military aid to Ukraine, the absence of any off-ramps for Russia, total economic war on Moscow, virtually no effort to facilitate or encourage negotiations —have been perhaps more dangerous than any clear and consistent policy might have been.

As the war drags on, this problem is getting worse, not better — more chaos, less clarity. Consider the past week’s fusillade of so-called “gaffes” during Biden’s trip to Europe. He told members of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division in Poland they would see the bravery of Ukrainians “when you’re there,” suggesting U.S. troops would soon be going into Ukraine.

He said the U.S. would respond “in kind” if Moscow used chemical weapons in Ukraine, implying we would launch a chemical weapons attack on Russia. Then in his big Warsaw speech he blurted out that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” which sent White House aides scrambling to clarify that no, Biden was not announcing a policy of regime change in Russia, he was just saying Putin can’t be allowed to invade his neighbors. (But then on Monday, Biden said he makes “no apologies” for his statement and he’s “not walking anything back.”)

At this point, no one is sure what the Biden administration’s plan is to help end the war in Ukraine, what it thinks a stable peace might look like, or even if regime change in Moscow is really off the table as a matter of White House policy. Biden has announced no conditions for the easing of sanctions on Russia, articulated no vision for how Ukraine might “win” or what that might look like, and with each new Biden “gaffe” the window for the United States to take the lead in a negotiated political settlement narrows.

All this suggests Biden has no idea what the American national interest is or what our national security strategy should be — in Ukraine or anywhere else. He seems only to have a vague sense that large and powerful countries should not invade their smaller and weaker neighbors. But when they do, how should America respond? What goals or national interests should guide our response? What should our priorities be? Biden and his advisors don’t seem to know.

They had better figure it out. The Ukraine war heralds a new era in geopolitics, one in which rival powers like China will press their claims and pursue their ambitions with every tool they have. It’s not enough anymore to hide behind the platitudes of a “stronger-than-ever NATO alliance,” as if that alone encompasses the American national interest. It’s not enough to insist, as then-Secretary of State John Kerry did when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, that “you just don’t in the 21st century behave in 19th-century fashion by invading another country on a completely trumped up pretext,” as if just wishing it would make it so.

What we need now is that which we have least: clarity and resolve. We need clarity about our chief adversary, China, and the resolve to prioritize containment of China above all else.

Elbridge Colby noted recently in Time that a return to global military dominance, such as the United States enjoyed in the “unipolar moment” after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is not feasible now even with increased military spending. While we do need to spend more on defense, he says, what we need above all is a strategy that prioritizes “being able to deny China, our greatest challenge by far, the ability to subordinate Taiwan or another U.S. ally in Asia, while enabling us also to modernize our nuclear deterrent and sustain our counterterrorism efforts.”

If news reports about the Biden administration’s recently completed, classified version of the National Defense Strategy are accurate, then we’re in trouble. According to Foreign Policy, the administration apparently delayed rolling out its national security and defense strategies because the Pentagon was making last-minute tweaks in light of the war in Ukraine, “suddenly shifting focus from a U.S. defense strategy that had eyes on China.”

Shifting our focus from China is one thing we should not do. The war in Ukraine has underscored the need for a clear-eyed assessment of what the United States can and can’t do overseas, and what the national interests really are. We can condemn Moscow’s predation on its neighbor and work to ease the suffering of the Ukrainian people while also recognizing that our great security challenges aren’t in eastern Europe but in the Asian Pacific.

Indeed, we need not just a defense strategy to contain China but an economic strategy as well. That includes policies aimed at U.S. corporations that do business in China, allies that trade with China, and indeed a wholesale reassessment of global trade and global supply chains. China is in effect our only peer competitor, and without a laser-like focus on containing Beijing, even if it means letting Europe take more responsibility for its own security, we will likely find ourselves before long watching another large country invade a smaller one.

If that happens, let’s hope we have people in the White House who won’t be caught by surprise, wondering what to do, and making it up as they go along.

Biden Doing Everything To Avoid Unleashing U.S. Energy Production,"President Joe Biden announced Thursday an “unprecedented” release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves maintained to have supplies during emergencies. Instead of unleashing American energy production to counter lockdowns’ disruption in global supply chains, 1 million barrels of crude per day will be released from the nation’s emergency stockpile for the next six months.

“The world has never had a release of oil reserves at this 1 million per day rate for this length of time,” the White House announced in a Thursday fact sheet. “This record release will provide a historic amount of supply to serve as bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up.”

Absent a radical shift in the administration’s energy policy, however, there’s no bridge in sight. Americans are coping with the highest gas prices ever recorded, compounded by inflation, with the national average reaching $4.33 per gallon earlier this month, according to an AAA tracker. On Thursday, a Federal Reserve analysis recorded inflation at a four-decade high, which followed a survey from Salary Finance out Wednesday reporting 1 in 5 Americans are running out of cash between paychecks.

After 14 months actively suppressing oil and gas production in the name of climate change, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine hampered the Oval Office’s diplomatic menu as the United States enthusiastically forfeited its energy independence. In the run-up to its full-scale invasion, Russia supplied more than 10 percent of the world’s crude but is now throttled by western sanctions against the primary source of revenue for the Kremlin’s war machine. Following the United States’s stint as an energy-independent net exporter of oil under President Donald Trump in 2018, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast the United States will revert to its role as a net importer this year under Biden.

Biden’s decision to tap the strategic oil reserves marks the third time the president opted to artificially bring down high gas prices with emergency stockpiles and no plan to make up the difference. In November, Biden also harnessed the stockpile to curb prices at the pump going into the Thanksgiving holiday. Gas prices dipped slightly following the 50-million-barrel release only to remain high a month later, hovering around $3.40 in January. Within two months, prices that were rising steadily even prior to Russia’s invasion eclipsed their prior high of $4.11 per gallon in 2008.

President Biden deployed the strategic oil stockpile for a second time less than a month ago, days after Russia launched its assault on Ukraine. In his second address to a joint session of Congress, Biden touted the release of 30 million barrels from U.S. reserves while doubling down on the same low-energy agenda that spiked gas prices upon his inauguration more than a year ago:

Let’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more; lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again.

Biden repeated the talking point about electric cars upon his latest deployment of the nation’s oil reserves Thursday and claimed there is “nothing in the way” of companies ramping up production.

“A typical driver will save about $80 a month from not having to pay gas at the pump,” Biden said in encouraging Americans to buy coal-powered electric cars, despite the average cost of an electric vehicle being north of $56,400, according to the Kelly Blue Book in December. That’s $5,000 more than an entry-level luxury car, averaging more than $51,300 in November, which is hardly affordable for Americans drowning under inflation.

Authorized to maintain 714 million barrels of crude, the U.S. Department of Energy reported the stockpile held more than 695 million barrels in 2011. After the completion of Biden’s latest drawdown in six months, the emergency reserves will be reduced to about two-thirds of their maximum capacity with 263 million barrels released under the current White House.

Repeated use of U.S. reserves without a plan to permanently increase U.S. oil and gas production was described by Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines as a “band-aid on [a] bullet wound.” It showcases an administration dedicated to pulling every lever possible to avoid allowing American producers to ramp up production to meet the nation’s energy needs. According to the EIA, Americans consumed an average of nearly 20 million barrels of oil a day, putting the White House release of 1 million barrels per day into perspective.

Instead of opening American energy projects the administration has shut down such as drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and permits for the Keystone XL Pipeline, Biden has continued to harass the oil and gas industry, and suppress production in the process. Just this week, Bloomberg reported the Biden administration is planning to delay oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico for a third consecutive year, signaling to the industry that the White House has no plans to endorse long-term production to reclaim energy independence.

The administration also repeated a popular left-wing talking point to complain that oil and gas producers were sitting on 9,000 drilling permits left unused. Those 9,000 permits, however, don’t mean producers are sitting idle with rights to extract untapped reserves at the flip of a switch, which would be corporate malpractice considering the current profitability.

Rights of Way (ROW) permitting, which can take years to approve, is still required, along with the billions in capital needed to drill. Uncertainty about operations on federal lands, prompted by the White House which delayed lease sales again in February, has held back the investment needed to ramp up operations. At the same time, another 4,600 permits to drill are awaiting approval from the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management run by an ecoterrorist.

Before pumping billions of dollars worth of capital and labor to drill, producers need signals of certainty from the White House that economically sensible drilling may proceed without sudden interruption. So far, however, President Biden has done everything but, while scapegoating Russian President Vladimir Putin, rival oil producers, and the industry itself for gas prices that started to soar from the very day Biden launched his assault on American production — inauguration day.

“President Biden’s decision to release more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is just a larger band-aid for the wounds inflicted on energy production by the Biden administration,” said Myron Ebell, the director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. “The Biden administration is still using every regulatory tool to slow oil and gas production on federal lands and offshore areas, delay pipeline and infrastructure approvals, and bully banks into dropping investments in new production.”

On Thursday, House Democrats endorsed the White House energy agenda, blocking the American Energy Independence from Russia Act for the fourth time.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/01/joe-biden-is-doing-everything-possible-to-avoid-unleashing-american-energy-production/,2022-04-01
Why Did Biden Charge That Putin Might Use Chemical Weapons?,"The contrast between President John Kennedy’s mature statesmanship during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and President Joe Biden’s inflammatory handling of the Ukraine conflict was stark.

Kennedy and his Soviet counterpart Nikita Khrushchev edged back from the brink of nuclear war and negotiated a solution that respected the vital interests, and saved the faces, of both parties. Biden, perhaps deliberately, exacerbated the conflict, made negotiations between Russia and Ukraine more difficult, and raised the odds of a general war. Where Kennedy was self-disciplined, Biden revealed himself as irascible and irresponsible — a danger to global security. His administration has brought us to the point where, if we are lucky, the Second Cold War has begun or, if we are unlucky, the Third World War is about to start.

In Europe, Biden made three (supposed) “gaffes”: he called for regime change in Russia; he indicated that NATO forces would be in Ukraine; and he threated to reply “in kind” if Russia used chemical weapons.

Although his controllers attempted to walk back each of these statements, it is unclear whether Biden a) inadvertently blurted out what he and his controllers are actually planning; b) was suffering a flashback to his years in the Senate, when he could say anything without anyone’s paying attention; c) was floating trial balloons; or d) misunderstood the policies of what is nominally “his” administration.

Chemical Warfare?

It is worth exploring one of these “gaffes”: that Putin is considering chemical warfare.

This is a serious charge made at a serious moment. It came not long after Russia charged that the United States had sponsored bio-weaponry research in Ukrainian facilities. But Biden cited no evidence to support his claim.

The United Kingdom was more circumspect. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said that “Russia could possibly be planning to use chemical or biological weapons in a ‘false-flag’ operation.”

Where Is the Evidence?

The world was left to wonder what evidence Biden had. The Biden-collusive media shows little interest in exploring that question. The Biden administration itself, as is its habit, expects us to believe that it has evidence merely because it says it does. Just a few weeks ago, when an Associated Press reporter pressed State Department spokesman Ned Price to disclose what evidence he had for a claim Price had made about Russian “disinformation,” Price repeatedly replied that the bare fact that he had made the claim was sufficient proof.

Yet it is doubtful that Russia, even if it possessed chemical weapons, would or even could use them. In a CNN interview, Gregory Koblentz, an authority on the subject, noted that if Putin did use chemical weapons, “it would not be too hard to trace back the use to Russia” and that it wasn’t clear “what the military value would be.”

Koblentz said that if the Russians were trying to kill Ukrainian civilians, “which is what chemical weapons are really good at, unfortunately the Russians have lots of conventional weapons that they can use very effectively,” and that “there’s some question about if Russia had chemical and biological weapons ready to go … Could they even use them effectively, given … how poorly they performed in … just supplying their forces with conventional firepower?”

Should We Trust Our Intelligence Agencies?

Biden’s defenders might retort that he based his charge on intelligence information — and that the disclosure of such information would compromise “sources and methods.” Or as Ring Lardner put it, “Shut up, he explained.”

U.S. intelligence agencies do not have a good record in matters like this. Maybe they got it right that Russia would invade Ukraine. But not long before, they (or the political masters to whom they reported) got it wrong in predicting when Kabul would fall to the Taliban and how strong a fight the Afghan military would put up.

And who can forget Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction? The Senate Report on Pre-War Intelligence in Iraq found that “[m]ost of the major key judgments in the Intelligence Community’s October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) … either overstated, or were not supported by, the underlying intelligence reporting.” Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, who chaired the investigation, said that “nobody inside the U.S. government had ever actually spoken to” Curveball, the source who provided “98 percent of the assessment as to whether or not the Iraqis had a biological weapon,” “except [for a single] Pentagon analyst, who concluded that the man was an alcoholic and utterly useless as a source.”

Russian ‘Disinformation’

Defenders of Biden’s claim might also point to Russian “disinformation” that the U.S. was sponsoring bio-weaponry research in Ukrainian laboratories.

Let’s assume that that was indeed “disinformation” — not because Biden says so, but because independent scientists, including some Russian scientists, reviewed the evidence that Russia produced and concluded that it didn’t support the claim.

Even so, that wouldn’t establish Biden’s counter-claims: it is a simple non sequitur to deduce that if Russia falsely accused the U.S. of developing bio-weapons, then the U.S. is right in alleging that Russia plans to use chemical weapons. At least the Russians produced “evidence” of a kind to substantiate their charges and convened a United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss them. By laying out the “evidence” for its claims, Russia invited independent scrutiny of the kind that appears to have refuted them. But the U.S. hasn’t documented Biden’s charges. Let Biden disclose his “evidence,” summon the Security Council to meet, and permit independent experts to review it.

Why Did Biden Go Public with His Charge?

Biden need not have made his charges on the world stage. If he genuinely feared that Putin planned to use chemical weapons, he could have spoken privately to Putin and warned that the U.S. would respond “in kind.” Why did he go public?

Biden purported to be pre-empting a “false flag” operation that Putin could have used to make it appear that Ukraine had made first use of chemical weaponry. But (to speculate): what if Biden’s “false flag” allegation was itself a false flag? What if his purpose was to cover a U.S. “false flag” operation that staged a chemical incident, blamed Russia for it, and used the pretext to justify military intervention and regime change in Russia? If Putin can play mind games, so can we.

Finally, we are just starting to learn about the president’s son Hunter Biden’s activities in financing Metabiota, a Pentagon contractor sponsoring Ukraine-based research into lethal diseases. Possibly that research had no connection with bio-warfare; but possibly the product was weaponizable, not only toxic. Either way, we urgently need more knowledge about Hunter’s financial ventures in Ukraine — and how they might have influenced his father’s remarks.

"Media: If Everything Weren't Horrible, Everything Would Be Awesome","Gas prices are at record highs, grocery bills are through the roof, and supply-chain disruptions are still leaving business shelves bare, but even amid the instability, some things never change: Democrats’ media lapdogs are still spinning the facts to a dizzying degree.

As an apt illustration, The Washington Post shared this article about Biden’s economy, from self-serious columnist Jennifer Rubin, to Twitter on Monday with the following snippet: “If it weren’t for inflation, this president’s economic performance would be unmatched.”

You really can’t make this stuff up. America is in such dire straits under the leadership of barely coherent President Joe Biden that the only way left to defend him is to say, If it weren’t for everything being horrible, it would all be wonderful.

To help Biden’s media lapdogs out, here are a few more amazing things — or, you know, things that would be if the opposite were reality.

If It Weren’t for Gasoline Being $5 a Gallon, Gas Would Be So Affordable

Gas has jumped 100 percent since 2020, with the national average above $4.00 per gallon. In some areas of the country, it’s a couple of dollars more, with fuel just outside Death Valley in California topping the charts at nearly $9.00 per gallon.

If the Washington Post needs help framing stories on gas prices, they’re welcome to use this headline: “If Biden’s $5 Gasoline Were Less Expensive, It Would Be Cheaper.”

If It Weren’t for Short-Staffing, Businesses Would Be Fully Staffed

Even as Rubin pumps recent employment numbers, plenty of stores across the country are still displaying “temporary hours” signs, waitresses are apologizing for slow service because “we’re just so short-staffed,” and “we’re hiring” signs are ubiquitous.

The pseudo boost in jobs isn’t coming from some sort of economic boom; it’s a painfully slow recovery from government lockdowns that hasn’t even reached where we were before the pandemic. Furthermore, the “unemployment rate” tells you nothing of the multitudes of people who opted to exit the labor force altogether and therefore aren’t included in the figure. But as the media would tell you, “If It Weren’t For Short-Staffing, Businesses Would Have All The Staff They Need.”

If It Weren’t for Supply-Chain Lockdowns, We Could Get Necessary Goods

Essential items are still taking forever to make it to their destinations, thus the shipping delays and empty shelves. That’s one of the many reasons the Biden administration’s gas-price solution of just buying an electric car was so absurd (that and, of course, the price tag).

But supply-chain disruptions certainly aren’t the Biden administration’s fault, and they’re not really a problem anyway because — and again, corporate press, feel free to nab this headline — “If It Weren’t For Supply-Chain Issues, We Could Get Our Hands On All The Things We Need.”

If It Weren’t for the Humanitarian Crisis on the U.S. Border, Biden’s Policies Would Be Second to None

After Biden’s political posture prompted more than 2 million Border Patrol encounters with illegal aliens on the border in 2021 alone, what could go wrong with his administration’s plans to repeal Title 42, the Trump-era policy that sped up the return of illegal border-crossers during Covid-19?

Thanks to his policies, dangerous cartels are empowered at the expense of women and children, and desperate migrants are left vulnerable at the mercy of the elements and the deadly Rio Grande. Yet journalists have used their platforms to explain that the border crisis is a result of the president being so “moral,” so they would probably be interested in a headline like, “If They Weren’t Empowering Cartels To Rape Women, Biden’s Border Policies Would Be Top Notch.”

If It Weren’t for Biden Family Scandals, This President Would Be Scandal-Free

We’ve known that Hunter Biden’s laptop was real since before the 2020 election — and thus all that the bombshell entails for his “big guy” father and their family corruption. But even as the corrupt media finally come out and admit it, they’re burying the lede to take attention off the Biden family and give the illusion that this administration is scandal-free.

In other words, their Biden coverage has the same air about it as Rubin’s fare: “POTUS Would Be Scandal-Less… If It Weren’t For The Biden Family’s Hard Drives Being Utterly Scandalous.”

If We Weren’t Depending on Foreign Adversaries for Oil, Biden’s America Would Be Energy Independent

Shortly after Biden willfully relinquished America’s energy independence that was achieved under President Donald Trump, our country has gotten a front-row seat to the atrocities that result from relying on your enemies for commodities such as oil.

The president and his press secretary have done their best to assure us that canceling the Keystone XL pipeline and suspending federal oil and gas leases had no effect on U.S. oil production. But one thing we can know for sure is that “If It Weren’t For Our Energy Dependence On Foreign Enemies, Biden’s America Would Be Energy Independent.”

This Is the Media’s Pattern

Rubin and The Washington Post make criticism of their work too easy, but Monday’s embarrassingly blatant spin wasn’t a lapse in journalistic judgment or a one-off oopsie. This type of framing is the media’s pattern, and it isn’t relegated to opinion columns.

It pervades America’s newsrooms. It also seeps out in fake fact-checks that acknowledge a statement is true but rate it “mostly false,” in wire stories that co-opt language like “pro-choice” and subversive pronouns, and in the continued use of Trump as a red herring to distract from whatever Biden nightmare is unfolding on a given day.

The corporate media are nothing more than a public relations arm for the Democrat Party, even if it means making nonsensical declarations like “If it weren’t for inflation, this president’s economic performance would be unmatched.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/05/bidens-media-lapdogs-if-everything-werent-horrible-everything-would-be-awesome/,2022-04-05
Biden's Record On Sex Ed Shows How Extreme Democrats Have Become,"Florida’s new law is garnering national attention for preventing teachers from engaging in classroom instruction related to “sexual orientation or gender identity” in kindergarten through third grade, and requiring parental involvement in decisions about a student’s mental health.

Critics have given the law the egregiously misleading moniker of “don’t say gay,” which has been dutifully parroted by corporate media outlets and in cringe-worthy segments at the Oscars, despite having no basis in fact.

Shortly after the bill was signed, President Joe Biden called the bill “hateful.” His press secretary, Jen Psaki, claimed the legislation was “designed to target and attack” children, and is “cruel” and “harmful.” Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg labeled the law “dangerous,” and his partner, Chasten Buttigieg, declared the law “will kill kids.”

But as he has on so many other key cultural questions, Biden has “evolved” on the issue of classroom instruction about sexual orientation. In 1994, he voted for an amendment that was far more draconian than he deems Florida’s law to be – one that specifically banned programs or discussion that “affirms a homosexual lifestyle” in schools nationwide, K-12.

Biden’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ Moment

In summer 1994, the Senate began debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the country’s primary federal education law. As part of that debate, Sen. Bob Smith, R-New Hampshire, offered an amendment to prohibit schools from receiving funds under the bill from “encouraging or supporting homosexuality as a positive lifestyle alternative,” which he defined as the “distribution of instructional materials, instruction, counseling, or other services . . . or referral of a pupil to an organization that affirms a homosexual lifestyle.”

Smith was joined in his effort by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-North Carolina, who amended the Smith amendment to shield it from modification. (Since the language of the two was effectively the same, I’ll refer to the amendment as Smith-Helms.)

In the debate that followed, Smith brought to the Senate floor a number of books and pamphlets featuring discussion and graphic images about sexuality, all of which had been prepared for children. “I encourage my colleagues to listen,” he said, describing the materials, “because there are some materials here that are so obscene that I cannot show them to the public. I cannot display them here and I cannot hold them up. I cannot quote from them, because to put them on the airwaves in any way, shape, or form would be considered obscene.”

He went on, “I ask each of my colleagues . . . How would you respond if your 12-year-old, or worse, your 6-year-old brought home some of the materials that I have at my desk?”

The deliberation didn’t stop there. Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, dubbed the “liberal lion of the Senate,” and for whom a room in the U.S. Capitol is named, came to the floor with a compromise. Along with Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont (then still a Republican), Kennedy appended the Smith-Helms amendment with language to, in his words, “assure that Federal funds are not used to promote or encourage sexual activity of any kind.”

The text of his amendment later put a finer point on it: No funds were to be used “to develop materials or programs directed at youth that are designed to directly promote or encourage, sexual activity, whether homosexual or heterosexual.” The Senate passed the amendment 99 to 0, with every Senate Democrat, including Biden, voting for it.

Kennedy, who had just three years before testified in a trial related to his own family sex scandal, offered a follow-up amendment to ban the distribution of condoms in public schools unless such a program had been “developed in consultation with parents” and provided information “concerning the health benefits of abstinence.” The amendment passed the Senate unanimously.

Then-Senator Joe Biden had nothing to say about these amendments at the time. While he is now compelled to denounce as “hateful” state-passed measures limiting instruction about “sexual or gender identity” in grades K-3, he had nothing to say about far more punitive policies that flat-out banned the instruction or materials “enouraging or supporting homosexuality” in all grades and all schools throughout the country. In fact, he voted for them.

When the Senate took up the Smith-Helms amendment late in the day on August 1, 1994, Biden cast his vote in favor, joining the 62 other senators who helped pass the amendment 63 to 36.

The Democratic Party Shift to Culture War Aggressor

While consistency isn’t necessarily the hallmark of lifelong politicians like Biden, it’s worth noting this 1994 vote for two reasons. First, to demonstrate just how far the Democratic Phas evolved on cultural questions in the two decades since, but second, to highlight just how far Biden actually exists outside of his positioning on the campaign trail as a moderate.

From his support for repealing the prohibition on federal funding for abortion – a policy he routinely supported while in the Senate – to forcing nuns to buy birth control and charging his Department of Justice to “do everything in its power to stop the rash of state laws that . . . violate the constitutional right to an abortion,” Biden has emerged as a willing handmaiden to the progressive jihad in the culture wars.

This is true in the area of gender ideology as well. On his first day in office, Biden issued an executive order directing his administration to ensure all regulations prohibit discrimination on, among other things, sexual orientation or transgender status – including allowing access by biological males to female restrooms, locker rooms, and school sports.

Biden has followed through on that commitment. His administration’s new Title IX rules will expand the definition of discrimination beyond sex to also include sexual orientation and gender identity. In his State of the Union address, Biden demanded that Congress pass the radical Equality Act, which would use sexual politics to erase the First Amendment.

While the left loves to blame the right for “stirring up the culture wars,” a Democratic Party that insists six-year-olds must be exposed to overtly sexual material isn’t the victim in the culture wars, they are the aggressor. In many cases, the rest of the country is just trying to keep up as the left moves the cultural goalposts (and even alters the English language) to more extreme positions every single week.

As The Federalist’s Culture Editor Emily Jashinksy put it, the left’s claim that conservatives are dragging the country into culture war fights “is the equivalent of one kid punching another kid on the playground, and then the second kid getting blamed for picking a fight.”

Biden’s evolution is a proxy for the evolution of the Democratic Party. His vote in 1994 is instructive because of how closely the debate 30 years ago mirrors the same debate that’s going on in states all over the country. Parents are objecting to graphic novels and books in school libraries that show and discuss explicit images of sexual behavior to young children. They are objecting to, in many cases, an ideologically driven attempt to present inappropriate sexual content and curriculum to kids without their consent.

In 1994, Biden took the side of parents in these disputes. In 2022, both he and his party call these parents hateful.

More Receipts Show Depth Of Biden Family Profiteering With Foreign Enemies,"Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin released new documents on Monday indicating that President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden and his brother James Biden were extensively involved with and profited from business deals with companies that operate on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and other corrupt regimes.

These new findings support what Grassley and Johnson both documented in their 2020 investigation into the Biden family’s corruption, but they have yet to catch due attention from the corporate media.

“These new records support the findings in our reports from last Congress in September and November 2020 — reports that the liberal media and our Democratic colleagues said were Russian disinformation,” Grassley said in his address to the Senate floor on Monday. “Forget the facts, forget the evidence, forget investigative journalism. The liberal media wanted to provide cover for then-candidate Joe Biden. They did whatever they could to smear our investigation.”

Much of the blame for this lack of attention, Johnson added in his floor speech, lies with their Democrat colleagues and the former intelligence officials who penned the sham letter claiming that information discovered on Hunter’s abandoned laptop was Russian disinformation.

“By casting doubt on evidence of the Bidens’ corrupt practices, these former intelligence officials interfered in the 2020 election to a far greater extent than Russia could have ever hoped to achieve,” Johnson said. “Their willing accomplices in the press amplified this disinformation letter and by doing so were equally guilty of egregious election interference.”

The Bidens Profited from CCP-Linked Business

Grassley and Johnson previously established that the Bidens were deeply involved with an energy company controlled by the CCP. As a result, that company, CEFC, funneled millions to Hunter to offer legal representation to the “spy chief of China,” Dr. Patrick Ho Chi-Ping. The same month that money was transferred to Hunter’s company Owasco through a middleman company, Ho was arrested for corruption and bribery.

Ho contacted James when he was arrested, but new documents released by the Republican senators show that Joe Biden’s brother, too, is guilty of receiving vaguely attributed funds from some of communist China’s biggest players.

Combined, James and Hunter’s companies received upwards of $4.8 million from CEFC, “an arm of the Chinese government,” between August 2017 and September 2018. James’s company Lion Hall Group alone received $1.4 million from CEFC via at least 20 wire transfers from Hunter’s company Owasco, something The Washington Post only recently admitted.

In addition to receiving money from CEFC, Hunter and James both profited off of numerous deals with CCP oligarchs and operated companies that shelled out tens of thousands of dollars to communist-connected businesses.

James was named a manager at Hunter’s company Hudson West Three in August 2017. At the time, the agreement designated $100,000 to Hunter and $65,000 to James every month. This lucrative deal was made possible after Northern International, a company with deep connections to communist China partner and CEFC founder Ye Jianming, wired $5 million to Hudson West Three that same month.

At the same time that Hunter’s company Hudson West Three was making payments to a CCP-controlled company, Hunter and James were also receiving wire payments with thousands of dollars. Recently released receipts show Owasco was entitled to several $165,000 wires from Hudson West Three in January of 2018. James’s company The Lion Hall Group also received nearly $18,000 from Hudson West Three the same month that several CEFC wire payments were made.

Receipts from April 2018 show that Hudson West Three, under the leadership of James and Hunter, wired tens of thousands of funds to Coldharbour Capital. This company was connected to Ye Jianming’s associate Mervyn Yan, who has strong ties to the communist regime in China.

“These transfers aren’t by accident. There’s clearly a scheme here,” Grassley said. “There’s a plan among and between all these individuals and their respective companies.”

The April receipts also show Hunter’s Owasco received another payment of $165,000 and James’ Lion Hall Group accepted a wire for roughly $34,000 for “office expense and reimbursement.”

In addition to presenting the sketchy payments from Hudson West Three, Grassley and Johnson produced bank records and credit card authorizations from September 2017 that confirmed that Hunter and James “went on $99,000 global spending spree courtesy of Gongwen Dong,” a Chinese executive and one of Hunter’s associates.

“The spending spree included airline tickets, purchases at Apple stores, hotels, and restaurants,” Grassley noted.

“With these new records, there can be no doubt that James Biden was financially connected to corporations and individuals with extensive links to communist China,” Grassley said. “And that he and Hunter Biden were in it together, working to help a Chinese government-linked energy company pursue deals and expand its reach in the energy sector.”

The Bidens Made Sketchy Deals Outside China

As Johnson noted in his floor speech on Monday, the Biden family business extends far beyond just striking deals with Chinese energy companies. There is and has been plenty of evidence suggesting that Joe, James, and Hunter were monetarily involved with multiple foreign oligarchs, especially in Ukraine.

Hunter exploited his father’s political reputation to strike business deals with oligarchs in Ukraine and China, a fact that was apparent even before the laptop emerged. Hunter may have even possibly given a portion of his equity deals to his father, but the legacy press refuses to report on that significance.

Despite Joe’s adamancy that he knew nothing of his son’s overseas business dealings, documents suggest that the now-president was actively engaged with his son’s business partners during his vice presidency.

Mere months after the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine in February of 2014, Joe met with Hunter’s business partner Devon Archer at the White House. Days later, Joe jetted off on an official White House trip to Ukraine because he was considered the “public face of the [Obama] administration’s handling of Ukraine.” One day after Joe’s visit to the Eastern European country, Archer was named to the board of Burisma. Less than one week after that, Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky had $23 million from multiple accounts seized by British officials.

A timeline of the Biden family’s involvement also shows that Hunter’s investment firm Rosemont Seneca Thornton received $3.5 million to “the corrupt and now-sanctioned wife of the former Mayor of Moscow,” Elena Baturina, at the same time of the revolution. A few months later, Hunter joined the Burisma energy company board despite having no previous experience in the energy sector.

“It is quite interesting to see how much significant activity involving the Bidens and corrupt actors in Russia and Ukraine occurred within a six-week period only two months after the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity. It sure looks like they intended to cash in on the turmoil in Ukraine,” Johnson noted.

Despite these congressional and journalistic findings, the corporate media dismissed any and all allegations against the Bidens as disinformation. The press not only failed to report on these bombshell findings but also refused to ask the president about his suspect involvement with Hunter’s business partner, Burisma, and the CCP-controlled firm that offered Hunter a massive payout.

Even now, after The Washington Post and The New York Times reluctantly admitted that Hunter’s abandoned laptop publicized in 2020 was legitimate, Johnson and Grassley agree that the press is “not telling the whole truth.”

“My guess is that they learned a lot from their coverage of Nixon’s Watergate scandal cover-up. They learned that when you’ve been caught in a cover-up — and that is what has happened here — you try to limit the damage by telling a little bit of the truth,” Johnson said.

There is a long list of questions from Johnson and Grassley about whether the Department of Justice and the U.S. intelligence communities have collected information about Hunter, Joe, James, and their communications with elites in countries that are the sworn enemy of the U.S. These questions, however, have gone unanswered for nearly two years.

Despite mounting evidence that the president and his family are deeply entrenched with and financially bound to foreign oligarchs, the Republicans said that the Biden administration has “been totally unresponsive to our oversight requests.”

Did Joe Biden's Millions Really Come From His Book Sales?,"In the week prior to the presidential election, I wrote a piece that asked the question, “Where Is Hunter Biden’s Money?” It was an important question then, even more so now. Given the legacy media’s recent validation of Hunter’s laptop that discussed a slice of equity planned for the “Big Guy” in a deal that involved an entity controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), we should know if any money from it (or other foreign sources) ended up in Joe Biden’s pocket, but we don’t.

Recall that despite then-presidential candidate Biden having bragged that he had released his tax returns with what his team called “a historic level of transparency,” the truth is that he only released his individual returns. Those returns provided no detail regarding the source of most of his income, dollars that flowed to him and his wife Jill by way of S-corporations they set up shortly after his departure from the office of vice president. Those entities, CelticCapri Corp (his) and Giacoppa Corp (hers), contained more than $13 million of the $17 million the couple had reported in income after Biden left office, most of it in the first year (2017).

The same media that ignored Hunter’s laptop has shown a complete incuriosity about these entities, accepting the premise that Joe and Jill raked in $13 million from their book deal to generate their huge increase in income. We simply don’t know if that’s true, though. What we do know is that their book sales were dismal.

Perhaps sensing smoke starting to build just before the election, USA Today published a “fact check” piece that attempted to support that the Bidens earned “$15.6 million … from speaking fees and book deals” in the years 2017 through 2019 and that “more than $10 million of that total income was profits from Biden’s memoir ‘Promise Me, Dad’ and $3 million in profits from Jill Biden’s book.”

Follow the source link provided to that $10 million number, though, and you’ll end up at Joe Biden’s campaign website with financial disclosure links to only their individual returns — no S-corporation tax returns. So, in reality, readers were left with a smokescreen. (Now the financial disclosure links for 2016, 2017, and 2018 have even been changed to connect to a Democratic National Committee fundraising site via ActBlue rather than the tax documents.)

I noted back in 2020 that, “While (Joe Biden’s) financial disclosures reasonably support the $2.7 million of net income reported by CelticCapri in 2018, a notable $8.7 million gap exists between its $9.5 million net income in 2017 and the $809,709 of disclosed income in that year from book tour and related speaking events. Since his disclosure covers only part of 2017, we lack the insight into other income that may explain it.”

To that obvious question, the legacy press simply yawned. But it will become increasingly harder for them to maintain a head-in-the-sand position as more information arises.

Senators Present Proof of CCP Connections

Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., recently showed proof of payments from what they said were CCP-controlled firms “that prove just how connected the Bidens were and how compromised President Biden probably is.” An August 2017 wire receipt showed $100,000 sent from CEFC Infrastructure Investment to Owasco, and a copy of a November 2017 check from CEFC Limited revealed $1 million paid to Hudson West III, LLC. Both recipient entities were tied to the president’s son.

Did any of that money, or other overseas income, go to Joe or Jill? We would know if the president provided a copy of their S-Corp. tax returns with all partner K-1’s that flowed through them. But the only detail we have is aggregate numbers reported on the couple’s individual returns.

As it stands, we’re left to trust USA Today that Jill grossed $3 million (royalties plus about $700,000 from speaking fees) for a book that sold only 7,000 copies in its first week, and that from that book deal she netted more than $1 million in the two years prior to its release, but only $175,319 in the year it was published (2019). It’s possible an advance was paid, but could a publisher have justified that amount?

The Numbers Don’t Add Up

We are told that Joe netted $12.2 million (after expenses) in the same deal for a book that sold 300,000 copies. Excluding the $4.2 million earned from touring and speaking, that yields $8 million of income that we are to assume came from book royalties (higher if we know his gross revenues before expenses).

For analysis purposes, consider that his book had a retail price of $27 for hardcover and $18 for paperback, and assume a reasonable mix of sales so the average price was $23 (with no discounting). On 300,000 books sold, gross revenues would’ve been just under $7 million. As an author, Joe would’ve likely received about 12 percent of that using a blended royalty rate (15 percent hardcover and 7.5 percent paperback typical from publishers), yielding about $800,000 income. Round it up to $1 million if you prefer. Double it. It’s still not close to $8 million.

Sure, he likely got an advance, but would a publisher have advanced that kind of money to an author whose prior work, “Promises to Keep,” sold only 49,000 copies?

So many questions.

Release the Full Tax Returns

Rather than ask for proof of sources of income, the media has been stuck in a repeating cycle of reporting about whether Joe and Jill underpaid payroll taxes. That’s a valid question, but it may miss the much larger one: Where did all of that money come from after Biden left office?

To that end, tax returns are a valuable investigative source document. Since the days of Al Capone, the rule has been clear: Don’t ever fail to pay taxes on any income, even if shady. It’s the easiest conviction for a prosecutor. So it’s logical that all income would be reported, and for any potentially over the ethical or legal line, an upstream S-Corporation would serve as the perfect mechanism to obscure it from view.

On a matter of this importance, all possibilities must be fairly considered until proof is established one way or the other. The president may have completely valid sources for all of his income, and if so, he should demonstrate it, particularly given the evidence of foreign money flowing through his son and indirect references to himself.

In releasing Biden’s tax return last year, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki commented that the “release (of) the president’s tax returns … should be expected of all presidents.” Surely she would agree this means the full set of documents.

If this question involved former President Donald Trump and one of his sons, The New York Times and The Washington Post would already be howling for full disclosure, and they would be right to do so. So perhaps they will join now in saying, “Mr. President, please clear the air of all doubt — release your full tax returns.”

Anne Applebaum: Hunter Biden Peddling Access To Joe Isn't 'Interesting',"The only thing worse than a lazy journalist is an incurious one.

And the only thing worse than an incurious journalist is one who is both lazy and incurious. See: the Atlantic’s Anne Applebaum.

Applebaum, a supposed disinformation expert, is unconcerned that the corporate press conspired during the 2020 election to censor legitimate news reports suggesting President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, may have leveraged his father’s political clout to line the family’s pockets.

The censorship incident is unremarkable, she says, because the alleged Biden corruption is itself unremarkable.

Applebaum’s comments came during an appearance at the ironically titled “Disinformation and the Erosion of Democracy” conference in Chicago. An attendee, University of Chicago student Daniel Schmidt, confronted Applebaum with her initial thoughts on the New York Post’s election-year scoop detailing the existence of a laptop, which reportedly belonged to Hunter Biden, and possibly incriminating documents and emails pertaining to the younger Biden’s overseas business activities. One such email purports to show Biden introduced his father, then the vice president, “to a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm less than a year before the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company.”

At the time, Applebaum remarked, “Those who live outside the Fox News bubble and intend to remain there do not, of course, need to learn any of this stuff.”

She was not alone in reflexively downplaying the laptop story. In fact, the broader press at the time falsely characterized the New York Post’s exclusive coverage as “Russian disinformation.” The New York Times this year confirmed the authenticity of many of the Biden emails.

In Chicago, Schmidt referenced a Media Research Center survey that shows 17 percent of polled Biden voters would have changed their vote had they been aware of the various Biden-related scandals, including the laptop the press actively suppressed.

He concluded, “Do you think the media acted inappropriately when they instantly dismissed Hunter Biden’s laptop as ‘Russian disinformation’? What can be learned from that and ensuring that what we label as disinformation is truly disinformation and not reality?”

Applebaum managed somehow to give a worse response than her initial reaction in 2020.

“My problem with Hunter Biden’s laptop is I think totally irrelevant,” she said. “I mean it’s not whether it’s disinformation or I mean I don’t think the – Hunter Biden’s business relationships have anything to do with who should be president of the United States.”

She added, “So, I didn’t – I don’t find it to be interesting. I mean that would be my problem with that as a major news story.”

Applebaum’s answer raises several difficult questions.

First, is she under the impression the laptop story involves only Hunter Biden?

Is she not aware that emails and related documents suggest Hunter Biden may serve (or may have served) as a bagman for his father, leveraging the Biden name to funnel cash into the family’s coffers? Does she not see the news value in documents suggesting the president’s son may have used his father’s position in the federal government to enrich both himself and other family members?

Does she not see the news value in the fact Hunter Biden’s overseas business activities, which may lead all the way back to the president, are under FBI investigation?

Does she not see the news value in the corporate press backtracking on its bogus “Russian disinformation” consensus?

One would think a speaker at the “Disinformation and the Erosion of Democracy” conference would find all of this incredibly interesting.

What, exactly, does Applebaum, a supposed expert on disinformation and democracy, find “interesting”? Let’s review some of her previous headlines:

“Tucker Carlson is stirring up hatred of America.”

“The MyPillow guy really could destroy democracy.”

“Laura Ingraham’s descent into despair.”

Uh-huh.

On Wednesday, CBS News reported at least 150 transactions involving either Hunter or James Biden’s global business affairs were flagged as concerning by U.S. banks for further review.

I’d say that’s pretty interesting — relevant even.

5 Reasons The Biden Budget’s Supposed ‘Deficit Reduction’ Is A Fraud,"Surprise, surprise: Joe Biden’s budget wasn’t worth the wait.

The administration finally submitted some of its fiscal proposals to Congress last week—seven weeks after the statutory deadline of the first Monday in February. Even then, major portions of the budget were not posted on the Office of Management and Budget’s website last Monday afternoon, with a note saying additional documents would get posted later in the week.

The administration tried to spend the weekend ahead of the budget’s release promoting its plan for a “billionaire’s tax.” The proposal, which some tax experts have criticized as both unworkable and unconstitutional, served one useful purpose: It attempted to distract from the fiscal gimmickry that the administration believes constitutes “deficit reduction.”

Even the press picked up on the “absurd” nature of the White House’s claims, in a Monday morning background briefing with reporters:

My core question is: A lot of the budget experts are saying, you know, look, the reason the deficit is falling is because the expiration of inherently temporary economic programs, and it’s kind of absurd for the administration to be taking credit for the decline from inherently temporary economic programs. Can I get a response to that?

Attempting to take credit for “deficit reduction” because Democrats’ plans to pass even more tax-and-spend legislation have run aground on Capitol Hill doesn’t represent the only gimmick in Biden’s budget—or even the biggest.

Biden’s 10-Year Deficit Baseline Has Increased

The budget includes two separate, but equally important, ten-year budget numbers. The first, the current-law baseline, reflects potential fiscal outcomes if the budget stays on “auto-pilot” absent additional changes. By contrast, the proposed budget assumes all of the administration’s proposals for both tax and spending get enacted into law.

Take a look at both sets of numbers from the budget proposed this week and the budget Biden proposed last May, and the differences—and lack thereof—become obvious:

May 2021 budget: Current law deficit of $13.176 trillion; proposed deficit of $14.531 trillion

Monday’s budget: Current law deficit of $15.466 trillion; proposed deficit of $14.421 trillion

Regarding the current law budget—that is, the fiscal policies we already have—Biden’s performance is nearly $2.3 trillion worse than last year. The budget Biden wants would reduce the ten-year deficit by only $110 billion, or only 0.7 percent, compared to what Biden himself proposed just last May.

‘Magic Asterisk’ for Build Back Bankrupt

When it comes to Biden’s floundering proposals to expand the welfare state, the budget includes the following footnote:

The Budget includes a reserve [fund] for legislation that reduces costs, expands productive capacity, and reforms the tax system. While the President is committed to reducing the deficit with this legislation, this allowance is shown as deficit-neutral to be conservative for purposes of the budget table. Because discussions with Congress continue, the Budget does not break down the reserve among specific policies or between revenues and outlays.

In other words, the budget just assumes that creating massive new entitlements would be fully paid for. That assumption comes despite Congressional Budget Office analyses showing that extending these entitlements in full over a decade—which Democrats want to do—would total nearly $5 trillion, far more than they have proposed in tax increases to offset that spending.

Ignores the Pork-Laden Omnibus Just Made Law

The budget includes another whopper of a footnote:

Reflects budget deficit reduction compared to a baseline that does not include the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117-103), which was enacted after the baseline was finalized. Deficit reduction relative to a baseline that incorporated that legislation would be significantly greater. [Emphasis added.]

In other words, because Congress just passed, and Biden signed into law two weeks ago, a bill with billions of dollars of earmarks—to say nothing of other unnecessary spending—practically all of Biden’s supposed “deficit reduction” has already vanished.

Unrealistic Economic Assumptions

The budget assumes inflation will total 4.7 percent for the fiscal year ending September 30, and then fall to a mere 2.3 percent for the fiscal year starting on October 1—estimates that a reporter rightly called “not realistic.”

On the background call with reporters, Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia Rouse revealed that printing and other deadlines meant the budget’s economic estimates were locked in as of last November 10. As a result, more recent developments, like expanded federal spending and the Ukraine invasion’s effects on oil and food prices, obviously did not get taken into account when formulating the fiscal plan.

But Rouse went on to claim that “we expect that…as we continue to work through the challenge of the pandemic, that we will keep economic activity going, supply chain pressures will ease, the extraordinary measures [i.e., the Federal Reserve printing money] will start to roll off as well, and we expect the economy to normalize.” This is exactly what the Biden administration predicted this time last year, but it didn’t happen.

No Meaningful Entitlement Reform

The Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is already effectively insolvent and faces losses of an estimated $457.8 billion between now and 2030. Yet Biden proposed few if any meaningful reforms either to Medicare or Social Security, other than the typical rhetoric about reducing fraud—an important issue, but not one that will prevent politicians from having to make tough political choices.

Any long-term budget and fiscal proposal, whether by a Republican or a Democrat, that does not tackle our entitlement crisis—particularly Medicare and Social Security—cannot pass the credibility test. On that count, Biden’s budget doesn’t even try.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/08/5-reasons-the-biden-budgets-supposed-deficit-reduction-is-a-fraud/,2022-04-08
"No Matter If Title 42 Stays Or Goes, A Massive Migrant Influx Is Coming","It’s a well-established fact that the U.S. border crisis began shortly after President Joe Biden assumed office and rescinded most of former President Donald Trump’s border security policies. Now, Biden and his team are working to remove one of the last lines of defenses left over from the Trump administration’s border policy toolbox.

Two years ago under Trump, the Centers for Disease Control instituted a public health order called Title 42 to expedite the expulsion of illegal border crossers during the Covid-19 pandemic. The policy was designed to prevent overcrowding in border facilities, which policymakers feared would lead to the rapid spread of Covid-19 along the border.

Now, the CDC is set to repeal Title 42 effective May 23, a decision it reached after months of pressure from leftist activists and politicians who claim the policy fueled “racism.”

Days after the CDC’s announcement, Missouri, Arizona, and Louisiana sued the administration and demanded a reversal, claiming the termination of Title 42 will trigger a surge of bogus asylum claims and “create an unprecedented surge at the border that will overwhelm Defendants’ capacity to enforce immigration laws at the border.”

Several Democrat senators the administration needs to install Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court also expressed strong opposition to the repeal of Title 42 without a plan to take on the expected migrant surge.

After facing pressure from its own side, the Biden administration might opt to keep Title 42 and reverse the CDC’s plan to end it next month. Any action from the White House, however, will not change the near-certainty of a massive border surge in late May.

Word about the end of Title 42 has already spread among smugglers and other migrant networks. As a result, thousands upon thousands of illegal migrants will trek to the U.S. southern border in coming weeks in hopes of filing an asylum claim and getting released into the United States for years.

Under the administration’s current policies, most of the illegal crossers will get into the United States — and be allowed to remain — without significant consequences. As my colleague John Daniel Davidson wrote earlier this week: “ending Title 42 under these circumstances means every migrant who gets over the border and claims asylum will get to remain in the United States, legally and with work authorization, for years. As a matter of policy, it is effectively indistinguishable from open borders.”

Due to these concerns of a rapid migrant surge at the end of May, there’s a small chance that the federal government will halt or at least delay rescinding Title 42. Keeping it, however, won’t deter illegal migrants who have heard the news from surging to the U.S.-Mexico border.

I discussed the potential for a migrant influx with Rodney Scott, the retired chief of U.S. Border Patrol, who was fired by the Biden administration last year because he didn’t share the administration’s lax approach to border security. Scott, now a distinguished senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said the expected rise in illegal border crossings at the end of May isn’t just a consequence of the Title 42 rollback but the Biden administration’s failed border policy altogether.

“The wave started when they went on national TV and basically said ‘Hey, you know, there’s a welcome sign in America and we’re not going to be deporting people. We’re going to shut down interior enforcement and we’re going to stop all effective programs on the border,'” Scott said.

It’s What The Cartels Want

Regardless of Title 42’s fate, thousands upon thousands of illegal crossers are guaranteed to pour across the border every day because they know where the Biden administration stands on border policy.

Mark Morgan, former acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told me that Mexican drug cartels, which control vast swaths of northern Mexico and profit off illegal immigration by charging migrants a fee to pass through their territory, see Biden’s open border policies as an opportunity to cash in.

“The cartels and smugglers, they pay attention to the shift in policies better than most Americans do in our country and so they’ve already used the rhetoric that Title 42 was going away to convince more migrants ‘Hey, you got to come now. Now’s the time to come because they’re going to start letting everybody in,'” Morgan said. “Some of the bump you’re seeing is just that the rhetoric has already begun. The smugglers have already convinced the migrants to come.”

Already, hundreds of migrants determined to come to the United States have formed a caravan and used a large cross as a battering ram to push through Mexican law enforcement officers at the Guatemala-Mexico border. Some of the migrants had been camped out in the southern Mexico border town of Tapachula for weeks waiting for Biden’s signal to make their way to the United States.

Most of the migrants in that group are from Venezuela and Northern Triangle countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Biden claims his administration is addressing the “root causes” of illegal migration in those regions, but border officials have also seen a growing number of migrants from hundreds of different countries in recent months, including Ukraine.

Even with Title 42, Biden’s border crisis has only grown worse each month as the administration scales back deportations even though illegal crossings rise.

“Beyond a policy shift, it’s really a continuation of the policies they set in place on day one and then creating a complete and total open border,” Morgan said.

In April of last year, nearly 1,000 illegal migrants crossed the border daily unpursued. This April, more than 8,000 migrants are expected to be apprehended at the southern border every day. According to current Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz, that number “will probably become the norm over the next 30 to 45 days.”

Ever since Biden repealed Trump’s border security measures, illegal crossings have grown exponentially. By removing protections such as the Migrant Protection Protocols (also known as the Remain in Mexico program) and explicitly scaling back ICE arrests and deportations, Biden has encouraged illegal immigration.

Already, border officials have logged at least one million arrests just six months into the 2022 fiscal year, putting them on track to record more than 2 million encounters by the end of the fiscal year.

Last summer, some 15,000 Haitian migrants congregated under a bridge near the border in Del Rio, Texas. The humanitarian crisis was a nightmare for border officials and the White House, which finally caught some of corporate media’s wrath when images of the squalid encampment emerged.

Despite criticism about its border policies then, the administration never changed course. Instead, Biden’s team doubled down and even spread lies about border agents whipping migrants, which the press amplified.

There’s ‘Got-Aways’ and Then There’s ‘Walk-Aways’

With so many people crossing the border, border officials are struggling to keep up.

“There’s not even enough computer terminals or bandwidth to effectively process all these people crossing the border, which is why they end up getting released on parole,” Scott explained to me. “It’s really just semantics. They are basically just released into the U.S. with very minimal records checks because they’re only doing record checks against pretty much U.S. databases.”

Processing migrants is already a disaster, and the removal of Title 42 is only bound to make it worse. Even now, the administration is planning to introduce “pre-screening” methods including apps designed to cut down processing time by cutting out important vetting processes.

Hundreds of thousands of illegal crossers enter the United States to surrender to border officials. Oftentimes, these migrant are released into the United States with little to no vetting or leverage to report to an ICE office. Hundreds of thousands more are crossing undetected or without being apprehended.

In the 2022 fiscal year alone, which began in October, border officials recorded more than 300,000 “got-aways,” who did not surrender to border officials and were not apprehended.

As bad as that number seems, it’s actually worse than that, because those 300,000 “got-aways” do not account for everyone who crossed the border undetected, only the ones border officials were able to record but not apprehend. It’s also just a small portion of the 2.5 million migrants who have illegally entered and stayed in the United States since Biden assumed office.

The Border Crisis Doesn’t Just Affect Border States

The illegal migrants who are released into the United States or sneak past Border Patrol usually have a plan. Many have jobs lined up and places to live. Oftentimes, their plans take them far from the southern border.

“We’re getting to a tipping point,” Scott said. “This many people being released into the U.S. this fast is going to change the demographics of U.S. cities because nothing stays at the borders.”

This is a cause for concern for many states struggling with the criminal effects of an open border, not just states that sit close to Mexico. As Morgan noted in our conversation, “the overwhelming majority of illegal migrants do not stay in the border towns and states.”

“What happens and what comes through our borders does not stay there. The border cities and states there, they receive the additional brunt of it, but they’re just the throughput,” Morgan explained. “And it doesn’t matter what the danger is whether that’s an invasion of illegal migrant, or drugs or gang members or criminal migrant, or a threat to our national security vulnerability, the border towns and states are the throughput but they’re making their way to every town, city, and state.”

When illegal border-crossers are released without significant repercussions and without being forced to report to an immigration facility, it endangers the entire nation. In 2021, approximately 47,000 migrants were released into the United States because of Biden’s policies but did not report to ICE on time or at all, as they were required to do.

Cartels, gangs, and other illegal operations are the first groups to exploit this release loophole for criminal activity. They use Biden’s lax border enforcement to shuttle illicit drugs and smuggle migrants into the United States undetected. These deadly drugs such as fentanyl are trafficked through the southern border in industrial quantities. As a result, nationwide drug overdoses are on the rise.

“When you open your borders up to one threat or one crisis, you’re opening your borders up to the vast set of threats that we face,” Morgan said. “In this case, illegal immigration. But what this administration wants people to believe is somehow you can support border security and support illegal immigration at the same time. That’s just a bald-faced lie. They’re not mutually exclusive. They’re interconnected.”

Biden has thus far only made the border crisis he created worse, but Scott says it’s not for a lack of possibility: “The last administration proved that you can control the border,” Scott said.

Biden and his administration are simply choosing not to.

“The [Biden] administration inherited the most secure border in our lifetime and they dismantled it,” Morgan said.

"In 2021, Joe Biden Didn’t ‘Pay His Fair Share’ in Taxes Again","To the Biden White House, the final working day of last week wasn’t Good Friday—and it wasn’t Jackie Robinson Day, either. To borrow an analogy from “The West Wing,” the Biden White House used last Friday as “Take Out the Trash Day,” dumping out President Biden’s 2021 tax returns late on a Friday afternoon, ahead of the Easter and Passover holidays.

This year, Tax Day didn’t come until Monday, April 18. One would think that, because Biden has released his tax returns and his predecessor did not, he would want to highlight this fact in a very public manner. Why didn’t Biden wait until Monday, and hold a big press conference where he could wave around his returns for everyone to see, to emphasize the fact that he’s “not like Donald Trump”?

Because Biden does have something to hide. He apparently has a dirty little secret—actually, it’s a pretty big secret—that he doesn’t want the American people to learn about. According to his own Treasury Department, Biden didn’t “pay his fair share” in taxes, and hasn’t for several years.

Corporate Loophole

I have written about this issue on several previous occasions. Upon leaving the vice presidency in January 2017, Biden and his wife Jill established two S-corporations to handle their book and speech income. By characterizing most of their income as profits from the corporations rather than wages, the Bidens were able to avoid payroll taxes on more than $13 million worth of income.

In 2021, they were back at it again, writing off $61,995 in corporate profits as exempt from payroll taxes, as evidenced on page 13 of their returns:

This $61,995 gets broken down in two ways: $29,234 comes from Joe Biden’s CelticCapri Corporation, while $32,761 comes from Jill Biden’s Giacoppa Corporation. In the president’s case, Biden avoided paying 3.8 percent tax on his nearly $30,000 in corporate profits—2.9 percent that funds Medicare, and an additional 0.9 percent imposed by Obamacare. (So much for Biden’s claim that “Obamacare is personal to me.”)

Jill Biden, who earned roughly $67,000 as a teacher at Northern Virginia Community College last year, avoided far more in taxes, as she did not reach last year’s Social Security wage cap of $142,800. Because she would have had to pay Social Security taxes on all wages up to the wage cap, classifying her nearly $33,000 in book income as corporate profits rather than wages meant Jill Biden didn’t just avoid paying Medicare taxes on these earnings—she avoided paying Social Security taxes as well.

All told, the Bidens seem to have dodged more than $6,100 in Medicare and Social Security taxes in 2021 alone:

Joe Biden: $1,110.89 ($29,234 times 3.8 percent)

Jill Biden: $5,012.43 ($32,761 times 15.3 percent)

This tax evasion comes after the Bidens appear to have previously avoided at least $517,000 in Medicare and Obamacare taxes from 2017 through 2020.

At least part of their scheme included potentially illegal tactics. As I have alleged in a complaint to the IRS regarding both Biden’s tax returns and his accountant’s conduct, I—along with many other tax experts—believe that in 2017 and 2018, Biden paid himself such a low salary as to violate IRS guidelines on “reasonable compensation.”

Treasury Says Biden Didn’t ‘Pay His Fair Share’

Regardless of whether the Bidens’ 2021 returns also violated tax laws, they constitute very clear hypocrisy—as one might expect from a career Washington politician. Note this passage from last year’s Treasury budget making the argument for closing the very loophole Biden continued to exploit in office, just as he had the past four years:

Different treatment [i.e., allowing S-corporation profits to avoid payroll tax] is unfair, inefficient, distorts choice of organizational form, and provides tax planning opportunities for business owners, particularly those with high incomes, to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.

If Biden really cared about the wealthy “paying their fair share,” he would look in the mirror, get out his checkbook, and write a check for the hundreds of thousands of dollars in Medicare and Obamacare taxes he appears to have dodged for the past five years. That would involve practicing what one preaches—or in other words, having integrity. Try that some time, Mr. President.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/18/tax-records-show-that-in-2021-joe-biden-didnt-pay-his-fair-share-in-taxes-again/,2022-04-18
Biden Dodged Blame For Lies About Hunter's Dealings Because Media Let Him,"President Joe Biden lies about pretty much everything and his professed lack of knowledge of Hunter Biden’s sketchy foreign business dealings is no exception. Despite mounting evidence that Biden knew of and was involved in his son’s overseas transactions, the corporate media gladly ignored his role in the Biden family business and subdued any evidence suggesting otherwise.

The New York Post reported this week that Hunter’s closest business partner Eric Schwerin made nearly 20 visits to the White House and “other official locations” while Biden was vice president and while Hunter was finagling deals with foreign oligarchs in Russia and China.

Most of the meetings were between Schwerin and Joe and Jill Biden’s aides. One of the meetings included Schwerin, who was president of Hunter’s investment fund Rosemont Seneca Partners, and Biden in the West Wing on Nov. 17, 2010.

These Obama-era White House visitor logs further prove Biden knew that Hunter was using his name and title to seal deals with foreign oligarchs and enrich the Biden family business.

Emails from Hunter’s infamous laptop already signaled that Biden knew about his son’s work and even had relationships with Hunter’s business partners including a Burisma adviser Vadym Pozharskyi.

“Thank you for inviting me to DC and giving me an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together,” Pozharskyi wrote in an email to Hunter in 2015, just a few months before Biden lobbied for the firing of a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.

It wasn’t until a few weeks ago, however, that the corrupt press bothered to start asking about the president’s connections to his son’s deals.

“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Biden said at a Democrat fundraiser in Iowa in 2019.

He repeated his firm denial just a few months later to Axios’s Mike Allen when he asked about Hunter’s position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.

“I don’t know what he was doing. I know he was on the board. … I trust my son,” Biden, who was visibly angered by the question, exclaimed.

Allen noted that Biden’s response didn’t “pass the smell test.” His apparent skepticism about the Biden family business, however, obviously didn’t carry water with his outlet or any other corporate media organization when the New York Post reported on Hunter’s laptop less than a year later.

Instead, the corrupt press lied that the laptop was “Russian disinformation” and refused to cover the treasure trove of corruption exposed by emails and documents on the Mac. Big Tech also censored any mention of Hunter’s laptop into oblivion just one month before the November 2020 election. It wasn’t until recently that these same major outlets that refused to cover the bombshell information reported by the New York Post admitted that the laptop is legit.

In that same vein, after Biden said he didn’t know anything about Hunter’s business dealings, NBC News journalist Kristen Welker took Biden’s claim that “My son has not made money in terms of this thing about, talking about China” at face value when moderating the final presidential debate in 2020, and waited another year before she finally asked the White House about the president’s false comments.

“During the last presidential debate, [Joe] Biden was asked if there’s anything inappropriate or unethical about his son’s relationships, business dealings in China and/or Ukraine. The president said ‘nothing was unethical.’ … Does the White House stand by that comment?” she asked last month.

White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield declined to acknowledge Biden’s lie and instead defended the president and his son. She endorsed Biden’s claim that “nothing was unethical” about Hunter’s complicated dealings and that Hunter “has not made money” off of his transactions with a Chinese Communist Party-controlled company despite receipts showing otherwise.

Why did Welker just recently press the Biden administration about an issue that came up two years ago and again less than a month before a key election? She had the opportunity to push back on Biden directly during the debate but she didn’t.

The corporate media is the propaganda arm of the administration, which is why, when Biden dismissed President Donald Trump’s laptop questions during the final debate as Russian disinformation, so did Welker and everyone else in the corrupt media establishment.

There’s plenty of evidence that Biden was involved and may have even profited off of Hunter’s foreign business dealings but the propaganda press refused to ask the right questions at the right time. They were so wrapped up in fixing the narrative to ensure a Biden victory that they failed to do their jobs and now Americans, many of whom said they would have voted differently in 2020 if they knew about Hunter’s laptop and the Biden family corruption, are paying for it.

Biden Used To Support Overturning Roe v. Wade,"Hours after a draft opinion of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision was leaked, showing that the overturning of Roe v. Wade is likely imminent, President Joe Biden threatened that his administration was prepared to undo the high court’s ruling.

“I directed my Gender Policy Council and White House Counsel’s Office to prepare options for an Administration response to the continued attack on abortion and reproductive rights, under a variety of possible outcomes in the cases pending before the Supreme Court,” Biden said in a statement Tuesday morning. “We will be ready when any ruling is issued.”

The ardent defense of Roe from the nation’s most powerful office stands in stark contrast to Biden’s past attempts to override the 1973 landmark abortion case while he was a senator from Delaware.

One month before Biden jumped into the crowded 2020 race for president, The New York Times outlined his record on abortion over his decades-long career. Biden was sworn into the Senate the same year the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade. In 1982, Biden, who was then ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, supported a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision that his own White House is now pledging to protect 40 years later.

“I’m probably a victim, or a product, however you want to phrase it, of my background,” Biden said at the time. Biden called his key vote “the single most difficult vote I’ve cast as a U.S. senator.”

The incumbent president’s abortion record would become anything but consistent throughout his career in Washington. He supported federal restrictions before opposing them based on the political headwinds.

National Review Senior Writer and former Federalist Senior Editor David Harsanyi highlighted on Twitter a 1994 letter from Biden where the future president bragged about opposing abortion funding 50 separate times.

Biden, whose faith as a Roman Catholic was routinely amplified by a friendly press throughout the 2020 contest, also voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Act of 2003 and was described as a “reliable ally” of similar legislation in the ’90s. In fact, Biden complained that allowing partial-birth abortions didn’t go far enough.

“It did not, as I would have liked, ban all post-viability abortions,” Biden said on the Senate floor of a proposal in 1997.

When running for president in 2019, Biden reversed his four-decade support for the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortion, the same week he professed his commitment to its protection.

“If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s ZIP code,” the former vice president said in Georgia to court the party faithful.

Biden’s flip to support the killing of babies in the womb has been controversial given his claims to be a faithful Roman Catholic. The church finds support for the procedure to be a serious violation of the faith and therefore worthy of one’s denial of communion. In 2019, Biden was denied communion at a South Carolina Catholic church on the campaign trail over his endorsement of abortion.

Despite his activism to protect nationwide abortion access, the corporate press has always elevated Biden as a “devout Catholic” to the ire of bishops within the church, who have also been antagonized by the president’s history of persecuting nuns.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/03/biden-pledges-to-protect-roe-after-once-supporting-constitutional-amendment-to-overturn-it/,2022-05-03
How Congress Should Investigate Joe Biden’s Taxes,"On Tax Day this year, President Biden once again bragged that he released his tax returns—as if that alone proves his integrity. But to paraphrase Winston Churchill, Biden should be more modest about his tax behavior, because he has much to be modest about.

The record not only shows that Biden and his wife used a loophole to avoid payroll tax payments that fund Social Security, Medicare, and Obamacare. It also strongly suggests that Joe Biden abused that loophole, in ways that led to deliberate and significant underpayments of taxes.

Because of those actions, and the evidence supporting this account, I recently filed complaints with the Internal Revenue Service against both Biden and his accountant regarding their actions. If and when Republicans take control of Congress next year, they should follow up by investigating Biden’s questionable conduct.

Rank Hypocrisy

Upon leaving the vice presidency in 2017, Biden and his wife Jill funneled their book and speech income through two S-corporations. By characterizing more than $13 million of that income as corporate profits rather than wages, the Bidens avoided paying more than $500,000 in payroll taxes.

Ironically enough, the Biden administration has proposed closing this very loophole, with the Treasury claiming it allows individuals with “high incomes to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.” Democrats in Congress have similarly proposed closing the “Biden loophole” in their $5 trillion Build Back Bankrupt legislation. While Biden previously exploiting a loophole he now wants to close makes him a hypocrite, it doesn’t automatically make him a tax cheat.

Legal Violations

But Biden paid himself such a low salary that multiple tax experts believe he violated federal tax guidelines. For starters, in 2017 Biden paid himself a 37 percent lower salary—just under $150,000—than the $230,700 he received as vice president. To ask the obvious question: What Washington dignitary earns less after leaving office than he earned while serving in the federal government?

In this case, the answer is equally obvious: The lower the salary Biden paid himself, the more money he could classify as corporate profits—and the more in payroll taxes he could avoid. Little wonder then that, on an inflation-adjusted basis, Biden in 2017 paid himself less than the annual salary he received in each of 46 of his years of service as a senator and vice president.

Biden underpaid himself relative to his peers, too. Data from the IRS’ Statistics of Income show that in 2017, firms with the same amount of revenue as Biden’s corporation—companies with between $5 million and $10 million in revenue—paid their executives salaries averaging 33.6 percent of net income. By comparison, Biden paid himself a salary of only 1.51 percent of his company’s net income in 2017, and 9.9 percent of his company’s net income in 2018, indicating he was deliberately underpaying his salary to avoid payroll taxes.

Consider too that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, after leaving office as Federal Reserve Chair, received an average of $126,509 for making 57 separate speeches in 2019 and 2020. Unlike Biden appears to have done, Yellen did not attempt to dodge payroll taxes by funneling her speech revenue through an S-corporation.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton charged an even higher amount, setting $225,000 as her standard per-speech fee. Yet even as he feverishly worked the lecture circuit himself after leaving the vice presidency, Biden paid himself in salary for an entire year less than what Clinton charged for a single speech—all apparently so he could lower his payroll tax bill.

Complaints Pending with IRS

Tax experts have publicly criticized Biden’s tactics, saying he underpaid his salary by millions of dollars—improperly avoiding thousands and thousands of dollars of payroll taxes on that income. After reading their opinions, and conducting my own analysis, I submitted a complaint to the IRS several months ago, asking the IRS to investigate Biden’s returns and recoup his underpayment.

I also recently filed a complaint against Biden’s accountant, Walter Deyhle. Under the IRS standards for accountants, Deyhle had an obligation to undertake the type of analysis I outlined above, which would have shown Biden needed to pay himself a far higher salary. Either Deyhle did not do this analysis, making him negligent, or Biden ignored his accountant’s advice and underpaid himself, and Deyhle improperly signed Biden’s tax return anyway.

Congress Should Act

If they retake control of Congress in November, Republicans should use the precedents set in the dispute over President Trump’s tax returns to subpoena Deyhle’s files, to uncover the facts about Biden’s taxes. Did Deyhle tell Biden his actions likely violated IRS guidelines, and if so, why did Deyhle sign Biden’s return?

Congress should also investigate why the IRS has had Trump’s returns under audit for more than a decade, while declining to audit Biden’s returns from the years before he became president, notwithstanding the public criticism Biden’s returns have received. The disparate treatment of two politicians regarding questions about their taxes leads to the additional question of whether IRS bureaucrats allowed ideology to influence their conduct, in a potential reprise of the Lois Lerner scandal.

Ironically enough, for all the effort Democrats have made to subpoena Trump’s taxes, their purported reasons for demanding his returns seem much less compelling than the IRS treating politicians of two different parties differently with respect to audit decisions. (While being in a hurry to subpoena Trump’s taxes, they have shown no desire to investigate Biden’s questionable tax returns.) And if an investigation revealed that political motivations played a role in the decision to decline an audit of Biden’s taxes, that would obviously necessitate further action by Congress, to (again) rein in an administrative state run amok.

The American people deserve a tax system that treats everyone equally under the law. When one expert says that “whether the IRS would be willing to” require Biden to pay back taxes is “questionable” given his role as chief executive, it undermines the effectiveness of the tax code for all Americans. To lead by his own example, Biden should pay back the taxes he owes—and if he doesn’t, Congress should investigate why the IRS has not held him to account.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/09/how-congress-should-investigate-joe-bidens-taxes/,2022-05-09
Why Biden Can’t Persuade Americans He Can Fix Inflation,"In a recent speech, President Biden tried to empathize with the plight of average Americans struggling with high inflation. But as might be expected of someone who prioritized acquiring luxury real estate over paying taxes that fund Medicare and Obamacare, the plutocrat’s attempts to deflect a politically toxic issue for Democrats fell flat.

Beyond trying to pin skyrocketing prices on Vladimir Putin—as if inflation didn’t start until the invasion of Ukraine began in February—Biden wants to turn the inflation issue from a referendum on his (lack of) leadership into a choice between his approach and Republican proposals. But playing the political blame game has about as much policy merit as its chances of political success—which is to say, slim and none.

Irony 1: High Inflation Is Rarely ‘Transitory’

High inflation falls into the same category as events like fiscal crises and wars: Much easier to start than to finish. Once inflation expectations become unmoored—i.e., when people believe prices will continue to rise for a sustained period—economies often fall into a “wage-price spiral.” In this scenario, workers demand higher wages to reflect a higher cost of living, employers pass on those higher wages in the form of higher prices, and the cycle repeats.

In most cases, only a sharp rise in interest rates, likely resulting in a severe recession, can break a wage-price spiral. For this reason, policy-makers should act before inflation gets out of control, because once the horse has bolted from the proverbial barn, it’s too late to fix the problem—or at least fix the problem easily.

By trying to focus on what Republicans would do now, Biden, perhaps unsurprisingly, misses the point. Republicans can and should argue that if they had controlled Congress in 2021, there wouldn’t be an inflation problem now to begin with—they would have stopped federal over-spending before price rises got out of hand. By contrast, Biden’s largest error came by ignoring all the warning signs over the past year-plus showing that inflation continued to accelerate.

Irony 2: Biden’s Agenda

A Reuters report on Biden’s address noted that “the President did not announce new policy measures in the speech”—perhaps the best news coming out of that address. Of late, Biden’s proposals have ranged from ineffective to potentially harmful. Attacking companies for “price gouging,” and pledging investigations of same, likely falls into both buckets—discouraging companies from achieving the revenues necessary to grow their enterprises, while not solving the underlying problems.

Biden didn’t mention it by name in his speech, but his Build Back Bankrupt legislation would exacerbate inflation. The bill’s budget gimmicks seek to mask its full cost, likely in the neighborhood of $5 trillion or more over a decade. Coming on the heels of the gusher of government spending over the past two years, these new entitlements would only worsen inflation.

Irony 3: Republicans Do Have Solutions That Would Lower Prices

Contrary to Biden’s claims, congressional Republicans do have two obvious solutions on hand that would address the spike in inflation. Here they are.

Repeal Biden’s “Covid Stimulus:” Press reports have listed some of the many wasteful projects that governments funded using the $1.9 trillion “stimulus” measure Democrats passed last March under the guise of “Covid relief.” The extravagant pork-barrel spending goes from coast to coast, from irrigation systems at a golf club in Colorado Springs to upgrades to a minor league baseball park in New York.

But the Congressional Budget Office notes that chunks of that spending have yet to go out the door. CBO estimates the bill will increase the deficit by $529 billion in the current fiscal year (which ends September 30), $114 billion in the upcoming fiscal year (which begins on October 1), and $59 billion in the fiscal year after that.

In his speech, Biden said that “reducing the deficit is one of the main ways we can reduce inflationary pressures.” Repealing last year’s “stimulus,” and rescinding any amounts not already obligated, would do just that. How about it, Mr. President?

Energy Exploration: In his speech, Biden also claimed Republicans “have no plan to bring down energy prices today.” That claim is false.

Republicans have proposed numerous ideas to would bring down energy prices. I outlined some of them in a recent article, starting with efforts to increase energy exploration in our own backyard. Because oil and natural gas operate in “spot” markets, any announcements signaling an expansion of American energy would bring down prices almost immediately, well before any new oil or gas wells come online.

But leftist climate warriors don’t want to increase energy exploration activities, which explains why the Biden administration recently canceled oil and gas sales in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.

Therein lies the underlying problem. While Biden and his elite colleagues remain firmly ensconced in their mansions, they want you to pay the price for their “climate sins.” All of this demonstrates that, while Biden may sound sympathetic to families’ inflation plight, he has no real intention of doing what it takes to bring the American people true relief.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/16/why-biden-cant-persuade-americans-hell-fix-inflation/,2022-05-16
Friedman Went To Lunch With Biden And Came Away Full Of Crap,"The New York Times’ Thomas Friedman — yes, the Thomas Friedman — ended his most recent and very bland column this week with the declaration that he had “left my lunch with the president with a full stomach but a heavy heart.”

Friedman no doubt left his meeting full and heavy. The article he churned out after his very important meal with President Biden is beyond bloated. Although Friedman said their conversation was off-record, he was gracious enough to tell his readers what he ate and how he “felt” about the encounter. In other words, it’s a typical Friedman column— practically useless.

His ultimate takeaway: Biden has been exceptionally good at managing our march to the brink of World War III. (It was apparently an epic failure that, unlike Biden, Donald Trump couldn’t goad Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine much sooner.)

“What I felt afterward was this,” wrote Friedman. “For all you knuckleheads on Fox who say that Biden can’t put two sentences together, here’s a news flash: He just put NATO together, Europe together and the whole Western alliance together — stretching from Canada up to Finland and all the way to Japan — to help Ukraine protect its fledgling democracy from Vladimir Putin’s fascist assault.”

Well, if that doesn’t make your heart soar with patriotism, I don’t know what will, FOLKS!

The only problem with that Olympian achievement Friedman credits to Biden is that it’s not true. Even if it were, which one of the people who voted for him feels that it made her life any better?

Setting aside that Ukraine isn’t a member of NATO, and thus is, in theory, owed nothing by the alliance, Biden hasn’t shown any degree of remarkable leadership there. He cut off our Russian energy imports, but our tried and true allies in Germany did not follow suit.

Biden requested that our reliable friends in Poland send fighter jets to Ukraine. Their response: No thanks! Great Britain sent their prime minister to Ukraine for a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Biden sent his wife. (I believe we shouldn’t be sending Americans to war zones where our national interests are, at best, ambiguous, but so long as we’re talking about leadership…)

The rest of Friedman’s article is a list of excuses for why Biden has been a suck of a president.

It’s Trump’s fault: “a movement by Trump and his supporters … is not propelled by any coherent set of policies, but rather by a gigantic lie…”

It’s Democrats’ fault: “House Democrats also sullied one of Biden’s most important bipartisan achievements — a giant infrastructure bill — by making it hostage to other excessive spending demands. The far left also saddled Biden and every Democratic candidate with radical notions like ‘defund the police.'”

It’s America’s fault: “[W]ith every passing day, every mass shooting, every racist dog whistle, every defund-the-police initiative, every nation-sundering Supreme Court ruling, every speaker run off a campus, every bogus claim of election fraud, I wonder if he can bring us back together. I wonder if it’s too late.”

I’m sure Friedman, a writer at America’s most important newspaper, truly enjoyed his lunch with Biden. It must have made him feel really special to be invited to the White House by the president of the United States.

But it’s time for him to admit what the rest of us have known for a long time now: Biden is an embarrassment and it’s not because of circumstances out of his control. Biden is the circumstance that needs to be controlled.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/24/thomas-friedman-went-to-lunch-with-joe-biden-and-left-full-of-crap/,2022-05-24
K-12 Schools Must Put Boys In Girls' Privvies To Get Federal Lunch Money,"K-12 schools must allow boys into girls’ private areas to obtain federal funds for lunches, breakfasts, and snacks, the Biden administration announced this month. A U.S. Department of Education spokesman told The Federalist the Biden administration’s press releases from several agencies announcing this policy will be followed by formal rulemaking in June.

“It seems to be playing politics with feeding poor kids, which is really unfortunate,” John Elcesser, executive director of the Indiana Non-Public Education Association, said via phone amid weeks of attempting to sort out these new demands with government officials on behalf of private schools in his state. “Because if a school feels like they cannot participate because it’s in conflict with their mission or values, if a religious exemption is not granted, you’re taking away a program that’s feeding low-income kids.”

Before many schools shut down in response to Covid-19, the National School Lunch Program fed nearly 30 million kids every school day, in approximately 100,000 public and private schools and residential care facilities.

Under this new demand, establishments that accept any federal food funding, including food stamps, must also allow males who claim to be female to access female private spaces, such as showers, bathrooms, and sleeping areas. Such organizations must also follow protocols such as requiring staff to use inaccurate pronouns to describe transgender people and allowing male staff to dress as women while on the job.

Religious institutions, however, qualify for a waiver exempting them from these requirements, said Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Greg Baylor in an interview Monday. According to the 1972 Title IX law, he said, religious institutions don’t have to file any paperwork to be exempt, although they can if they wish.

Baylor noted, however, that publicly affirming a commitment to sexual reality by seeking an exemption acknowledgment from federal agencies may assist extremist pressure campaigns. The activist group Human Rights Campaign’s blueprint for the Biden administration pushed for narrowing religious exemptions for multiple federal regulations and for the administration to “out” individuals and institutions who request such exemptions.

The Biden administration appears to be following that blueprint closely. According to Elcesser, USDA officials are telling schools to file paperwork to be exempt, although the Title IX law says that’s an option but not required. The USDA confirmed that to The Federalist Tuesday with this emailed statement: “Organizations may request a religious exemption by submitting a written declaration to the Secretary of Agriculture identifying the provisions that conflict with a specific tenet of the religious organization.”

Government schools can receive no exemption. At best, parents and taxpayers can urge school districts to not comply while inevitable lawsuits over the Biden administration’s interpretation work through courts for years.

“The Biden administration is grossly extending the Bostock holding where it does not belong. Like many of the Biden administration’s power grabs, this imposition transgresses areas of proper state and local authority. As the principal guardians of federalism, state attorneys general have the ability to combat such overreach where it injures state functions,” Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, a Republican, told The Federalist in a statement.

Even if this regulation is ultimately overturned by one means or another, millions of American children will be forced to eat their school lunches with a side of sexual politics.

“There is a lot of harm that comes from inflicting this interpretation of Title IX on public schools and private schools that are not eligible for the exemption,” Baylor said. In Loudoun County, Virginia, in 2021, a young woman was sexually assaulted in a school bathroom by a young man granted access by the district’s transgender policies.

Parents have told The Federalist that their daughters no longer use the bathrooms or locker rooms at their public schools because they don’t feel safe there. Many parents are finding after the fact that school districts are helping their children live as the opposite sex and hide that from their families.

“Some percentage of school districts want to be told by the federal government that they have to implement gender ideology,” Baylor observed. “If anyone complains, they can say, ‘We’re just doing what they told us. Go blame Joe Biden, not me.'”

As Biden promised to do while campaigning, his administration is pushing sexual confusion on as many institutions as it can. This aim has gotten a huge boost from the 2020 Supreme Court decision Bostock v. Clayton County, an unconstitutional ruling that gives this extremist sexual agenda a legal fig leaf. That 5-4 decision clinched by President Donald Trump-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch, however, concerned sex differences not in education but employment.

While the majority opinion said Bostock only applied to Title VII, or employment law, it provided the rationale and excuse to extend this reasoning elsewhere. And the Biden administration’s press releases are ignoring the ruling’s claimed limits to apply it to other areas of federal code, particularly education’s Title IX, as many predicted.

Not only is the Biden administration’s use of federal food subsidies to impose sexual politics legally suspect in substance, it’s also legally suspect procedurally, Baylor said. That’s because press releases are not legally enforceable. Only federal regulations that have followed proper legal procedures are.

That hasn’t happened yet with this Biden administration demand, although the USED spokesman said the proposed regulation will be issued in June. Yet even after the regulation is issued, federal agencies are required to accept public comments for several months, then they must spend several more months reviewing all comments and responding, then writing and issuing a final regulation, which then can — and will be, Baylor said — challenged in court.

“When they do things some other way, just by some regulatory guidance or a press release or a memo, that in itself can be a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and that’s precisely what we’ve argued in some of the cases we’ve filed on this issue,” Baylor said. “…We think they’re making shortcuts and we’ve challenged that in court.”

So it appears with this demand, just like with the Biden administration’s so-called vaccine mandate, the administration is slow-walking the legal procedures required. That delays inevitable lawsuits, which themselves take years to work out. This process effectively imposes unpopular, extremist gender policies extra-legally, through fiat and intimidation. Meanwhile, many elected officials can and do sit on their hands and claim it’s the courts’ job to solve what they can end immediately through legislative action.

Given that Biden holds the presidency for more than two more years, all this means that American children who don’t attend Christian schools will be subject to social chaos at school for a long time, atop lockdowns that have already deeply damaged their learning trajectories. Remedies include withdrawing children from public schools, school boards refusing to follow regulations that are not legally binding until all court challenges are resolved, schools refusing to accept federal funding that comes at such a high cost, and state legislatures and Congress passing new laws to limit and undo the disastrous Bostock decision.

“The uncertainty is really unfortunate, and what we need are courageous parents who share their views with school administrators and school boards. We need courageous school administrators and school boards to do the right thing and push back on this interpretation of Title IX, because there are real harms to kids as a consequence,” Baylor said.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/25/biden-admin-k-12-schools-must-put-boys-in-girls-bathrooms-to-get-federal-lunch-money/,2022-05-25
Biden's Contradictions On Defending Taiwan Are Dangerous,"During his first trip to Asia as the U.S. president, Joe Biden said the U.S. military would defend Taiwan if China invaded the island. His comment became headline news worldwide as many interpreted it as a significant U.S. foreign policy change.

Yet, as so often, White House officials immediately clarified the president’s comment and insisted that there was no U.S. policy change regarding Taiwan. This is the third time White House staff have backpedaled after President Biden’s comments on Taiwan.

In an interview with ABC News in August and at a CNN town hall event in October 2021, Biden made similar comments, suggesting the United States would defend Taiwan against China. Each time, senior administration officials immediately contradicted Biden by stating that the U.S. government’s policy concerning Taiwan “has not changed.”

Such contradictions have raised questions, including who is in charge of U.S. policy on Taiwan and what that policy is. The lack of clarity on these questions is precarious, and not just for the future of Taiwan.

Historically, the U.S. government has followed a policy of “strategic ambiguity” created by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. That doesn’t guarantee the U.S. defense of Taiwan in the event of Communist China’s invasion, but it doesn’t rule out U.S. involvement in defending Taiwan either.

China’s Clear Views on Taiwan

In contrast to Washington’s ambiguity, Communist China has always been crystal clear about its intention toward Taiwan. Beijing insists there is one China led by the Communist Party and that Taiwan is a province of China. Beijing has vowed that it will never allow Taiwan to become independent. China’s current leader Xi Jinping sees the “reunification” with Taiwan as a legacy that he will make happen by any means necessary, including the use of force.

Under Xi’s leadership, Communist China has made astonishing progress in military preparations for a possible invasion of Taiwan. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has built the world’s largest navy, measured by fleet size. China constructed artificial islands in the South China Sea and militarized some of them with anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile systems, laser and jamming equipment, and fighter jets. Clearly, China intends to use these militarized islands to disrupt any foreign military aid to Taiwan in the event of invasion.

With growing military power, China has increased pressure on Taiwan. Since 2020, the PLA has sent military aircraft into Taiwan’s Air Defense Zone, sometimes on a weekly or even a daily basis. Additionally, the PLA has conducted several military exercises near Taiwan, with the most recent one earlier this month. Each exercise amounted to a full-scale rehearsal of an invasion of Taiwan. The U.S. government said the PLA’s provocation is “destabilizing, risks miscalculations, and undermines regional peace and stability.”

So far, China’s military intimidation of Taiwan has been counter-productive. Polls show that most Taiwanese don’t identify as “Chinese” and don’t favor reunification with the main­land. Still, everyone recognizes that Taiwan can’t defend itself against China’s invasion on its own.

Calls to Abandon ‘Strategic Ambiguity’

After Russia invaded Ukraine in February this year, many observers believed China’s Xi might be motivated to attack Taiwan while the Russian military was keeping the West occupied. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, warned that “an invasion of Taiwan could happen within this decade.” He introduced a bill recently to “increase coordination between the U.S. and Taiwanese militaries to ensure Taiwan is equipped to defend against an attack and invasion by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).”

The calls for the United States to abandon “strategic ambiguity” and offer Taiwan an explicit security guarantee have grown louder. Many pointed to China’s military buildup, the expansion in the South China Sea, the brutal crackdown on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, and its increasing military pressures on Taiwan as evidence that China’s aggression has become a threat to the peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region, affecting the U.S. and its allies’ interests and security.

Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is one who has made this argument. He called on the Biden administration to abandon the U.S. government’s long-held “strategic ambiguity” position on Taiwan and clarify that the United States would intervene if China invaded the island. Abe argued that “strategic clarity” is the best deterrence strategy to prevent China from going to war with the United States and its allies over Taiwan.

Biden Administration Creating Confusion

Yet the Biden administration so far has created more confusion domestically and internationally rather than presenting any strategic clarity. Since day one, the Biden administration has stated it would continue the “strategic ambiguity” policy toward Taiwan. But President Biden publicly declared several times that the U.S. military would help defend Taiwan in a Chinese invasion. Each time, senior administration officials immediately walked back Biden’s comments as if he never meant what he said.

There are three possible explanations. It could be that Biden’s comments were indeed blunders, and there is no change of U.S. policy on Taiwan. It could also be that he did mean what he said, but his staff simply undermined his authority publicly to avoid antagonizing China.

The third explanation is that the Biden administration has yet to formulate a clear China policy. It probably feels a bipartisan pressure to defend Taiwan but is war-weary and doesn’t want to actually go to war with China. All of these explanations are dangerous, for three reasons.

First, it signals to Beijing that U.S. political leadership is weak and has neither the ability nor the will to confront China. Second, it doesn’t build confidence among U.S. allies. The Biden administration’s policy confusion and perceived weakness may even convince some allies and partners to switch to China’s side.

Third, the Biden administration’s policy confusion and perceived weakness have increased the risk of a conflict with China rather than deterring China. China’s Xi may decide that the best time to invade Taiwan is when the United States is led by an aging politician who often appears confused. Xi can certainly strengthen his argument to his generals by pointing to America’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Richard Haass warned that “Historically, uncertainty regarding the other side’s intentions has often been a major driver of instability and conflict.” Therefore, to increase geopolitical stability and minimize the risk of conflict with China, the Biden administration must stop creating misunderstandings and confusion regarding its foreign policy concerning Taiwan.

If Biden wants to continue the traditional “strategic ambiguity” policy, he must avoid making any explicit commitment to defending Taiwan when asked. If Biden believes the time has come for a policy change in Taiwan, he needs to get a consensus from his team before announcing that to the world (so they don’t contradict him in public), and then make a clear case to the American people before committing U.S. troops and resources to defend Taiwan.

How Biden Is Directly Responsible For Baby Formula Shortages,"Image Credit Random Retail/Flickr

Although the Biden administration likes to repeat that they are the “adults” back in charge, they regularly attempt to cover up their many failures by blaming others. Joe Biden gave a fantastic and contemplative inauguration speech about “unifying our divided nation,” but from Day 1, with every word and deed, Biden has done the opposite. He has brought this country to the lowest point in many decades, on deficit spending, supply chain, economic policy, political animosity, and the rule of law.

It really did start on Day 1, with a rather un-“adult-like” sour grapes firing of every single Trump-era public health official at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including those officials monitoring vaccine safety, despite being deep in the throes of a worsening pandemic. The result was an increased number of dead American as pandemic deaths have been immensely worse under Biden’s watch, despite having Trump’s vaccine. Next, Biden waited more than a year to finally replace the officials, and he started by choosing a very unpopular FDA commissioner, an uninspiring non-reformer and Obama-era re-tread, Dr. Robert Califf.

The same Joe Biden that campaigned on his “plan” to end the pandemic, later admitting he actually never had any “plan,” now wants to let Americans know that he has a different “plan” for the baby formula shortage — which was caused by Califf’s FDA incorrectly blaming Abbott for infant deaths and shutting down its facility in the first place, without consideration of the ramifications.

About 75 percent of U.S. parents and caregivers rely on baby formula to meet the nutritional needs of infants up to 6 months of age. The shortage has disproportionately impacted low-income families and babies that require specialty formulas.

When news of the shortage broke, the Biden administration’s first recommendation was to tell American parents to “call a doctor” to ask them where to buy formula. As a former professor of pharmacology to medical students at Yale and Georgetown universities, I must have missed the lesson plan memo that instructed future physicians on where to shop for baby formula. On a side note, I can tell you that my physician colleagues are already overwhelmed with non-clinical duties, spending two-thirds of their time on paperwork for medical insurance carriers, and are becoming increasingly burdened with direct patient care responsibilities due to hospital understaffing caused by Covid-19 vaccine mandates. Asking Americans to call their “doctors” as a cover for Biden’s FDA error is thoughtless and wrong.

The Biden administration then deflected to physicians again, saying that panicked mothers should call their pediatricians to ask for free samples and to prescribe alternative formulas. The fact that mothers need to make appointments for their infants and physicians now must break away from their daily patient load and administrative duties due to an FDA-caused mess is the core issue at hand.

Next, the Department of Health and Human Services created a webpage telling Americans to call a “community organizer” via their local “Community Action Agency ” so mothers can beg for formula from their local food bank. But that’s hardly a solution; it just shifts the problem from one mother to a different mother!

Strangely, the webpage makes no mention of calling the government’s own border detention centers to obtain the stockpiles of formula reserved for those illegally crossing the southern border.

It’s a far cry from the Biden we saw running for office who eloquently promised to take responsibility and not shift the blame to others. What a difference an election and two years make!

The vacuum of leadership and multitude of poor advice has led to massive confusion, and people panicking and disgracing themselves by taking advantage of the matter. Some online videos of what appear to be English as a second language “first-generation Americans” unfamiliar with the traditional American way of life and our philosophy of “all being in this together” have taken to hoarding product as “sport,” putatively for online selling at a substantial markup. This behavior is predatory, selfish, and quite un-American.

The Real Responsibility Lies With Biden’s FDA and Commissioner Califf

So what happened? Long story short: no Abbott products were found to be contaminated. That’s not just my opinion — that’s the conclusion of the FDA and CDC following a thorough, months-long determination. Abbott had definite violations in its inspection, but none of them warranted an extended FDA shutdown leading to shortages for American infants.

Even after knowing that, the FDA is seemingly taking forever to allow the plant to re-open. As of this writing, it is still shut down. When pressed for answers at the House Committee hearing on May 19, Califf couldn’t project a date when store shelves would be restocked, admitting it could be months.

Will the commissioner or anyone else from the FDA be held accountable for the crisis of desperate mothers and their hungry babies over the last few months? Here is your answer: On May 19, the House passed a bill to give FDA employees an additional $28,000,000.00 taxpayer-funded pay raise. Although the bill states that funding is also to address the baby formula shortage, the FDA already has a $6.5 billion dollar budget for 2022, $3.6 billion of which was “discretionary spending.”

It is unlikely that the $28 million was ever needed for anything other than fatter FDA salaries, and especially since the exact breakdown of baby formula vigilance versus pay raises isn’t specified, it is safe to assume that majority of it will go to salaries. In other words, congressional Democrats alone have decided to reward the lackadaisical and incompetent FDA that inappropriately shut down the Abbott facility, which led to the baby formula shortage in the first place.

Biden has had to invoke the Defense Production Act to cover up the failures of his administration and in particular those of FDA Commissioner Califf in addressing this situation in a timely manner.

In the meantime, the shortage in formula has necessitated hospital admissions for infants all over the U.S.

Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, who had previously gushed at the Biden-Harris inauguration, really said it all when she referred to the baby formula shortage as “unacceptable, and worse, totally preventable,” further going on to tell the FDA commissioner that because of it “babies and children are suffering.”

If You Were Abbott, Wouldn’t You Move Overseas Too?

Now formula will be imported from other countries, but as a drug safety expert, I should warn Americans: Unlike Abbott, we don’t know if the FDA has ever inspected those overseas facilities recently — or ever — or if the FDA has any plans for conducting comprehensive “release testing” at any point before the formula is sent off to American infants.

In response to its series of failures, the White House made an obviously staged video of Biden calling companies like Gerber and Reckitt on speakerphone to beg them to ramp up production by overworking their employees to make more formula to cover up for the FDA’s mistakes. Biden appeared to heavily rely on reading notecards. On a side note, all of Biden’s staff wore masks while Biden did not.

The natural business and economic consequences of the ineptitude of the Biden’s FDA is that baby formula manufacturers will be motivated to move their manufacturing facilities from the U.S. to foreign countries, where the FDA won’t be breathing down their necks and able to shut them down based on a whim. If Abbott and companies like it move manufacturing out of country it will result in yet another vacant American manufacturing plant plus lost property, corporate, and salary taxes, while unemployment will need to be paid to those losing their jobs. It’s not just desperate mothers and hungry babies who will lose in this crisis, but all Americans.

It is clear Biden has no intention of taking any responsibility for this (and other failures), and it’s not very “adult-like.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/27/how-the-biden-administration-is-directly-responsible-for-worsening-baby-formula-shortages/,2022-05-27
"Yes, Biden Deserves The Blame For Inflation","Joe Biden has written an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal detailing his plan to fight inflation.

Well, perhaps the word “detailing” is too generous. The preponderance of the column features Biden taking credit for economic growth that can be attributed to the reopening of an economy that was shuttered by the governing class during Covid. Biden, of course, not only championed those closings, but was critical of Republican governors who opened their states before he deemed it appropriate.

But with midterms approaching, there’s been a concerted effort underway to exonerate the president, and thus Democrats, of any culpability for rising prices. Biden sycophant “Morning Joe,” for example, contends that anyone who blames the president for more than a “passing impact” on inflation is a “lying hack or an ignorant rube.” One wonders if that group includes former Obama adviser Steve Rattner, who argues that inflation has been driven by government putting “too much money in people’s pockets?” Or Obama’s one-time Director of the National Economic Council Larry Summers, who had been warning for more than a year that cash infusions would exacerbate inflation? Or Jeff Bezos, who correctly pointed out that the “administration tried hard to inject even more stimulus into an already over-heated, inflationary economy?”

Even if we were to concede that there is no good way to quantify exactly how much recent spending helped propel inflation — which is outpacing other Western nations — it’s clear that the Biden administration completely mismanaged what should have been a slam-dunk recovery.

The Fed’s easy monetary policy may not be the president’s fault, but what about Washington’s showering the economy with cash during a recovering economy? Democrats threw $2 trillion in “stimulus” into the economy and continued expanding the terms of unemployment benefits (even as the job market was recovering). All of this after the $3 trillion bipartisan “Covid relief” bill had passed.

With an assist from some Republicans, Democrats then okayed another trillion-plus-dollar infrastructure bill. The president says that “tackling inflation” is his top domestic priority, but for more than a year most of his efforts, witnessed in the near-constant media coverage, were used to try and pass progressive reforms. It was Republicans — with help of two often-vilified, moderate Democrats — who stood in the way of Biden pushing through another nearly $5 trillion in social spending. The president still wants more “relief.”

Biden can blame Putin for creating disruptions in the energy market, but price spikes predate Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And surely one of the jobs of the president is to put the United States in a stronger position for economic shocks. Instead, Biden signed a slew of executive orders pausing government leases on public lands, shutting down the Keystone XL pipeline, and stymieing drilling in the Gulf of Mexico over concocted “social cost of carbon” externalities. Despite the (extra) uncertainty that came with a post-pandemic economy, all of this was done in the first weeks of his administration.

Biden is now calling these energy spikes, embedded in essentially all economic activity, a needed “transition.” Virtually every action Biden has taken is conceived to make fossil fuels more expensive. That’s the president’s fault. Concerns over the availability of future energy production are baked into today’s prices.

As a political matter, Democrats, obsessed with the idea of historic expansion of the welfare state, spent a year dismissing and mocking apprehensions over spiking prices. “There’s nobody suggesting there’s unchecked inflation on the way — no serious economist,” Biden famously claimed.

As prices spiked and poll numbers dropped, Biden officials began to cynically use rising prices as a justification for more spending. Biden and his National Economic Council Director Brian Deese argued that Build Back Better — which you might recall costs “zero” dollars — would help combat inflation. The entire administration pushed the notion that the best prescription for alleviating inflation was more spending. Even today, as the president is poised to “forgive” student loans, pumping hundreds of billions into the economy to bail out rich kids, Deese maintains the impact “on inflation, in the near term, is likely to be quite small.” Sure.

In any event, I assume Ron Klain isn’t laughing off inflation as a “high class problem” anymore.

So, while it’s true that inflation is a complex, multifaceted problem that isn’t entirely any person’s or administration’s or event’s fault, it is fair to say that the Biden administration, from top to bottom, was as wrong as an administration could be on the issue. They ignored it. They weren’t prepared. They exacerbated it. At the very least, Biden deserves a lot more credit for inflation than he does economic growth. If you’re going to take credit for the latter, you deserve blame for the former.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/01/yes-biden-deserves-the-blame-for-inflation/,2022-06-01
Gun Store Shutdowns Spike 500 Percent Under 'Zero Tolerance' For Typos,"President Joe Biden is overzealously targeting firearm retailers to drive them out of business. Federal firearm license revocations for retailers have increased 500 from previous years. That’s got gun control groups excited, but it is casting a pall over the cooperative relationship firearm retailers maintain with law enforcement.

President Biden never hid the fact that he intended to use the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to drive his gun control agenda. He campaigned on a platform of targeting the firearm industry instead of focusing on criminals.

“Our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA, the gun manufacturers,” President Biden said from the presidential campaign debate stage.

That hostility produced a platform that turned the ATF from the bureau that regulates the firearm industry and enforces federal gun laws into the hammer and anvil by which the Biden administration is pummeling flat firearm retailers. Instead of compliance inspections by ATF Industry Operations Investigators to work to ensure firearm retailers remain within federal firearm regulations, those inspections are now driving firearm retailers out of business.

Revocations

Lee Williams, an independent investigative reporter specializing in covering firearms, revealed that ATF once revoked the licenses of federal firearms licensees (FFLs) at a rate of about 40 each year. “But, in the 11 months since Joe Biden declared war on ‘rogue gun dealers,’ the ATF has revoked 273 FFLs — an increase of more than 500%,” Williams reported. “However, rather than targeting the true rogues, Biden’s ATF is revoking FFLs for the most minor of paperwork errors, which were never a concern for the ATF until Biden weaponized the agency.”

That’s due to the Biden administration’s “zero tolerance” inspection policy. That means inspectors are revoking federal firearms licenses for even minor clerical errors that previously would warrant a warning letter.

ATF has the authority to revoke licenses for even these minor clerical errors but used to be more interested in compliance. That changed under the Biden administration and the Department of Justice (DOJ) led by Attorney General Merrick Garland. National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) is providing retailers with guidance to be prepared for these inspections.

Misplaced Priorities

The White House budget request clearly identified that driving gun stores out of business was a higher priority than pursuing criminals. President Biden proposed earlier this year to spend $20.6 billion on the Justice Department for federal law enforcement, crime prevention, and intervention.

Tucked into that spending proposal were plans for the ATF to hire 140 special agents and another 160 Industry Operations Investigators. That’s more inspectors to revoke licenses than special agents to actually lock up criminals. The Biden administration refuses to get tough on crime but is zealous in targeting the firearm industry.

Thomas Brandon, former ATF acting director, told USA Today that the goal of inspections is to get dealers compliant, not to penalize them. “The high majority of FFLs are good hardworking people running businesses, and they’re our front-line of defense for intelligence for diversion of firearms with straw purchases,” Brandon said, referring to when someone attempts to purchase a firearm for someone else who can’t.

The firearm industry absolutely wants firearm retailers that flout the law to be held accountable, but addressing the rare instances of criminal activity at the gun counter neglects the larger problem of criminal misuse of firearms. Indeed, that policy of targeting “rogue gun dealers” could have unintended consequences.

Unintended Consequences

Firearm retailers willingly cooperate with ATF special agents on suspect attempts to purchase firearms. They are often the ones providing tips to special agents on suspected straw purchases. Now, those same retailers are forced to consider the consequences of inviting ATF into their retail locations. When a potential tip to criminal activity by a random person wandering into their store could result in a business owner losing a license and income, that threatens the ability of the ATF to enforce the law.

That’s got special agents in the field concerned. Agents in ATF field offices who chose to remain anonymous have told NSSF the “zero tolerance” policy will do more harm than good. It will dry up their most valuable source of intelligence on criminal activity — the local gun store owner who wants criminals to be locked up.

Now, owners are forced to consider the unintended consequences of trying to do the right thing. Tips of suspect activity could lead to an inspection and a misplaced entry in a record book could put that gun store owner out of business.

There’s little reason to believe the policies will be reversed. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee questioned President Biden’s nominee to become ATF director, Steve Dettelbach, in a confirmation hearing last week. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) confronted Dettelbach about the “zero tolerance” policy and the Biden administration’s policy of rooting out “rogue dealers.” Dettelbach demurred on defining a “rogue dealer,” adding only that federal firearm license revocations should be reserved for “willful violations” and not “inadvertent errors.”

“The key to enforcement programs, it has to be fair, it has to be consistent, and it has to be effective,” Dettelbach told Sen. Grassley. The Biden administration’s “zero tolerance” policy to decimate firearm retailers is proving to be counterproductive.

Joe Biden Is Not A Victim. He Is The Aggressor,"A spate of news articles came out in recent days hilariously attempting to do two things for Joe Biden. The first is to paint his dumpster presidency as though he’s a victim of circumstance rather than the rotting root of all of our nation’s woes.

Politico’s version on Sunday went like this: “President Joe Biden and his aides have grown increasingly frustrated by their inability to turn the tide against a cascade of challenges threatening to overwhelm the administration.” The story also declared that, “In crisis after crisis, the White House has found itself either limited or helpless in its efforts to combat the forces pummeling them”

Similarly, an online article by NBC News last week said Biden is “Faced with a worsening political predicament.” Biden is not “faced” with a “predicament” and there is not a “cascade of challenged” that’s “threatening” his administration. Biden is the predicament. He is the challenge.

It’s not a matter of chance that the southern border continues to be crushed by all of Latin America’s destitute. It’s because Biden and his trusty sidekick Kamala Harris allow it. They invite it.

There were 234,000 illegal border crossings in April, the latest month for which government data is available. That’s more than any other month of Biden’s presidency. It’s 55,000 more than April of the previous year and it’s more than triple the amount of crossing that took place in the final month of Donald Trump’s presidency.

Watching those numbers climb, Biden’s team decided it was as good a time as any to lift the Covid rule that allowed for the expedited expulsion of illegal migrants.

It’s by no sad stroke of luck that under Biden the cost of gas has doubled and Americans have to take out a second mortgage to buy a week of groceries. It’s the $2 trillion in welfare (sometimes referred to as “Covid relief”) Biden and Congressional Democrats shoved into an economy that was already at a simmer. Steve Rattner, an economist who worked in the Obama administration, when Biden was vice president, said all of that money would “go down in history as an extraordinary policy mistake.”

This is the case with all of our biggest problems. Biden isn’t “faced” with them. He created them.

The second thing these news articles do is try to make it look like Biden and his aides are aware of the calamity and are in some way productively strategizing the best ways to address it.

Here’s how the Washington Post did it on May 31: “President Biden [has] complained for weeks to aides that his administration was not doing enough to publicly explain the fastest price increases in roughly four decades.” The story referred to “new activity,” a “flurry of activity,” and, a “flurry of moves” by the White House, which amounted to some officials writing op-eds and appearing on TV news programs.

That Politico piece said the “plan” is now to “put Biden on the road to highlight progress being made.”

NBC illustrated how deadly earnest Biden is in noting that he’s “pressing aides for a more compelling message and a sharper strategy,” and mentioned that he’s “bristling at how they’ve tried to stifle the plain-speaking persona that has long been one of his most potent assets.”

Don’t worry, FOLKS. Biden knows just how bad it is out there for you FOLKS. He’s pressing and bristling, FOLKS.

If it weren’t for the fact that moms aren’t able to find baby formula in Biden’s barren economy, this would be funny. But that’s another one of those real problems Biden faces created.

Hang tight. The White House is about to put Biden on the road.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/07/joe-biden-is-not-a-victim-he-is-the-aggressor/,2022-06-07
Jimmy Kimmel Asks Joe Biden Why He’s Not Acting More Like A Dictator,"Joe Biden is incapable of giving interviews to his allies in establishment media without looking like a centenarian overdosing on Xanax. So, the administration recruited a sycophantic late-night talk show host for the job. And, as expected, the interview with Jimmy Kimmel, who set up tee-balls for our dotard leader, was as cringe-inducing. Biden struggled to remember his canned talking points, promised a “mini revolution” if Roe was overturned (the same day someone tried to murder a SCOTUS justice), and rambled into the ether. Biden is an unserious person doing very serious damage.

Dunking on Republicans and hating Trump might have been good enough to win in 2020, and it might get you frivolous applause from the automatons in Kimmel’s audience, but it isn’t political philosophy. That fact was evident last night as the host who once warned his audience about “fascists” asked the president why he isn’t unilaterally dismantling a constitutional right.

“Can’t you issue an executive order? Trump passed those out like Halloween candy,” Kimmel asked Biden, when referencing gun control. “I don’t want to emulate Trump’s abuse of the Constitution and constitutional authority,” responded the president … the same week he unconstitutionally invoked the Defense Production Act, a cronyist gift to favored solar panels that is ostensibly meant to bring down the price of gas and oil.

This president signed more executive orders in the first 100 days (this isn’t even counting the numerous other ways he’s governed through edicts) than any president in the 21st century, and it isn’t particularly close. Biden signed 32 executive orders in the first month — many of the limiting oil and gas production and undoing border security measures. Biden averages 67 executive orders a year, 12 more than Trump.

Of course, it isn’t necessarily the number of executive orders a president issues that matters — Calvin Coolidge signed 1,203 without abusing his power — it’s the intent. Postwar presidents rarely made domestic policy via executive order. Barack Obama, unable to build consensus on virtually any policy proposal, put the practice of governing by fiat into hyperdrive. And Biden’s use of executive power to make domestic policy was so unprecedented in the early going that even The New York Times editorial board felt compelled to scold him. This “is no way to make law,” the Times noted. “A polarized, narrowly divided Congress may offer Mr. Biden little choice but to employ executive actions or see his entire agenda held hostage. These directives, however, are a flawed substitute for legislation.”

One imagines the Times editors also understood that Biden, as Obama before him, would not only have his entire agenda nuked by a Republican successor, but that it would also give that successor an excuse to rule in the same authoritarian manner.

Biden, though, doesn’t seem to care. He is expected to use his executive power to “forgive” student debt by saddling taxpayers with the bill. With Dobbs potentially overturning the fictitious right to an abortion, Biden also told Kimmel that he’s looking into signing executive orders on abortion rights, an issue over which the president has zero authority. As is the case with any orders he would sign undermining Second Amendment, which would almost surely be overturned.

This is the same president who bragged about circumventing the Constitution, issuing slightly modified versions of an illegal “eviction moratorium” (which had begun under Trump) so he could offer “rental assistance” before the court shut it down again. Obama was the first modern president to openly argue that he had power to ignore the legislative branch because they didn’t adhere to his political demands. Biden might be the first modern president to openly argue that he could defy the courts for the same reason.

Look, I realize CNN and other networks have retired their Trump-era “lie trackers,” but there is simply no way Biden, when coherent, is any less mendacious than Donald Trump. There were, maybe, two or three incidental remarks in the Kimmel interview that the president let pass that were in the vicinity of reality. We’ve all grown up accepting that politicians will lie to us, but the ease and frequency — and audacity — in which they do so these days borders on sociopathic.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/09/jimmy-kimmel-asks-joe-biden-why-hes-not-acting-more-like-a-dictator/,2022-06-09
Biden To World: Russia Controls The U.S. Economy,"On Friday, after news broke that inflation again accelerated to reach a 40-year high of 8.6 percent, President Joe Biden turned America’s financial crisis into a national security one by telling the world that foreign leaders have near-total control over the U.S. economy.

Shortly after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released May’s price report, which in addition to reporting an 8.6 percent annual inflationary rate showed a full 1 percent increase last month, President Biden began the spin: “Today’s report underscores why I have made fighting inflation my top economic priority. While it is good to see critical ‘core’ inflation moderating, it is not coming down as sharply and as quickly as we must see. Putin’s price hike hit hard in May here and around the world: high gas prices at the pump, energy, and food prices accounted for around half of the monthly price increases.”

The president’s entire pitch struck a chord conflicting with reality. “Biden hasn’t made inflation his top economic priority,” noted Katie Pavlich soon after. “For months, his administration denied inflation was happening, saying it wouldn’t be an issue, before calling it temporary and transitory last summer.” And the skyrocketing inflation began before Russia’s January 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The public has long known that Biden suffers from an acute case of blameuitis. But the president’s continued claims that Putin holds responsibility for our country’s accelerating inflationary rates, when coupled with Biden’s other actions and inactions, is not merely tone deaf, it is dangerous. While finger-pointing has long been a mainstay for politicians, the Biden administration’s messaging goes beyond shifting blame to conceding that foreign leaders can control the U.S. economy in Joe Biden’s America.

President Biden’s reported plans to meet with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a trip to the region next month confirm this. Saudi Arabia, the world’s second-largest oil producer behind the United States, serves as the “unofficial head of the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),” and the planned visit seems certain to push for more oil production from OPEC countries.

Goes Begging on His Knees to Country He Spurned

The announcement of President Biden’s intent to meet with bin Salman represents a course change so sharp that it will be seen as the United States’ complete subservience to the country Biden promised to make “the pariah that they are” shortly before his election.

In the waning days of Donald Trump’s presidency, “Biden promised to take a hard line on Saudi Arabia, saying he would rip up the ‘dangerous blank check’ that Trump had written for the Saudis.” During a 2019 presidential debate, Biden added that there is “very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia.”

After his election, Biden “released a U.S. intelligence report that concluded that Prince Mohammed had approved the plan to capture or kill [journalist Jamal Khashoggi], who had been an outspoken critic of the young Saudi ruler.” The Biden administration then continued its efforts to distance itself from Saudi Arabia then, with then-Press Secretary Jen Psaki saying “the Biden administration will ‘recalibrate’ how it treats the kingdom.”

The Biden administration also moved to isolate bin Salman, with Psaki calling his father, King Salman, President Biden’s “counterpart.” This pronouncement, notwithstanding the fact that bin Salman has been considered the “de facto ruler” of Saudi Arabia for some time, seemed to declare the Biden administration unwilling to work with the Saudi leader.

Just more than a year later, however, with Putin’s troops poised to invade Ukraine, the Biden administration is abruptly changing course, and Saudi Arabia has certainly noticed. The president’s staff tried unsuccessfully to arrange a call between Biden and bin Salman “as the U.S. was working to build international support for Ukraine and contain a surge in oil prices.”

The Wall Street Journal reported in March that “Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the U.A.E.’s Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan both declined U.S. requests to speak to Mr. Biden in recent weeks.” “A U.S. official” told the Wall Street Journal that “the planned discussion” “was part of turning on the spigot [of Saudi oil].”

While snubbing Biden, the Wall Street Journal reported that “both Prince Mohammed and Sheikh Mohammed took phone calls from Russian President Vladimir Putin,” in late February or early March, “after declining to speak with Mr. Biden.

At the time, the Biden administration maintained “there were no plans for Mr. Biden to travel to Saudi Arabia.” Just law week, however, Biden’s current press secretary acknowledged the president intends to visit Saudi Arabia, although details have yet to be confirmed.

Putin may have brought Biden to his knees, but these formerly spurned Saudi princes now have the leader of the free world crawling across the desert sands for help from the man who told the Atlantic just three months ago that he simply did “not care” whether the American president understood him. “It’s up to him to think about the interests of America,” bin Zayed said about Biden.

America Is Strong When It Controls Its Own Energy

Groveling to Saudi Arabia and the other OPEC countries does not serve America’s interests. America’s interests are best served by policies promoting energy independence—something first achieved in 2019 under President Trump.

Since taking office, however, the Biden administration has pushed for a dramatic move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. From canceling the Keystone Pipeline to attempting to halt new leases for drilling on public land and offshore, these policies render America more dependent on foreign energy sources led by ruthless dictators, like Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Democrats like Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow portray electric vehicles as the solution, with Stabenow gushing about her new electric car that she claimed to have driven from Michigan to D.C., bypassing “every single gas station” along the way, with no concerns over gas prices. “I’m looking forward to the opportunity for us to move to vehicles that aren’t going to be dependent on the whims of the oil companies and the international markets,” the Michigan Democrat added.

The move to electric vehicles will not lessen our country’s dependence on problematic countries, however. On the contrary, China holds a near monopoly on cobalt and lithium, two rare-earth metals necessary to produce electric car batteries. “China controls around 86.5 percent of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s cobalt exports,” with Congo holding “around 60 percent of the world’s mined cobalt.”

In fact, Hunter Biden played a role in helping China obtain a stranglehold over the cobalt supply when a company he founded worked with Chinese investors to arrange for China to purchase the Congolese cobalt mine, Tenke Fungurume, from its American owner.

With China now controlling the metals necessary to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles, the communist country holds undue sway over every country committed to abandoning fossil fuels. That includes Joe Biden’s America. Putin is proving it.

Joe Biden Voicemail Means It’s Time To Appoint A Special Counsel,"In 2018, while Hunter Biden was reportedly under investigation for his dealings with Chinese businessmen, Joe Biden left a voicemail message telling Hunter: “I think you’re clear.” This latest development in the Biden family pay-to-play scandal provides further proof a special counsel is needed to oversee the ongoing criminal probe.

In an exclusive, The Daily Mail on Monday reported that a voicemail recovered “from a backup of Hunter’s iPhone XS,” stored on his abandoned MacBook laptop, captured Joe Biden leaving this message for Hunter on December 12, 2018: “Hey pal, it’s Dad. It’s 8:15 on Wednesday night. If you get a chance just give me a call. Nothing urgent. I just wanted to talk to you. I thought the article released online, it’s going to be printed tomorrow in the Times, was good. I think you’re clear. And anyway if you get a chance, give me a call, I love you.”

The New York Times article referenced by the now-president, entitled “A Chinese Tycoon Sought Power and Influence. Washington Responded,” detailed the dealings of two corrupt Chinese businessmen, Ye Jianming and Patrick Ho—both of whom had connections to the Biden family through CEFC China Energy.

Ye acquired CEFC in 2006, according to the Times article, with the business focused on “securing the rights to overseas oil fields in strife-torn places like Chad, South Sudan, and Iraq.” “From 2009 to 2017, CEFC’s revenues jumped from $48 million to $37 billion,” the Times reported, noting that Ye’s first outreach to the Biden family came in 2015.

The Washington Post, which independently authenticated Hunter’s abandoned laptop months after its pre-election discovery, likewise reported that emails recovered from the hard drive showed that an intermediary for CEFC first “reached out to Hunter Biden in December 2015 to set up a meeting between the then-vice president’s son and Ye.”

The proposed 2015 dinner didn’t happen, but the Times article reported that an aide to Ye would later meet Hunter. Then, in May 2017, Hunter met with Ye in Miami. During that meeting, Hunter reportedly “offered to use his contacts to help identify investment opportunities for Ye’s company, CEFC China Energy, in liquefied-natural-gas projects in the United States.” As a thank you, Ye sent a note of gratitude and a 2.8-carat diamond to Hunter’s hotel room.

While the natural gas project discussed never materialized, in early August 2017, Hunter executed a consulting agreement with CEFC. It provided him a retainer of $500,000 and a monthly stipend of $100,000 while James Biden, Joe’s brother and Hunter’s uncle, pocketed $65,000 a month. According to the Washington Post, “over the course of 14 months, the Chinese energy conglomerate and its executives paid $4.8 million to entities controlled by Hunter Biden and his uncle.”

Then in November 2017, Ho, the CEFC vice-chairman and secretary-general, transferred to one of Hunter Biden’s entities $1 million, ostensibly for “representation.” Hunter, however, seemed to have no role in defending Ho, who was charged that month for crimes related to alleged bribes to officials in Chad and Uganda and attempting to arrange for CEFC to serve as a middleman with Iran to avoid sanctions. Following his arrest, Ho also called James Biden, although James believed the call was likely meant for Hunter.

In 2018, when the article that prompted Joe Biden’s messages hit, the millions in payments from CEFC to business ventures controlled by Hunter Biden were not known. Thus, at the time, the Times merely reported, “it is unclear whether Hunter Biden struck any business deals with CEFC or Mr. Ye.” Since then, the public has learned both of the multi-million-dollar connection between Hunter and CEFC and of a video showing Hunter calling Ho “the f-cking spy chief of China who started the company that my partner [Jianming], who is worth $323 billion, founded and is now missing.”

Also unknown when the Times ran its December 2018 story was that Hunter Biden was himself purportedly under investigation for his business dealings with CEFC. A month after the 2020 election, however, CNN reported that federal prosecutors in Delaware were investigating Hunter Biden’s business dealings, specifically his dealings in China and with CEFC. Significantly, in its report, CNN claimed that two people briefed on the Hunter Biden investigation claimed it “began as early as 2018.”

That Joe Biden told his son “I think you’re clear” in relation to reporting discussing Hunter’s connection with CEFC, and that this assurance came just one week after Ho’s conviction while Hunter Biden was reportedly under investigation for his business dealings with Ye and Ho, raises the question of whether Joe Biden had any inside information concerning the investigation of his son.

A related question concerns the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act wiretapping of Ho. According to The Daily Mail article that broke news of Joe Biden’s voicemail message, the outlet had obtained a copy of a FISA surveillance order that “revealed that federal agents were monitoring Ho as a potential spy for China.” That surveillance likely continued, at a minimum, until Ho’s arrest in late 2017, meaning that the FISA surveillance likely swept up some communications with or about Hunter Biden.

Even if not, the evidence continues to mount against the Biden family, leaving two fundamental questions: What is taking the Delaware U.S. attorney so long? And why hasn’t a special counsel been appointed yet?

Biden's Abortion Order Seizes Power From Voters And Gives It To Feds,"In response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson ruling, which handed decisions about abortion back to the states and thus voters, President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Friday that pushes his taxpayer-funded, abortion-on-demand agenda to the top of his administration’s priority list.

The order will funnel federal time, resources, and funds, mostly through the Department of Health and Human Services, to shield existing abortion clinics, promote unlimited abortion, and circumvent Republican state laws to help send women to abortion appointments in other states.

“What we’re witnessing wasn’t a constitutional judgment. It was an exercise in raw political power,” Biden said.

In addition to casting doubt on the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, Biden called Dobbs “extreme” and claimed the Republican-nominated justices who made up the majority lied about the ruling being “a decision driven by history.”

Polling suggests that at least 44 percent of Americans — a plurality — prefer for abortion issues to be dealt with at the state level, yet Biden is using his executive power to implement pro-abortion radicalism through the federal government under the guise of ensuring that “Americans have access to reliable and accurate information about their rights and access to care.”

It’s unclear how exactly the Biden administration defines “reliable and accurate information,” but if congressional Democrats get their way, that information will deliberately exclude pregnancy centers that work around the clock to assist women and children but have been smeared as “fake clinics.” Some Democrats have even demanded they be shut down. Meanwhile, Biden and his administration were silent on the firebombings at dozens of pregnancy centers around the nation.

Despite demands from progressives such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to open abortion facilities on federal lands, the Biden administration declined to implement the practice, which could have “dangerous ramifications.” Instead, Biden plans to use Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to increase the promotion of contraception including some problematic birth controls and harmful abortion pills and said he wants the Department of Justice to do “everything in their power” to protect women seeking abortions and abortion facilities.

Biden previously signaled he would not accept the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision. Less than 24 hours after the draft opinion was leaked in May, Biden threatened to use his executive authority to reject the end of Roe v. Wade. Despite Democrats’ history of defending poor rulings from the high court as the “law of the land,” Biden pledged to use his Gender Policy Council and White House Counsel’s Office to counter “the continued attack on abortion and reproductive rights” by the Supreme Court.

When the court officially released the final Dobbs decision, Biden called on Americans to vote for pro-abortion politicians who will give Democrats in Congress the leverage they need to snatch the abortion issue back from states and voters to the federal level. He repeated the same plea to circumvent “extreme Republican governors” and “Republican extremists in the Congress” on Friday during his remarks about the new executive order.

“This is the fastest route available. I’m just stating a basic fundamental notion. The fastest way to restore Roe is to pass a national law codifying Roe, which I will sign immediately upon its passage on my desk,” Biden said, shortly before he repeated an unconfirmed and dubious story about a 10-year-old girl who was denied an abortion.

Several pro-life organizations condemned Biden’s remarks and his executive order. “It is tragic that this administration is using its power to push for more and more painful abortions which harm women and take innocent lives. Of particular concern is the administration’s effort to push chemical abortion which carries significant health risks to women, even more than surgical abortion. Our nation today faces significant challenges, not enough abortion is not one of them,” March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said in a statement.

“Long gone is the Democratic Party of ‘safe, legal, and rare.’ President Biden has once again caved to the extreme abortion lobby, determined to put the full weight of the federal government behind promoting abortion,” said SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser. “Democrats will stop at nothing to promote their agenda of abortion on demand, up until the moment of birth, paid for by the taxpayers — including dangerous mail-order abortion drugs — even if it means gutting the long-standing filibuster, increasing the size of the Supreme Court, or putting abortionists in tents in national parks.”

"As Dems And Media Turn On Biden, Remember: They Empowered Him","“Biden, At 79, Shows Signs Of Age And Aides Fret About His Image,” reads a headline on the front page of Sunday’s New York Times.

It’s a goofy article; one that reluctantly tries to tackle the president’s publicly deteriorating mental faculties while claiming he’s still more fit than either Presidents Ronald Reagan or Donald Trump (Republicans). At one point, the reporter even cites “experts” who “put Mr. Biden in a category of ‘super-agers’ who remain unusually fit as they advance in years.” But foolishness aside, there it sits: an article questioning Biden’s fitness for office on the front page of the Sunday Times.

And they weren’t done: “Democrats Sour on Biden, Citing Age and Economy,” the top headline read in Monday’s New York Times. “Poll Shows Most Want New ’24 Candidate as Pessimism Becomes Pervasive.”

The online version of that piece even includes a box titled, “The Biden Presidency,” which breaks down “where President Biden stands… with midterm elections looming.” The five categories are titled, “Struggling To Inspire,” “Low Approval Rating,” and “Questions About 2024,” as well as “Staff Changes,” about the “increasing number of West Wing departures,” and “Rallying Allies,” about the conflict in Ukraine.

On Tuesday, the Times threw a third punch, with columnist Michelle Goldberg’s headline, “Joe Biden Is Too Old To Be President Again.”

The Sunday-Monday front-page punches, followed up an Opinion page uppercut, send a clear signal that the Times regrets putting the president in office as much as many of his voters do. More than that, however: they no longer finds the president useful to their project.

The difference between the Times and the public who voted for Biden, is press and their allies in Democratic leadership are the real people who hoisted his presidency on our country. Together, they pushed him onto a disinterested Democratic base, papered over his mental decline, suppressed criticisms of his competence, and even actively censored credible accusations of his corruption.

Just look back two years: In February 2020, Biden had come in fourth place in Iowa. A week later, he’d come in fifth in New Hampshire. In public appearances, he alternated between sinister whispers about the future and yelling angrily into the crowd.

Still, his campaign was less radical than those of his colleagues, who had endorsed open borders and gun seizures. More, he was known to the American people and presented as a more standard American president than Trump did, so powerful figures coalesced behind him. And after South Caroline poobah Rep. James Clyburn endorsed his candidacy in that state, he began to win, counting in particular on the black vote.

With this switch, a press (and party) that had openly challenged his past positions and his competency began a steady drumbeat touting his morality and ability to do the job. Questioning his cognitive decline suddenly went from common in both corporate news analysis and political debates to forbidden. Some public figures who’d questioned his capacity even deleted their tweets.

While the former vice president ran a bunker campaign with barely any press access, corporate media breathlessly covered Trump’s Covid fight, comparing it to the Vietnam War. The District of Columbia even erected crosses for the dead, next to a digital counter keeping tabs of deaths attributed to the disease. (The display was removed after Trump lost the election.)

Biden’s South Carolina comeback wasn’t just unusual, it was artificial. The only other Democratic presidential candidate to have achieved this feat before was Bill Clinton, who skipped Iowa altogether (ceding it to the hometown candidate) but then so outperformed expectations in New Hampshire, he was nicknamed “The Comeback Kid.”

While America’s elite presidential historians rush to tell the public Biden was the second coming of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (and will “save the soul of America”), the reality is he’s not even Bill Clinton. Clinton was the kind of politician who could make a deal with a hostile Congress, survive a sexual affair with an intern less than half his age, and still reign as a kingmaker for decades after finishing his second term. In contrast, D.C. Democrats quietly worry Biden might not live through a second term.

So now they want to banish him and his distinctly unimpressive vice president, whom the voters (to their credit) left in last place during the Democratic primaries.

They’re right to want to banish Biden, of course. A New York Times poll released Monday showed his job approval at 32 percent. That’s lower than Jimmy Carter when he left office, lower than Trump just after the Jan. 6 riot — and less than half of Clinton’s approval when he left office in 1998. To Biden’s near sole credit, he’s still 8 points above where Richard Nixon was on his final week in office.

The current occupant of the White House, however, isn’t planning to leave office any time soon; he’s still more than two years out from his next election. That means his approval matters a great deal, and in politics, as National Review’s Jeff Blehar succinctly put it, at 33 percent approval “there are no survivors.”

So now, the corporate media and Democratic establishment that picked the Democrat candidate, worked to install him as America’s president, and virtually dictated his White House’s policies are trying to sulk away and avoid blame for the decline. Now they’ll point to his age and his cognitive decline on the front page of the Times. They’ll discuss it once again on Twitter. But it’s all just a game.

Of course, Biden is old and experiencing cognitive decay; he was two years ago when he was picked and everyone watching knew it. He’s been in the limelight for literally 50 years, so we could all see the difference.

The fact is that the American regime ignored and hid this because they hated Trump enough they were willing to do anything — anything — to defeat him. They did this, and the hard reality is this isn’t a Biden problem; it’s a regime problem.

So when his old friends in the party and the media try to eject his presidency, remember that they created it; empowered it.

Someday soon the president will leave the world stage, but they’ll remain, still willing to do anything they need to get their way. Joseph R. Biden might be in office, but they’re in charge — the regime that did this.

“I can’t help feeling very sorry for Joe Biden,” Goldberg wrote in her Wednesday Opinion column. It was her opening line, but could have been the end of “Of Mice And Men,” when George comforts his friend doomed, Lennie, before shooting him in the head.

George and Lennie had been a team. Best friends, even. But in the end, we all knew who was in charge.

Remember that. It will be important again.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/12/as-democrats-and-the-media-turn-on-biden-remember-they-are-the-corrupt-regime-that-empowered-him/,2022-07-12
"For Biden, Polls Are Probably Worse Than They Seem","President Biden has a miserable 33 percent job-approval rating, according to the New York Times/Siena College poll, making him one of the least popular first-term presidents in history. Sixty-four percent of Democrats say they want another candidate in the 2024 presidential race.

No modern president, as far as I can tell, has faced higher dissatisfaction in his own party during his first term. Only 13 percent of voters say the United States is on the right track, the lowest number since they began asking this question during the great recession.

Not long ago, left-wing pundits couldn’t stop talking about Donald Trump’s poll numbers — “Donald Trump is remarkably unpopular,” “The unprecedented unpopularity of Donald Trump,” “Trump is officially the most unpopular president since modern polling began in the 1930s. It will forever be his legacy,” and so on. A president with that kind of piddling support, they would argue, had no business initiating policy changes. Nowadays, Democrats want their historically unpopular president to sign “transformative” legislation using reconciliation and unilaterally restructure American governance. The only consistent characteristic of modern liberalism is the unyielding belief that politics should be played by two sets of rules.

Still, I don’t put too much reliance on national polls. Yes, unpopularity matters. It hurts Democrats. It also further debunks the notion that the Democratic Party’s agenda items are vastly more popular, and Republicans who stand in their way are undermining “democracy.”

Republicans, though, should remember that job approval rating is measured in a bubble. The New York Times/Siena College poll finds Biden winning a match-up against Donald Trump 44-41. The real presidential election is largely a binary choice for those who vote, and many of those dissatisfied with Biden may never vote for a Republican.

Then again, this seems to be the only takeaway for Democrats like Joe Scarborough. “So Biden’s going into halftime shooting 33% from the field and he is STILL beating Trump University,” tweets Morning Joe. All these unforeseen and unfair events have befallen the poor Biden, they argue, and yet, he still leads Trump (conveniently forgetting that he also had to deal with a once-in-a-century worldwide pandemic and ensuing economic fallout from lockdowns.)

It’s certainly entertaining watching partisans feign excitement over their mollycoddled candidate holding a 44-41 lead in a national poll against a guy who is accused of sedition on virtually every news channel daily. What do these numbers look like when Trump (or someone like Ron DeSantis) is reminding voters what gas prices and their 401(k)s looked like before Covid?

Indeed, the left is again convincing themselves that winning a national poll means something. (Siena, incidentally, had Clinton up 17 points in its final 2016 poll.) There is no popular vote. Biden must win states. And the president is underwater in almost every one of them, on almost every issue, in almost every poll. I’m no prognosticator or election expert — Biden might well win reelection — but none of that could possibly be heartening news for Democrats.

I’m just unsure how it gets any better for Biden. Democrats on social media do a lot of self-soothing, convincing themselves that events will become more hospitable for the president. Perhaps, if Biden stopped undermining the economy and energy production, they may, to some extent. Economic indicators, however, aren’t projecting a big turnaround. Even if they did, Biden’s claim to moderation, largely a function of his age, has already been obliterated. Two-thirds of independents don’t approve of his performance. At the same time, Biden’s progressive rhetoric is also transparently unprincipled. Neither Biden, nor any president, really has the power to mollify progressives. Not until the Constitution is rendered inoperative.

With all that said, the prevailing concern about Biden among voters in the New York Times/Siena College poll isn’t ideological, it’s his age — by which we can deduce they mean his competence. In the 2020 race, Biden’s fragile state was largely concealed from the public by the campaign and press. These days, on the rare occasions the president wanders into an unscripted interaction, he is incoherent. The chances of the president’s cognitive state improving, I’m afraid, are nil. That’s not how nature works.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/12/for-biden-polls-are-probably-worse-than-they-seem/,2022-07-12
"The Bidens Shouldn’t Be In Government, They Should Be In Counseling","Every family has issues but the Biden family’s dirty laundry requires a washing machine bigger than their private jet.

Despite the corporate media’s best efforts to suppress negative news about America’s latest first family, the dysfunctional Bidens have longstanding character crises that put the health and safety of our nation in jeopardy.

Joe Biden

Joe Biden has been repeatedly accused of inappropriately touching and kissing children and women ever since he assumed government office in 1972. On top of that, Joe is a mendacious braggart with a deluded sense of self-expertise who not only lied about his son Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings to cover his family’s butts and bank accounts but lied about many of his major life events.

He lied about being the only student in his law school class who was “on a full academic scholarship.” He lied about being in the top half of his graduating class. He plagiarized pieces of a law review article in one of his law school papers and gave a speech appropriating British politician Neil Kinnock’s life as his own, a decision that essentially ended Joe’s first presidential bid.

How can Americans trust their president to be the straight shooter he promised to be if his past is littered with deception?

When Biden lost his first wife and 13-month-old daughter in a tragic car accident that also injured his two sons in 1972, he repeatedly mischaracterized the man who was driving the tractor-trailer truck that hit the Biden family station wagon as drunk. The chief prosecutor who oversaw the investigation into the crash explicitly stated that Biden’s claims were incorrect, and the daughter of the man driving the truck begged Biden to correct the record. He didn’t.

That brings us to a drug-addicted Hunter whom Joe enabled by apparently funding some of his trysts with Russia-linked escorts and sending out coerced statements claiming to support the scandalous and adulterous relationship between Hunter and his brother Beau Biden’s widow.

Even if he’s not technically guilty of anything, Joe’s “I’d do anything for you, son” attitude when it comes to his relationship with Hunter leaves him susceptible to sway from Hunter’s foreign buddies, including American enemies such as China. Just this week, Joe sold oil from emergency reserves to the Chinese gas giant that has ties to Hunter.

Hunter Biden

If Joe is compromised because of his son, then Hunter is a glaring national security threat. The Biden son infamous for being a crackhead and alcohol addict was not only discharged from the military for using cocaine, but he’s also been caught filming his drug trips and expensive and possibly criminal sexual escapades with foreign women for a laptop store owner to find. That laptop contained sensational revelations that the corrupt press and Big Tech suppressed to manipulate the 2020 election in favor of the Bidens.

If Hunter’s addiction doesn’t make the Biden family a great candidate for extensive therapy, then his tumultuous relationship history does. Hunter has a history of divorce and affairs, and fathered at least one out-of-wedlock child with a woman in Arkansas who had to sue him for paternity.

Speaking of romantic relationship drama, Hunter came under scrutiny for losing track of a firearm in 2018. Hallie Biden, the wife of his late brother turned his girlfriend, threw it away behind a grocery store near a high school during one of the couple’s many arguments. Against normal protocol, the Secret Service got involved to cover up the mess.

Despite his reckless handling of a gun, repeated use of illicit drugs and drug paraphernalia, and then likely lying on federal forms about that drug use, Hunter has miraculously gotten away with little charge and punishment.

Hunter’s problems may be separate from the president’s actions but even when his issues went from personal to directly affecting the national security of the United States, the Biden family has kept him close. Maybe that’s because Hunter exchanged access to his father, who was vice president at the time, for cash to fund the family’s lavish lifestyle.

James Biden

That brings us to Joe’s brother James Biden. James has largely stayed out of the press and the public eye but his backstage workings are the thread that holds the Biden family business together. Because of James’s relationship with certain Chinese oligarchs, the Bidens profited off of numerous Chinese Communist Party-linked deals and operated companies that shelled out tens of thousands of dollars to communist-connected businesses.

According to Republican Sens. Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley, “Hunter Biden and James Biden served as the perfect vehicle by which the communist Chinese government could gain in-roads here in the United States through CEFC and its affiliates.”

James, along with other members of the Biden family, went on a more than $100,000 shopping spree as a reward for their dealings with China-affiliated businessmen.

James clearly has a pocketbook and an ear for the CCP and once again, Joe’s proximity to problematic family members like James hurt his credibility to run the nation properly.

Jill Biden

Jill Biden, excuse me, Dr. Jill Biden seems to be the least problematic member of the family but that doesn’t mean she’s free of any blame. She certainly hasn’t been welcomed into the Biden family business with open arms. Texts reportedly belonging to Hunter paint the First Lady as a “selfish,” “entitled” “moron.”

Jill is still clearly a liability for the country by association with her husband. The poor woman also appears to have been tasked with wrangling her senile husband at presidential events.

She also seems to be a growing liability to the Democrat party’s political aspirations to win over Hispanics.

With gas prices higher than Hunter, a humanitarian crisis at the Southern border that is so bad not even the “doctor” of the family can fix it, and economic woes that would render anyone, not just the gaffe-prone president, speechless, the U.S. is clearly struggling under Biden’s rule.

The media gave Joe and the rest of his family a pass on all of their skeletons during the campaign, the now the country has to pay the price for it.

11 Of The Biden Administration’s Greatest Failures So Far,"It’s no exaggeration: Joe Biden is bringing the country down in a tailspin. From historic failures internationally to crises at home and dropping approval ratings, Biden’s administration makes every single thing it touches worse.

Taken alone, each of these failures is pretty damning, but as a whole — or at least even just this small sampling — they reveal the degree to which our 46th president is a danger to America’s well-being.

1. Facilitating a Deadly Border

On June 20, an abandoned semi-truck was found to contain more than 40 dead migrants, with the death toll later rising to 51. The deceased have been confirmed to be Mexican, Guatemalan, and Honduran citizens entering the United States illegally, although 20 others’ national origins remain undetermined.

On a recent trip to Mexico, Federalist staff saw firsthand the devastating effects of Biden’s refusal to enforce U.S. border and immigration laws. As a result, our southern border is controlled by cartels, which smuggle and exploit men, women, and children — a process that can be deadly.

2. Shipping Illegals to a Community Near You

In addition to ignoring the border crisis, the president is secretly shipping illegal migrants across state borders and into suburban cities and family neighborhoods. In February, he planned to dump 1,000 Afghan refugees right next to Loudoun High School without contacting local law enforcement about the plan.

According to The Daily Wire, the Department of Homeland Security said the Federal Protection Service would provide security for students located next to unvetted foreign citizens, but since FPS has no jurisdiction in Loudoun County, this pledge was meaningless.

3. Holding Kids Hostage to Trans Radicalism

In May, the Biden administration attempted to strongarm public schools into letting males who identify as transgender use girls’ bathrooms by threatening to pull federal funding for school lunches if they didn’t. That’s 30 million lunch-program students Biden took hostage to push his party’s trans radicalism.

4. Tapping into Emergency Petroleum Reserves

Laying all blame on Putin for gas prices that are double what they were before Biden took office, Biden has commissioned the selling of 1 million barrels of oil per day for six months from our national emergency reserve. Instead of saving our stockpile for an emergency and resurrecting the Keystone pipeline and other major American energy projects Biden killed, the administration is using up the largest release from the stockpile in our history — and suggesting you buy an electric car.

5. Botching the Afghanistan Withdrawal

Pulling out of Afghanistan was always the plan — but not the disastrous way Biden did it. By leaving before Afghan forces were prepared, abandoning the Bagram Air Base before evacuating American citizens and Afghan allies, and leaving American citizens, weapons, and equipment for the Taliban to commandeer, Biden committed a tremendous strategic and humanitarian error.

6. Supporting Child Castration and Sterilization

The White House is openly championing “gender-affirming” surgeries and brainwashing attempts targeted at young children, and Biden is not simply a moderate bystander. He has threatened “immediate action” against state governors and attorneys general who decry castration of a kid as child abuse.

7. Driving up Inflation

As Americans are reminded every time they buy groceries or fill their gas tanks, Biden’s policies have caused, or at least exacerbated, record inflation and unsustainably high consumer prices. By throwing money at problems the government largely created through the so-called American Rescue Plan, relinquishing U.S. energy independence, and printing more money, among other fiscally irresponsible policies, the president has helped make just about everything Americans need more expensive.

8. Letting Babies Go Hungry

Due to government-mandated shutdowns that slowed deliveries, burdensome regulations, and then Biden’s Food and Drug Administration’s shutdown of the largest baby formula-making plants in the country, Americans found themselves unable to find needed formula, leaving infants in hospitals and families desperate. Their desperation turned to frustration with the Biden administration when they realized the president was using their tax dollars to buy and ship formula to illegal immigrants at the border.

9. Forcing the Covid Jab

Despite his so-called “pro-choice” posture, Biden sought to force Americans to put vaccines into their bodies by issuing a rule that all workers in any business of more than 100 employees must get vaccinated or else be constantly tested. His vaccine-or-test mandate for workers was overruled by the Supreme Court and later withdrawn by his administration.

10. Scheming to Enact Abortion Radicalism

Biden has expressed support for an abortion-specific carveout for the filibuster, advocating for an exemption strictly to empower Congress to codify Roe v. Wade without having enough votes. This radicalism is despite his previous passion for the filibuster and Democrats’ constant use of it during President Donald Trump’s tenure.

11. Tanking His Own Approval

Biden has utterly failed to keep the country’s approval, with his ratings down to record lows. The latest CNBC poll out this week shows Biden’s approval rating at an abysmal 36 percent. That’s even worse than Trump’s lowest ratings ever, despite the former president weathering instability over Covid-19 and cultural upheaval after the death of George Floyd.

"We're All Struggling Because Of Biden, Not The Other Way Around","Perry Bacon Jr. — which is the name of a Washington Post writer, not a sandwich at Arby’s — has managed to have the dumbest excuse to date for why Joe Biden’s approval numbers are somewhere between bad and “get this man out of the White House right now before he kills us all.”

Bacon wrote on Monday, presumably with a straight face, that a major factor driving the president’s approval ratings to lower than Donald Trump’s is that the news media’s coverage has been “anti-Biden.” He actually said that.

“In the first few months of 2021, many in the media focused on narratives that seemed like they could turn into big anti-Biden stories but didn’t pan out,” wrote Perry. By “anti-Biden stories,” he meant the few times reporters asked the president why vaccines were so slow to distribute and whether he planned to do anything to stem the tide of obscene numbers of migrants illegally crossing the southern border.

It’s apparently “anti-Biden” to inquire whether he actually plans to do anything about our most urgent problems.

But, Perry said, it was the disastrous and fatal withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that really did Biden in with the press. “Afghanistan was an important turning point in media coverage for two reasons,” he wrote. “One, it provided journalists the big anti-Biden story that I think many of them were desperate to find. And it drove down Biden’s popularity with the public, giving the media justification for even more coverage that cast the president as struggling.”

Ah, yes! Remember the days of yore when the media were so obviously “desperate” to find a reason to kneecap Biden. The memories are fond.

It’s preposterous. Even now, media coverage of the Biden administration is relegated to one-minute news briefs about the president and Kamala Harris’s latest screw-ups, only between hour-long segments about the Jan. 6 House hearings.

Perry wrote that he would like for the press to “cover Biden more positively.”

Hey guys, could you put a positive spin on the historic inflation, the new war that Biden is marching us toward, and the record-high gas prices? That would be swell.

Biden isn’t where he is by a stroke of bad luck. His approval rating isn’t embarrassingly low because reporters aren’t giving him enough credit. And his own party’s voters aren’t on their knees praying he doesn’t run for a second term because journalists haven’t properly shown them the silver lining.

Biden isn’t the victim of an awful press. They’re the ones who sold him to America. We’re the victims of the media and his presidency.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/20/america-is-struggling-because-of-biden-not-the-other-way-around/,2022-07-20
Biden Tests Covid-Positive. His Vax Claims Test Negative For Truth,"Image Credit The White House/Flickr

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Thursday morning that “President Biden tested positive for COVID-19” but assured the American people that he is “fully vaccinated and twice boosted and experiencing very mild symptoms.” This announcement comes exactly one year after Biden told people they wouldn’t get Covid if they were vaccinated.

Here are four of Biden’s biggest vaccine lies to date.

1. “This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.”

In January, Biden said, “There’s no excuse — no excuse for anyone being unvaccinated. This continues to be a pandemic of the unvaccinated.”

In fact, Biden echoed the phrase ad nauseam — and even admitted that he says it “constantly.” But after Biden and his fellow Covid tyrants shamed other Americans who declined to get a shot and blamed them for the Covid virus’ persistent existence, the constant positive tests of the double-boosted show that blame game had no basis in reality.

2. “You’re not gonna get Covid if you have these vaccinations.”

While Biden sometimes qualified his claims that the Covid-19 vaccines prevented infection, on at least one occasion, he claimed the vaccines were 100 percent effective. “You’re ok, you’re not gonna — you’re not gonna get Covid if you have these vaccinations,” Biden said.

The claim was so blatantly false that even Snopes acknowledged that “Biden overstated the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations.” Rather than rating Biden’s claim as false, though, Snopes marked it with a green checkmark and insisted the claim was a “Correct Attribution.”

3. “When President Biden took office … there was no vaccine available.”

Just this May, the White House said in a tweet that “When President Biden took office, millions were unemployed and there was no vaccine available.” The claim was so blatantly false that the White House later corrected it.

Fox News reported that Biden also made this false claim in a CNN town hall, with White House Correspondent Kevin Corke noting Biden “received two vaccine shots himself while President Trump was still in the White House.”

4. People who are vaccinated “do not spread the disease to anybody else.”

Biden also claimed that people who are vaccinated do not spread Covid, insisting “We’re making sure health care workers are vaccinated because if you seek care at a health care facility, you should have the certainty that the people providing that care are protected from COVID and cannot spread it to you.”

He later repeated the claim. “Everybody talks about freedom and not to have a shot, or have a test,” Biden said. “Well, guess what, how about patriotism? How about making sure that you’re vaccinated so you do not spread the disease to anybody else? What about that? What’s the big deal?”

Yet, Jean-Pierre announced that Biden “will continue to work in isolation until he tests negative” and that “the White House Medical Unit will inform all close contacts of the President” about the positive test. These protocols would obviously be unnecessary if people who have received the Covid shot actually could not spread the virus.

House Dems Endorse Sending Emergency Oil Reserves To China,"House Democrats blocked a motion Wednesday that would have barred oil from the nation’s emergency petroleum reserves from being shipped overseas to entities under the control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

The motion, proposed by California Republican Rep. David Valadao, would have made it illegal for oil from the emergency stockpile to be sent to China after President Joe Biden’s latest release sent 1 million barrels to Beijing enterprises. Democrats killed the motion with 219 voting against and 206 Republicans voting in favor.

“It is irresponsible and dangerous for the United States to provide a foreign adversary with fuel that we need to keep here in the United States in case of an emergency,” Valadao said promoting his proposal on the floor of the House. “It seems the Biden administration is helping to support China’s national security at the expense of our own.”

Earlier this month, Reuters revealed that American oil from the strategic petroleum reserves maintained for sudden supply shocks was shipped to the east Asian adversary as opposed to U.S. refineries. According to the Energy Department, 950,000 barrels ended up in the hands of Unipec, the trading arm of the China Petrochemical Corporation owned entirely by the Chinese government. The company is also known as “Sinopec,” in which the president’s son Hunter Biden invested $1.7 billion through the private equity firm BHR Partners.

Hunter Biden’s lawyer told The New York Times last fall that he “no longer holds any interest, directly or indirectly,” in the private equity firm built while his father was vice president. According to the Washington Examiner, however, Hunter Biden remained listed as a part-owner of the firm as late as March.

“Business records from China’s National Credit Information Publicity System accessed Tuesday continue to identify Skaneateles as a 10% owner in BHR, and Washington, D.C., business records continue to list Biden as the only beneficial owner of Skaneateles,” the Examiner reported in March. “The White House has routinely deflected questions about Biden’s business dealings to his attorneys, who have remained largely mum.”

On Wednesday, 19 House Republicans sent a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm with demands for a briefing on the sale.

“The decision to sell to Unipec raises questions about why the Biden Administration is selling oil from the SPR to China, especially when the sale may enrich Hunter Biden, the President’s son,” wrote lawmakers led by Kentucky Rep. James Comer. “This transaction is even more troubling given that evidence continues to mount showing the Biden family peddled access to the highest levels of government to enrich themselves.”

The letter was published exclusively by the New York Post, which also broke a series of stories from an abandoned Delaware laptop that contradicted Joe Biden’s repeated claims of never speaking business with his son “or with anyone else.” Emails from the laptop reportedly belonging to Hunter Biden also implicated the president in corrupt business deals with the CCP, now enriched by American reserve oil.

In May, President Biden tapped the strategic petroleum reserves to unleash 1 million barrels of oil daily for 180 days, which will align conveniently with the fall election cycle, instead of encouraging domestic energy production. By the end of Biden’s latest release, 260 million barrels will be depleted from the reserves, which have an authorized capacity of up to 714 million. The Department of Energy has announced plans to replenish only 60 million barrels, leaving the reserves at their lowest level since 1985.

The Energy Department has also refused to comply with requests made under the Freedom of Information Act probing the use of the emergency reserves in the absence of any real emergency such as a hurricane or cyberattack. Instead, Biden’s ordered releases from the stockpile seem to be efforts to save political capital. Earlier this month, the Functional Government Initiative, a nonprofit government watchdog, filed a lawsuit to compel records that would grant insight into the administration’s decision to tap the storage of petroleum.

The U.S., however, is not the only nation to tap into its emergency oil reserves to tamp down high gas prices. China, which has equally sized reserves, has tapped only 7.4 million barrels of its own stockpile while U.S. emergency supplies are shipped to Beijing.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/21/house-democrats-dont-mind-emptying-out-emergency-oil-reserves-to-china/,2022-07-21
Media Predictably Cover For Biden’s Saudi Foreign Policy Fiasco,"Biden just got back from a disastrous trip to Saudi Arabia, and all we’re really hearing from the media is crickets.

With a only few highlights of Biden’s flaws during his visit and a preoccupation with human rights issues instead of our hamstrung credibility, the corporate media are content with their coverage of a failed diplomacy attempt that signals only weakness from the United States.

On July 13, Biden visited Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (often referred to by his initials MBS) ostensibly to “strengthen a strategic partnership” to compete against China, increase stability in the Middle East, and fight Russian aggression, per an article Biden himself published in The Washington Post.

The real purpose of the visit was to relieve the gas price problem, caused in large part by Biden’s green policies, soaring inflation, and sanctions on Russia, which have converged to tank his approval rating. (He all but admitted this in his article.) The only tangible thing that seems to have arisen from the U.S.-Saudi meeting, however, is a transfusion of strength between the two countries’ reputations: Saudi Arabia was just recognized by the leader of the free world, and the United States just begged for oil from a state our president called a “pariah” on the campaign trail.

The mild criticism the corporate media directs at Biden is not enough. From the fist bump with MBS, whom the CIA reports sanctioned the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, to the lack of specific agreements binding Saudi Arabia to sell more oil, the trip was a president-sized flop, and the media are covering for him.

The fist bump was bad, but it remains the only aspect of the trip many outlets will cover, turning the poorly judged gesture into a red herring. They’re not talking about the oil problem, the opened airspace Biden said was a victory for Israeli-Saudi relations and the Saudi government overtly contradicted, or Biden’s dubious assertion that he challenged MBS on the killing of Khashoggi (testimony the Saudi minister of state denies).

CNN’s coverage of the trip stresses a “political and diplomatic tightrope” the president was forced to walk in Saudi Arabia and even gives a favorable nod to Biden’s not-so-subtle jab at U.S. gas stations for not charging prices equal to what they pay for oil. CNN also lauded Biden for taking a “calibrated approach” to increasing oil exportation from Saudi Arabia.

NBC published only three articles on Biden’s time in Saudi Arabia, all of which were prior to its conclusion. Two painted Biden’s visit as part of a grand, effective plan, and one criticized Biden for fist bumping MBS. NBC did not publish one article upon Biden’s return, nor did it highlight his failed attempt to secure more oil or the Saudi’s contradiction of his statement that the opening of Saudi airspace to Israeli planes was a step toward ties with Israel.

NPR covered only the human rights issue raised by Biden’s fist bump with MBS in its scant articles upon the conclusion of the Saudi trip.

While The New York Times and The Washington Post have critiqued Biden’s failure to achieve tangible results from his trip, the Times editorial board also said Biden was doing the “right thing” in his visit, and both outlets made sure to couch their criticism in mild terms. It’s a far cry from the rage such a disastrous visit would have raised from leftist media if former President Donald Trump had gone to the Middle East to beg for oil.

If Trump, who is scarcely recognized in the corporate media for his actually successful accords in the Middle East, had achieved the same outrageous failings as Biden, Trump would have been plastered on front pages for weeks after the trip. Yet mention of the Saudi debacle is almost absent on the homepages of our major media.

FBI's False Labeling Of Biden Laptop As Disinfo Is Really Bad,"FBI whistleblowers claim that agents opened a sham investigation into Hunter Biden to brand reliable and verifiable derogatory evidence as “disinformation,” according to an explosive news release issued yesterday by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.

If true, beyond exposing the FBI’s role in running cover for the Biden family, the whistleblowers’ claims prove significant for a second reason: By failing to thoroughly vet the evidence in its possession related to Hunter Biden — which included the hard drive for the MacBook Hunter had abandoned at a repair shop — the intelligence community ignored a momentous national security threat, namely that the Russians potentially possessed a second Hunter Biden laptop.

Late Monday, Grassley issued a news release citing “multiple FBI whistleblowers, including those in senior positions,” who raised “the alarm about tampering by senior FBI and Justice Department officials in politically sensitive investigations,” including “investigative activity involving derogatory information on Hunter Biden’s financial and foreign business activities.” According to the Iowa Republican, the whistleblowers alleged that Washington Field Office Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy “Thibault and other FBI officials sought to falsely portray as disinformation evidence acquired from multiple sources that provided the FBI derogatory information related to Hunter Biden’s financial and foreign business activities, even though some of that information had already been or could be verified.”

The news release added that “in August of 2020, FBI supervisory intelligence analyst Brian Auten opened an assessment, which was used by a team of agents at FBI headquarters to improperly discredit and falsely claim that derogatory information about Biden’s activities was disinformation, causing investigative activity and sourcing to be shut down.” “The FBI headquarters team allegedly placed their assessment findings in a restricted access subfolder, effectively flagging sources and derogatory evidence related to Hunter Biden as disinformation while shielding the justification for such findings from scrutiny,” according to Grassley.

The Iowa senator claimed that “Thibault also reportedly ordered the closure of a stream of information related to Hunter Biden and sought to improperly mark the matter within FBI systems in a way that would prevent it from being re-opened in the future.” “The FBI headquarters team allegedly claimed that reporting from the stream was at risk of disinformation,” but the whistleblowers told Grassley, “that all of the information obtained through that stream was already verified or verifiable.”

The FBI whistleblowers’ charges, if accurate, are devastating and mean that at a time that Hunter Biden was already reportedly under investigation by the Delaware U.S. Attorney’s Office, rather than work with the agents already investigating then-candidate Joe Biden’s son, FBI headquarters initiated its own “assessment.” Then, according to the whistleblowers, agents improperly shut down sources, falsely framed evidence as disinformation, and hid the reasoning for that determination from other FBI agents behind restricted areas.

The press release also suggests that the FBI’s “assessment” served to frame the investigation Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., were conducting into Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealing as tainted by Russian disinformation. As part of that investigation, in May 2020, “Senate Republicans issued a subpoena seeking documents from the younger Biden and asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Burisma,” which was the Ukrainian energy company that paid Hunter nearly $1 million a year to sit on its board.

With the Trump-Biden presidential contest in full force, Grassley and Johnson’s investigation into Hunter prompted pushback from Democrats, with Democrat members of the Gang of Eight sending a letter and classified addendum in July 2020 to FBI Director Christopher Wray “specifically citing the Johnson-Grassley probe into Hunter Biden as reason for an urgent briefing for Congress about foreign ‘disinformation.’”

The following month, Democrat Sens. Gary Peters of Michigan and Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote Grassley and Johnson and requested that members of the Senate Homeland Security and Finance committees, which they chaired, “receive a briefing from the FBI’s foreign influence task force related to their ongoing Biden investigations.”

According to an August 5, 2020, Washington Post article, “the Democrats have requested the member briefing for months, and the FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies have previously briefed committee staff on possible foreign disinformation.” The FBI later briefed both Grassley and Johnson on August 6, 2020, but according to the senators, that briefing was both “unsolicited and unnecessary” and failed to provide any new information to the senators or any specific allegations that they had received “disinformation” as part of their Hunter Biden investigation.

Given that FBI supervisory intelligence analyst Brian Auten, according to whistleblowers, opened his assessment into Hunter in August, the whistleblowers’ allegations raise serious questions concerning whether Democrats pressured the FBI into launching an investigation into Hunter as a pretext to provide the desired “disinformation briefing.”

Further, in April of 2021, someone leaked the fact that the FBI had briefed Grassley and Johnson on August 6, 2020, with the Washington Post running a story painting the senators as reckless in their investigation into Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings by suggesting they “ignored FBI warnings and thus may have been manipulated by the Kremlin.” As the Wall Street Journal reported at the time, it seems possible that “the FBI set up two Members of Congress for political attack under the guise of a ‘defensive briefing.’”

The whistleblowers’ accusations then, when coupled with the media coverage, suggest that an agent from FBI headquarters opened an assessment to provide cover to Hunter Biden, to eliminate source trails for the investigation into then-candidate Joe Biden’s son, and to taint the legitimate inquiry into Hunter Biden’s business dealings. That scandal, however, represents but half the issue because the whistleblowers’ statements, if true, suggest the assessment of Hunter was a sham. And as a sham, the agents would not vet the evidence available to them, which would have included the MacBook laptop Hunter had abandoned at a repair shop in Delaware.

The FBI seized that laptop in December of 2019, after being alerted to its existence in October. At that time, FBI agents were reportedly told that in addition to pornography, the computer had information “dealing with foreign interests, a pay-for-play scheme linked to the former administration, [and] lots of foreign money.”

What the FBI did after seizing the laptop in December of 2019 is unknown. However, given that the FBI was reportedly told it contained “a pay-for-play scheme linked to the former administration, [and] lots of foreign money,” any legitimate investigation would have involved reviewing the laptop for information relevant to Grassley and Johnson’s investigations. And had the FBI reviewed the laptop, agents would have discovered a video recording capturing Hunter Biden saying that in 2018, another laptop went missing when he was “partying in Las Vegas,” and that Hunter believed it was stolen by a group of Russians.

The video then showed a prostitute asking Hunter if he worried the Russian thieves would try to “blackmail” him. “Yeah, in some way, yeah,” Hunter replied, noting his father is “running for president,” and that “I talk about it all the time.” Hunter had also noted that the computer had “tons” of compromising videos on it.

But it was not just the compromising videos of Hunter of concern, but the financial information likely on that laptop that could implicate his father in the pay-to-play scandal. If that information were in the hands of “the Russians,” as Hunter believed, the national security risk was huge and demanded the intelligence community conduct a defensive briefing of Joe Biden.

Instead, it appears from the whistleblowers’ comments that a non-investigation took place, with legitimate sources and evidence falsely categorized as disinformation, and then rather than provide Biden a defensive briefing, the senators received one.

This scandal is no longer just about the Biden family; it is about every member of the law enforcement and intelligence communities who put our country at risk by failing to do their jobs.

DOJ Insiders: Delaware US Attorney Inadequate To Investigate Biden Corruption,"The Delaware U.S. Attorney’s Office investigating Hunter Biden lacks the wherewithal and resources to adequately probe the dubious financial dealings of the Biden family and their business partners, according to three current or former Department of Justice officials.

“If any single one of the dozens of issues had been alleged about the Bush or Trump families, a special counsel would have been appointed immediately,” said one career official familiar with the probe. “[The Delaware office] needs help. There’s no way it can tackle everything it needs to, even if it tried.” Two other officials also expressed concern about resources available to the investigation, particularly given the political sensitivity and complexity of the underlying issues.

In March 2022, the New York Times reported that David C. Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, was overseeing the criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, noting that the probe may also involve the scrutiny of various other connected individuals and businesses. Sources told the Times that a grand jury continues to gather evidence “in a wide-ranging examination” of Biden’s international business dealings, with prosecutors considering charges for tax fraud, criminal foreign lobbying, and money laundering.

On July 8, Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., the top Republican on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, wrote to Weiss, a second time, inquiring about the investigation. In addition to asking the attorney whether Nicholas McQuaid, a former associate of Hunter Biden’s criminal attorney and now the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the DOJ’s Criminal Division, had any involvement in the investigation, Grassley and Johnson sought assurances concerning the funding and scope of the investigation.

Has the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Delaware issued grand jury subpoenas “to Wells Fargo, USAA, Bank of America, TD Bank, JPMorgan Chase, PNC, Morgan Stanley, Citibank, Bank of New York Mellon, Bank of China and First National Bank of Omaha for records relating to Hunter Biden, James Biden, Sara Biden, John R. Walker, Eric Schwerin, Devon Archer and corporate entities linked to them, including but not limited to, Hudson West III and the Lion Hall Group?” the letter inquired.

Those financial institutions should have relevant information related to Weiss’s criminal probe, the senators explained, referencing bank records introduced on the Senate floor establishing financial connections between James Biden (the president’s brother) and Hunter and the communist Chinese regime.

During floor speeches earlier this year, Grassley and Johnson displayed multiple records confirming the transfer of funds from top Chinese officials and various entities run by President Joe Biden’s family members, including one transfer of $100,000 from the Chinese-owned firm of CEFC and Hunter Biden’s firm, Owasco. Another wire transfer from communist-connected Chinese businesses totaled $5,000,000, with the proceeds reaching Hunter and James Biden through a variety of business organizations they controlled — a maze the senators walked people through on the Senate floor earlier this year, including Hunter Biden’s Hudson West III and James Biden’s Lion Hall Group. Other bank records established high-value transfers to James Biden.

Revelations of Hunter and James Biden’s profiteering from communist China represent but one aspect of the financial dealings of the duo. According to the New York Times, Hunter Biden’s joint global equity firm, the Bohai Harvest Equity Investment Fund, helped arrange the purchase by a Chinese mining company of the world’s largest cobalt source in the Congo. “Hunter reportedly launched that new joint enterprise with Chinese business partners less than two weeks after he traveled to China on Air Force Two with his then-vice president father.”

That Hunter and then-Vice President Joe Biden made the joint trip to China shortly before the younger Biden partnered with Chinese businessmen proves even more significant now, given the recent release of a tape capturing Hunter bragging of his influence over his father. “He’ll talk about anything that I want him to, that he believes in. If I say it’s important to me, then he will work a way in which to make it a part of his platform,” Hunter can reportedly be heard saying. “My dad respects me more than he respects anyone in the world, and I know that to be certain, so it’s not going to be about whether my dad thinks it’s going to affect his politics.”

In early July, even more questions concerning dealings with China were raised when news broke that the Biden administration had sold nearly 1 million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to Unipec, which is the “trading arm” of the Chinese company known as Sinopec. “Sinopec is also tied to Hunter Biden, whose private equity firm, BHR Partners, bought a $1.7 billion stake in the company seven years ago.”

Beyond China, Hunter Biden’s role in Ukraine and his appointment to Burisma Holdings board of directors at a reported salary of $50,000 per month during his dad’s time as vice president adds to the deep dive required on the Biden family financials. Sources familiar with Weiss’s investigation also claim the Delaware U.S. attorney is looking at the Washington consulting firm Blue Star Strategies, which worked for Burisma in a deal Hunter Biden reportedly helped broker.

But there is more, with a Senate report documenting Hunter Biden’s receipt of a combined $3.5 million from the wife of the former Moscow mayor, a Kazakhstan investor, and several other individuals.

Closer to home, James Biden’s financial dealings also evidence a complicated pay-to-play scandal underlying his investing in the health care sector. According to court filings and interviews with former business associates, James Biden told his potential partners, including at Americore Health Hospital, “that his last name could open doors and that Joe Biden was excited about the public policy implications of their business models…”

According to Politico, Tom Pritchard, a former Americore executive, said that James Biden held out the “promise of a large investment from the Middle East based on his political connections,” even introducing Pritchard to the now-president. James Biden later reportedly helped Americore obtain a loan from a hedge fund, before taking “a six-figure personal loan out of Americore’s coffers,” but then the Middle East investment never materialized, and neither did James Biden’s repayment of the loan.

Similar allegations suffered in a Tennessee case brought by two health-services firms that sued James Biden and his business partners, “alleging James and his partners promised to provide a large investment from the Middle East, then pushed the firms to make expensive acquisitions, as part of a scheme to drive them out of business and steal their business models.” “Those firms alleged that James Biden cited his family’s political connections and promised his older brother would promote their health care model as part of his 2020 presidential campaign.’”

Grassley and Johnson’s letter to Weiss suggests the Biden family’s apparent attempt to profit in the health care sector from their relationship with Joe Biden is on the radar of investigators, as the senators specifically called out Sara Biden as an interested party. Politico’s exposé into the Biden family’s health care investments reported that Platinum Global Partners, “a Florida corporation that lists James and his wife Sara as managers,” faced claims in a court case in Palm Beach County related to a purported investment agreement James and Sara Biden’s business reneged on. And according to Politico, an “executive involved in litigation against James Biden,” claimed James Biden said he “could get the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote” an “oral rinse” with purported benefits for cancer patients.

The other names called out in the letter to Weiss provide further insight into the breadth of the financial dealings the Delaware office must entangle. Devon Archer, for instance, served as a partner with Hunter Biden and John Kerry’s stepson Chris Heinz in their investment firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners. Archer has already been convicted of fraud in an unrelated case in New York.

Eric Schwerin, another person Grassley and Johnson identified whose banking records would likely be relevant, was at one time president of Rosemont Seneca Partners. However, “during the eight years of Joe Biden’s vice presidency, Schwerin gradually became a de facto financial planner for the wider Biden family.” And according to a new book by Hunter’s ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, Schwerin “managed almost every area of [her and Hunter’s] financial lives.”

Significantly, “emails from Hunter Biden’s abandoned hard drive show Schwerin moving money on behalf of father and son and helping Hunter Biden handle family expenses.” Another email showed that while Joe Biden was vice president, Schwerin received his “Delaware tax refund check” and that Schwerin and Hunter discussed various payments for Joe Biden’s expenses.

While the Times reported that “over the last two years, federal prosecutors in Delaware have issued scores of subpoenas for documents related to Hunter Biden’s foreign work and for bank accounts linked to him and his associates, including two formerly close business partners, Eric Schwerin and Devon Archer,” the senators’ letter requests confirmation of that fact from Weiss.

In addition to Hunter’s business dealings, the letter questioned Weiss on recent reports suggesting that “Joe Biden may have unwittingly financed Hunter Biden’s ‘participation in an escort ring tied to Russia.’” The senators then stressed that in their September 2020 report, they had “noted that records in our possession indicated that ‘Hunter Biden paid nonresident women in the United States who are citizens of Russia and Ukraine’ and that some transactions are linked to what ‘appears to be an Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.’”

Such “potentially criminal behavior must be thoroughly investigated by law enforcement entities according to the highest ethical standards,” last week’s letter cautioned, while noting that the senators “have serious concerns about your review of this matter as well as the ongoing Hunter Biden criminal case.”

Those “serious concerns” led the senators to once again ask Weiss whether he discussed with the attorney general “the need for a special counsel or independent counsel to properly investigate the Hunter Biden criminal matter,” and whether the District of Delaware’s U.S. Attorney’s Office has “received sufficient resources and support from the Justice Department to properly execute the Hunter Biden criminal case.”

Calls for a special counsel have been percolating since April when a group of nearly 100 House Republications wrote Attorney General Merrick Garland to demand he appoint a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden. “We are concerned that in the case of Hunter Biden the Department has an actual conflict of interest and certainly has the appearance of a conflict of interest that could prevent a fair and impartial investigation of his activities,” the lawmakers wrote, adding, “You were nominated to your position by Hunter Biden’s father and ultimately work for him.”

Those concerns have been heightened with the announcement of several whistleblowers in the Department of Justice sounding the alarm about politically charged decisions to limit or shut down investigations of the Biden family business.

The White House has to date rejected calls for a special counsel, but three current or former DOJ officials tell The Federalist that conflicts of interest aside, the complexity and scope of the investigation exceed the capabilities of the Delaware U.S. Attorney’s Office.

With Weiss’s investigation already into its third year and with evidence continuing to trickle out from Hunter’s laptop confirming both his and his uncle James’ questionable business dealings and that Joe Biden benefitted financially from those enterprises, Grassley and Johnson are right to question whether Weiss has adequate resources for the probe into the Biden family financial dealings.

Those familiar with the investigation, however, believe a special counsel is needed to ensure the right people with the necessary skill sets are available — something the Delaware U.S. Attorney’s Office just cannot possibly have.

"DOJ May Have Impeded Biden Probes Out Of Pittsburgh, Delaware","The recent charge leveled by multiple whistleblowers that FBI headquarters falsely labeled verifiable evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden “disinformation” raises the specter that agents also impeded the separate investigations run by the Pittsburgh and Delaware U.S. attorneys’ offices.

On Monday, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, announced that “multiple FBI whistleblowers, including those in senior positions” had accused Washington Field Office assistant special agent in charge Timothy Thibault and other FBI officials of “falsely portray[ing] as disinformation evidence acquired from multiple sources that provided the FBI derogatory information related to Hunter Biden’s financial and foreign business activities, even though some of that information had already been or could be verified.”

The whistleblowers, Grassley explained, had further claimed that “in August of 2020, FBI supervisory intelligence analyst Brian Auten opened an assessment, which was used by a team of agents at FBI headquarters to improperly discredit and falsely claim that derogatory information about Biden’s activities was disinformation, causing investigative activity and sourcing to be shut down.” “The FBI headquarters team allegedly placed their assessment findings in a restricted access subfolder, effectively flagging sources and derogatory evidence related to Hunter Biden as disinformation while shielding the justification for such findings from scrutiny,” according to Grassley.

Conflicting Stories

This explosive revelation conflicts with the storyline leaked by law enforcement officials to the New York Times shortly after Joe Biden’s election — just as news of the investigation into the financial dealings of his son reached a fever pitch.

Soon after Hunter Biden disclosed that the Delaware U.S. attorney’s office was investigating him and had served multiple subpoenas on him and his business associates, the Times published a story discussing the separate investigation run out of the Pittsburgh U.S. attorney’s office.

“As federal investigators in Delaware were examining the finances of Hunter Biden during his father’s campaign for president, a similar inquiry ramped up this year in Pittsburgh, fueled by materials delivered by President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani,” the Times article opened. “Attorney General William P. Barr had asked the top federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh, Scott W. Brady, to accept and vet any information that Mr. Giuliani had on the Biden family, including Hunter Biden,” the December 14, 2020, article continued, claiming that “Brady hosted Mr. Giuliani for a nearly four-hour meeting in late January to discuss his materials.”

The Times article then proceeded to paint the then-Pittsburgh U.S. attorney as a partisan hack and, relying on unnamed sources, claimed that Barr’s decision to direct Brady to oversee an “intake process for information about Ukraine to ‘assess its provenance and its credibility,’” was “highly unusual because prosecutors in Delaware had already been scrutinizing Hunter Biden for more than a year.”

Barr made clear at the time, however, that investigators had to be careful about any information originating from Ukraine because “there are a lot of agendas in the Ukraine, a lot of crosscurrents.” “We can’t take anything we received from Ukraine at face value,” Barr stressed. And the Times — while spinning the narrative that there was something nefarious about Barr’s decision to task Brady with oversight of information provided by Giuliani, claiming “the arrangement immediately raised alarms within the F.B.I. and the Justice Department” — even acknowledged in its article that Barr “has farmed out other politically sensitive investigations to trusted U.S. attorneys outside Washington.”

Then, relying “on interviews with five current and former law enforcement officials and others with knowledge of F.B.I. interactions with the Justice Department,” the Times reported that Brady sought “to take aggressive steps,” including having the FBI interview a list of potential witnesses, which supposedly “prompted a tense confrontation with F.B.I. officials at the bureau’s headquarters in Washington.”

Significantly, the Times reported that “the F.B.I. viewed the investigative steps into Mr. Biden that Mr. Brady sought as unwarranted because the Delaware inquiry involving money laundering had fizzled out and because they were skeptical of Mr. Giuliani’s material. For example, they had already examined a laptop owned by Mr. Biden and an external hard drive that had been abandoned at a computer store in Wilmington and found nothing to advance the inquiry.”

The Times had previously reported that “as part of the F.B.I.’s closely held money-laundering investigation into [Hunter] Biden, agents working with federal prosecutors in Delaware authorized a federal grand jury subpoena and obtained the laptop and an external hard drive.” In seizing the laptop and external hard drive from the Delaware repair store, the FBI’s receipt confirming the seizure “included an F.B.I. code, 272D, the bureau’s internal classification for money laundering investigations, and ‘BA’ for its Baltimore field office.” (The FBI’s Baltimore field office supports the Delaware’s U.S. Attorney’s office.) But, according to the Times’ sources, “the F.B.I. examined the laptop but that its contents did not advance the money-laundering investigation.”

An FBI Leak

But now, some two years later, we know that the Times reporting is factually incorrect, which even the New York legacy outlet’s coverage earlier this year confirms, in two respects. First, the “money laundering” aspect of the Delaware inquiry into Hunter Biden had not “fizzled out,” but according to their sources remains a part of the Delaware U.S. attorney’s grand jury investigation. And second, the laptop contained evidence supportive of the money-laundering probe and potentially other crimes.

Yet in 2020, five officials told the Times a different story, and some further claimed that in response to the Pittsburgh U.S. attorney’s investigation, FBI agents “found ways to ostensibly satisfy Mr. Brady,” raising questions of how precisely they thwarted his investigation.

When coupled with what the multiple whistleblowers, including some in senior positions, told Grassley, it appears the FBI headquarters either improperly withheld information or presented inaccurate information to the U.S. attorney’s office in Pittsburgh and possibly also Delaware.

And what better way to hide that fact than for FBI headquarters to leak to the New York Times that the laptop held nothing nefarious and to portray any investigative findings coming from the Pittsburgh U.S. attorney’s office as politically suspect? With that narrative in place, other FBI agents, including those supporting the Delaware U.S. attorney’s office investigation, would have no reason to question FBI headquarters’ claims that evidence was “disinformation.”

What other purpose would the leaks to the Times serve? With a Biden election, a new slate of U.S. attorneys would soon be on the job, so the political hit on Brady made no sense at that late date. Similarly, many of the complaints aired in the December 2020 piece by the Times’ sources concerned fears that Brady or his team would influence the November 2020 election by leaking details of the investigation, but with the election over and without any leaks, that criticism rang hollow.

But if the five unnamed officials knew they had withheld information from the Pittsburgh and Delaware U.S. attorney’s offices related to the investigation into the Biden family and/or had improperly closed down sources and evidentiary trails as alleged by the whistleblowers, then creating the public perception that there is “no there, there” would help hide this reality.

So as Grassley proceeds with his investigation into the whistleblowers’ allegations, he should also assess whether FBI headquarters withheld or provided inaccurate information to the two U.S. attorney’s offices that had been charged with investigating Hunter Biden and his family business dealings. More significantly, with the Delaware U.S. attorney’s office still investigating Biden, it is imperative that prosecutors there — or better yet, a special counsel — review all evidence gathered by the Pittsburgh office and any files touched by FBI headquarters to ensure the integrity of the investigation.

Former U.S. Attorney Scott Brady and Delaware U.S. Attorney David C. Weiss both declined to comment in response to inquiries by The Federalist. Grassley’s office, however, confirmed to The Federalist that the senator has not spoken with either the Pittsburgh or the Delaware U.S. attorney’s offices about the whistleblowers’ allegations.

Biden Is A More Problematic Climate Hypocrite Than Kylie Jenner,"A few weeks ago, socialite Kylie Jenner got “climate shamed” on social media after she published an Instagram post with a picture of herself and her sometime-partner Travis Scott, along with their private jets. Jenner’s caption to the post, “you wanna take mine or yours?” received torrents of criticism for its poor taste.

But for sheer chutzpah, people should look to Washington, not Hollywood, when it comes to climate hypocrisy. Over the last year, the middle class has gotten punched in the teeth when it comes to energy policy, with gasoline prices still nearly double the roughly $2.31-per-gallon mark from when President Trump left office, and home heating prices soaring too. The increases come in no small part because Democrats believe in leaving American energy buried in the ground to appease leftist activists outraged about the “climate crisis.”

Even as Democrats in Congress prepare a massive tax-and-spending binge full of “green energy” pork to address this “crisis,” their putative leader, Joe Biden, acts like a jet-setter when it comes to his own lifestyle. Biden’s actions demonstrate not just that he has no intention of practicing what he preaches, but that he’s perfectly content to let working families suffer, while indulging in his own desire for luxury and comfort.

‘Crisis—What Climate Crisis?’

Consider some of the first acts Biden took after leaving office as vice president in 2017. Upon signing a book deal, he used the proceeds to increase his real estate portfolio. On top of the mansion he already owned in Wilmington, Delaware, he bought a nearly 5,000 square foot “beach house” in Rehoboth Beach.

When asked about the purchase, Biden told a local paper that the move had fulfilled a lifelong dream to own a beach house. Apparently, solving the “climate crisis” took a backseat to buying another mansion—and increasing his carbon footprint in the process.

In addition to the Wilmington estate and his Rehoboth “beach house,” Biden also rented a mansion outside Washington upon leaving the vice presidency. That palace boasts nearly 12,000 square feet of living space—one-third larger than the vice president’s residence Biden left. It also includes parking for more than 20 cars—making the home not very eco-friendly—a gym, a sauna, chandeliers in the entrance lobby, and a grand piano in a music room/parlor.

Take a look at a picture of the house from Zillow and ask yourself: Does the person who lives here look like someone who cares a lot about the “climate crisis”?

Jetting to Wilmington and Rehoboth

Having spent money acquiring a real estate portfolio, Biden now spends much of his time using taxpayers’ money flying around to visit it.

While Jenner drew attacks for taking flights on her jet for minor excursions as short as 17 minutes, Biden’s slightly longer flights home to Delaware occur nearly as frequently. In 2021 alone, Biden took 31 trips back to Delaware—and a further 12 trips to Camp David, the official presidential retreat in Maryland.

One of the stories discussing Jenner’s controversial post noted that “in one hour, a single private jet can emit two tons of carbon dioxide.” But as a specially modified Boeing 747, Air Force One must emit many more tons of toxic fumes than the smaller jets that celebrities like Jenner frequent.

For security reasons, the President of the United States obviously can’t fly on commercial airlines. But is it asking too much for someone who complains of a “climate crisis”—and says the federal government must raise taxes to fund a bunch of pork-barrel climate spending to address this “crisis”—to perhaps not spend every weekend flying around in a massively polluting (not to mention taxpayer-funded) Boeing 747?

After all, taxpayers already provide Mr. Biden with lodging in a large, not to mention historic, mansion. The White House includes its own tennis court, putting green, bowling alley, and plenty of room for Mr. Biden to “ride” his bike well away from the prying eyes of the press. What more could the man want?

It’s Not About Climate, It’s About Control

One comment on Jenner’s Instagram post hit the nail on the head: “Why do I limit my meat consumption and use paper straws while the 1% gets to pump tons of carbon into the atmosphere for a day trip to Palm Springs?” Substitute “Wilmington” or “Rehoboth Beach” for Palm Springs, and you have Joe Biden’s behavior—and example—in a nutshell.

In many respects, the answer is as simple as it is infuriating: Lefty politicians, just like lefty celebrities, think they’re better than you, and don’t have to follow the rules they set out for others. They want others (meaning you) to pay the price for their climate “sins.” And climate groups have shown themselves willing to play along, and give Biden a pass for his hypocritical example, so long as he enacts the policies they want.

But the fact that the left has little interest in practicing what it preaches shows that the “climate crisis” isn’t really about climate; it’s a grab for power. As Rahm Emanuel famously noted, “You never let a serious crisis go to waste.” That’s why the left dubs anything and everything a “crisis”—because to them, “crisis” functions as code for “government power grab.”

Make Biden Practice What He Preaches

Some smart conservative offices should offer an amendment during the Senate vote-a-rama on the Democrat tax-and-spending bill that would prohibit the use of taxpayer funds for these emissions-producing weekend flights to Delaware for the First Couple. If the “climate crisis” is as bad as Democrats claim it is, then all 100 senators should readily agree to this common-sense provision.

If, on the other hand, Democrats vote down this type of measure, it would reinforce the fact that these lawmakers have no interest in holding themselves to the same standards and restrictions as mere mortals like you and I. And that’s something to think about the next time you’re at the pump, paying an outrageously high price for gas under this president.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/08/03/joe-biden-is-a-more-problematic-climate-hypocrite-than-kylie-jenner/,2022-08-03
Biden Admin Run By Former Registered Foreign Agents,"More than a dozen high-ranking members of the Biden administration previously worked as registered foreign agents, according to a new report obtained exclusively by The Federalist. The report was published by the Biden administration watchdog “Inside Biden’s Basement,” itself a project of the nonprofit Transparency Action Fund.

Titled, “Foreign Agents Lurking Inside Biden’s Basement,” the group’s new report outlines the networks of at least 13 officials under President Joe Biden who were once paid to represent foreign interests and registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Their prior clients range from Iran and Kazakhstan to Canada and Mexico.

FARA records show White House Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su’s law firm paid out $30,000 a month to Mercury Public Affairs on behalf of the government of Kazakhstan in 2018. Biden Special Assistant Erin Pelton was employed with Mercury in the same year and worked on behalf of both Kazakhstan and Qatar, according to public government documents.

In 2006, Biden’s U.S. Ambassador to Poland Mark Brzezinski’s public affairs firm, McGuireWoods Consulting, was paid nearly $140,000 over a six-month period by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO).

“As Americans experience one Biden-era crisis pile on top of another, the President’s Cabinet, spokesmen, and aides behind the scenes seem to put America last,” said Derrick Hollie, the communications director for Inside Biden’s Basement. “It is instructive for Americans watching their needs take a back seat to know which of those officials Inside Biden’s Basement have represented nations other than our own yet now have tremendous power over their lives.” Hollie worked previously in Trump’s Department of Transportation.

The Foreign Agents Registration Act requires that anyone lobbying on behalf of a foreign client disclose their business to the Department of Justice. Filings regularly demonstrate the extent of bipartisan corruption in Washington. As the Washington establishment sought to undercut former President Donald Trump, FARA enforcement kicked into high gear amid investigations into Trump officials such as Paul Manafort.

Those efforts, however, highlighted how deeply entrenched foreign interests are in Washington, D.C., also ensnaring Tony Podesta, a top Democrat lobbyist and the brother of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Manafort, Tony Podesta, and Rick Gates failed to disclose their lobbying efforts on behalf of interests connected to former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. While the media focuses heavily on the very real problems of foreign influence among certain Trump associates, far less attention is paid to the damning connections shared by Biden officials.

Attorney General Merrick Garland, the most senior of those listed, represented five international clients including the Union Nacional de Productores de Hortalizas in Mexico; the Government of Brazil; VIASA, previously known as Venezuelan International Airways; the International Commodities Clearing House, Ltd. in the United Kingdom; and the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT).

Biden adviser Anita Dunn, another senior official highlighted who returned to the West Wing in May, previously served the government of Ontario. Dunn had also voluntarily coordinated public relations strategy for disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. While not an international client, the ex-movie mogul was convicted of rape in 2020 and was sentenced to 23 years in prison at 67 following testimonies from six women against him. Dunn was also reported by the Wall Street Journal to admire former Chinese dictator Mao Zedong as a favorite political philosopher.

Other officials named in the report include U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Jeff Flake and U.S. Representative to the European Union Mark Gitenstein. Flake, who served a single term in the Senate from Arizona, previously represented Rossing Uranium Ltd., a Nambian mining operation with connections to the government of Iran. Gitenstein worked for the Swiss-headquartered food giant Nestle.

Six other administration officials who were registered foreign agents include Robert Bauer, the co-chair of the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court; Melissa Schwartz, the communications director for the Department of the Interior; Natalie Wyeth Earnest, counselor to the Treasury secretary; Maria Fabiana Jorge, alternate executive director of the Inter-American Development Bank; Zev Karlin-Neumann, a communications adviser for the Domestic Policy Council, and Steven Ricchetti, counselor to Biden.

While the report names 13 officials who were registered foreign agents before their tenure in the administration, the report is not exhaustive. The administration is actively working to conceal the identities of presidential appointees more than 18 months into Biden’s first term.

Last month, a separate conservative legal group, America First Legal (AFL), launched a litigation blitz to unearth the names, titles, positions, resumes, salaries, ethics pledges, waivers, and agreements of all appointees under Biden.

In an interview with The Federalist at the time, AFL Vice President and General Counsel Gene Hamilton compared the effort to compile records of administration officials to ProPublica’s “Trump Town” database, which made the same information of nearly 4,000 presidential appointees publicly accessible.

“People, you know, highlighted it and used it to try to write stuff up about people who were trying earnestly to execute President Trump’s agenda,” Hamilton said. “Well, the same has not really been true for the Biden administration. And so this is about transparency.”

AFL’s efforts are not connected to the database being compiled by Inside Biden’s Basement.

Grassley's Questioning Of Wray Suggests Bigger Biden Scandal,"Sen. Chuck Grassley’s questioning of FBI Director Christopher Wray during Thursday’s Judiciary Committee hearing, when considered in conjunction with the details provided by FBI whistleblowers, is suggestive of an even bigger Hunter Biden scandal.

Last week, Grassley revealed that “multiple FBI whistleblowers, including those in senior positions,” claimed the “Washington Field Office assistant special agent in charge Timothy Thibault and other FBI officials … ‘falsely portray[ed] as disinformation evidence acquired from multiple sources that provided the FBI derogatory information related to Hunter Biden’s financial and foreign business activities, even though some of that information had already been or could be verified.’” The whistleblowers also told the Iowa Republican senator that “in August of 2020, FBI supervisory intelligence analyst Brian Auten opened an assessment, which was used by a team of agents at FBI headquarters to improperly discredit and falsely claim that derogatory information about Biden’s activities was disinformation, causing investigative activity and sourcing to be shut down.”

Grassley further revealed that “the FBI headquarters team allegedly placed their assessment findings in a restricted access subfolder, effectively flagging sources and derogatory evidence related to Hunter Biden as disinformation while shielding the justification for such findings from scrutiny.”

In revealing news of the whistleblowers’ claims, Grassley did not further detail the sources of the derogatory information. However, in questioning Wray during Thursday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, four exchanges proved intriguing — and potentially insightful.

1. Was a Second U.S. Attorney’s Office’s Evidence Buried?

After using his opening statement to review the whistleblowers’ allegations, Grassley asked Wray whether “when the FBI receives a potential criminal investigation relating to a matter subject to information and prosecution by a U.S. attorney, is it the FBI’s standard practice to share that information with the relevant U.S. attorney’s office?”

Wray replied in the affirmative, noting that it is his expectation that when a particular U.S. attorney’s office and the related relevant FBI field office have the lead on an investigation, if other U.S. attorneys’ offices come across information that is relevant to that investigation, those tips and leads will be passed on to the lead office.

This line of questioning ran parallel to The Federalist’s reporting last week that noted that while the U.S. attorney’s office in Delaware pursued its investigation of Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings, then-Attorney General William Barr had directed the Pittsburgh U.S. attorney to review material purporting to show Hunter Biden’s involvement in criminal business dealings in Ukraine.

While little is publicly known about the work of the Pittsburgh U.S. attorney’s office, shortly after Biden’s election, the New York Times ran a hit piece on former Pittsburgh U.S. Attorney Scott Brady, presenting him as a Trump partisan, purportedly based “on interviews with five current and former law enforcement officials and others with knowledge of F.B.I. interactions with the Justice Department.” Among other things, the Times reported that Brady sought “to take aggressive steps,” including having the FBI interview a list of potential witnesses. The Times’ unnamed sources claimed that in response to the Pittsburgh U.S. attorney’s investigation, FBI agents “found ways to ostensibly satisfy Mr. Brady.”

Revisiting the Times article and the claims of these unnamed sources in light of the whistleblowers’ claims suggests FBI headquarters either improperly withheld information or presented inaccurate information to the U.S. attorney’s office in Pittsburgh and possibly also Delaware. And now, Grassley is questioning the FBI director on how evidence from one U.S. attorney’s office should be handled when another office is running lead. That question seems suggestive of the possibility that the evidence buried by FBI headquarters came from the Pittsburgh U.S. attorney’s office or the related FBI field office and was never shared with the Delaware U.S. attorney’s office.

Brady declined to comment to The Federalist and Grassley’s office has not yet responded to a request for comment as of publication time.

2. Was There a Foreign Human Source?

A second line of Grassley’s inquiry during Thursday’s hearing raises further questions about the type of evidence purportedly buried by FBI headquarters.

“I would like to know if the FBI received information that foreign persons had evidence of improper or unlawful financial payments paid to elected officials or other politically exposed persons would that pose a nation security concern?” Grassley asked the FBI director. And what steps should the FBI take “to vet or more fully investigate improper or unlawful money paid to elected officials and other politically exposed persons?” Grassley inquired.

Given Grassley’s focus on the whistleblower information during the hearing and the similarity between the hypothetical posed and the allegations swirling around Hunter Biden, this line of inquiry suggests FBI headquarters may have wrongly classified a foreign human source with evidence about Hunter Biden as disinformation and did so without any vetting or investigation. And having Wray state for the record, as he did, that the FBI would look at such information “very closely” and “very seriously” through the FBI’s maligned foreign influence teams, and with the potential involvement of public corruption resources, seems a purposeful tact for Grassley to make as he moves the whistleblowers’ claims move forward, especially if the evidence shows that the agents presented with the derogatory information about Hunter did not properly address the evidence.

3. How Was the Derogatory Information on Hunter Biden Branded Disinformation?

Grassley also pushed Wray on the question of disinformation. Again, while his questions were posed generically, the whistleblowers’ claims provide an interesting context to the discussion.

What criteria does the FBI use to evaluate whether evidence “is or isn’t disinformation”? the Iowa senator asked.

Here, Wray responded that “when it comes to disinformation, we’re not out there investigating whether or not information we see floating around is truthful or false in the first instance.” Rather, the FBI’s focus is on whether “there’s a foreign adversary trying to push information and from there we look into,” Wray explained. “When it comes to disinformation and defensive briefing, for example,” Wray continued, “there is an inter-agency process, that is [Office of the Director of National Intelligence] coordinated because a lot of this information comes not from the FBI but from other intelligence agencies, or in some cases from foreign allies,” the FBI director explained.

That testimony raises numerous red flags when considered against the whistleblowers’ claims that evidence about Hunter Biden was wrongly labeled disinformation by FBI headquarters. First, just from Wray’s testimony, it appears that the FBI agents would not be the appropriate ones to deem evidence “disinformation.”

Second, given the “inter-agency process” mentioned, one wonders if FBI headquarters reached out to any of the other intelligence agencies to discuss the derogatory information about Hunter Biden and if so, did another intelligence agency brand it disinformation? Third, was this derogatory evidence ever shared with the head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, or if not, why not?

The whistleblowers’ allegations were bad enough before, but now that Wray has explained the inter-agency involvement in assessing disinformation and in providing defensive briefings, the scandal could be even worse, if, for instance, FBI headquarters marked the sources as disinformation without sharing the intel with the other agencies as seems the proper protocol from Wray’s testimony.

4. Does the FBI Have a Culture of Retaliation?

A final line of questioning of interest focused on ensuring the whistleblowers would not be retaliated against. Here, it is interesting to note that Grassley stated that during his June telephone conversation with the FBI director they had “discussed the need to protect whistleblowers that had approached my office.” Grassley then thanked Wray for his commitment to preventing retaliatory conduct against whistleblowers, before asking two follow-up questions.

“Do you agree any retaliatory conduct against whistleblowers must be disciplined?” Grassley asked first.

Wray agreed that any conduct against whistleblowers was “unacceptable” and that the department had a “number of mechanisms” in place to protect whistleblowers.

Grassley then asked for Wray to commit “that the FBI won’t take any action to determine who the whistleblowers are.” Wray again confirmed the bureau would “be scrupulous in our rules” and condemned “in the strongest possible terms any prospect of retaliation against whistleblowers.”

That Grassley had Wray publicly reaffirm his commitment to protect the whistleblowers and condemn any possible retaliation raises the question of whether the FBI has a culture of retaliation. That might explain why the agents who came forward to Grassley about the alleged burying of evidence against Hunter Biden did so only within the last two months, when the charged misconduct occurred back in 2020. Grassley may also be seeking to assure other would-be whistleblowers that he will safeguard their identity and hold the FBI director responsible for guaranteeing they are not retaliated against.

With this guarantee now public, the question for the “patriots working their tails off,” as Sen. John Kennedy called the FBI agents not implicated in wrongdoing during yesterday’s hearing, is whether they will come forward to out the bad apples. If not, are they really patriots working their tails off? Or are they really just trying to save their hides.

Biden Is Accelerating The Illegal Border Invasion,"Austin, Texas — Following months of Biden administration shuttle diplomacy, multi-national U.S.-bound immigrants from more than 150 countries are now finding international routes to the southern border faster, easier, and less obstructed than ever before.

Panama has dramatically shortened the notorious Darien Gap route from South America for the first time. Mexico has amended a years-old policy of using a national guard road blockade to slow U.S.-bound immigrants on its Guatemala border for one that now immediately hands out fast-pass visas straight to the American border.

Taken altogether, the new relative ease, safety, and swiftness of global journeys to the U.S. southern border should induce even greater numbers of foreign nationals to try the journey, especially those border-crossing nationalities the administration is currently allowing to remain. The number of foreign nationals not from Mexico or Central America is at the highest level in American history, amid illegal migration already at record-breaking levels overall.

Such nationals range from 40 to 50 percent of all who reach the southern border since the Biden administration carved exemptions in the pandemic-related Title 42 instant expulsion policy. The Biden exceptions have allowed large numbers of such trespassing foreign citizens to stay inside the United States. Homeland security officials regard this population as posing heightened national security, public safety, and health risks.

The Biden government has not taken specific credit for these two consequential changes. But the enticing changes do come after months of American diplomacy with Panama and Mexico and fall in line with the administration’s overarching policy idea for border management that illegal immigration not be stopped so much as rendered “safe, humane, and orderly.”

The administration has certainly lodged no objections to the creation of what amounts to a free-flow corridor from Panama through Mexico. That has included nary a discouraging word on Mexico’s apparent order that its national guard deployment, which Biden’s administration once insisted be maintained, stand down.

The New Darien Gap Short Cut

Starting late last year, a series of investigative stories by major American news outlets drew attention to the largest human flows ever recorded through the exceedingly dangerous Darien Gap. That gap is a lawless 60-mile jungle wilderness that must be crossed from Colombia to reach Panama.

Usually no more than 10,000 mostly single, young, adult male immigrants a year undertook the seven- to 10-day trek to Panama over mountains and across flash-flood-prone rivers. Yet more than 130,000 crossed in the first year after Biden won office to take advantage of exemptions the new president allowed in Title 42 for families with young children, unaccompanied minors, and pregnant women. Much of the recent popular press coverage focused on their deaths, criminal victimizations, and misery.

American diplomacy with Panama followed these stories, culminating in the April signing of a Bilateral Arrangement on Migration and Protection agreement to “improve migration management” by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The agreement is short on specifics, but during the preliminary shuttle diplomacy in February, Panama suddenly established a new sea route.

That route allows smuggling vessels from Colombia full of U.S.-bound foreign nationals to land much further northwest up the Caribbean coast on Panamanian territory. Panamanian coast guard vessels had previously blocked such smugglers. Immigrants landing make their way to the community of Canaan Membrillo. Another route opened up on the Pacific side of Panama to the community of Jaque.

The route to civilization in Panama from the new landings is only a two- or three-day trip over easier terrain through Kuna tribal territory, compared to the old 10-day trek through Embera tribal lands. Francisco Agapi, mayor of 29 villages where the old trail emptied out for years, told me recently that vastly reduced numbers now come through because the immigrants naturally prefer the short route the Panamanian government made possible by allowing the migrant boats to land further north.

The new route, which will almost surely draw higher numbers of migrants from around the world, coincided with a Panamanian border and immigration police operation it called wana humaradá, which means “let’s go with everything” in the Embera language. Its purpose was described as an effort to create a “more controlled migration” and to reduce the loss of life among foreign nationals, Spanish-language media reported.

The significance of Panama establishing the new shorter bypasses is that, while fewer immigrants will probably die getting to Biden’s open door, it formalized the opening of a true superhighway. Such easier, quicker passage will only invite ever more massive volumes of people to pour through from South America and keep going, said the American conflict journalist Chuck Holton, who lives in Panama not far from Darien Province.

“It could easily get to the point where we have as many extra-continentals coming through as we do from the northern triangle countries of Central America,” he said. “They’ll double and double again the number of people coming. They’re talking about facilitation. They’re not talking about deterrence.”

Mexico’s Great Stand-Down

Starting with the Trump administration in 2019 and maintained by Biden, Mexican policy on its southern border with Guatemala was to blockade as many incoming immigrants as possible for at least several months in the city of Tapachula. The government typically would require immigrants to obtain Mexican asylum or other forms of legal permission to be in Mexico — deliberately slow-rolling the processes for months — before they could continue on to the American border with their freshly minted documents, which could be found crumpled on the banks of the Rio Grande. The Mexican slow-roll policy required Mexican national guard roadblocks on dozens of highways in the southern provinces.

But following recent months of American diplomatic activity, Mexico apparently now feels free to issue — as fast as it can — transit visas and 30-day “Multiple Migratory Form” visas to all immigrants entering its territory from Guatemala. They promptly use these to travel straight to the American border for illegal crossings, according to Spanish-language media reporting (here, here, here, here, and here).

First, they obtain seven-day transit visas in Tapachula and then 30-day permits 50 miles north in the town of Huixtla that clears a straight beeline to the American border. This new practice represents a sea change in bilateral immigration management that has drawn no American media coverage I can find.

For the first time since 2019, the Biden administration appears to have released Mexico from its agreement to use its 30,000 national guard soldiers for blockade duty. Starting sometime in late June, Mexico City ordered its soldiers to yield the southern highways, apparently for the first of many caravans on July 1. Soldiers were told to “limit themselves to observing the transit of the caravan, which celebrated with cries of ‘Yes, we can! Yes, we can!’ as participants passed through the former roadblocks.”

By the end of July, at least 16 caravans of various sizes have been allowed to obtain visas in the southern Mexican city of Huixtla and continue on to Texas or Arizona. Now, the Mexican soldiers escort the immigrants to ensure their safety, rather than block any of them. The Mexican journalist Oscar “El Blue” Ramirez has been on the scene in southern Mexico covering the chaos that Mexico’s new open-road policy has wrought.

The Mexican policy was never able to hermetically seal the southern border with Guatemala, far less so under Biden than under Trump, whom Mexico credibly feared would strike the country with massive tariffs for straying. But under Biden, as I have often reported, three or four months of immigrant population buildups would lead to riots and violent disturbances, which would force the government to free tens of thousands at a time in “ant operations” that would disburse them all over northern Mexico for eventual U.S. border crossings.

Now, however, the new agreement frees Mexico of that at least somewhat-deterring pretense and opens the roads north to their widest aperture in years. So many are using it now that complaints have turned from imprisonment in Tapachula to merely long, irritating lines to get the new visas.

Thousands are coming from all over the world, fresh from the new Darien Gap route workarounds. They’re coming in huge numbers, judging by Spanish-language reporting like Oscar Ramirez’s. As Venezuelan Angel Escobar told Noticieros Television on July 23 while waiting in southern Mexico for his quick-pass visa to the American border: “Right now in the United States with President Joe Biden … everyone who goes to the United States has a condition of not being deported and that, then, is what benefited us and now all of us that were in South America and Venezuela and want a better quality of life … we can achieve that.”

With the American southern border in historic collapse amid record-smashing human flows from foreign nationals already, the Biden administration’s role in opening the superhighway qualifies as befuddling but not particularly surprising.

Opening up Darien Gap short-cuts and ending long entrapping delays in southern Mexico squarely hit the Biden administration’s often-stated policy goal of creating “safe, humane, and orderly” migration to the American border. It just should not go unnoted.

Garland Doesn't Care About The Rule Of Law. Ask Hunter Biden,"Attorney General Merrick Garland addressed the FBI’s raid of former President Donald Trump’s Florida residence on Thursday afternoon, three days after the Department of Justice embarked on an unprecedented escalation of its persecution of political opponents.

“Faithful adherence to the rule of law is the bedrock principle of the Justice Department and of our democracy,” Garland said. “Upholding the rule of law means applying the law evenly, without fear or favor. Under my watch, that is precisely what the Justice Department is doing.”

President Joe Biden’s Justice Department, however, has done anything but apply the rule of law “evenly, without fear or favor.” Hunter Biden is Exhibit A.

In September of 2020, Senate investigators published an 87-page report detailing Hunter Biden’s extensive overseas networks with a series of potential conflicts of interest. The investigation included episodes of potentially criminal business activity flagged for the Justice Department such as a six-figure shopping spree financed by Chinese business leaders. The report also unearthed evidence of “organized prostitution and/or human trafficking.”

Records on file with the committee, investigators wrote, “confirm that Hunter Biden sent thousands of dollars to individuals who have either: 1) been involved in transactions consistent with possible human trafficking; 2) an association with the adult entertainment industry; or 3) potential association with prostitution.”

Hunter Biden’s home, however, which was featured in a glossy profile of the president’s son by Vanity Fair last December, has never by raided by federal law enforcement.

One month after lawmakers on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and Senate Treasury Committee published their report, the New York Post published a series of emails from a laptop that had belonged to Hunter Biden and was abandoned at a Delaware repair shop. Beyond unearthing a cache of documents contradicting the president’s claims of never speaking business with his son “or with anyone else,” the computer’s hard drive was full of salacious material of Hunter Biden’s escapades with illicit substances and hookers. In July, the Daily Mail reported that Hunter Biden now may face federal charges for prostitution.

But while charges could be in the pipeline, Hunter Biden’s home has never been raided by law enforcement.

In 2018, the Biden son reportedly bought a firearm that later went missing. When asked by the Firearms Transaction Record (Form 4473) whether he is an “unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance,” Hunter Biden said, “no.”

While it’s unclear whether Hunter was an active user at the time, his record of drug abuse is extensive and consistent, with repeated rehab visits in 2003, 2010, and 2014 for treatment with highly addictive substances. In 2014, Hunter was discharged from the Navy for cocaine use, and according to the New Yorker, he went on another cocaine binge two years later in 2016.

As The Federalist reported last year, “Hunter was … suspected of smoking crack cocaine in a Washington, D.C., strip club in late 2018. He purchased the firearm the same year on Oct. 12.”

Hunter Biden’s home has still never been raided by law enforcement.

On Monday, however, Trump’s 128-room mansion at Mar-a-Lago became the subject of a raid ostensibly over the Presidential Records Act, despite prosecutions under the 1978 law being exceedingly rare. While there are dozens of variables to be considered when determining whether to execute a raid, there has always been far more evidence to initiate a search warrant of Hunter Biden than Donald Trump, even as a DOJ investigation of the Biden’s finances is underway. Yet Trump remains public enemy number one, and his prosecution has remained the top item on Democrats’ policy agenda since he descended the golden escalator in 2015.

If Garland, who admitted Thursday to personally signing off on the warrant to search Trump’s home, applied the law “without fear or favor,” either Monday’s raid would not have been executed, or a raid of Hunter Biden’s residence is on the way.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/08/12/merrick-garland-doesnt-care-about-the-rule-of-law-just-ask-hunter-biden/,2022-08-12
America's Botched Afghanistan Withdrawal Was Biden's Fault,"A year after America’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, no one in the Biden administration has been held accountable, including the person who bears the most responsibility for it: President Joe Biden.

Monday marked the one-year anniversary of the fall of Kabul to the Taliban and the beginning of what was arguably the worst U.S. foreign policy disaster since the fall of Saigon in 1975. In Kabul, the Taliban celebrated by marching in a “Victory Day” parade, holding weapons aloft, waving flags, and shouting “God is great.”

And no wonder — the Taliban won, America lost. If Americans had been in denial about our defeat in Afghanistan, the calamitous U.S. withdrawal last August left no doubt. Images of the chaos that ensued as the Taliban closed in on Kabul shocked the world, perhaps none more so than the throngs of Afghans at the airport, running alongside and clinging to U.S. military aircraft as they took off. Some desperate Afghans held on too long, plunging to their deaths as the Americans flew away.

The falling men of Kabul would come to symbolize America’s abject failure in Afghanistan. Two decades after 9/11, we departed in chaos and confusion, abandoned at least 800 American citizens and tens of thousands of Afghan allies, and left hundreds of billions of dollars worth of military hardware in the hands of the Taliban, our erstwhile enemies who now rule Afghanistan with an iron fist.

When Kabul fell, Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken were on vacation, just as U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ross Wilson had been earlier that summer, when the country was falling apart.

According to a new report on the Afghanistan withdrawal by Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Wilson’s two-week absence that July made it impossible for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to make critical decisions and prepare for a Sept. 11 deadline Biden had arbitrarily imposed for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces and personnel.

The congressional report, according to a recent article by Susan Crabtree of RealClearPolitics, claims Biden and top administration officials lied when they claimed the fall of Kabul came as a surprise, and that they had no choice but to rely on the Taliban for security in the Afghan capital during the U.S. evacuation.

Relying on the Taliban, it turns out, would prove disastrous when a suicide bomber managed to slip past Taliban security checkpoints and kill 13 U.S. soldiers and some 170 Afghans at a Kabul airport gate. The report reveals that those senseless deaths might have been avoided if the Biden administration had accepted an Aug. 15 offer from the Taliban to allow the U.S. military to control security in the capital during the evacuation.

As for the fall of Kabul coming as a surprise to Biden’s White House, the report says Biden and his advisers were warned more than a month in advance that the Afghan government was on the brink of collapse. A mid-July cable from nearly two dozen U.S. personnel stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said the Afghan government and military might quickly collapse amid a U.S. withdrawal, as did a CIA intelligence assessment that summer.

Biden and Blinken ignored it, just as they ignored offers from Guam and Pakistan to provide interim transit centers to help process Afghan interpreters and other evacuees after U.S. air bases in Qatar and Germany had been overwhelmed, according to the report.

Perhaps most notoriously, Biden lied about al-Qaeda being “gone” from Afghanistan (or, as Blinken put it, being reduced to “remnants”). How do we know? Because when U.S. forces recently took out al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, he was living in downtown Kabul. He wasn’t hiding in a cave in the mountains, he was living and working in the heart of Taliban-controlled Afghanistan’s capital city, where he had reportedly relocated with his family only months after the U.S. withdrawal.

This week we’ll hear arguments, pegged to the anniversary of the withdrawal, that it wasn’t really Biden’s fault, that he inherited a war none of his predecessors had the guts to end, that former President Donald Trump left him with an unworkable agreement for withdrawal, that really it was all the fault of the corrupt Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, and the feckless Afghan military.

Certainly, there is blame to go around in America’s decades-long misadventure in Afghanistan. But in the months and even years leading up to last year’s withdrawal, almost no one (except top U.S. generals like Mark Milley) argued we should stay in Afghanistan indefinitely. The question was not, do we get out? But, how do we get out in an orderly way?

By ignoring intelligence on the ground in Afghanistan, failing to make careful preparations months in advance, and ceding control of security in Kabul to the Taliban, among other blunders, Biden turned a challenge into a crisis and a crisis into a catastrophe. And then he lied about it. He is still lying about it. And no one has been held accountable.

And by the way, that doesn’t just describe the Afghanistan withdrawal, it describes almost every major event of the Biden presidency.

Not Just Afghanistan: Incompetence Is All Over Biden Presidency,"Monday marked the one-year anniversary of the fall of Kabul, and even the media machine can’t deny that the Biden administration’s execution of the necessary U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan was disastrous. What they fail to acknowledge, though, is that the rank incompetence that plagued that withdrawal has shown up in practically every hire, decision, and policy position in the Biden administration.

Covid Tyranny

Biden slammed his predecessor for his inability to stop an endemic airborne virus and promised to “get [Covid] under control” and “beat this virus.” Of course, even for a capable administration, that was an impossible task — and under Biden, the Covid toll only grew while freedoms shrunk. Even though the Biden administration oversaw more people receiving (or being forced to receive) shots that had been manufactured under the Trump administration, Biden still presided over more Covid deaths in his first year in office than Trump did in 2020. And as my colleague Eddie Scarry noted, by last September, a majority of U.S. adults reported “little to no trust in Biden to relay accurate information related to COVID-19.”

Covid hysteria has died down as Americans have grown tired of politicians’ lockdowns and media fearmongering — and as the media have found other crises to fan. But it hasn’t been a result of any competent effort by the Biden administration, which spent more than a year getting people fired with heavy-handed mandates and nuking dissent from cyberspace.

Deadly Border Crisis

After the Biden administration signaled a change from the Trump administration’s hardline stance on border security, the human trafficking industry run by cartels at the U.S.-Mexico border has surged. We’ve seen record after record number of illegal immigrants apprehended at the border — a metric that doesn’t even account for those who get through undetected. Horrific footage in September 2021 showing roughly 12,000 migrants in a crowded encampment under the international bridge in Del Rio, Texas, reflected how out-of-control the continuing crisis at the border is. As my colleague Jordan Boyd reported in April, “In 2021, at least 650 migrants died during their attempts to illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border,” many due to drowning, heat, or cartel violence.

A pastor who runs shelters in Matamoros, Mexico, told The Federalist’s John Daniel Davidson and Emily Jashinsky that the cartel “controls everything here now.” The Biden administration has continually shown itself either unwilling, unable, or both, to put an end to the lawless smuggling and the deaths and violence it causes.

Painful Gas Prices

The average gas price in the U.S. hit a new record, north of $5.00 per gallon, in June under Biden’s watch. While the unpopular administration has managed to inch that price down artificially by depleting our strategic oil reserve to dangerously low levels — an “accomplishment” they’re all too willing to brag about — gas prices remain close to $4.00 per gallon, far higher than the roughly $2.39 voters were paying on the day Biden took office. The administration tried its best to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for the spike in fuel costs, but even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a gallon of gas cost more than $3.50 on average around the country.

It’s an intentional repercussion of the Biden administration’s well-known plan to drive the U.S. off of gas and oil and replace those industries with “green” options. Both Biden’s promises and actions have confirmed as much, and Congress’s bizarrely-named “Inflation Reduction Act” will only make things worse.

Spiking Inflation

Speaking of inflation, the Biden administration has overseen inflation breaking 40-year records nearly every month. Year-over-year inflation rates have hovered around 8 and 9 percent, while certain grocery staples have jumped almost 25 percent. And now that the country is barrelling into a recession with two consecutive quarters of downturn in economic activity, the Biden administration’s incompetent response is to redefine a “recession” and insist that inflation is “zero.”

Disaster in Ukraine

The Biden administration hasn’t fixed its post-Afghanistan reputation for foreign policy disaster by its response to the Russia-Ukraine war. In a bumbling jumble of remarks in January, Biden appeared to green-light a “minor incursion” of Russia into Ukraine, before adding, “My guess is [Putin] will move in. He has to do something.” And when a reporter sought clarification and asked, “Are you effectively giving Putin permission to make a small incursion into the country?” Biden replied, “That’s how it did sound like, didn’t it?”

Since Putin invaded Ukraine a month later, the Biden administration and Congress have done nothing but throw money at the problem and stage dramatic photo-ops, spending $54 billion of taxpayers’ earnings with no assurance that money and weapons will even make it into the right hands.

A Roster of Incompetent Hires

At the top of all these fiascos is a dementia patient who can hardly get through a teleprompter speech without a gaffe, such as reading “repeat the line” out loud or forgetting what year it is. And the incompetence doesn’t improve down the chain of command, among officials who seem to have been picked more for checking identity politics boxes than for their qualifications. Vice President Kamala Harris has failed at every policy area she’s been appointed over, and is infamous for thoughtful commentary like, “It is time for us to do what we have been doing and that time is every day.”

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose qualifications included enjoying the board game “Ticket to Ride,” took two months off for paternity leave while the nation endured a supply-chain crisis. Secretary of State Antony Blinken wouldn’t even admit whether the president knew what was going on during the Afghanistan withdrawal debacle, and posed in front of an upside-down Mexican flag in February 2021 when bragging about America’s relationship with Mexico.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm couldn’t tell reporters “how many barrels of oil the U.S. consumes on a daily basis,” and called a question about increasing U.S. oil production to bring down gas prices “hilarious.” And Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has responded to a largely softball press corps by talking about the “Department of DOJ” and looking at her briefing book for more than 20 seconds only to admit “I don’t have anything new” when asked about the baby formula shortage in June.

From intentional “failure” (like driving gas prices up in an attempt to force Americans to follow Democrats’ green pipe dreams) to arrogance (such as thinking Americans either won’t care or won’t be able to do anything about it), even the Biden administration’s intentional decisions are executed with incompetence. Unfortunately, the botched Afghanistan withdrawal one year ago was neither the only nor the last sign of it.

Biden's Iran Appeasement Has Always Been About His Legacy,"President Joe Biden is considering whether to grant Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, a known mass murderer and human rights abuser, a visa request in order for the Iranian leader to enter the U.S. and speak at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly meeting in New York next month.

As the Associated Press reported, Raisi is among the nearly 160 world leaders who “say they plan to attend September’s first totally in-person gathering” at the UN General Assembly “since the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020,” with additional leaders on the provisional list of speakers including “U.S. President Joe Biden, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, [and] King Abdullah II of Jordan,” among many others.

“[I]t’s clear from the provisional speakers list released [on July 18] that over 80% of leaders of the U.N.’s 193 member nations want to address the annual gathering in person and engage in many of the off-the-record meetings and conversations where a lot of international business is conducted,” the report reads.

In light of Raisi’s purported plans to attend the upcoming summit, a delegation of Republican senators comprised of Marco Rubio and Rick Scott of Florida, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, Ted Cruz of Texas, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and Tom Cotton of Arkansas has since pressured Biden to deny the Iranian leader a visa to enter the U.S., with the group highlighting Raisi’s horrendous human rights record and the Iranian regime’s recent efforts to assassinate U.S. officials.

“Raisi’s involvement in mass murder and the Iranian regime’s campaign to assassinate U.S. officials on American soil make allowing Raisi and his henchmen to enter our country an inexcusable threat to national security,” the senators wrote in a letter. “If recent reports are true that Raisi plans to attend the UN General Assembly, the White House must deny Raisi and other Iranian officials visas to attend. Allowing Raisi to travel to the United States—while his agents actively work to assassinate senior American officials on U.S. soil—would gravely endanger our national security, given the likely presence of [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] agents in the Iranian delegation.”

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who along with former National Security Adviser John Bolton were targets of Iranian assassination plots, issued similar remarks, telling the Washington Free Beacon that the Biden administration “is allowing [Iranian terrorits] to come to New York City while actively engaged in efforts to kill Americans on U.S. soil.”

“The Iranians just recently sponsored an attack that was almost successful in killing an American in [New York],” he said referencing the apparent Iranian assassination attempt on British author Salman Rushdie. “We can do better.”

Back in 2019, Raisi was among numerous Iranian government officials sanctioned by the Trump administration “for advancing Iran’s radical agenda.” During his time as the head of Iran’s judiciary, Raisi held “administrative oversight over the executions of individuals who were juveniles at the time of their crime,” as well as the “torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of prisoners in Iran, including amputations.”

When pressed by The Federalist on whether the administration plans to grant Raisi and his delegation visas to enter the United States, a Biden State Department official declined to provide a definitive answer on the matter, claiming that “visa records are confidential under U.S. law” and that the United States must fulfill its previously made commitments to the UN.

“As host nation of the UN, the United States is generally obligated under the UN Headquarters Agreement to facilitate travel to the UN headquarters district by representatives of UN member states. We take our obligations under the UN Headquarters Agreement seriously,” the representative said. “At the same time, the Biden Administration has not and will not waver in protecting and defending all Americans against threats of violence and terrorism.”

As noted in the agreement cited by the administration, however, the United States retains the authority to protect its national security.

“Nothing in the [UN Headquarters] agreement shall be construed as in any way diminishing, abridging, or weakening the right of the United States to safeguard its own security and completely to control the entrance of aliens into any territory of the United States other than the headquarters district and its immediate vicinity,” the document reads.

Biden Caters to Iran

While Biden’s refusal to bar Raisi from entering the U.S. is foolish, it’s not surprising. Since taking office over a year and a half ago, Biden and his team have repeatedly worked to appease Iran’s authoritarian leadership as a means of coercing Tehran into signing a new nuclear deal.

Earlier this year, for instance, the Biden administration notified Congress that it had “restored so-called ‘civ-nuke’ waivers,” on Iran, which would allow for “non-American companies to work on civilian nuclear projects” in the Middle Eastern country “without drawing retaliation from the US government.” Moreover, the administration also reportedly took action in October 2021 to lift sanctions on two Iranian entities “involved in the military missile programs.”

As reported by The Hill, “The sanctions, targeting the Mammut Industrial Group (Mammut Industries) and its subsidiary Mammut Diesel, were originally imposed by the Trump administration in September 2020 as part of efforts to increase a maximum pressure campaign of sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear activity and actions in the region criticized as malign and destabilizing.”

Personal Legacy over Security

While it’s not shocking for Biden to make a major foreign policy blunder given his disastrous presidency thus far, the reckless push for a new Iran deal reeks of something different than simply pure incompetence. For Biden, the rabid obsession with securing a new nuclear agreement — no matter its efficacy in containing Iran’s push for nuclear weapons — isn’t based on global security so much as it is his personal legacy.

Unlike his predecessor, who brought peace in the Middle East through numerous treaties between Arab states, Biden’s foreign policy in the region has been a complete disaster. In addition to his appeasement of Iran, Biden also botched the United States’ withdrawal from Afghanistan, leaving behind hundreds of American citizens and billions of dollars worth of military equipment for the Taliban to use against the Afghan people.

For Biden, getting Iran to sign on to a new nuclear deal would mean covering up his failure in Afghanistan and stamping his name in the textbooks of history as the president who managed to tame the beast of the Middle East known as Iran. Like any other policy issued by the Biden administration, it doesn’t matter how effective any new deal would be at stopping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, or whether Tehran would abide by such an agreement. So long as he gives the appearance of “doing something,” it seems Biden couldn’t care less what the long-term effect of any deal is.

At the end of the day, the lesson for Iran is this: You can plot to assassinate U.S. officials, fund terrorism across the globe, threaten to wipe Israel off the map, and Joe Biden still might roll out the red carpet for you at the United Nations to spew anti-Western propaganda for the world to hear.

Why Zuckerberg's Admission Of FBI Election Meddling Is Huge,"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s admission last week that the FBI pushed the social media giant to censor Russian misinformation — and thus the Hunter Biden laptop story, as that’s how the agency and Democrats characterized it — shortly before the November 2020 election is but a breadcrumb of a bigger scandal: the widespread interference by the FBI in the 2020 presidential election with the potential that the bureau coordinated its efforts with the Biden campaign.

When asked during a Thursday podcast with Joe Rogan how Facebook handles controversial news, such as the Hunter Biden laptop story, Zuckerberg stopped his host to provide a backdrop to Facebook’s decision to decrease distribution of the scandal.

“The FBI basically came to us, some folks on our team, [saying,] ‘Hey just so you know, you should be on high alert,” Zuckerberg told Rogan. According to Zuckerberg, the bureau told Facebook that “we thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election” and that “we have it on notice that basically there’s about to be some kind of dump similar to that so just be vigilant.”

As Zuckerberg told “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast audience, “Hey, look, if the FBI — which I still view as a legitimate institution in this country, it’s a very professional law enforcement — they come to us and tell us we need to be on guard about something, I want to take that seriously.” So, when the New York Post broke the Hunter Biden laptop story on October 14, 2020, Facebook treated the story as “potentially misinformation, important misinformation” for five to seven days while the tech giant’s team could determine whether it was false.

During that time, Facebook decreased its distribution of the story by making the story rank lower in the news feed. “You could still share it, you could still consume it,” Zuckerberg explained, but “fewer people saw it than would have otherwise.” And while he would not quantify the impact, the Facebook founder said the decreased distribution was “meaningful.”

In a follow-up, Rogan asked if the FBI had specifically said “to be on guard about that story,” meaning the laptop story. After originally responding, “no,” Zuckerberg corrected himself, saying, “I don’t remember if it was that specifically, but it basically fit the pattern.”

Whether the FBI identified the Hunter Biden laptop story as the about-to-drop Russian misinformation, however, is irrelevant because the warning the bureau provided Facebook proved specific enough for the Big Tech company to censor distribution of the New York Post’s story. And, contrary to fake intel the FBI provided Facebook’s team, the laptop was not Russian disinformation but a true and devastating story showing Joe Biden had lied to the American public when he claimed in September of 2019 that he had never discussed his son’s foreign business dealings. Information on the laptop further implicated the Democrat presidential candidate in a pay-to-play scandal involving Russia, Ukraine, and China.

The implications flowing from Zuckerberg’s revelation are huge and raise a litany of questions that demand answers.

We Need Answers

First, it is implausible to believe Facebook is the only Big Tech company contacted by the FBI with a warning about Russian disinformation and the bureau’s expectation being that tech executives would then censor the Biden scandal. Rather, it is only reasonable to believe the FBI issued similar false warnings to Twitter and other outlets.

And while Facebook only limited distribution, Twitter completely censored the story, preventing it from being shared at all on the platform. Twitter also temporarily locked Trump’s campaign account to prevent the then-president from sharing the laptop story and suspended the New York Post’s account.

Did the FBI’s warning prompt Twitter’s censorship as it had Facebook’s? What other Big Tech companies did the FBI contact to paint the Hunter Biden laptop story as misinformation? What network and cable news outlets received a similar message? What about print and legacy media companies? Who within the FBI issued the warnings? With whose knowledge? With whose authorization? Or by whose directive?

A second component to the scandal concerns the FBI’s interactions (or lack thereof) with the Biden campaign. According to John Paul Mac Isaac, the owner of the Delaware laptop repair shop where Hunter Biden abandoned his laptop in mid-2019, the former’s father approached the FBI on October 8, 2019, on his behalf to alert the FBI to the laptop’s existence. During that meeting, Isaac’s father claimed he told the agent there was pornography on the laptop as well as information about “dealing with foreign interests, a pay-for-play scheme linked to the former administration, lots of foreign money.”

Isaac’s father left the local FBI office believing the bureau was uninterested in the laptop, but then two months later, in December of 2019, two federal agents appeared at Isaac’s Wilmington repair store with a subpoena and seized the laptop. Isaac had previously made a copy of the hard drive, however, and later provided the copy to Rudy Giuliani who, in turn, gave a copy to the New York Post, prompting the stories the FBI then tried to censor by falsely flagging it as Russian disinformation.

What the FBI did with the laptop after taking possession of it remains unknown, although FBI whistleblowers now claim that “local FBI leadership told employees ‘you will not look at that Hunter Biden laptop.’” Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson revealed the whistleblowers’ claims in a letter he sent to the inspector general of the Department of Justice last week. That letter further stated that the “whistleblowers allege that the FBI did not begin to examine the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop until after the 2020 presidential election — potentially a year after the FBI obtained the laptop in December 2019.”

If, as the whistleblowers allege, the FBI did not review the content of Biden’s laptop until after the 2020 presidential election, that constitutes yet another scandal because from what Isaac’s father conveyed to the agent in October of 2019, the laptop represented a national security threat.

The FBI and the intelligence community cannot possibly defend the country from threats if it blinds itself to what those threats are. Nor could the intelligence community properly provide Joe Biden with a defensive briefing if agents remained ignorant of the content of the laptop. And as I previously reported, that content included the revelation by Hunter Biden that he believed Russians had stolen a second laptop with material that put him at risk for blackmail. So if the whistleblowers’ claims prove true, the FBI and the intelligence community put the election of Joe Biden above America’s national security.

Either way, the FBI lied to Facebook and presumptively Twitter and many other media outlets. If the FBI had analyzed the laptop, it knew it was not Russian disinformation; if agents had not yet assessed the material, it had no basis to claim it was Russian disinformation.

What Did the Big Guy Know?

The question remains, though: What did the FBI tell Joe Biden about the laptop?

While it would be completely inappropriate for the FBI to bury the laptop and withhold a defensive briefing from the Democrat presidential candidate, it is possible the FBI took that tack to provide Biden with plausible deniability. But once the FBI knew the story was about to break, what did the bureau do, besides lying to Big Tech companies that the story represented Russian disinformation?

And we know from the Post’s October 14, 2020, story on the Hunter Biden laptop that the FBI had foreknowledge of the Post’s plan to run the story, as did Hunter Biden and the Biden campaign. “The FBI referred questions about its seizure of the laptop and hard drive to the Delaware US Attorney’s Office, where a spokesperson said, ‘My office can neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation,’” the Post reported. The Post added that “Hunter Biden’s lawyer refused to comment on the specifics but instead attacked Giuliani,” and “the Joe Biden campaign did not return requests for comment.”

After the Post reached out to the FBI and Biden for comment on the story, did the FBI tell Biden how it came to possess Hunter’s laptop and that it appeared legitimate? Or did agents lie to Biden?

Here, a comment Biden made in crosstalk during his October 22, 2020, presidential debate with Trump in Nashville proves intriguing.

After Biden intoned that the election was about the character of the country, Trump countered, “If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck — if this is true, then he’s a corrupt politician. So don’t give me the stuff about how you’re this innocent baby. Joe, they’re calling you a corrupt politician.”

“It’s the laptop from hell, the laptop from hell,” Trump continued.

Biden initially countered by pointing to the “50 former national intelligence folks who said that what this, he’s accusing me of is a Russian plan.” “Four, five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage,” Biden claimed.

“You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?” Trump barked.

At this point, the crosstalk escalated, but Biden could be heard saying, “That’s exactly what — that’s exactly what I was told.”

Was Biden lying? Or did someone tell Biden that the laptop was Russian disinformation? Did the FBI and intelligence community lie to the Democrat candidate about the authenticity of the laptop, rather than provide Joe Biden with a proper defensive briefing? If so, who lied? Who knew of the lie? Who approved the lie or directed it?

And what about Hunter? Did Biden ask his son about the laptop? What did Hunter say? Did Biden know the FBI was lying about it being disinformation and just go along with that narrative?

These questions barely scratch the surface, with more serious questions concerning whether the FBI plotted with the Biden campaign to push the Russian disinformation narrative and to seek censorship of the story. And before writing that off as a crazy conspiracy theory, remember that it was Zuckerberg — the Zuck Bucks king — who revealed that the FBI had approached him and warned that the about-to-be dumped story was Russian disinformation. So we know the FBI holds responsibility for pushing the disinformation canard to Big Tech, we just don’t know whether agents coordinated the plan with the Biden campaign.

A review of contemporaneous reporting also reveals that the intelligence community pushed the Russia disinformation narrative through leaks to the New York Times and Washington Post.

The same day the story broke, in reporting on the Hunter Biden laptop article published by the Post, the New York Times reported that “some security experts expressed skepticism about the provenance and authenticity of the emails,” citing “United States intelligence analysts.”

According to the Times, American intelligence analysts had contacted Burisma — the Ukrainian energy company at which Hunter served a lucrative gig on the board of directors — to learn more about a purported hack of Burisma by “the same Russian GRU unit that was one of two groups that hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016.” The Times reported that the intelligence analysts “had picked up chatter that stolen Burisma emails would be leaked in the form of an ‘October surprise.’”

Citing its American intelligence sources, the Times then claimed that “among their chief concerns … was that the Burisma material would be leaked alongside forged materials in an attempt to hurt Mr. Biden’s candidacy — as Russian hackers did when they dumped real emails alongside forgeries ahead of the 2017 French elections — a slight twist on Russia’s 2016 playbook when they siphoned leaked D.N.C. emails through fake personas on Twitter and WikiLeaks.”

The speed with which the New York Times spun the Hunter Biden laptop story, and the assist by the unnamed “U.S. intelligence analysts” suggests a coordinated effort by individuals in the intelligence community to protect Biden’s candidacy by framing the New York Post’s coverage as Russian disinformation.

Less than a week after the New York Post broke the laptop story, the Washington Post likewise bolstered the disinformation narrative based on FBI leaks. “What’s more, numerous news outlets have now reported that the FBI is examining whether the material from Hunter Biden (which supposedly includes salacious stuff) is linked to a Russian disinformation effort,” the Washington Post reported on October 20, 2020, adding that “intelligence officials had previously warned that Giuliani is a conduit for such disinformation.”

The FBI and U.S. intelligence analysts’ peddling of the Russia disinformation narrative to the New York Times and Washington Post further expands the deep state’s culpability in interfering in the 2020 election and also leads to more questions.

Who provided the media outlets with leaks to spin the Hunter Biden laptop scandal as Russian disinformation? Who knew of the leaks, and who approved them or directed them? And did the FBI and intelligence community coordinate with the Biden campaign in pushing the Russia disinformation narrative to the legacy media?

How Deep Does the Corruption Go?

Other questions concern what prompted “more than 50 former senior intelligence officials” to sign “on to a letter outlining their belief that the recent disclosure of emails allegedly belonging to Joe Biden’s son ‘has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.’” Did the FBI or other members of the intelligence community help coordinate that letter?

Given the FBI took the initiative to prompt Facebook and almost certainly other media outlets to censor the Hunter Biden story, it’s entirely reasonable to think the same deep-state liars would round up former members of the cabal to sign the letter to further the disinformation narrative.

If so, did Joe Biden or his campaign know about the efforts? Or did the Biden campaign merely exploit what the FBI was doing behind the scenes?

And make no mistake, even if Biden’s team did not conspire with the FBI to cause the censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story, it exploited the FBI’s gratuitous interference in the election, with the Biden campaign pointing to social media’s censorship as proof that the story was disinformation.

“Well, look, I think Twitter’s response to the actual article itself makes clear these reported allegations are false and are not true, and I’m glad to see social media companies to take responsibility to limit misinformation,” campaign press secretary Jamal Brown said shortly after the story broke.

Biden likewise hid behind the spin pushed by the 50-plus former national intelligence agents that framed the laptop as Russian disinformation, as demonstrated by his debate performance highlighted above.

Whether Biden coordinated with those former deep-staters, or they conspired with the FBI, merits investigation as well because, at the end of the day, the burying of the Hunter Biden laptop story cost Trump the election.

As the Washington Times reported earlier this year after the New York Times belatedly acknowledged the authenticity of the laptop: “Trump pollster John McLaughlin found that 4.6% of Biden voters would have changed their minds if they had known about it, easily enough to flip results in key states. Another survey by The Polling Company showed that even more Biden voters in seven swing states — 17% — would have switched their votes if they had been aware of the laptop and other stories.”

Those poll results confirmed what many conservatives had long thought — that by censoring the laptop story and the Biden family’s pay-to-play scandal, Big Tech stole the election from Donald Trump.

But Zuckerberg’s admission on Thursday that Big Tech throttled the story at the behest of the FBI reveals a deeper scandal: It was the FBI and not social media that stole the election from Donald Trump.

Biden Created The Student Debt Crisis He's Pretending To Fix,"There’s a lot that’s wrong with Biden’s student debt forgiveness plan — morally, economically, and legally. The plan is fundamentally unfair; many experts think it will be inflationary, and it’s almost surely illegal under Supreme Court case law. But that’s not the whole story: As a senator in 2005, Joe Biden pushed changes in bankruptcy law on behalf of the credit card industry that helped precipitate the student debt crisis.

Pre-Biden Bankruptcy Laws

There is indeed a student debt crisis. About 45 million Americans owe something like $1.6 trillion in student loans. Most of the debt is owed to the government. But a sizeable chunk (about 8 percent) is owed to private lenders.

In general, borrowers burdened by too much debt and unable to pay their loans can usually discharge them in a personal bankruptcy case. Some debts, particularly those owed to the government, are not dischargeable. But consumer loans and credit card debts generally are dischargeable. Before 2005, young people who were overwhelmed by student loans from private lenders were able to get relief by filing for bankruptcy. Even student loans from the government had been dischargeable before 1976, though that was later changed.

The upside of bankruptcy for the debtor is that the slate is wiped clean. But there’s a major downside to bankruptcy: Your credit rating is shattered. You’re a proven bad risk, and if lenders deal with you at all in the future, they’re likely to demand high-interest rates or substantial collateral or both. But that’s just as it should be: You shouldn’t be able to walk away from your debts and stiff your creditors with no consequences at all. Fear of being branded a bad risk is a healthy incentive either not to borrow too much or to pay up if you can.

Biden Protecting the Banks

Those were the normal rules and incentives before Biden led a group of 18 Democrat senators in supporting changes in the bankruptcy law in 2005. One of those changes barred most student debtors from being able to discharge their private loans. (Congress left a tiny loophole for some student borrowers, but it wasn’t available to the vast majority.) Biden was an enthusiastic supporter of the legislation, voting for it four times before its final passage in 2005.

This kind of protection for lenders is exceptional; in general, private consumer debt can be discharged. The legislation Biden wanted was a sweetheart deal for the banks that stripped student loans of bankruptcy protections. And it led to a train wreck: Students borrowed too much, couldn’t find the kind of employment that would let them pay off their loans, and began to buckle under the strain. Student debt tripled in the decade after 2005; more than 1 million people were defaulting on their student loans every year.

Worst off were the student borrowers who had been suckered into attending colleges whose programs couldn’t lead to good jobs, and who dropped out of college saddled with debt to take low-paid work at Starbucks.

Biden’s Debts to the Financiers

Why did Biden staunchly back this change — even as Democrats like Teddy Kennedy denounced it for “sacrific[ing] Americans to the rampant greed of the credit card industry”? Because Biden was a long-time water carrier for the credit card and banking industries. And both he and his family profited from that arrangement.

Biden has long had mutually rewarding ties to the financial services sector, (as do many members of his Cabinet and others in his inner circle). In the 2003-2008 Senate electoral cycle, Biden received more than $500,000 from credit card companies, financial services, and banks. For decades, he was especially close to the credit card company MBNA (now part of Bank of America) — so much so, that he felt obliged to say in 1999, “I’m not the Senator from MBNA.” Like so much else that Biden says, this was false.

For over 20 years, MBNA was Biden’s largest contributor. MBNA hired Hunter Biden straight out of law school, made him an executive, and retained his services for five years after his departure — for an undisclosed sum — as a “consultant.” So during the years when Biden was backing and voting for a bill that enriched corporate lenders and screwed over student borrowers, Hunter was still on MBNA’s payroll.

The reckoning has come 17 years later. As president, Biden had to do something to fix the problem that Biden as senator had helped to create. Hence, the giveaway of $500 billion. And Biden’s loan forgiveness does absolutely nothing to make things better — in particular, nothing to bring the exorbitant cost of higher ed down, or improve its quality, or steer young people into careers that will let them build better lives, enjoy higher incomes, and contribute more to society without a huge overhang of debt.

A Better Plan

If Biden had considered the public interest, he could have proposed a plan to Congress that would have enabled student borrowers — whether in debt to the government or private lenders — to discharge their debts in bankruptcy, at least if they had paid, say, seven years’ worth of loans. This would have returned the student loan program to something more like its earlier incarnation.

Yes, it would have cost the government, i.e. taxpayers, hundreds of billions, but probably less than the plan he adopted. By requiring that the student has paid off the loan for several years before being able to shed the rest, it would have prevented the worst abuses. It would have created an incentive to continue payments on the loan because bankruptcy damages the borrower’s credit rating.

So some of those whom Biden’s program benefited — likely the ones best able to shoulder their payments — would likely not have chosen bankruptcy. On the other hand, the borrowers in greatest distress would have taken advantage of the opportunity. And if Congress enacted these changes, their legality would have been unassailable. But no, this could have hurt the banks. So rather than trying to repair his past mistakes, Biden chose the quick and dirty but less effective fix.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/09/01/how-senator-biden-helped-create-the-student-debt-crisis-president-biden-is-trying-to-fix/,2022-09-01
Biden’s Declaration Of War On Half The Country Is An Election Ploy,"President Joe Biden went to Philadelphia Thursday night to deliver what is, in effect, the kickoff and the keynote address for the Democratic Party’s midterm election campaign.

The speech he delivered was gobsmackingly dishonest and profoundly irresponsible in that its goal was to, in effect, burn the country down in order to preserve his party’s congressional majorities. It was also the sort of overproduced tribute to a leader’s vanity with dramatic lighting and Marine guards deployed in the background, a visual message that diverges from the humble boy from Scranton that Biden pretends to be.

His weasel-worded attempt to differentiate between good Republicans and MAGA extremists who are presumably guilty of what amounts to treason falls flat when you consider that the overwhelming majority of Republicans — not to mention the 74 million people who voted for Trump in 2020 — still support him and, as polls show, would still vote for him again over Biden. So, yes, he was talking about treating half the country as enemies of democracy.

In fact, it is the Democrats who are waging war on free speech and weaponizing the Department of Justice to settle scores with political opponents with their partisan investigations of the Jan. 6 Capital riot and the raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home. His claim that Trump supporters are the ones threatening violence is given the lie by the fact that it was Democrats who cheered on a summer of violent Black Lives Matter riots and, doubtless, would do so again if it served their political purposes.

And given that it was uttered in front of Independence Hall, the shrine of the republic’s origins, its disingenuous effort to demonize opponents and undermine the fabric of democracy in what he claimed was its defense, was also an act of partisan desecration.

But for all of the speech’s offensive nature and the transparent mendacity of Biden’s claims, it might also go down as one of the more astute strategic decisions in the history of American politics.

Like every incumbent going into his first midterms with control of both Houses of Congress, Biden has every reason to expect a shellacking in November. That was going to be exacerbated by the fact that his administration has been a shambles from its first moments.

Many conservatives are fond of dismissing Biden as a much diminished if not senile old man who is unfit for office. But whatever the truth about his state of mind, the political tactics he is now employing are not stupid.

To the contrary, faced with a losing hand, Biden is doing the only thing that might avert a catastrophic loss by overturning the table. In branding his political opponents as not merely misguided but as “semi-fascists” and opponents of democracy, he is seeking to turn back the clock to 2020 when he could pretend that he would bring normalcy and unity to a country wracked by polarization, the pandemic and tired of Trump’s antics.

In doing so Biden has changed the subject from his own misrule. What Democrats are attempting to do is an attempt to turn the midterms into a referendum on the party out of power rather than the one that has been running the country for the last two years.

Can this work? Logic would dictate that most voters care more about the economy and the toll that Biden’s inflation and misguided energy policy has taken on their personal finances and ability to feed their families than his rants about a mythical war on democracy from the right.

Though Democrats have spent the last 20 months trying to make the Capitol riot into a permanent disqualifying argument against Republicans, that didn’t save Biden from record unpopularity as his administration lurched from disaster to disaster.

But even if the Mar-a-Lago raid was an act worthy of a banana republic and the likelihood of a bogus indictment of Trump on a ginned-up charge about classified documents reflects the Democrats’ belief that taking down their opponent requires treating him as if he were a mafia don rather than a president, all this has changed the political conversation in the country. It has also given Biden a slight boost in the polls even if his approval rating is still deep under water.

Republicans have rightly risen up to register their outrage. They can remind voters that the Obama White House, the security establishment and the Hillary Clinton campaign attempted what was, in effect, a soft coup that sought to overturn the 2016 election results via the Russia collusion hoax. They can also point to revelations about how the FBI was used to pressure Facebook to silence discussion of Biden family corruption during the 2020 election and the White House doing the same to Twitter to deplatform skeptics of administration covid policy like Alex Berenson. Whatever you might think about Republicans who believe the 2020 election was stolen, it has been the Democrats and their deep state, corporate media and Big Tech accomplices who have been undermining democracy.

But so long as the discussion is about whether Republicans are fascists and if it’s okay to treat a former president like a criminal who must be presumed guilty of just about anything you can imagine, we’re not discussing the economy, inflation, Biden’s abandonment of the working class or the woke racist and gender ideology indoctrination that is flipping many voters from blue to red.

Biden thinks that with enough help from the DOJ and the media, the midterms will hinge on opinions about Donald Trump. That may not be a guarantee of Democratic victory but neither is it a formula for a red wave.

Republicans must remind the country about what a disaster Biden has been and speak about what they stand for in terms of conservative ideas and values, as MAGA Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are articulating. The alternative is to gamble the country’s future on a bet that Biden is more than willing to take.

7 Bombshells From Special Master Order Following Trump Raid,"A federal judge on Monday granted former President Donald Trump’s request for the appointment of a special master to review the documents seized by the FBI during a raid on his Mar-a-Lago home last month. Presiding Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, further held that the Department of Justice cannot review or use for criminal investigative purposes any material seized pending the review process.

Besides handing Trump a victory in his battle for some oversight of the Biden administration’s digging into his documents, Cannon highlighted several significant facts over the course of her 24-page order that further call into question the DOJ’s targeting of Trump.

Here are the seven top-line takeaways:

1. President Biden Was Directly Involved

In the order granting Trump’s request for the appointment of a special master, Cannon began by providing a summary of the backdrop that led to the search. Throughout 2021, Trump and the National Archives and Records Administration (“NARA”), “engaged in conversations concerning records from [Trump’s] time in office,” the court noted. Those discussions resulted in Trump in January 2022 transferring 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago to NARA. NARA subsequently informed the Department of Justice that some items in the boxes contained markings of “classified national security information.”

Following the archive’s outreach to the Justice Department, NARA notified Trump on April 12, 2022, that it intended to provide the 15 boxes to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Trump’s attorneys sought a delay in the transfer to assess whether any documents contained privileged material. But then, as Cannon wrote, after obtaining a short delay, on May 10, 2022, NARA informed Trump it would proceed with “provid[ing] the FBI access to the records in question, as requested by the incumbent President, beginning as early as Thursday, May 12, 2022.”

In including this quote in her order, Cannon cited the letter the NARA’s acting archivist sent to Trump’s lawyer. That letter explained that Biden had decided to defer to the archivist’s “determination, in consultation with the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, regarding whether or not [the archivist] should uphold the former President’s purported ‘protective assertion of executive privilege.’” Acting Archivist Debra Steidel Wall then explained in the letter that based on her consultation with the assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, she had decided not to honor Trump’s claim of privilege.

While the media has previously highlighted those aspects of the letter, Monday’s order highlighted a key sentence in that same letter that went less noticed by the press: “NARA will provide the FBI access to the records in question, as requested by the incumbent President, beginning as early as Thursday, May 12, 2022” (emphasis added).

This language indicates that Biden did not merely defer to the NARA but asked the NARA to give the documents to the FBI. Of course, deferring to the NARA’s judgment equated to Biden authorizing the hand-off to the FBI, but this passage suggests a more direct connection between Biden and the investigation into Trump.

2. Timeline of the Trump Targeting Is Suspect

A second significant detail revealed by Monday’s order concerns the timeline of events, which the court exposed by providing a clear chronology. On May 10, 2022, the archivist informed Trump’s lawyers that the “NARA will provide the FBI access to the records in question, as requested by the incumbent President, beginning as early as Thursday, May 12, 2022.” And on May 11, 2022, before the DOJ received possession of the 15 boxes from NARA, the DOJ “obtained a grand jury subpoena,” for “[a]ny and all documents or writings in the custody or control of Donald J. Trump and/or the Office of Donald J. Trump bearing classification markings.”

But why would the DOJ seek a grand jury subpoena for any and all documents in Trump’s possession bearing classification markings before reviewing the material provided by the NARA? And given that the DOJ obtained the subpoena the day after the NARA told Trump’s lawyer “the incumbent President” had requested the archive provide the documents to the FBI, one must ask: Did Biden direct the DOJ to obtain the grand jury subpoena?

3. Not So Fast Joe — Trump’s Executive Privilege Can’t Be So Quickly Sidestepped

Another important detail from Monday’s order concerned the court’s handling of Trump’s request for a review of the seized material to address issues of “executive privilege.” In opposing Trump’s request for a special master, the Biden administration argued that Trump lacked the right to assert “executive privilege” against the current executive branch. The court concluded that the Biden administration’s “position arguably overstates the law,” noting that the Supreme Court has not “rule[d] out the possibility of a former President overcoming an incumbent President on executive privilege matters.”

“Further, just this year,” Cannon continued, “the Supreme Court noted that, at least in connection with a congressional investigation, ‘[t]he questions whether and in what circumstances a former President may obtain a court order preventing disclosure of privileged records from his tenure in office, in the face of a determination by the incumbent President to waive the privilege, are unprecedented and raise serious and substantial concerns.’” To protect former President Trump’s ability to raise a question of executive privilege, then, a special master should review the documents and make an initial assessment, the court concluded.

This analysis tees up the possibility that Trump will later assert executive privilege, prompting a showdown with the Biden administration.

4. Members of the Investigative Team Saw Confidential Attorney-Client Documents

While the Biden administration had not reviewed the seized documents to assess any potential executive privilege concerns, a Privilege Review Team had screened the material to determine if it is protected by attorney-client privilege. Because it had already screened the material, the government objected to the appointment of a special master to conduct “another round of screening,” arguing in essence, that such screening would be “unnecessary.”

“The Court takes a different view on this record,” Cannon explained in rejecting the government’s argument. The court then stressed that the evidence suggests the Privilege Review Team’s initial screening for potentially privileged material was faulty.

“The Privilege Review Team’s Report references at least two instances in which members of the Investigative Team were exposed to material that was then delivered to the Privilege Review Team and, following another review, designated as potentially privileged material,” Cannon noted. “Those instances alone, even if entirely inadvertent, yield questions about the adequacy of the filter review process.”

The federal judge further expressed concern about the fact that “the Filter Review Team’s Report does not indicate that any steps were taken after these instances of exposure to wall off the two tainted members of the Investigation Team,” with the “tainted members” being the ones who had seen the material presumed protected by attorney-client privilege.

While a special master cannot address the issue of the “tainted members” on the investigative team, the court’s highlighting of the problem will likely push the DOJ to keep those agents away from any related part of the investigation. But what the special master can do is review the documents and determine if others were protected by attorney-client privilege. If so, the DOJ will have bigger problems.

5. DOJ Seized a Lot of Personal Material

Another revelation from Monday’s order concerned the amount of personal material the FBI seized. “The Government’s inventory reflects a seizure of approximately 11,000 documents and 1,800 other items from Plaintiff’s residence,” the court wrote. Of the material seized, the court said approximately 100 documents contained classification markings. But the FBI also seized some 500 pages of material potentially protected by attorney-client privilege, medical documents, correspondence related to taxes, and accounting information.

Further, as the court noted, “the Government also has acknowledged that it seized some “[p]ersonal effects without evidentiary value.” And “some of the seized items (e.g., articles of clothing)” were “readily identifiable as personal property.” The FBI had also seized three of Trump’s passports, but those items have already been returned to the former president.

That the FBI seized Trump’s passports, articles of clothing, medical records, and accounting and tax documents during the raid of Mar-a-Lago highlights both the breadth (and lack of particularity) of the search warrant and the potential for the Biden administration to use the search as a fishing expedition.

6. FBI Suggested Trump Committed a Crime by Returning a Torn-Up Document to the NARA

The sixth revelation came not directly from the court’s opinion but from the government filings referenced in Monday’s order and specifically the DOJ’s response brief in opposition to Trump’s request for the appointment of a special master.

In its response brief, the government wrote that on February 9, 2022, the special agent in charge of NARA’s Office of the Inspector General made a referral of Trump to the DOJ. The government further explained that “the NARA Referral was made on two bases: evidence that classified records had been stored at the Premises until mid-January 2022, and evidence that certain pages of Presidential records had been torn up. Related to the second concern, the NARA Referral included a citation to 18 U.S.C. § 2071.”

This passage proves intriguing for two reasons. First, it appears the special agent in charge made a criminal referral of the former president because documents Trump had returned to the archivist had been torn up at some point. This reference screams “witch hunt,” which leads to the second point: The unredacted portions of the search warrant affidavit omit any reference to the torn documents.

Rather, the unredacted portions of the search warrant affidavit speak of the government “conducting a criminal investigation concerning the improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces, as well as the unlawful concealment or removal of government records.” The affidavit continues by noting that “the investigation began as a result of a referral the United States National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) sent to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) on February 9, 2022,” which “were reported by NARA to contain, among other things, highly classified documents intermingled with other records.”

None of the unsealed portions of the affidavit reference the second basis for the referral — that Trump returned torn documents. Maybe such references were black-out, but if so, the DOJ lacked a solid reason for the redactions given they revealed the same facts in the briefing. Or maybe the DOJ realized that using torn documents as a pretext to search the home of a former president would paint the raid as political — because it sure does make the special agent in charge’s referral look political.

7. Leaks Look Bad Too

In granting Trump’s request for the appointment of a special master, Cannon stressed that the special master would help maintain institutional trust in a case heavily politicized. She further noted that a special master would serve to ensure “the integrity of an orderly process amidst swirling allegations of bias and media leaks.” Here, the court noted that “when asked about the dissemination to the media of information relative to the contents of the seized records, Government’s counsel stated that he had no knowledge of any leaks stemming from his team but candidly acknowledged the unfortunate existence of leaks to the press.”

Those “unfortunate” leaks provide further proof of the politicization of this entire affair: In three weeks’ time, Mar-a-Lago has sprung more leaks than have escaped from Special Counsel John Durham’s team over three years. And while the special master may not be able to silence the deep-state leakers, he or she will provide a check to the Biden administration.

But first, the parties must, as the court put it, “meaningfully confer” and then submit a joint filing to the court of a list of proposed special master candidates and a detailed proposal of the master’s duties, limitations, and ability to speak privately with Trump and the government, and other logistical information.

Biden's MAGA Screed Directs Gatekeepers To Purge Political Foes,"There are a lot of ways to analyze an address like the one Joe Biden gave last week from the steps of Independence Hall. One can view it from the perspective of its insane optics (the weird lighting and blood-red background call to mind Dante’s “Inferno”) to its inherently contradictory language (calling for unity while also calling half the country a “threat … to the very soul” of America).

But there is another, more practical matter: How does Biden expect this to end? Does he really think that using the office of the president to re-christen an entire group of Americans as extremists whose existence “threatens the very foundations of our republic” will somehow compel them to see the light, as it were? To step out of their red-colored haze, and vote Democrat? To suddenly reconsider the Senate run of failed presidential candidate Evan McMullin or to pour one out for future MSNBC contributor Liz Cheney?

Or by summoning the same language used to justify suppressing the speech rights of Americans in World War I, is he laying the predicate for something much darker?

One of the features of our current political realignment is the retrenchment of the so-called “elite” class into an intractable monolith: The people who sit atop our political, cultural, corporate media, and educational institutions all share the same exact values. They almost uniformly vote Democrat, they engage in ritualistic and performative displays of wokeness, they believe words are violence, and that there is no bigger threat to Our Democracy™ than Donald Trump voters.

When viewed through this lens, Biden’s speech takes on a much more pointed aim: a not-so-subtle directive to the oligarchy and the Democratic courtier class that “MAGA Republicans” are not just the embarrassing, demented, idiot rubes they are forced to share a country with. They are now officially the out-group — a rogue, extremist danger to themselves and others — and should be treated as such.

In tagging the 78 million people who voted for Trump as akin to domestic terrorists, Biden’s speech serves two codominant roles: to label half the country as a threat and to use this designation as a bat signal to the institutional arbiters of social, cultural, and corporate America to disassociate, shun, shame, and reprimand. And, critically, do it all with the formal imprimatur of the White House.

After all, Biden’s address wasn’t a campaign speech. Incredibly, it was pitched — and covered by corporate media unquestioningly — as a policy address.

The Mother Lode of Cancellation Attempts

Biden’s formal slicing of the electorate into “good voters” and “bad voters” will only encourage the trend toward the woke totems, dissent shaming, and push for intellectual homogeneity that is coursing through higher education and the arts. But where it could carve new ground is by formalizing the nascent practices of corporate America to ideologically weaponize access to the market. After all, you don’t want to be seen doing business with fascists, right?

It’s one thing to shun half of America’s voters from the corridors of polite society and the highest of ivory towers (though still unconscionable in its own right). It’s quite another to seem to nod approvingly in the direction of cutting half of America off from the guts of capitalism itself.

In this sense, Biden’s speech represents the mother lode of all cancellation attempts. And corporate America has already shown itself to be a willing partner. What began several years ago as the comprehensive deplatforming of provocateurs such as Laura Loomer (who is banned from Twitter, Periscope, Facebook, Instagram, Medium, GoFundMe, Venmo, MGM Resorts, PayPal, Lyft, Uber, Uber Eats, Chase Bank, and even the T-shirt company TeeSpring) has slowly crept inward, culminating in the simultaneous deplatforming of then-President Donald Trump — not only by the Big Tech giants but by his campaign’s email service, credit card processor, and two of his banks.

The small business, social media startup Parler found itself similarly assaulted when it was simultaneously banned from the Google app store and the Apple app store, and booted from Amazon’s hosting services — all on blatantly pretextual grounds. And it wasn’t just their market access infrastructure. “Every vendor from text message services to email providers to our lawyers all ditched us too on the same day,” Parler’s then-CEO John Matze confirmed to Fox News.

Glenn Greenwald calls this effect “de-personing,” and it’s a good way to describe the burgeoning ideological conditioning of major market players. Users who are engaged in offline behavior that the world’s largest non-bank lender, Paypal, in partnership with the Anti-Defamation League deem to be “hate speech” are removed or denied access.

The email provider Mailchimp cut off services for the Northern Virginia Tea Party group in 2020 when they used the service to organize a recount rally in support of President Trump. Last year, I was inexplicably banned from Mailchimp’s subsidiary TinyLetter for sending out a column I’d written for the New York Post. (I’m still banned! I took my newsletter to Substack.)

Bank of America will no longer lend money to certain gun manufacturers. Citibank will not process some gun sales by their own customers. During the Trump administration, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, and U.S. Bank refused to provide banking services to the private prison industry in protest of Trump’s immigration policies. These same federally-insured banks and a handful of others now refuse to provide depository services to federal contractors who do work for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Payment and funding sites such as Paypal, GoFundMe, and Patreon recently banned users they deemed “alt-right.”

Then there are, of course, the massive Big Tech platforms that work directly with the White House to decide which users and content to ban. This not only affects speech, it limits access for the millions of small businesses that use Google and Facebook, the world’s two largest digital advertising firms, to access the market. And God forbid you write a book with a political or policy message that upsets the world’s biggest book retailer.

All of this amounts to a uniquely American form of ideological social credit that determines access to the platforms and services that form the basis of the modern economy. The government isn’t mandating it, but a speech like Biden’s offers tacit approval, if not outright encouragement, of such measures. And the ideological fusion between the Democratic Party and leading corporations ensures the new hierarchy will be enforced.

Creation of an Underclass

Seen in this manner, Biden’s speech does far more than give the country the collective creeps. It formalizes the creation of an underclass. It says, from the official White House podium, that it is now appropriate and indeed necessary for the preservation of democracy to cut off “MAGA Republicans” from every avenue of influence and material gain.

The message is already being socialized across the airwaves. The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent called Biden’s claim that Trump voters pose a foundational threat to America “undeniably correct.” Over at MSNBC, DNC adviser Kurt Bardella went even further, calling “MAGA Republicans” a “domestic terrorist cell operating in America.” The Atlantic contributor Peter Wehner said all Republicans are a “dagger pointed at the throat of American democracy.”

Elements of the left in media, business, and universities have been salivating at the thought of embarking on a social purge of their political foes. Biden’s speech has mainstreamed and given credence to that impulse. The White House has, quite clearly, tipped its hat to corporate- and media-led otherizing at a national scale.

For a long time, the right’s answer to this has simply been to “build your own.” This has become increasingly difficult as the very infrastructure of capitalism has become ideologically weaponized, and as multinational corporations have grown so powerful as to literally rival nation-states in terms of reach and resources.

Small, dissident competitors struggle to reach the marketplace, blocked by ideological gatekeepers such as Apple and Google, or are just unable to compete with behemoths like Amazon who are simultaneously market access platforms, retail product rivals, and logistics chokepoints.

But in the Biden era, it’s also become next to impossible to create competing platforms based upon the twisted, circular reasoning that forces conservatives out of the mainstream toward alternative outlets, and then uses the existence of those alternative outlets as proof of the group’s extremism.

The Parler example remains superlative. Parler rose to prominence as a Twitter alternative based on free speech norms. Its popularity was, in part, based on the many users who were either banned on Twitter or disgusted by the platform’s ambiguous and politically influenced moderation decisions. But as Parler grew in prominence, it was immediately labeled as a “bastion of extremism” by arbiters of mainstream influence such as congressional Democrats, partisan pundits, and the mainstream social media platforms. Thus the platform that existed because of a user base forced out by the mainstream was then labeled by the same people as “dangerously extremist,” which then justified its collective deplatforming.

Chris Hedges, a former award-winning investigative reporter whose work was recently shut down by YouTube, described the phenomenon this way: “They push you to the margins and then, they demonize those spaces on the margins.” He goes on, “So they push you into a space that they then demonize, and then use it as an excuse to shut you down. But they’ve already in essence created the space in which you exist.”

For all the clownish supervillain feel of Biden’s staging outside of Independence Hall, his message was very real: Hate your neighbor because he’s a danger to the country. Biden’s speech gave official permission to his fellow ideological and political travelers to fully demonize their political opponents in every arena in which they find them — a public message soon to be enforced by very private means, from the heights of social, political, and corporate power.

DOJ Won't Reveal Mar-A-Lago Docs—Except Thru Media Leaks,"Hiding behind the horror of 9/11, the Biden administration demands that a federal judge and the country trust its targeting of a top political opponent—all while leaking details of classified documents to a pliant press.

This development and six others flow from recent court filings in former President Donald Trump’s efforts to obtain a special master’s oversight of the FBI’s seizure of thousands of documents and personal effects from his Mar-a-Lago home. The government doesn’t want to allow an independent review of the documents it’s seized. Trump’s legal team does.

First, The Backdrop

Three days after the August 8, 2022, raid on Trump’s Florida home, an attorney representing the former president spoke with Jay Bratt, the chief of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. Bratt has apparently been leading the investigation into the former president.

Trump’s lawyer asked Bratt “to agree to the appointment of a Special Master to protect the integrity of privileged documents.” Bratt refused. A week-and-a-half later, Trump filed a separate action in a Florida district court seeking judicial oversight and the appointment of a special master.

Federal judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, granted that motion last week, holding a special master shall be appointed to review the seized property, “manage assertions of privilege and make recommendations thereon, and evaluate claims for return of property.” Significantly, Judge Cannon also entered an injunction prohibiting the government from using the documents “for criminal investigative purposes pending resolution of the special master’s review process.” The court then ordered the parties to recommend individuals to fill the special master role, along with proposed procedures for the process by last Friday.

DOJ Files a Notice of Appeal

Before submitting the list of proposed special masters and the other details ordered by Judge Cannon, the Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal with the trial court, which the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals then docketed, starting the appeal process. Of interest, here, the clerk of court entered a corrected notice of appeal on behalf of the government, indicating the appeal was “interlocutory.”

Generally speaking, an “interlocutory appeal” is filed before the proceedings in the lower court are final. The right to appeal interlocutorily is limited, but federal rules of procedure provide for jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal where a party challenges the issuance of an injunction.

In this case, because the Biden administration seeks to challenge the trial court’s issuance of a preliminary injunction barring the government from using the seized materials “for criminal investigative purposes pending resolution of the special master’s review process,” the Eleventh Circuit has jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal.

What issues the Eleventh Circuit will address as part of the interlocutory appeal, such as the propriety of the appointment of a special master, present a different question, however. A federal appellate court with jurisdiction to review, interlocutorily, a lower court’s decision granting an injunction may also review other interrelated issues decided by the trial court. Significantly, it is a may and not a must, meaning the federal appellate court holds discretion to decide whether to review ancillary, albeit interconnected, issues.

The Biden administration has not yet filed its brief on appeal, but it seems likely that the government will ask the Eleventh Circuit to review Judge Cannon’s decision appointing a special master at the same time the appellate court addresses her decision enjoining the DOJ from using the seized materials for “criminal investigative purposes.” Trump will likely oppose any review of the decision to appoint a special master. But it is too early now to predict what issues the Eleventh Circuit will take up.

Biden Admin Claims Terrorism Requires a Stay

In addition to filing a notice of appeal, the Biden administration filed a motion for a partial stay of the injunction, asking Judge Cannon to “stay” or put on hold the injunction to the extent it “(1) enjoins the further review and use for criminal investigative purposes of records bearing classification markings that were recovered pursuant to a court-authorized search warrant and (2) requires the government to disclose those classified records to a special master for review.” The government further asked the court to rule promptly on its motion, telling Cannon that if she does not stay those portions of the order by Sept. 15, the government would seek a stay from the Eleventh Circuit.

While stressing that it disagrees with the court’s injunction, broadly speaking, the Biden administration limited its request for a stay to those portions of the order affecting the seized documents bearing a classification marking. In arguing for a stay, the government attempts to present the request as a matter of vital national security, even evoking 9/11 to frame their argument.

“The FBI itself is part of the Intelligence Community, and since the 9/11 attacks, the FBI has integrated its intelligence and law enforcement functions when it exercises its national security mission,” the government stressed in its motion. Further, the FBI conducts investigations that “may constitute an exercise both of the FBI’s criminal investigation authority and of the FBI’s authority to investigate threats to the national security.” In this case, the government then noted, “the same personnel from the FBI involved in the criminal investigation were coordinating appropriately with the IC in its review and assessment.”

According, while the court “specifically authorized the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (‘ODNI’) to continue with “the classification review and/or intelligence assessment,” the government argues that the injunction’s application to the records bearing classification markings “would thus frustrate the government’s ability to conduct an effective national security risk assessment and classification review and could preclude the government from taking necessary remedial steps in light of that review—risking irreparable harm to our national security and intelligence interests.”

The Biden administration’s claimed urgency strikes a surreal chord given that the DOJ waited six months to seize the classified documents after learning materials returned to the National Archives and Records Administration included documents bearing the classification markings. Further, given that the government has already segregated those 100 documents, a special master could expeditiously review the material, limiting the supposed harm to our national security and intelligence interests.

How Judge Cannon, and ultimately the Eleventh Circuit, will rule on the motion remains to be seen. Trump’s legal team still has a chance to respond to that motion by 10 a.m. today.

Biden Admin Seeks to Relitigate Trial Court’s Order

The government’s motion to stay also, in effect, attempts to reargue the DOJ’s position that there is no basis for a special master to review the documents bearing classification markings. The arguments presented in the motion thus serve as a preview of those the government will likely make to the Eleventh Circuit.

First, the government maintains that because the documents bearing classification marking cannot possibly be private records in which Trump has an interest, the court lacked the authority to appoint a special master to review those documents. But this argument presumes the government can be trusted—something Judge Cannon called into question given the mistakes made concerning documents preserved by attorney-client privilege. At a minimum, then, the special master’s review of the documents bearing classification markings provides assurances that the agents reviewing the documents properly segregated them.

The government also challenged Judge Cannon’s view that the special master should review the documents for potential executive privilege. According to the DOJ, as part of the executive branch, it has complete authority to review the documents marked classified and Trump has no right to assert executive privilege.

In enjoining the government from using the seized documents as part of its criminal investigation, Judge Cannon stressed that the question is not that simple. She is right. Because of a dearth of cases law, there is no clear answer to the scope and limits of executive privilege. Some parameters appear clear, however, such as that documents privileged by executive privilege cannot be used by the grand jury, yet the DOJ can nonetheless review those documents.

A problem arises, however, if the same FBI agents who reviewed documents protected by executive privilege then present a criminal case to a grand jury, taking advantage of the knowledge they gleaned from the content of the privileged documents. The FBI avoids that problem with documents protected by attorney-client privilege by using a taint team to review the material for privileged communications. The taint team ensures the investigative agents, who may later present a case to a grand jury, have no exposure to the material protected by attorney-client privilege.

The government and critics of Judge Cannon’s opinion fail to appreciate that absent a “taint team” to review any documents protected by executive privilege, the investigative agents may improperly use their knowledge during grand jury proceedings. Having a special master identify documents potentially protected by executive privilege provides a mechanism for both the DOJ and Trump to address the effects (or lack thereof) of the potential executive privilege claim.

Unsurprisingly, there is no case law considering these points because the targeting of a former chief executive in this situation has never occurred before. But handling executive privilege similarly to attorney-client privilege makes sense, which explains Judge Cannon’s ruling last week—a ruling the government ignores in its motion to stay.

Biden Admin’s Request Proves Trump’s Point

Another significant point from last week’s filings comes from the government’s argument in its motion to stay. In arguing against Judge Cannon’s order that it not use the materials seized “for criminal investigative purposes pending resolution of the special master’s review process,” the Biden administration proves the need for a special master.

Throughout its motion, the government stresses the interconnectedness of the criminal and intelligence community’s work. The FBI uses the intelligence community’s classification review “to inform its ‘criminal investigation into the potential mishandling of . . . national defense information,’ as to which classification status is highly relevant,” the government highlights.

“The government must assess the likelihood that improperly stored classified information may have been accessed by others and compromised,” the DOJ continues, adding that “that inquiry is a core aspect of the FBI’s criminal investigation.” For these reasons, the DOJ argues it cannot separate the intelligence aspect of the investigation from the criminal investigation aspect.

In its motion to stay, the Biden administration further argues:

The integration of the FBI’s criminal investigative and national security-related missions would also make it exceedingly difficult to bifurcate the FBI personnel working on the criminal investigation from those working in conjunction with other departments or agencies in the [Intelligence Community.] Any FBI agent or analyst who investigated whether the classified records were improperly accessed, for instance, would by definition be gathering information highly relevant to—and thus in furtherance of—’criminal investigative purposes.’ And such bifurcation would make little sense even if it were feasible, given that the same senior DOJ and FBI officials are ultimately responsible for supervising the criminal investigation and for ensuring that DOJ and FBI are coordinating appropriately with the IC on its classification review and assessment.

These arguments seek to force the court into allowing its criminal investigation to continue prior to the special master’s review, by framing the court’s order as effectively halting intelligence agencies’ work protecting our national security interests. Beyond creating a false dilemma, the government’s argument proves precisely why a special master is needed to assess privilege: because the Biden administration’s review of the documents, including potentially privileged documents, concerns its criminal targeting of Trump.

Full Tilt to Target Trump Before Midterms

The argument and analysis presented in the government’s motion reveals another reality: The Biden administration intends to pursue a criminal case against Trump, likely before the 2022 midterms. After the first wave of shock over the raid of the former president’s home passed, the conversation quickly turned to the end goal. Would the government be content with retrieving the documents, or was the government intent on indicting Trump?

While not conclusive, the government’s motion strongly suggests the Biden administration is all-in on pursuing a criminal case against the former president. Every word of the DOJ’s motion frames the case as representing a serious affront to national security and one deserving of criminal penalties.

For example, the Biden administration argues that “without a stay, the government and public also will suffer irreparable harm from the undue delay to the criminal investigation.” “The public has an ‘interest in the fair and expeditious administration of the criminal laws,’” the brief continues, adding that “any delay poses significant concerns in the context of an investigation into the mishandling of classified records.” “The government’s need to proceed apace is particularly heightened where, as here, obstructive acts may impede its investigation,” the Biden administration further stresses.

A few months’ delay to allow the special master to review the documents, however, is far from an “undue delay,” unless the Biden administration’s focus isn’t a “fair and expeditious administration of the criminal laws,” but midterm elections.

Only Leaks Are Allowed to See the Light of Day

In seeking to expedite its criminal investigation and in opposing the special master, the Biden administration relies heavily on its claims that the documents marked classified put the country at grave risk. But as Trump’s lawyers note in their briefing, material once classified does not always remain classified. This concerns not merely the documents Trump declassified, but that other documents, such as the former president’s travel itinerary, lose any top-secret nature with time.

The Biden administration clearly wants Americans to believe the documents Trump had at Mar-a-Lago represent serious threats to our national security, as evidenced not merely by the court filings but by the many leaks to the press. To protect that narrative, the DOJ remains adamant that the special master not have access to the documents it has segregated as marked classified.

The Biden administration argues it “will also suffer irreparable harm if . . .it is forced to disclose classified materials outside the Executive Branch in circumstances where there would be no valid purpose served by such disclosure.” But, as Judge Cannon detailed, there are several valid purposes, including ensuring the documents were properly segregated and do not involve privileged documents.

Further, transparency proves especially important in this case, where “concerns about the perception of fair process are heightened where, as here, the Privilege Review Team and the Investigation Team contain members from the same section within the same DOJ division, even if separated for direct reporting purposes on this specific matter.” “[P]rosecutors have a responsibility to not only see that justice is done, but to also ensure that justice appears to be done,” Judge Cannon stressed.

Beyond these points, there is the irony that while the government bemoans the use of a special master, it continues to leak to the press supposed details about their content. History also teaches that the more the government screams about the need to keep supposedly classified information secret, the more likely the details represent not national security intel but information harmful to the deep state.

Master Names Floated, Including a DNC Donor

On Friday, the DOJ and Trump filed a joint response to the court’s order, setting forth individuals to serve as the proposed special master. On the DOJ side, the Biden administration recommended retired federal judges Barbara S. Jones and Thomas B. Griffith. Jones is a Democratic National Committee and Act Blue Donor, while Griffith appears a Biden favorite, having previously been called to serve on a committee to reform the Supreme Court.

Trump’s legal team proposed Judge Raymond Dearie and Florida’s former deputy attorney general, Paul Huck Jr. While likely similarly biased, but in Trump’s favor, that is precisely what is needed to ensure that the Biden administration’s DOJ isn’t playing fast and loose with the facts.

For all these developments, there will be many more over the next week, with the government filing its opening brief in the Eleventh Circuit. Trump’s legal team will also be responding shortly to the Biden administration’s motion to stay and Judge Cannon will need to rule on that motion. Should she deny the motion, the government will then seek a stay from Eleventh Circuit. Judge Cannon must also decide on the individual to appoint as a special master and whether he (or she) will have access to the documents marked classified.

With every development, there will be more media coverage of Trump and the raid—and less of the disastrous condition Biden and Democrats have put the country in over less than two years.

Biden Just Admitted His Student Loan 'Forgiveness' Ploy Is Illegal,"In an obvious effort to boost his anything-but-sunny track record before the 2022 midterms, President Joe Biden finally admitted in a Sunday “60 Minutes” interview that “the pandemic is over.” The gaffe-prone president’s statement appeared to upset his party’s plans of using Covid-19 as an excuse to exercise unconstitutional control forever, judging by the meltdown in newsrooms and on Twitter. But Biden also inadvertently admitted his recent vote-buying scheme to “forgive” student loans is against the law.

When Biden announced plans to “forgive” $10,000 in student loans ($20,000 for Pell Grant recipients) for certain borrowers last month, it was an obvious political ploy to give young voters money and wink at them to remember it on Election Day. It was a crime against the word “forgiveness,” since neither the universities nor government lenders are “forgiving” anything, but rather are charging taxpaying bystanders to pay students’ debts. Above all, it was unconstitutional and illegal, considering the Constitution’s demand that “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law” and the fact that the president has no legislative authority to dictate those appropriations.

But the Biden administration has never been one to let the Constitution get in the way, so Biden’s Education Department’s Office of the General Counsel threw together a hogwash argument claiming that the Covid-19 “emergency” authorized the plan. Even The Atlantic admitted, “Biden’s Student-Debt Rescue Plan Is a Legal Mess.”

“[W]e have determined that the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students (‘HEROES’) Act of 2003 grants the Secretary authority that could be used to effectuate a program of targeted loan cancellation directed at addressing the financial harms of the COVID-19 pandemic,” General Counsel Lisa Brown wrote. The HEROES Act is a law passed shortly after 9/11, designed to support members of the military by allowing the education secretary to provide student loan-related relief “to respond to a war or other military operation or national emergency.” Brown claimed that the never-ending Covid “pandemic” was justification enough that “this authority could be used to effectuate a program of categorical debt cancellation directed at addressing the financial harms caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

But now — if the pandemic is “over,” as Biden has finally acknowledged — doesn’t that mean Biden’s Education Department can no longer use it as a “national emergency” to try to justify its power grab? Even if the HEROES Act could be legally stretched to include Covid-related student-debt handouts, Biden just rendered his own agency’s legal argument null.

It’s also senseless to declare the pandemic any more “over” now than it was less than a month ago. The New York Times reported the daily average number of Covid deaths at 463 on Aug. 25, the day Biden announced his student loan ploy. On Sept. 18, the day his “60 Minutes” interview aired, the daily average was 464.

Even Biden himself had previously expressed doubts multiple times since he was elected about a president’s authority to write checks from taxpayers to student borrowers.

“I’m going to get in trouble for saying this. … For example, it’s arguable that the president may have the executive power to forgive up to $50,000 in student debt,” he said in December 2020. “Well, I think that’s pretty questionable. I’m unsure of that. I’d be unlikely to do that.”

In February 2021, he commented, “I’m prepared to write off a $10,000 debt, but not 50 [thousand dollars]. … Because I don’t think I have the authority to do it by signing the pen.” The next day, the White House insisted the $10,000 figure “was not meant as a descriptor for executive action but to reflect his endorsement of achieving that goal through legislation,” according to Politico.

Even Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi jumped in to say in July 2021, “The president can’t do it,” referring to the use of taxpayer dollars to pay off student borrowers’ debts. “That’s not even a discussion.”

The illegality of Biden’s student debt “forgiveness” was no secret to anyone with a working knowledge of the U.S. Constitution. But Biden’s admission on “60 Minutes” suggests it’s no secret to him either.

Biden's '60 Minutes' Interview Proved He Isn't Running The Country,"President Joe Biden sat down for a rare, one-on-one interview on CBS’s “60 Minutes” this past weekend, and it went about as well as you’d expect.

In addition to dismissing public concerns about skyrocketing inflation and his family’s foreign business dealings, America’s commander in chief decided to lay out his administration’s supposed policy with respect to the ongoing China-Taiwan issue.

“We agree with what we signed onto a long time ago,” Biden said in an apparent reference to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. “There’s a ‘One China Policy,’ and Taiwan makes their own judgments about their independence. We are … not encouraging [them to be] independent. … That’s their decision.”

Under the “One China Policy,” the United States acknowledges that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is the sole government of China and that Taiwan belongs to China. The U.S. does not, however, recognize the PRC’s claims to territorial sovereignty over Taiwan.

While Biden’s remarks about Taiwanese independence fall in line with the United States’ long-standing policy toward the island nation, his next comments almost assuredly left White House staff hopping mad. When asked by CBS News’s Scott Pelley if the United States would come to Taiwan’s defense in the event of a Chinese invasion, Biden answered with an unequivocal “yes.”

“So, unlike Ukraine, to be clear, sir, U.S. forces, U.S. men and women would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion?” Pelley asked in a follow-up, to which Biden replied, “yes.”

60 Minutes: ""Would U.S. forces defend Taiwan if invaded by China?""



Biden: ""Yes""



White House then had to clarify policy on Taiwan hasn't changed. pic.twitter.com/Vad3dbLQ2L — Greg Price (@greg_price11) September 19, 2022

After Biden’s remarks, Pelley noted how a White House official told “60 Minutes” that “U.S. policy [toward Taiwan] had not changed,” and that “officially, the U.S. will not say whether American forces would defend Taiwan.”

The remarks from Biden, if true, would greatly alter U.S. policy toward Taiwan. For decades, America has practiced what’s known as strategic ambiguity, wherein the U.S. won’t officially confirm whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.

Despite the magnitude of such a policy change, this is hardly the first time Biden has publicly expressed U.S. military support for Taiwan and the White House was forced to release a statement “clarifying” the president’s remarks. During a CNN town hall event with Anderson Cooper last October, Biden was asked point-blank if the U.S. would defend Taiwan from China, to which the president responded by saying, “yes, we have a commitment to do that.”

Not even 24 hours later did a White House official release a statement saying Biden “was not announcing any change in our policy” and that the administration would “continue to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo.”

A separate incident regarding a change in U.S.-Taiwan policy by Biden also occurred the following month in November 2021, when the president declared Taiwan “independent.” Once again, less than 24 hours later, Biden walked back his remarks.

Factoring in his numerous incoherent statements and ramblings about getting “in trouble” with his staff for engaging with the press, Biden’s Taiwan blunders and the White House’s repeated walk backs reveal what many Americans have suspected for the past year and a half, which is that Biden is not running the U.S. government.

As has long been held throughout American history, it is the president that heads up and steers U.S. foreign policy, not unelected bureaucrats. Yet that is exactly the situation the country finds itself in today.

At every turn of his presidency, Biden has abdicated his responsibilities to unknown White House staffers, who direct and carry out the government’s major policy initiatives while America’s commander in chief slinks away to his Delaware beach house at every available opportunity. In essence, Biden has become nothing more than a puppet, whose strings are being controlled by unnamed, high-level White House officials to shape America and her foreign policy through whatever means necessary.

Whether it’s getting lost on stage after giving a public speech or having his wife prevent him from answering press questions, Biden has demonstrated time and again that he isn’t remotely capable of handling the most basic tasks of a fully functioning human being, let alone those of a U.S. president. Under a different president — a Republican one — left-wing Americans and the media would be loudly calling into question Biden’s ability to serve. But sadly, Democrats are in charge. So instead, we’re stuck with a walker-back-in-chief whose oligarchic presidency is running the country into the ground.

Grocery Shop With Me To Fact-Check Biden's Nuts Inflation Claims,"By now you’ve no doubt heard about President Joe Biden’s interview with “60 Minutes” in which he declared the pandemic “over” and said unequivocally that, “yes,” the United States will come to Taiwan’s defense whenever China attacks. He also made some dubious claims about inflation.

When CBS interviewer Scott Pelley highlighted the abysmal state of the economy and noted that “people are shocked by their grocery bills,” Biden sputtered that the “inflation rate month to month was up just an inch, hardly at all.” To give you a flavor of the rest of the exchange:

Biden: [You guys] make it sound like, all of a sudden, ‘My God, it went to 8.2 percent.’ Pelley: It’s the highest inflation rate, Mr. President, in 40 years. Biden: I got that. But guess what we are. We’re in a position where for the last several months, it hasn’t spiked. It has just barely — it’s been basically even.

It’s worth clarifying what Biden is trying to claim here. The inflation rate clocked in at 8.3 percent in August, after registering at 8.5 percent in July and 9.1 percent in June. When the president says inflation “hasn’t spiked” and has “been basically even,” he’s talking about these fractional changes — and he’s hoping you don’t know what they mean and that his lapdogs in the corporate media won’t explain them to you.

But when we’re talking about inflation and how it affects prices, the baseline isn’t some-odd 8 percent or whatever the rate happened to be last month. In other words, we don’t measure August’s inflation as down 0.2 percentage points from July and 0.8 points from June. These monthly figures represent year-over-year changes, meaning each report describes how prices that month compare to prices at the same time last year — and they’re all up, by a lot.

To that end, I suppose it’s accurate to say that month-to-month, inflation “hasn’t spiked” — but that just means inflation has been consistently bad under this administration. But the goal obviously isn’t to keep inflation “basically even” at a 40-year high; it’s to bring it the heck down.

But even these overall 8 and 9 percent figures are misleading — and dramatically under the money — for essential needs such as energy and food. As Pelley said, Americans are “shocked” every time they go to the grocery store.

But just how bad is it? Do grocery increases really amount to just 8 percent, or a few cents, per item? Are prices up, as Biden claimed, “hardly at all”?

I went to the grocery store and ran some numbers, and I too was shocked by what I found.

Midterm to Midterm

I stopped by one of the nearest grocery chains, which isn’t as cheap as Aldi but is no Harris Teeter highway robbery either. I’d say it’s comparable to a nice Pick ‘N Save, with a few brand options for each item.

While doing some personal shopping, I took inventory of basic items (universal brands if the store had them), some of which were “on sale.” I documented each item’s regular price. Then, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), I cross-referenced those prices with grocery costs during a comparable time in recent memory: the last midterms in 2018 under President Donald Trump — a year and a half into the presidency and during a time of strong political incentives to keep Americans happy.

I avoided produce, most of which the BLS doesn’t keep consistent records for and which has such a short shelf-life that prices vary widely. I did, however, check in on other essentials across a variety of categories: baking items such as flour and sugar, meat, eggs, cheese, and other staples such as bread and pasta. And let’s just say after running the numbers, an 8 percent increase would have been welcomed. The real hikes were insane.

Milk, Eggs, and Bacon

Let’s start with breakfast, as you do. In September 2018, bacon cost $5.50 per pound, according to BLS averages. Today, those delicious piggy strips will run you about $7.99 per pound for your run-of-the-mill brand.

That’s a 45 percent price jump, almost all of which occurred after Biden took office.

Bureau of Labor Statistics

Milk is even worse. In 2018, one gallon of whole milk cost $2.98. Now, the grocery store’s off-brand milk costs $4.89, a price increase of almost 70 percent.

Milk is an input into multiple other foods, such as cheese, sour cream, cream for your morning coffee, and more. So when milk goes up, it has a big effect on the prices of many other edibles.

Bureau of Labor Statistics

The other two non-specialty brands available, both Midwest-specific, cost $4.99 per gallon and a whopping $5.39. The latter was the last one on the shelf, an all-too-familiar sight in Biden’s America.

Eggs are some of the worst offenders of all. Americans paid $1.65 for a dozen of Grade A, large eggs in 2018. Now, those eggs cost $3.49 for 12.

I’ll spare you the math. That’s a nearly 112 percent spike that’s coincided with the current president’s time in office. The cost has more than doubled.

Bureau of Labor Statistics

Pasta, Bread, and Baking

Bread and pasta used to be reliably inexpensive staples of the American diet. It’s why go-to meals for lower-income families often include PB&Js for lunch and spaghetti for dinner. But they’re not so inexpensive anymore.

Wheat bread in 2018 cost $1.95 per pound. Now it costs $3.19, a 64 percent rise.

Bureau of Labor Statistics

The cost of white bread has skyrocketed. Four years ago, it ran consumers just $1.29 per pound. Today it’s $2.79. That’s a 116 percent spike.

Bureau of Labor Statistics

And while the price of spaghetti in September 2018 was $1.20 per pound, America’s go-to pasta now costs $1.84, meaning it’s risen in price by more than half.

Bureau of Labor Statistics

Speaking of rising by half, that’s also what’s happened to the price of sugar. Four years ago, it cost just 58 cents per pound. Now it costs 87.

Bureau of Labor Statistics

Flour is even worse, with a 70 percent increase. In 2018 it cost an average of 47 cents per pound, and today it costs 80.

Bureau of Labor Statistics

Meat and Cheese

A consistent complaint among Americans is the cost of meat, and it’s easy to see why. Prices are up considerably for some of consumers’ most reliable protein sources.

Chicken breasts cost an average of $2.90 per pound during the Trump midterm era. During Biden’s midterm season, they are running at $4.99 per pound. That’s a 72 percent increase for what was arguably one of the most basic, versatile, and affordable of poultry proteins. The upward trend started about the same time the Biden administration took the reins of the U.S. economy.

Bureau of Labor Statistics

Ground beef, another staple, is up from $3.74 per pound in 2018 to a staggering $6.29 per pound now. No, that’s not for organic. It’s a good thing the summer season is coming to a close, because those cookouts were getting painfully expensive — 68 percent more expensive for the burgers than just a few years ago.

Bureau of Labor Statistics

The cheese for the top of those burgers went up a bit too. While cheddar cheese ran about $5.13 per pound in 2018, it’s up to about $6.00 now, for a nearly 17 percent rise.

Cravings

Junk food isn’t exempt from Biden’s inflation, either, so if you’ve got a salty craving, expect to pay more to satisfy it — at least twice as much, actually.

In September 2018, potato chips were $4.43 for 16 ounces. Now they cost more than that for a regular price 8-ounce bag.

That means today potato chips are $9.18 for 16 ounces at my grocery store, a 107 percent jump for the simple pleasure.

Bureau of Labor Statistics

So … ‘Hardly at All’?

This is a lot of figures to make sense of, but it’s safe to say a single-digit inflation rate doesn’t capture it, and you definitely wouldn’t describe the prices as up “barely an inch.” In fact, among these basic items in my shopping survey, prices were up an overall average of 70 percent since just the Trump midterms!

Of course, it should go without saying that groceries in some parts of the country will be cheaper than in the Midwest city where I live, while others will be more expensive. And of course, consumers can sometimes find more affordable off-brands than some of the above, just as they could find brands that are much spendier. But these 2018 BLS statistics are “U.S. city average[s],” meaning it’s fair and accurate to compare them to mid-tier brands in this American city in 2022 — and the comparison is damning.

The left-wing media and Biden apologists will retort that prices are the fault of a virus or Vladimir Putin or malicious corporations, but the administration’s reckless fiscal policies speak for themselves. And it isn’t as though other presidents don’t have to contend with geopolitical forces or crises outside their control. When Trump was in office, everything from an airborne virus to Twitter spats was his fault. Now that Biden is commander in chief, it’s only right that the direct consequences of his policy failures be laid at his feet.

So consider this a fact-check. Biden’s claim that inflation is up “hardly at all” deserves pants-on-fire status and all the Pinocchios. But Americans don’t require a fact-check. They just got home from the grocery store, and they’re shocked at what they see.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/09/23/grocery-shop-with-me-to-fact-check-bidens-inflation-up-hardly-at-all-claim/,2022-09-23
Left-Wing Group Writes Playbook For Biden’s Elections Takeover,"The following is an adapted excerpt from the book, “Myth of Voter Suppression: The Left’s Assault on Clean Elections.”

In March 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing every federal agency to focus on voter registration and participation in what appears to be a federally-backed get-out-the-vote effort.

Don’t worry. We are assured this will be nonpartisan.

The White House came back in September 2021 to explain federal agencies will be working with “nonpartisan” groups. But the Biden administration hasn’t given many details about how this order is being implemented and who these nonpartisans are. What’s key is that the executive order almost mirrors exactly what the left-wing group Demos produced in a policy brief shortly after Biden was elected.

While other groups on the left often attempt to sound reasonable and pragmatic, Demos shows ideological leg with phrases like, “transforming America,” “rethinking capitalism,” and “global governance.” So the liberal New York think tank’s “Democracy Program” strikes one of its least-threatening tones. Don’t be fooled. It’s about weaponizing the federal government to sign up as many Democrat voters as possible.

Demos issued a report on December 3, 2020, titled, “Executive Action to Advance Democracy: What the Biden-Harris Administration and the Agencies Can Do to Build a More Inclusive Democracy.” Less than two months after taking office, Biden issued an executive order nearly identical to the Demos demands about politicizing federal agencies.

Lest there be any doubt about the organization’s influence over this administration, it’s important to know that K. Sabeel Rahman was the president of Demos and Chiraag Bains was the Demos legal strategies director when the organization issued the briefing calling for Biden’s executive actions.

So it’s no coincidence that Rahman became senior council for the Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the implementation of executive orders, as well as for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which oversees regulation. Bains is the deputy director of racial justice and equity for the Domestic Policy Council — which the executive order identifies as taking the lead on the policy. A White House press release on March 5, 2021, noted that Bains — while working at Demos, “led voting rights litigation and advocacy across the country.” Two days after this press release, Biden issued the executive order.

Demos previously partnered with Project Vote, an offshoot of ACORN, and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law to lobby the federal and state governments against what it calls “excessive Voter Identification requirements.” The coalition wanted the Motor Voter law extended beyond registering voters at the Department of Motor Vehicle offices to include offices for welfare, Medicaid, food stamps, and other areas of public assistance where perhaps Democrat voters are more likely to be. Demos criticized the Obama administration for not using the HealthCare.gov portal to sign up for Obamacare as a voting registration site.

The marriage of government with turning out the partisan vote — using social services as a sweetener — is a throwback to the workings of Tammany Hall, the Daley machine, and other Democrat Party traditions.

After years of advocating using the power of government to benefit a single party, Demos issued its December 2020 recommendations for the incoming Biden-Harris administration in what turned out to be the blueprint for Biden’s election agenda.

The first of the six recommendations says, “The Biden-Harris administration can make voting more accessible by directing specified federal agencies, in their administration of federal programs, to act as voter registration agencies, including providing voter registration applications, assisting clients to complete applications, and transmitting completed applications to state authorities.”

In an apparent response, Biden issued an overly broad executive order on March 7, 2021, ordering federal agencies to do exactly that.

“Agencies shall consider ways to expand citizens’ opportunities to register to vote and to obtain information about, and participate in, the electoral process,” Biden’s executive order says. “The head of each agency shall evaluate ways in which the agency can, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, promote voter registration and voter participation.”

The order also says agencies are to “expand citizens’ opportunities to register to vote and to obtain information about, and participate in, the electoral process.” The order directs agencies to focus on “distributing voter registration and vote-by-mail ballot application forms,” “assisting applicants in completing voter registration and vote-by-mail ballot application forms,” and “soliciting and facilitating approved, nonpartisan third-party organizations and state officials to provide voter registration services on agency premises.”

Demos specifically singled out using U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to sign up new voters at naturalization ceremonies. Under Biden’s executive order, the Department of Homeland Security’s focus will be on voter registration “at the end of naturalization ceremonies for the hundreds of thousands of citizens naturalized each year,” according to the White House summary of agency plans.

The second Demos recommendation for Biden’s executive actions was to “strengthen Department of Justice’s enforcement of and guidance on voting rights statutes” and “pursue aggressive civil and criminal enforcement of federal voting rights protections.”

The Justice Department seems to have obliged, filing lawsuits against the election laws in Arizona, Georgia, and Texas, while also issuing election law guidance seemingly as a warning to other states.

Apart from the executive order, Biden appointed top Justice Department officials with a long record of opposing any voter ID laws. Biden named Vanita Gupta as the associate attorney general. She returned to the department after running the civil rights division during the Obama administration.

During that run, she oversaw the 2015 lawsuit against North Carolina to attempt to block the voter ID law there. Biden also named Kristen Clarke as the assistant attorney general, who would lead the Civil Rights Division that oversees the Voting Section. As a private lawyer, Clarke led a lawsuit to stop the then-Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp from enforcing election integrity policies.

The third Demos recommendation was to provide more federal resources to the Election Assistance Commission. Under this category, Demos called for the EAC to “develop standards and best practices for mail and early voting” and to “encourage ‘no-excuse’ voting by mail.”

Along those lines, the Biden executive order says agencies should provide ways to give information to people from government offices located throughout the United States as well as online and social media, “about how to register to vote, how to request a vote-by-mail ballot, and how to cast a ballot in upcoming elections,” and “ways to provide access to voter registration services and vote-by-mail ballot applications” and “distributing voter registration and vote-by-mail ballot application forms.”

The fourth Demos recommendation was: “Create an office within the White House focused on advancing the administration’s efforts to protect and strengthen democratic systems and civic participation.”

In April 2021, Biden named Justin Levitt as his senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights. Levitt is a Loyola law professor who previously worked in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration. Levitt worked for the George Soros-funded America Coming Together PAC, and for the vote-fraud-denier group Brennan Center for Justice. In 2014, Levitt wrote a Brennan Center report opposing voter ID laws.

The fifth recommendation calls for the Biden-Harris administration to “strengthen the U.S. Postal Service’s ability to deliver election mail.” This suggestion surrounded the left’s pre-2020 election postal conspiracy theories that Trump was somehow hijacking the postal service to get reelected.

It was not part of Biden’s executive order, but in July 2022, the USPS announced it was establishing a division to handle election mail.

The sixth Demos suggestion was to end what it calls “Prison Based Gerrymandering” by requiring the Census Bureau to count federal prisoners at their last known address rather than at the prison they are incarcerated in. The theory behind this is that when it comes time for redistricting, prisoners are from urban areas that could add majority Democrat districts but are housed in rural areas — and thus will only add non-voting residents to expand likely Republican areas.

The DOJ didn’t address “prison gerrymandering” but the executive order says the department shall, “provide educational materials related to voter registration and voting and, to the extent practicable, to facilitate voter registration, for all eligible individuals in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.” Yet another likely Democrat constituency.

Let’s be clear, it would be problematic for a Republican president or for a president of any party to direct the federal bureaucracy to engage in elections. It’s difficult to see how the public shouldn’t suspect the party in power would want to shift things in their favor.

Biden Hosts Braves After Pushing All-Star Game To Boycott Atlanta,"President Joe Biden hosted the Atlanta Braves at the White House on Monday to celebrate the Major League Baseball (MLB) team’s 2021 World Series win. The event comes after Biden and other high-profile Democrats called for the professional baseball league to move its annual All-Star game out of Atlanta to protest Georgia’s recently passed election integrity law.

“This team has literally been part of American history for over 150 years,” Biden said. “But none of it came easy … people counting you out. Heck, I know something about being counted out.”

During the event, Biden was presented with a customized jersey bearing his name and the number 46, in reference to him being the nation’s 46th president. In a separate moment, America’s commander-in-chief bizarrely beckoned “everybody under 15” to come near him for a group photo.

Despite Democrats and their media sycophants’ efforts to cast Biden as a folksy, kind old man, the president has routinely shown himself to be anything but. Following the Georgia legislature’s passage of a bill last year to enhance the integrity of the state’s election laws, Biden proceeded to call for the MLB to relocate its 2021 All-Star game out of Atlanta in protest.

“I think today’s professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them [moving the all-star game out of Atlanta],” Biden told ESPN last year.

In the same interview, Biden went on to label the Georgia bill as “Jim Crow on steroids” and falsely asserted that the law “prohibited food and drink at polling places and mandated the polls close at 5 p.m.”

“Imagine passing a law saying you cannot provide water or food for someone standing in line to vote? Can’t do that? Come on,” he said. “Or you’re going to close a polling place at five o’clock when working people just get off? This is all about keeping working folks and ordinary folks that I grew up with from being able to vote.”

FLASHBACK: In April, Biden “strongly” supported MLB's baseless boycott of Georgia knowing “the people who need help the most"" will “get hurt the most.”pic.twitter.com/dMEOFyOWRi — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) January 11, 2022

As noted by The Daily Wire, however, “[t]he Georgia law implements restrictions on handing out food and drink near polling places similar to restrictions already in place in New York and Biden’s home state of Delaware” and “are designed to prevent lobbyists or special interest from handing out concessions at polling places. It does not ban voters from bringing or ordering food, nor does it prohibit polling workers from setting out self-service water stations or distributing food donated for general use.”

Moreover, the Georgia bill does not require polls to close by 5 p.m., as Election Day voting in the state lasts from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

While Biden attempted to walk back his pro-boycott rhetoric a week later, the damage had already been done. Two days after the president called for moving the All-Star game out of Georgia, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred announced that the MLB would be relocating the annual event to Colorado.

The move ultimately had devastating effects on Georgia’s economy, with Job Creators Network (JCN) CEO Alfredo Ortiz estimating that the decision cost the state “upwards of $100 million” in revenue. Ortiz has since released a statement blasting Biden for hosting the Braves at the White House, saying that the president should “be embarrassed” for playing a role in “costing the Greater Atlanta area” millions in revenue.

“Biden and left-wing activists pressured MLB to move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta, lying about the Georgia election reform law,” Ortiz said. “MLB caved to Biden and the far left in a pitiful case of virtue-signaling. … Biden should apologize to the Greater Atlanta community today, instead of joining them in celebration.”

Other notable Democrats who assisted in fueling the push for the MLB to pull its All-Star game out of Atlanta include Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock and Georgia Democrat gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.

"As Trump Rallies Republicans For Midterms, Where's Joe Biden?","The midterm elections are just four weeks away, and former President Donald Trump is busily campaigning for Republicans in crucial contests. Joe Biden, on the other hand, is nowhere to be found.

It’s quite odd, given Biden’s past performance as a “road warrior,” traveling the country to support fellow Democrats. Back during the 2018 midterms, for example, the former vice president traveled to roughly two dozen states to attend rallies, fundraisers, and other stops, supporting 65 candidates as one of the best-known Democrats in the nation. In one week, he attended 12 rallies.

This time around, however, Biden seems to be sitting campaign events out (although he’s still traveling, just not for congressional Democrats). His public schedule in the last two weeks shows he attended three fundraising events for Democrats (one for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee at the home of James and Kathryn Murdoch, no less), but nothing directly affiliated with a candidate.

This keep-the-president-at-a-distance approach seems to be congressional Democrats’ strategy as Nov. 8 nears. When asked whether she would like Biden to join her on the campaign trail in the battleground state of New Hampshire, former governor and first-term Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan told Fox News, “My job is to be an independent voice for New Hampshire. That’s the role I’ve always worked to play and be for Granite Staters.”

First-term Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, when asked the same question by reporters in Georgia, distanced himself: “Regardless of who else comes to Georgia, or doesn’t come, at the end of the day the people of Georgia have a very clear choice between me and Herschel Walker. That’s who’s running.”

Why are Democrats so loath to speak the president’s name and tout his support? One look at his horrendous approval ratings gives a pretty good idea. What with skyrocketing inflation, energy costs, and crime — not to mention flirting with nuclear war with Russia — Democrats think that by distancing themselves from Biden and his crisis-plagued presidency, they might also distance themselves from the issues at the forefront of American’s minds (hint: it’s not abortion).

A Washington Post op-ed notes that while Biden’s net approval rating is 7 percentage points in the negative, Democratic congressional candidates are unaffected, as they lead Republicans in national House polls. Setting aside the extreme unreliability and partisanship of polls, which the left typically uses to shape rather than reflect public opinion, The Washington Post is really saying the Democrats’ midterm strategy out loud: Namely, candidates are distancing themselves from Biden to avoid getting slaughtered at the ballot box.

“If Biden’s net approval — the difference between his approval rating and his disapproval rating — were the only factor in the midterm elections, the Republicans would win the House by a healthy margin,” writes Washington Post opinion columnist David Byler. “…Voters still might start to blame Democrats for the economy and Biden’s policy disappointments, allowing the GOP to retake the lead before November. But for now, they’re letting Democrats distance themselves from Biden…”

To that end, Biden has made only nine official endorsements this election cycle, compared to more than 100 in 2018 and nearly 50 during the 2020 cycle.

Contrast Biden’s marked absence on the campaign trail with former President Donald Trump. After endorsing Republican candidates for nearly 200 races in 39 out of 50 states, the leader of the Republican Party and the 2024 presidential front-runner has been actively campaigning for candidates in key battlegrounds. This past weekend, he held a rally for Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and U.S. Senate hopeful Blake Masters in Mesa, as well as a rally in Nevada. And he’s been traveling throughout the country campaigning for Republican candidates he’s endorsed in an effort to boost GOP turnout in November.

It looks like it’s working, as Trump’s endorsements actually make a difference. In the primaries, candidates backed by Trump won 92 percent of the time.

“The endorsements make him the most prominent figure in the Republican party,” GOP activist Charles Coughlin told the BBC. “And it increases his influence when Republicans are constantly asking for his endorsement.”

As Republicans seek the former president’s support, he appears just as eager to give it. Trump reportedly plans to ramp up his engagements in October by hosting rallies, robocalls, tele-town halls, and fundraisers for Republican candidates. His rallies so far have already attracted thousands of supporters.

“Nobody turns out conservative voters better than Donald Trump does,” GOP pollster Jim McLaughlin told The Washington Post.

How surprising that Trump, supposedly the most politically toxic political figure in the history of the United States, is now making his rounds across the country to help Republican candidates in crucial midterm contests. Meanwhile, the sitting president, once the most coveted speaker for Democrats, is being shoved in a closet. Democrats don’t want Biden anywhere near their candidates, so he’s been relegated to fundraiser.

Is Joe Biden-Appointed Prosecutor Giving James Biden Free Pass?,"U.S. Attorney Cindy K. Chung is still overseeing the criminal investigation into the bankrupt health care business from which James Biden allegedly siphoned hundreds of thousands of dollars to finance repairs to his beach house, even after President Joe Biden nominated the top prosecutor for a lifetime appointment as a federal appellate judge. And the assistant U.S. attorney leading the criminal investigation into the James Biden-connected business has now been tapped to replace Chung, according to sources.

Attorney General Merrick Garland has ignored these blatant conflicts of interest just as he has spurned demands that he appoint a special counsel for the Delaware criminal investigation into the Biden family business dealings that implicate not just Hunter and James Biden, but the president of the United States.

“A resident of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, pleaded guilty in federal court to three counts of conspiracy related to the submission of fraudulent health care claims, United States Attorney Cindy K. Chung announced today,” a September press release from the Western District of Pennsylvania opened. Chung’s announcement then detailed the conspiracy to commit health care fraud, pay and receive unlawful kickbacks, and commit money laundering, to which Daniel Hurt pleaded guilty.

While on the surface the Hurt case seems unrelated to James Biden, the details underlying the charge reveal the investigation into Hurt should have run prosecutors headlong into President Biden’s brother’s financial relationship with Americore, the company Hurt allegedly solicited and obtained kickbacks from in executing his Medicare fraud.

In pleading guilty, Hurt admitted he received more than $26 million dollars from Medicare by fraudulently billing the federal government for “genomic (CGx) testing.” According to the U.S. attorney’s press release, “CGx testing used DNA sequencing to detect mutations in genes that could indicate a higher risk of developing certain types of cancers in the future.”

Hurt admitted, however, that he and his unnamed co-conspirators were not using the CGx testing for legitimate medical purposes. Instead, they “obtained CGx prescriptions from telemedicine physicians without regard to the fact that the doctors did not conduct proper telemedicine visits, were not treating the Medicare beneficiaries for cancer or symptoms of cancer and did not use the test results in the treatment of the beneficiaries.” And to attract seniors, they launched a nationwide marketing campaign to prompt Medicare recipients to submit cheek swab samples, either from home testing kits or at “health fairs” held throughout the United States.

The press release explained that Hurt then arranged for these DNA samples to be sent to the Ellwood City Medical Center, or “ECMC,” in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, for supposed CGx gene sequencing even though ECMC lacked the appropriate testing equipment. Hurt caused the ECMC staff to repackage the samples for testing by third-party laboratories but used ECMC to bill Medicare, benefitting from the higher reimbursement rate allowed for rural hospitals such as Ellwood. In total, between just “January 2019 and October 2019, Medicare reimbursed ECMC more than $25 million for CGx testing.” As part of the conspiracy, Hurt also admitted to providing kickbacks to ECMC.

What the U.S. attorney’s press release failed to mention, however, was that Americore Health, LLC, which was a privately held Fort Lauderdale-based company closely connected to James Biden, owned ECMC, having taken over operations of the rural hospital in 2017. In fact, “in pitching the sale of Ellwood City Medical to Americore,” Americore’s CEO Grant White would reportedly “often drop Biden’s name.”

Email and text messages exchanged with James Biden and filed as exhibits in a civil lawsuit filed in Tennessee against the president’s brother by two companies in the health care sector confirm James Biden’s relationship with Americore Health, LLC. In that lawsuit, Diverse Medical Management, Inc. and Azzam Medical Services, LLC sued James Biden, investor Michael Lewitt, other investors or investor funds, as well as Americore Health, LLC and its CEO, White, for fraud, civil conspiracy, and other state law claims.

The complaint in the Tennessee lawsuit alleged that on Dec. 19, 2017, Diverse Medical Management’s president and CEO, Michael Frey, and its General Counsel Mitchell Cohen traveled to Fort Lauderdale to meet with Americore’s CEO, White, to discuss a potential partnership between the company and Americore. According to the complaint, at this meeting, the companies agreed Diverse Medical Management would provide business development and management services to the rural hospitals that Americore acquired, including ECMC and another hospital in Kentucky, the Pineville Community Health Center.

When Frey traveled to Pineville in January 2018 to introduce the business model to the hospital, he met Biden for the first time. “Biden handed Frey a business card identifying him as a Principal with Americore,” Frey alleged in the complaint, attaching as an exhibit this photograph:

James Biden admitted meeting Frey in court documents, but in classic lawyer fashion, his attorney claimed the president’s brother lacked the “knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth” of whether Biden handed Frey a business card identifying him as a “Principal with Americore.”

Frey also filed with the court email and text exchanges, including one from Michael Lewitt, who was alleged in the complaint to be a money manager and an associate of Jim Biden. In that email, which Lewitt sent to Frey, Sara Biden, and Jim Biden, he noted that they needed to get Grant “out now” and “take over operations of the hospitals from Grant,” “effectively locking” the Americore CEO out.

A few months later, Lewitt sent a text message, meant for James Biden, inadvertently to Frey. That text further confirmed Biden’s involvement in Americore, reading: “We can wrap ( A / C ) into Frey’s entity further diluting the both in the process? After we take control of both. Just a thought. We must have complete control, too many moving pieces. Jim.”

While this text unnerved Frey, the Diverse Medical Management’s president and CEO alleged that Jim Biden and the other investors continued to reassure him and his business partner, Dr. Mohannad Azzam, the founder of Azzam Medical Services, LLC, that the financial deal they had discussed would materialize. And according to the complaint, Biden continued to work closely with the pair, with Biden leaving Dr. Azzam a voicemail in November of 2019 stating he needed Azzam’s PowerPoint presentation on his diabetes care model to show investors the following evening. In January of 2020, Biden also texted Frey, with the president’s brother claiming in that message to be leaving soon for Turkey to secure funding.

After the continued assurances of funding never came to fruition, in June 2019, Frey and Azzam’s business entities sued James Biden, Lewitt, Americore, White, and others for several claims, including fraud and civil conspiracy. Then, in a shocking development, on Feb. 18, 2020, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against White, stating “as grounds” in the court filing that White had “provided Plaintiffs voluminous electronic evidence exonerating him in this Action and demonstration he too was a victim of the fraudulent actions of Defendants James Biden, Michael Lewitt, and others.”

Three months later, Jim Biden and the other parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement and release, dismissing all of the claims and counterclaims in the case.

But before they had settled the case, Americore’s former CEO, White, had prepared and signed — under penalty of perjury — a declaration for Frey and Azzam’s case against Biden and the other investors. Mark Hemingway detailed White’s accusations in his in-depth reporting on the scandal for The Federalist, writing:

“In January of 2018 Lewitt arranged for his hedge fund to loan Americore $2 million as a bridge loan while we awaited the larger investment. Jim Biden directed me to loan him approximately $400,000 of this money for him to use to repay a past-due personal loan secured by his house in Florida. Subsequently, in additional bridge loans from Lewitt’s hedge fund, Biden took additional amounts totaling approximately $250,000. The approximately $650,000 was originally intended to be used for Americore working capital. Jim Biden promised that the approximately $650,000 would be paid back out of the multi-million investment coming from overseas that was imminent and certain. Jim Biden, however, has never repaid the approximately $650,000 to Americore, instead only paying back approximately $25,000. Americore has been charged forbearance fees and interest on this despite the fact that Biden took that money.”

Politico also reported in March of 2020, that “a former Americore executive has told POLITICO that James Biden had more than half a million dollars transferred to him from the firm as a personal loan that has not yet been repaid.” Americore, which filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 31, 2019, included the $650,000 “loan” to Jim Biden in its schedule of “Assets and Liabilities,” according to White.

White’s claims against Biden, coupled with the fact that he had sufficient documentary evidence to back up his allegations to convince Frey and Azzam to drop their claims against White, provides a strong basis to investigate James Biden for his involvement with Americore. But it is the Western District of Pennsylvania’s U.S. attorney’s office overseeing that investigation, with the Pennsylvania office actually taking over two related cases against Hurt from U.S. attorneys’ offices in other states.

The Western District of Pennsylvania’s U.S. Attorney Cindy K. Chung, however, has a serious conflict of interest: Beyond being appointed to her position by Joe Biden, in July of 2022, the President nominated her to fill a vacancy on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Further, according to two sources familiar with the current plans to replace Chung, Assistant United States Attorney Eric G. Olshan has been tapped to be President Biden’s choice as the next Western District of Pennsylvania’s U.S. attorney. Olshan is the lead prosecutor handling the Hurt case.

While the allegations against Hurt do not directly connect to Jim Biden, the facts underlying the conspiracy charge indicate that the investigators necessarily confront — or should have confronted — evidence related to the operations of Americore. The charge against Hurt, however, spoke only of Americore seeking and receiving illegal kickbacks. But what about White’s claim that James Biden used the hospital as his personal piggy bank? And what about Biden and his associates’ other involvement in Americore?

That the U.S. attorney Joe Biden appointed to the job, and who has since been nominated by the president to a federal appellate judgeship, is overseeing this investigation is scandalous. Likewise, that the lead prosecutor in the case is on deck for Chung’s job creates a huge conflict of interest for the office. Attorney General Merrick Garland should immediately tap a special counsel to investigate Jim Biden’s involvement with Americore.

He won’t, of course, because Garland knows the corrupt media will ignore the conflict — just as it has left unnoticed the attorney general’s refusal to provide special counsel protection to the Republican-appointee Delaware U.S. attorney overseeing the investigation into the Biden family. Instead, Garland seems ready to sit idly by while, under the protection of the president, the Biden family papers over its problems with a possible indictment of Hunter Biden on middling tax and gun charges.

Joe Biden Is Our Greatest Fabulist,"At first glance, I thought The New York Times had finally written a piece highlighting Joe Biden’s decades-long propensity to lie. Instead, what we got was more of an explanation.

Biden’s “folksiness,” contends The New York Times, “can veer into a personal folklore” with “the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences.” (Not to be pedantic, but folklore is a collection of stories and legends shared by a community, not stories and legends concocted by a single person. Those are more appropriately called “fictions.”) The Times expends many words assuring its audience that Donald Trump’s lies were much, much worse than Biden’s largely innocuous folklore.

Maybe, maybe not. Most of the lie counters have been shut down. The Times taps left-wing journalist Eric Alterman as an expert on presidential mendacity to help us out. He argues that Biden – “a good and decent man”– is merely guilty of engaging in the kind of lies “grandfathers” might tell. Biden has a “tendency,” Alterman says, to “stretch the truth up to a point just like virtually every president has done.”

History disputes this contention.

Biden recently veered into some personal folklore, telling Hurricane Ian victims that his family “lost an awful lot of” their home when lightning struck (Last year, he claimed to understand the pain of “having had a house burn down with my wife in it”). Turns out, more than 15 years ago, the Bidens had “a small fire that was contained to the kitchen,” according to contemporary accounts. A few days earlier, Biden assured the victims of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico that he too was basically “raised in the Puerto Rican community at home, politically.” According to the New York Post, in 1970, when Biden was 28, Delaware “had about 2,154 people who were either born in Puerto Rico or descended from Puerto Rican parents,” or roughly 0.39 percent.

Anyway, those kinds of stories perhaps stretch the truth. Biden’s long history shows that his habit of lying is far more pervasive.

Let’s take his contentions on race. While campaigning in Alabama for the presidency in 1987, Biden — then a youthful 45 —bragged that the infamous George Wallace had given him an award for being “one of the outstanding young politicians of America.” Now, it is true Joe Biden spent the mid-1970s being mentored by pro-segregationist senators like James O. Eastland and Herman Talmadge, but there is no record of him getting any award for his work from the infamous racist.

A few years earlier, Biden, whose “soul raged upon seeing the dogs of Bull Connor,” also claimed to have marched in the civil rights movement and participated “in sit-ins to desegregate restaurants and movie houses” at the age of 17. “Joe Biden,” Joe Biden explained in 1981, at the age of 39, “was a lawyer who did work for the black community, represented the Black Panthers at the time they were burning down my city, was a criminal defense lawyer, and the proponent of public housing in the county that election.” He wasn’t.

In 2014, at the age of 72, Biden was still going on about how he “got involved in desegregating movie theaters.” There is no evidence of it being true. A couple of years ago, Biden told an audience in South Carolina that he “had the great honor of being arrested” on “the streets of Soweto” in South Africa when attempting to meet Nelson Mandela. Also not true. This year, at the age of 79, Biden suggested to black college students in Atlanta that he had been arrested during civil rights protests. All of this was a kind of stolen valor, really.

The chances that Biden participated in sit-ins in 1959 or was defending Blank Panthers in the 1960s or came anywhere near being arrested in the 1990s are about as likely as little Joey seeing gay men kissing on a street corner in working-class Wilmington in 1961 — or for that matter, ever hearing his Baltimore-born, middle-class dad dropping progressive axioms on him about love being love. Zero.

Here is some other stuff “every president” hasn’t done: lie about having attended the University of Syracuse Law School on a “full academic scholarship,” lie about finishing in the “top half” of his class, lie about winning an award for outstanding political science student at the University of Delaware, and lie about finishing with “three degrees.” Evidence suggests that Biden almost surely lied about his superior IQ, as well.

None of this even gets into what is perhaps the most blatant act of plagiarism in national political history. Biden didn’t just pinch an entire speech from one-time British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock – as Maureen Dowd put it at the time, using “phrases, gestures and lyrical Welsh syntax intact”– but he also plagiarized Hubert Humphrey, and John and Robert Kennedy, as well.

These aren’t stories with “the factual edges shaved off.” They were either cynical lies told to gain personal power or the work of a pathological liar. Considering Biden continued his transparent fabulism after his first presidential campaign imploded, the latter seems possible.

Drop a needle on any era of Biden’s 50-year career, and you’re going to hear a greatest hit.

In 2020, Biden was still pretending he had shifted U.S. policy on Bosnia in 1990s. “Look, I’m the guy that started the effort to make sure we took down the guy who was engaged in genocide in the Balkans: Slobodan Milosevic.” In “Promises to Keep,” his 2007 compendium of folklore, Biden contends he personally confronted Milosevic in a secret 1993 meeting, telling the dictator, “I think you’re a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one.” Weirdly, not a single person in the room could corroborate this extraordinary moment, save Biden’s then-chief of staff Ted Kaufman. As the Washington Post gingerly put it in 2008, “Biden Played Less Than Key Role in Bosnia Legislation.” Indeed, he was the ninth co-sponsor of a bill on the issue.

Another Biden story revolves around a Navy captain who allegedly rappelled down a 60-foot ravine in Afghanistan’s Kunar province to save his fellow soldier. Biden was intent on giving this man a medal. When generals warned that going to Afghanistan was too dangerous, Biden brushed off their concerns. “We can lose a vice president,” the president imagined himself saying. “We can’t lose many more of these kids. Not a joke.”

It’s difficult to type those words without laughing at his audacity. But there is more.

“God’s truth, my word as a Biden,” the president told an audience 10 years after it didn’t happen. “He stood at attention, I went to pin him, he said: ‘Sir, I don’t want the damn thing. Do not pin it on me sir, please. Do not do that. He died. He died.’” Other than the fact that Biden never visited the Kunar province as vice president and never pinned a silver star on any Navy captain it’s a great story.

On and on it goes.

After an anti-Semite murdered 11 people in 2018, Biden claimed to “remember spending time at the, you know, going to the, you know, the Tree of Life synagogue, speaking with them.” He never went. When speaking about wildfires in Idaho in 2021, Biden claimed his “first job offer” came from a local lumber company in Boise. Boise Cascade says it has no idea what he’s talking about. When speaking to graduating midshipmen at the Naval Academy this year, Biden spun a curiously specific story about how he had been “appointed to the academy in 1965” but opted not to go because it didn’t offer him a football career. Since Annapolis offers no graduate programs, and Biden graduated from the University of Delaware and applied to Syracuse Law School in 1965 – in neither institution did he play any football — it is a dubious tale. Biden had requested five student draft deferments during those years over his asthma – which, much like his stuttering, only appears as needed — it seems odd that he would have chosen a naval career.

Of course, you could write a 1,000-page novel detailing the imaginary life of Joe Biden. And you can discount his unique place among our greatest liars because you prefer his politics. Contra The New York Times’ intimations, however, it’s not normal.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/11/joe-biden-is-our-greatest-fabulist/,2022-10-11
Grassley Demands FBI 'Come Clean' On Hunter Biden Probe,"Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley demanded the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) give Congress an unredacted brief tracing the steps agencies have taken to probe Hunter Biden’s potentially criminal business ventures.

In a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss, Grassley outlined the evidence against the Biden family leveraging White House connections for personal profit from overseas adversaries.

“Since May 31, 2022, I’ve written three letters to the Justice Department and FBI based on protected whistleblower disclosures that indicate a pattern and practice of political decisions being made at the FBI’s Washington Field Office (WFO) and FBI Headquarters,” Grassley wrote. “In response, my office has received a significant number of protected communications from highly credible whistleblowers which have increased since my initial outreach to your offices.”

In July, Grassley’s office published a whistleblower report revealing double standards within the FBI and DOJ related to investigations into Biden’s conduct compared to that of former President Donald Trump. Washington Field Office Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy Thibault and Director of Election Crimes Branch Richard Pilger, whistleblowers alleged, coordinated to amplify defamatory information against Trump while giving cover to Hunter Biden, dismissing intelligence about the current president’s family as disinformation.

“Multiple FBI whistleblowers, including those in senior positions,” Grassley’s office explained, “are raising the alarm about tampering by senior FBI and Justice Department officials in politically sensitive investigations ranging from election and campaign finance probes across multiple election cycles.”

Three months later, Grassley is demanding an end to the agencies’ “continued silence” and calling on them to give Congress and the American people an update on federal investigations into misconduct that jeopardizes national security.

“Notably, the Justice Department and FBI have not disputed the accuracy of the allegations that I have made public since May 31, 2022,” Grassley wrote in a letter Thursday. “Simply put, enough is enough — the Justice Department and FBI must come clean to Congress and the American people with respect to the steps they have taken, or failed to take, relating to the Hunter Biden investigation.”

In August, another whistleblower report emerged from Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson’s office alleging FBI agents actively sought to dismiss incriminating evidence against the Biden family amid the 2020 election.

Multiple whistleblowers, according to Johnson’s office, “intentionally undermined efforts to investigate Hunter Biden.”

Two days later, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted Facebook colluded with the FBI to suppress stories surrounding the Biden family business ventures as Americans cast ballots in October 2020.

“The FBI basically came to us and spoke to some folks on our team and was like, ‘Hey, just so you know, you should be on high alert. We thought that there was a lot of Russian propaganda on the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically there’s about to be some kind of dump similar to that,'” Zuckerberg said on the Joe Rogan Podcast.

Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that agents under Weiss, the U.S. attorney conducting an investigation into Hunter Biden’s potential tax crimes since 2018, “have gathered what they believe is sufficient evidence to charge” the younger Biden.

Grassley gave the FBI and DOJ an Oct. 27 deadline to issue a series of reports chronicling the FBI’s conduct since October 2020 when former Biden business partner Tony Bobulinski blew the whistle on the first family’s overseas ventures.

“I think Joe Biden and the Biden family is compromised,” Bobulinski told Fox News one week before Biden was elected president. Bobulinski warned the new president was compromised by the Chinese Communist Party in particular, which, emails indicate, was slated to funnel money to the former vice president.

Bobulinski also gave an interview to the FBI that fall outlining the conflicts of interest that surrounded Joe Biden as the new president prepared to take over the Oval Office.

“The Justice Department’s and FBI’s continued silence on these matters is deafening and further erodes their credibility,” Grassley wrote last week.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/17/grassley-to-fbi-we-know-you-have-impactful-voluminous-evidence-of-biden-family-corruption-so-come-clean/,2022-10-17
Biden Makes Abortion Pitch In Last-Ditch Attempt To Sway Voters,"In a last-ditch attempt to distract midterm voters from Democrats’ disastrous legacy, President Joe Biden vowed to sign a bill that would legalize abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, something a majority of Republican and Democrat voters disagree with.

In a speech at a Democratic National Committee event on Tuesday, Biden promised that if Democrats keep their grip on Congress come Nov. 8., he will codify Roe v. Wade in January on what would be the decision’s 50th anniversary.

“Together will restore the right to choose for every woman and every state in America. So vote. You gotta get out the vote. We can do this if we vote, folks,” Biden said.

As for the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision, Biden falsely stated it caused “women all across the country, starting in my house” to lose “a fundamental right.” Biden’s wife is far beyond child-bearing age and is a legal resident of a state that allows abortion through most of pregnancy. Dobbs did not outlaw abortion, but returned legislating on abortion to the states.

Biden on Roe being overturned:



“Women all across the country, starting in my house, lost a fundamental right.” pic.twitter.com/OGWQA2hX5f — Greg Price (@greg_price11) October 18, 2022

Biden claimed that Dobbs pushed Republicans towards “doubling down on their extreme positions” on abortion. In reality, it is Biden’s White House, joined by his Democrat allies, who are pledging to reject the abortion restrictions most voters support in favor of forcing their deeply unpopular abortion agenda on all 50 states.

“Take a look at what happened in Kansas. Come this November, we’re gonna see what happens all over America, God willing,” the “deeply Catholic,” pro-abortion president said.

Polls, which are often manipulated by corporate media to aid the Democrat agenda, acknowledge that only 17 percent of Americans support the type of unlimited, taxpayer-funded abortion through all nine months Biden wants to legalize.

Regardless, Biden and the vulnerable Democrats whose political fates will be decided on Nov. 8 have fully embraced abortion up to the moment of birth.

Some blue politicians, such as Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, have gone so far as to deny babies in the womb have detectable heartbeats and pretend that science doesn’t say life begins at conception.

In addition to ignoring how voters feel about killing babies in the womb, Biden’s address also overlooked the fact that an overwhelming majority of Americans simply aren’t thinking about abortion when they cast their ballots.

One month before election day, 37 percent of voters say inflation and price increases are the biggest issues facing the country today. Right behind that is the economy and jobs, which 29 percent of voters think is a No. 1 problem.

“With elections next month, independents, especially women, are swinging to the G.O.P. despite Democrats’ focus on abortion rights,” The New York Times admitted in an article on Monday.

Even MSNBC hinted that Biden’s pro-abortion rant was out of touch with voters who are more concerned with inflation, the border crisis, and crime.

Americans are not falling for Democrats’ attempts to distract them from the real issues, but that’s not stopping Biden from doubling down.

“The president is going to continue to talk about issues that matter to the American people, and abortion is one of them,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed on Tuesday afternoon after Biden’s speech.

Peter Doocy asks Karine Jean-Pierre if Biden's priority is inflation or abortion:

Biden Depletes Petroleum Reserve To Help Dems In Midterms,"Gasoline prices will soar after the Democrats’ midterm shellacking. Why? Power. For many politicians, as well as parties, the point of power is power.

Biden campaigned against American oil and gas, saying he would “end fossil fuels” with no more pipelines and “no more drilling on federal lands, no more drilling, including offshore, no ability for the industry to continue to drill.”

Within a week of taking office, Biden banned the Keystone XL pipeline and suspended oil and gas leasing on federal lands — the latter move was subsequently overturned in late August by a federal judge in response to a lawsuit by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The regulatory assault has been unrelenting as well.

Meanwhile, Biden’s allies in woke finance are working to dry up the capital needed to find more oil and gas and then produce and refine it. As a result, America is producing about 1 million barrels a day less oil than it did under former President Donald Trump (before the onset of Covid-19).

Strategic Reserve Low

Coincidentally, that 1-million-barrel shortfall is about the same amount of oil Biden has been withdrawing from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).

Congress created the SPR in 1975 after the oil shocks of the 1970s led to gas lines and stagflation. Situated underground in giant caverns associated with salt domes in Louisiana and Texas, the SPR was rapidly filled to about 600 million barrels by 1990. It reached its maximum capacity of 714 million barrels during the Great Recession when the price of oil plunged from $190 a barrel to $58.

But since Biden’s election — and especially since the White House announced an accelerated draw down of the SPR on Nov. 23, 2021 — the oil in the SPR has plummeted to levels not seen since 1984, shortly after the storage caverns became operational.

Presidential Approval Tied to Gas Prices

The figure below illustrates two important variables during President Joe Biden’s time in office. The first is the RealClearPolitics average of presidential job approval polling, with approval tracked in black and disapproval in red. The second is the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline. The figure shows how public approval of the job Biden is doing tends to lag the price of gasoline — a common and necessary product most voters buy on a regular basis, and one for which there is extreme and constant visibility, unlike, say, the cost of eggs or a pair of shoes.

Sources: Real Clear Politics, Energy Information Administration, American Automobile Association.

Not surprisingly, an administration whose chief declared war on American-made energy well before inauguration presided over a steady increase in the price of gasoline.

By November, with the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline having increased steadily over the past 11 months from $2.20 to $3.40, or 55 percent, the Biden team was panicking as the presidential job approval deficit hit a negative 12.1 percentage points. The irony, of course, is that the price of energy was merely reacting to Biden’s own policies.

The challenge for green politicians is that while polling frequently shows Americans approve of expanding green energy (wind, solar, and batteries) by 80 percent to 20 percent, when a modest cost is assigned to these policies — even $20 a month in higher prices for electricity or gasoline — support quickly collapses to 30 percent to 70 percent against green energy, especially among lower-income groups that have traditionally been a core Democratic constituency. It seems everyone’s for windmills, rainbows, and unicorns — until the bill comes due.

Thus, on Nov. 23, 2021, as Biden’s approval ratings had precipitously declined for six months, the White House announced a greatly accelerated drawdown of the SPR. Almost immediately, there was relief at the pump and the Biden job approval rating saw a jolt upward — for a month.

Unfortunately for Biden, his administration’s ongoing hostility to American-made oil, combined with the federal government’s competing against the oil and gas industry by selling oil out of storage, could not keep prices low forever.

Using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Politically

So, where do we go from here? If Biden has been drawing down the SPR for crass partisan purposes, transmogrifying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve into the Strategic Political Reserve, what might he do after Nov. 8 when the Democrats may lose both the House and the Senate as well as some governorships and state legislative chambers?

To see how Biden might use the awesome, market-shaping power of the SPR, we must look at how it’s been abused so far: not as a store of energy to mitigate the effects of another Arab oil embargo, nor in the event of a major war, but to purchase political popularity. This view is further fortified by revelations out of Saudi Arabia that Biden begged the Saudis to delay the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ production cut until after the November elections.

The Biden team — overweighted with elite, woke Ivy Leaguers — would view a loss to the MAGA masses in November as a rebuke deserving of a crushing response.

One option is refilling the SPR. My colleague John Hostettler, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for a dozen years through 2007, believes that in the wake of a midterm loss, a simple cessation of the SPR draws wouldn’t be enough; it wouldn’t inflict enough pain.

Should the SPR draws stop, or, as Hostettler believes, shift back to refilling the reserves, what would happen? Oil prices would immediately spike, with gasoline prices following quickly. Democrats would start attacking “greedy Big Oil” and would introduce so-called windfall profits taxes, propose a ban on the export of American oil and gas, and call for hearings on oil industry collusion.

Republicans, of course, would defend the domestic oil industry. In response, Democrats and their allies in big media would pillory Republicans, calling them friends of Big Oil and enemies of working Americans.

Lastly, as gasoline prices pushed through $6, $7, or even $8 a gallon, Biden’s team would be at first quietly, then openly, touting the “transition” to green energy. “Don’t want to pay $8 a gallon for gas? Buy an electric car (with a made-in-China battery)!” they’d say.

In an arcade gaming context, Democrats’ actions to punish Americans for their November insolence might well turn into a Leeroy Jenkins moment, where their drive to inflict maximum pain at the pump results in the Democrats being wiped out in 2024.

But a new Republican majority in Congress wouldn’t be powerless. They can make aggressive use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to overturn many Biden administration rules, including the climate disclosure rule, that increase the costs of producing energy. Biden could veto CRA joint resolutions, but doing so would highlight his bad policies. Republicans could also redistribute funds from regulatory compliance to accelerating permitting to speed getting oil and gas out of the ground and to the consumer. Congress can also vote to remove judicial review to curb frivolous environmental or green energy lawsuits. While Biden could veto all of these initiatives, Congress, with the power of the purse, has a powerful negotiating tool.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/19/biden-shamelessly-manipulates-our-strategic-petroleum-reserve-to-help-democrats-in-midterms/,2022-10-19
"Computer Store Owner Sues Hunter, Biden Campaign For Defamation","The owner of the Delaware computer repair store where Hunter Biden abandoned his MacBook filed suit against Hunter Biden, the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign, Rep. Adam Schiff, CNN, and Politico in Delaware state court on Monday. The eight-count complaint alleged claims of defamation, civil conspiracy, and civil aiding and abetting against the defendants based on statements they made after the New York Post published the scandalous materials recovered from Hunter’s laptop.

John Paul Mac Isaac found himself thrust into the public eye after the New York Post on Oct. 14, 2020, published an exposé about the contents of the laptop Hunter Biden had abandoned at Isaac’s Delaware computer repair store. No sooner had the news broken than Joe Biden’s presidential campaign and backers of the Democrat candidate called the story Russian disinformation.

While Hunter Biden refused to comment on the story before the November 2020 election, after President Biden found himself safely in the White House, Hunter sat down with CBS News and when asked, “Was that your laptop?” the president’s son replied: “I really don’t know what the answer is. I have no idea.” But when pushed on whether the laptop could be his, Hunter responded: “There could be a laptop out there that was stolen from me.” “It could be that I was hacked. It could be that it was the — that it was Russian intelligence. It could be that it was stolen from me.”

Isaac’s lawsuit against Hunter alleges that, contrary to Hunter’s claims, he knew the laptop was his, as Hunter knowingly left the laptop with Isaac on April 12, 2019, and then a short time later returned to the store with an external hard drive for Isaac to transfer the data recovered from the laptop hard drive. Yet Hunter “knowingly broadcast the false and defamatory information about his laptop to third parties — viewers of the interview” that imputed that Isaac was “involved in one or more crimes including, theft of his laptop, hacking of his laptop, or being part of a plot by Russian intelligence.”

The Delaware store owner also sued the “Biden for President Campaign Committee,” or “BFPCC,” which served as Joe Biden’s presidential campaign. According to his complaint, the members of the BFPCC claimed the New York Post exposé was “a Russian disinformation operation.” A senior Biden campaign adviser would repeat that theme in an interview on MSNBC, saying that if then-President Trump “decides to amplify these latest smears against the vice president and his only living son, that is Russian disinformation.”

Biden Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield, on behalf of BFPCC, likewise said of the information from the laptop “that what [Trump is] doing here is amplifying Russian misinformation.” And the candidate himself, Joseph R. Biden Jr., the complaint stressed, “representing the views of BFPCC,” said, “[t]here are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant. Five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except his good friend Rudy Giuliani.”

In his defamation count against BFPCC, Isaac alleged the campaign committee employees knew or should have known that the claims of Russian disinformation were false. Yet they published those statements about the laptop knowing they would subject Isaac to “distrust, scorn, ridicule, hatred, and contempt, which continues to this day” and that they imply Isaac “committed an infamous crime, i.e., treason and/or other crimes against the United States of America by participating in a Russian attempt to undermine American democracy and the 2020 Presidential election.”

Isaac also added Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., CNN, and Politico as defendants in the newly filed complaint. The Delaware store owner had previously sued those three defendants, along with The Daily Beast in a Maryland state court but later voluntarily dismissed that lawsuit. Isaac later entered into a confidential settlement agreement with The Daily Beast, according to his attorney Brian Della Rocca, before refiling the claims against Schiff, CNN, and Politico in the lawsuit that also named Hunter and the Biden campaign.

The claims against Schiff and CNN stem from the congressman’s appearance on the cable network to discuss the emails recovered from the laptop. Schiff told the network’s Wolf Blitzer during an interview that “we know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin.” Schiff had no evidence that the information contained in the New York Post exposé was part of Russian disinformation, however, and by representing otherwise, the complaint alleged, Schiff portrayed Isaac as a Russian agent or participant in a Russian disinformation campaign.

Isaac’s claim against Politico rests on that outlet’s publication of an article titled “Hunter Biden Story is Russian Disinfo, Dozens of Former Intel Officials Say.” The article then discussed the letter signed by more than 50 former senior intelligence officials that addressed the recent publication of Hunter Biden’s emails. That letter did not assert that the Hunter story was Russian disinformation, though, instead merely claiming it had “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.”

By framing the laptop story as actual “Russian Disinfo” in its title, Politico defamed Isaac, his attorney alleged, as the article “clearly identifies the information as coming from Plaintiff.” Thus, Politico’s reporting implies Isaac was “part of a Russian disinformation campaign” and/or “more specifically a Russian agent,” according to Isaac’s complaint.

A Promising Case

This recently filed defamation case proves promising for several reasons. First, the lawsuit follows the concession by several legacy media outlets of the authenticity of the laptop, making the defendants’ claims of Russian disinformation specious.

“Now that the world has a better understanding of the legitimacy of the Hunter Biden laptop story, it is clear that there was a concerted effort to kill the story by defaming John Paul and others,” Isaac’s lawyer Della Rocca told The Federalist. “This destroyed John Paul’s reputation and his business,” Della Rocca added, noting, “We now know how much of a role Representative Schiff and Hunter Biden played in the conspiracy to defame John Paul and it is time they, along with others, are held accountable.”

The lawsuit also proves significant for a second reason: By naming both Hunter Biden and his father’s presidential campaign, Isaac’s case holds the potential to uncover any complicity between the Bidens and the spinning of the story as Russian disinformation. And because Isaac named the presidential campaign and not Joe Biden, there is a chance that portion of the suit can proceed even while Biden is president.

Finally, Isaac’s lawsuit follows revelations that members of the FBI pushed Facebook to censor the story as Russian disinformation. Discovery should reveal whether the FBI, intelligence agencies, or other Democrat operatives pushed Politico, CNN, and other private organizations to block the story and, if so, how.

But first, Isaac will need to withstand a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which will likely be filed in the coming months.

Watch: TikTokers Mock Biden For His Hilarious 'Motivational' Gaffe,"Gym rats are taking swings at Commander in Chief Joe Biden with a TikTok trend featuring thirst-trap lifting videos overlaid by dramatic music and an embarrassing Biden gaffe. “The best way to get something done if you — If you hold near and dear to you… that you uhh… umm… like to be able to uhh… well, anyway…” the president says over motivational music.

https://www.tiktok.com/@vincentfischer_/video/7149288991991352618?_r=1&_t=8WfIiQD2szD&is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7149288991991352618

“I had a hangover and was gonna stay inside, but then Joe Bidens [sic] inspiring words hit me,” one TikToker captioned his running video.

https://www.tiktok.com/@villanenfrans/video/7152541979790839046?_r=1&_t=8WfIqtffxms&is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7152541979790839046

The trend began with gym bros, but it has morphed into mock motivation for all aspects of life. Here’s a U.S. Air Force pilot pretending Biden’s quote “keeps [him] motivated”:

This med school graduate joked that the Biden gaffe got him through his “toughest days of residency.”

An apparent retail manager videoed himself in front of his bathroom mirror getting ready for work with the caption, “Didn’t want to go to work today, but then I thought of this very powerful Biden quote.”

One TikToker joked that the Biden quote gave her motivation to renovate her house.

While the Biden gaffe TikTok trend is funny, the president’s obvious mental decline is no laughing matter. It is a serious problem. Last month, Biden appeared to get lost on stage at the Global Fund’s Seventh Replenishment Conference in New York after he delivered a speech. Millions of people watched the leader of the free world in a now-viral moment awkwardly look from right to left, seemingly confused about if and how he should exit the stage.

A few days later, at the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, the 79-year-old president asked for the late Rep. Jackie Walorski, R-Ind., who was killed the month prior in a tragic car accident with two members of her staff. Countless members of the media — on both sides of the political aisle — asked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeatedly what the president meant by “Where’s Jackie?” and whether Biden was aware of Walorski’s death. Jean-Pierre seemed to be just as lost as the president, providing no explanation for why Biden asked for the deceased woman, instead responding over and over with the bizarre answer that Walorski was “top of mind” for the president — whatever that means.

Gaffe after gaffe has left both Democrats and Republicans feeling dismal about the president’s mental capacity and his ability to properly represent the United States on the world stage and run the country. Polling shows nearly two-thirds of all voters — 64 percent — report “high concerns about Biden’s mental capacity.” Even a majority of Democrats express worries about the president’s cognitive faculties.

From the supposedly legendary face-off between Biden and Corn Pop, to when Biden called on people to “honor” the Holocaust during his speech in Israel, the people’s confidence in the president’s ability to lead the free world wanes more every day. So to all of you Americans worrying about the future, take heart and remember: “The best way to get something done if you — If you hold near and dear to you… that you uhh… umm… like to be able to uhh… well, anyway…”

Court Froze Biden's Plan To Buy Votes With Student Loan Bailout,"Late Friday, a federal appellate court froze the Biden administration’s plan to begin canceling student loans, crushing the president’s plot to start zeroing out the debts on Sunday, just two weeks out from midterm elections.

The Eighth Circuit’s decision in Nebraska v. Biden suspending the loan-forgiveness plan dealt a humiliating blow to the president, who just hours earlier bragged that the courts had declared, “We’re on Biden’s side.” But even before the ruling, no court had sided with the president; rather, the earlier cases were all tossed because the Biden administration crafted the program to prevent anyone from obtaining “standing” to challenge the unilateral executive action.

“Standing,” or the legal right to sue because of a cognizable injury, remains at issue in Nebraska v. Biden, with the Eighth Circuit’s decision on Friday merely temporarily pausing Biden’s plans to wipe out over $400 million in student debt. This week, the federal appellate court will decide whether to enjoin the loan-forgiveness program during the appeal. The Eighth Circuit is not the only court to watch this week, however, as two other challenges to the Biden administration’s student-debt bailout program are teed up for decision and a third may be soon — and any one of these courts could prevent the vote-buying scheme from taking effect before midterms.

Here’s what you need to know to understand the relevant issues, the pending cases, and the Biden administration’s desperation to keep the courts from addressing the legality of his student-loan wipeout.

How It All Began

On Aug. 24, 2022, Biden announced that the Department of Education will provide up to $20,000 in student loan cancellation, with individuals earning less than $125,000 ($250,000 for married couples), qualifying for this relief. The secretary of education then, on Aug. 30, 2022, issued a memorandum explaining its view that it had the authority under the HEROES Act to cancel student loans, reversing the opinion of the Trump administration that no such categorical authority exists.

The HEROES Act is a federal statute Congress passed in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks that, among other things, authorized the secretary of education to “waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student assistance programs” when the secretary deems it “necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency…” Under the HEROES Act, “the term ‘national emergency’ means a national emergency declared by the President of the United States.”

The Biden administration’s secretary of education on Oct. 12, published the terms of the student loan cancelation plan, justifying the action based on the presidential proclamation of a national emergency due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting “financial hardship arising out of the COVID–19 pandemic on individuals who owe student loans.” Since then, the administration has opened a portal to apply for loan cancelations, with the president claiming on Friday that 8 million borrowers had already submitted applications.

Even before the secretary of education published the terms of the Biden administration student-loan cancellation plan, litigation began. On Sept. 27, 2022, Frank Garrison filed suit against the Department of Education and Miguel Cardona, in his official capacity as the secretary of education, arguing the HEROES Act did not authorize the Department of Education to discharge student loans en masse. Garrison’s lawsuit further alleged the agency action violated the separation of powers principles and the “non-delegation” doctrine, which teaches that Congress holds “the lawmaking function” under our constitutional structure and cannot convey the authority to make laws to another branch of government.

In challenging the student-loan bailout plan, Garrison alleged as an injury that the Biden administration’s discharge plan would cause him to incur at least $1,000 state income tax liability that he would not otherwise incur. That tax liability would result because the Biden administration’s loan-forgiveness scheme was automatic, and under state law the discharge was taxable. Garrison, however, already qualifies to obtain loan forgiveness in approximately four years under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (“PSLF”) plan, and such debt cancellation is not taxed in Indiana. Thus, as Garrison alleged in his complaint, the Biden administration’s debt “forgiveness” plan injured him financially by imposing a state tax burden, entitling him to sue to challenge the secretary’s decree.

After Garrison filed suit, the Department of Education opted Garrison out of the loan forgiveness program and created an opt-out provision that would allow other individuals who would otherwise automatically receive relief to opt out of the program. This change sought to destroy Garrison’s claimed injury, and without an injury Garrison would lack “standing” to challenge the debt-bailout program.

The trial court agreed that Garrison lacked standing to challenge the loan-cancellation plan but concluded that the problem for Garrison was that Indiana caused his asserted injury by imposing a state tax liability, and thus it wasn’t a matter for the federal court. Accordingly, the court dismissed Garrison’s lawsuit and refused to consider whether the Biden administration acted beyond its constitutional and statutory authority.

On Oct. 4, 2022, in Brown County Taxpayers Association v. President Joseph R Biden Jr., a Wisconsin nonprofit organization filed a separate lawsuit challenging the loan-forgiveness plan. In its complaint, the Brown County Taxpayers Association presented the same arguments Garrison had made — that the Department of Education exceeded its authority under the HEROES Act and violated the separation of powers principles. The Brown County Taxpayers Association also argued that the Biden administration violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution by justifying the student loan debt relief plan with a race-based motive, stating the program was intended to help “black students,” “black borrowers,” and “other borrowers of color.”

A federal court dismissed Brown County Taxpayers Association’s lawsuit, concluding the organization lacked “standing” to sue because the only injury the group alleged was an injury to them as “taxpayers.” The Brown County Taxpayers Association sought to stay the Biden administration’s loan-forgiven program while it appealed the dismissal of its complaint. But on Thursday, Justice Amy Coney Barrett denied the Wisconsin organization’s request for an injunction pending appeal, which is unsurprising because, other than in limited circumstances involving the Establishment Clause, taxpayers lack standing to challenge government action.

On Thursday, a federal court in Missouri likewise dismissed a challenge to the loan-forgiveness program in Nebraska v. Biden, finding the plaintiffs in that case — the states of Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, and South Carolina — lacked standing to sue. And it was this decision, along with the Supreme Court’s refusal to stay the loan-forgiveness plan in the Brown County case, that President Biden touted on Friday as the courts agreeing with him, even though no court had yet reached the merits of the loan-forgiveness plan.

By Friday evening, the six plaintiff states had filed a motion for stay pending appeal with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and an emergency motion for administrative stay of agency action in Nebraska v. Biden. The Eighth Circuit granted that emergency motion and entered an order prohibiting the Biden administration from discharging any student loan debt until the court rules on the plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction pending appeal. The federal appellate court further ordered the Biden administration to file its response by Monday at 5:00 p.m., and the six states challenging the debt-forgiveness order to file their reply by Tuesday at 5:00 p.m.

To obtain an injunction pending appeal, the states must convince the Eighth Circuit that at least one state has standing and that the plaintiffs have a likelihood of succeeding in their challenge to the Biden administration’s student-loan forgiveness plan.

Arguing for State Standing

In arguing for standing, the six states first highlight the injury to Missouri, which, through its Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, or “MOHELA,” services student loans. Last fiscal year alone, MOHELA earned $88.9 million for servicing some 5.2 million accounts. That revenue, in turn, allows MOHELA to, among other things, fund scholarships. The Biden administration’s debt cancelation program will result in nearly half of all borrowers having “their debt completely” eliminated, which will injure MOHELA by greatly reducing its revenue stream, according to Missouri.

Missouri, along with Arkansas and Nebraska, point to another aspect of the Biden administration’s original debt relief plan to argue standing. Initially, in announcing the student-loan cancelation, the Department of Education told “borrowers with privately held federal student loans,” they could qualify for loan cancelation “by consolidating these loans into the Direct Loan program,” which is run by the federal government. Following that announcement, students consolidated millions in student loans to qualify for the discharge.

That consolidation injured Missouri, Arkansas, and Nebraska financially, the states argued because, for instance in Missouri, MOHELA used private loans to secure bonds and earned interest payments from the loans and fees in servicing the loans. The Arkansas Student Loan Authority likewise alleged an injury caused by the consolidation, with debtors consolidating $6 million of private loans, which in turn reduced the revenues earned by the state for administering the private loans. Nebraska argued the consolidation also harmed its financial interests by negatively affecting its investments in private loans.

The same day the states filed suit against the Biden administration, the secretary announced that borrowers with non-federally held student loans could no longer become eligible by consolidating those loans with the federally held Direct Loans. Those borrowers “who have applied to consolidate prior to Sept. 29,” however, remained eligible.

Based on this change in policy, the trial court held that Missouri, Arkansas, and Nebraska lacked standing to sue. The court also rejected Missouri’s argument that the reduced servicing revenue to MOHELA gave the state standing, reasoning that because the state’s general fund was not responsible for any deficit MOHELA might face, Missouri was not harmed by the loan cancellation. The federal district court also rejected the six states’ argument that they had standing to sue because the Biden administration’s plan will reduce state tax revenues, with the court reasoning that the states can modify their revenue codes.

In their briefing to the Eighth Circuit, Missouri, Arkansas, and Nebraska present a strong argument for standing, with each of the states identifying concrete financial harm caused by the Biden administration’s cancelation of the debt. And while consolidation of private loans is no longer permitted, that harm already occurred.

If the Eighth Circuit agrees, then it will consider the merits of the states’ lawsuit to determine if they have established a likelihood of success on their claim that the secretary of education exceeded his authority under the HEROES Act. On the merits, the states’ argument is even stronger given that the Biden administration’s loan cancellation plan universally wiped out student debt, reaching nearly half-a-trillion dollars in loans.

Here, the states are likely to succeed based on “the major-questions doctrine,” which teaches that “a federal agency may regulate on issues of immense ‘economic and political significance’ only with explicit congressional authorization.” The student-loan forgiveness plan has such immense “economic and political significance,” erasing, as it does, some $400 billion in federal student loan debt. Yet the HEROES Act contains no explicit authorization to eliminate student loans en masse based on income levels, indicating the Department of Education exceeded its authority in plotting to erase the debt. Accordingly, based on the “major-questions doctrine,” the Eighth Circuit should grant an injunction pending appeal.

A Few More Shots

Whether the Eighth Circuit will agree remains to be seen, but three other lawsuits challenging the Biden administration’s student-loan cancelation plan remain viable, with two currently poised for rulings this week.

On Tuesday, federal Judge Mark Pittman, a Trump appointee, will hear a motion for a preliminary injunction brought by two plaintiffs, Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor, both of whom owe student loans but do not qualify for debt cancelation, either at all or not completely. Brown owes commercially held student loans, and as such, does not qualify under the terms of the Biden plan, while Taylor only qualifies for a $10,000 cancelation because he did not receive any Pell Grants while in college.

Brown and Taylor argue that the Department of Education’s cancelation program is arbitrary and that had the secretary complied with the notice and comment mandates of the Administration Procedure Act, they and similarly situated debtors could have convinced the department to provide them relief. The Biden administration counters that the HEROES Act is exempt from the Administration Procedures Act and that these plaintiffs lack standing to sue.

Also poised for decision this week is the CATO Institute’s lawsuit against the Biden administration. On Friday, the nonprofit organization filed a motion for a temporary restraining order in a federal court in Kansas, seeking to freeze any loan cancellation during the pendency of its legal challenge.

Like the majority of the other plaintiffs, the CATO Institute argues that the Biden administration lacked authority under the HEROES Act to unilaterally cancel student loans. To establish standing, the CATO Institute highlights its status as a nonprofit organization, which benefits from the student-loan forgiveness program Congress established for debtors who work in the nonprofit sector for 10 years. Biden’s categorical cancellation of student loans will harm CATO and other nonprofits, the institute argues, since potential employees with student loans will no longer find it advantageous to work for a nonprofit.

Presiding Judge Toby Crouse, a Trump appointee, has not yet ruled on CATO’s motion for a temporary restraining order, but a decision or a hearing schedule should be forthcoming soon.

Arizona’s Attorney General Mark Brnovich presented an argument similar to CATO’s in a lawsuit filed against the Biden administration in an Arizona federal court. In Arizona’s complaint, Brnovich argues that the congressionally established cancelation of student loans for government lawyers allows his office to recruit better candidates and that by canceling student loans, Arizona is harmed. Arizona also argues the loan-cancelation plan harms the state by reducing its tax revenues. Arizona has not yet filed a motion to enjoin the cancelation of any loans, however, although such a motion could be forthcoming this week.

It seems likely that in at least one of these four cases, the court will find standing and enter a preliminary injunction preventing the cancelation of any student loans. But if not, contrary to Biden’s spin, that does not mean the courts agreed the Department of Education acted within its authority. It just means the Biden administration devised a scheme to prevent anyone from having standing to challenge the law. And that strategy is every bit as shameless as the regulatory loan “forgiveness” timed with midterm elections.

‘Catholic’ Biden Invokes Morality To Push Trans Mutilation Of Kids,"Image Credit NowThis News/YouTube

President Joe Biden, a self-described Catholic, affirmed in word and deed the mutilative practice of abusive, irreversible gender surgeries and “treatments” in an interview that aired Sunday.

During a NowThis News presidential forum at the White House, the president allowed himself to be interviewed by Dylan Mulvaney, a man who became TikTok-famous for his series called “100 Days of Girlhood” documenting his supposed “transition” to becoming a girl. (Mulvaney also did a recent podcast interview with makeup brand Ulta Beauty on “The Beauty of … Girlhood,” and the backlash contributed to Ulta’s stock value falling last week.)

The Biden interview began with Mulvaney stating “Mr. President, this is my 221st day of publicly transitioning,” to which Biden interjected in his classic Catholic-appropriating diction “God love you.” Mulvaney then asked Biden if he thought “states should have a right to ban gender-affirming health care.” (By bans on “gender-affirming health care,” Mulvaney was referring to state restrictions on health professionals administering cross-sex hormones and mutilative genital surgeries to children.)

Biden responded by saying that protecting minors from things like puberty blockers, chemical castration, and irreversible surgeries is “wrong” both legally and morally. “I don’t think any state or anybody should have the right to do that, as a moral question and as a legal question,” said Biden. “I just think it’s wrong.”

Later in the interview, Biden reiterated his belief that transgenderism possesses the moral high ground and Republican lawmakers seeking to protect children do not. “The idea that what’s going on in some states … it’s just outrageous, and I think it’s immoral. The trans part’s not immoral. What they’re trying to do to trans persons is immoral,” he stated.

The Federalist reached out to the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops and USCCB president, Archbishop José Horacio Gómez, for comment on Biden’s remarks, but did not hear back by publication time.

Historically, the Catholic Church of which Biden claims to be a part expresses a different take on human sexuality. The Church teaches that people are born either biologically male or female. Moreover, the Church instructs Catholics, like Biden, to not support and fuel gender dysphoria, which is a serious mental disorder that denounces truth and biology.

In the Vatican’s 2019 condemnation of the gender revolution and its denial of the “metaphysical roots of sexual difference,” the Church also argued the trans agenda is an attack on the family and that children must be protected from gender activists’ perverted ideology.

While Biden expressed full support of the transgender agenda in contradiction to the Church’s teachings, he couldn’t cognitively separate transgendering kids from the idea of child abuse.

At the end of the interview, Biden made a true Freudian slip and began talking about his late son Beau Biden’s foundation “for abused children,” after Mulvaney asked him an unrelated question about families accessing trans “resources.”

“[Beau] started a foundation […] for abused children. And one of the things he did is raised millions of dollars for this organization to basically educate parents as to what they should not be afraid of. And to educate the community as to what is just pure hyperbole,” said Biden.

The Beau Biden Foundation’s expressed mission is to protect children from sexual predators, particularly by educating children, parents, and child welfare professionals and also bolstering “national child protection laws.”

Indeed, the Beau Biden Foundation seems particularly relevant to the topic of chemically castrating and mutilating children for the sick pleasure of predatory trans activists. Welfare professionals, parents, and children also need to be better educated on the often irreversible damages and long-term health problems that come with “transitioning” minors whose brains are not even fully developed to consent to such “treatment.” Moreover, state and national laws should do more to protect children from these abusive and damaging hormones and procedures.

Perhaps the president intended to suggest that parents would be the potential abusers in a situation where their child rejected his biology. That accusation is terrifying — and disastrously ignores who is inflicting real pain and damage on confused kids.

Either way, Biden doesn’t seem to notice the irony in promoting Beau’s anti-child abuse foundation while simultaneously supporting the radical trans movement that specializes in abusing minors. Not only did he endorse the butchering and psychological torment of children, but he did it while invoking things like God and morality, maliciously distorting sacred and clear Catholic teachings.

Joe Biden Is Literally Falling Asleep On The Job,"President Joe Biden appeared to suffer an awkward nap attack during an MSNBC interview that aired Friday, in just the most recent example of the president’s dangerous cognitive decline (and of the corporate press totally ignoring that it happened).

In a conversation with MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart about (ironically) his plans to run for a second term, Biden’s eyelids drooped and he started nodding off, creating an embarrassing pause. It prompted Capehart to smile awkwardly and say “Mr. President…” and then “ope!” as Biden’s eyes fluttered open.

“Dr. Biden thinks that uh, my wife thinks that uh, [long pause] that I uh, that we’re, that we’re doing something very important,” the president sputtered.

Joe Biden seems to legit fall asleep during this interview. He just keeps getting worse: pic.twitter.com/4quPIC9fbJ — Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) October 22, 2022

It’s not the first time Biden has appeared to fall asleep in the course of his presidential duties. In a July summit in Saudi Arabia, he was caught on video in what looked like an incident of catching Zs during a speech by Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani. (At least the latter is relatable, as nodding off in a one-on-one interview takes even more nerve than snoozing through a long-winded speech.)

Watch him at the 20:12 minute mark:

“Fact” “checker” PolitiFact, which is surprisingly informative once you realize its verdicts are often indicators that the truth is the opposite of its conclusions, insisted Biden wasn’t actually dozing in the clip, mostly just because PolitiFact writers decided they didn’t think he was asleep.

“Although he does at points have his head bowed and his eyes lowered, he keeps shifting positions, moving his hands and raising his head and eyes. He appears to simply be listening, not sleeping,” is the outlet’s cold-hard-fact rebuttal.

During a climate summit in November 2021, Biden’s nap was so obvious even the corporate media couldn’t explain it away.

Biden’s track record notwithstanding, regime-loyal media were happy to bury the story of his most recent televised gaffe, ignoring the president’s cognitive deterioration after spending four years screeching about his predecessor’s mental state based on far flimsier evidence.

Here’s how the propagandists at The Washington Post covered the exchange:

When asked if the first lady supports a 2024 run, Biden nodded and paused before providing a full answer. ‘My wife thinks that we’re doing something very important and that I shouldn’t walk away from it,’ he said.

The article even admitted that Biden “was the oldest person to be sworn into office [and] has faced questions from his own party about whether he should seek reelection, due [partly] to his age,” but then proceeded to explain why “the reemergence of former president Donald Trump” necessitated another Biden run.

In a curt summary of the exchange, NBC News reported that “Biden indicated first lady Jill Biden is supportive of a potential second term.” CNN and The New York Times offered similarly under-informative reports.

That’s quite the change of tune from the four years of the Trump presidency in which left-wing journalists invented opportunity after opportunity to cast doubt on that president’s mental dexterity. Here are just a few examples of media outlets ginning up fears that Trump, who is a few years younger than Biden, was in cognitive decline and deserve to be removed from office:

“Is Something Neurologically Wrong With Donald Trump?” The Atlantic, 2018

“Trump Is Mentally Unfit To Be President,” USA Today opinion contributor, 2020

“The 25th Amendment Proves Why Trump’s Mental Health Matters,” NBC News, 2017

“It’s Officially Fair to Question Donald Trump’s Mental Fitness,” GQ, 2018

“Trump Is Mentally Unfit, No Exam Needed,” New York Times op-ed, 2019

What aberrant behaviors prompted this kind of concern? In the above Atlantic article (which clocked in at more than 3,500 words), the only examples offered were one instance of “slurred speech” which “could result … from a dry mouth,” the evolution of Trump’s speaking style and his unique diction, drinking a glass of water with both hands, and “conspicuously drinking water during a speech.”

What Trump didn’t do in all four years of his presidency was doze off in the middle of his own televised interview. That’s a Joe Biden special.

Biden Can't Even Escape Mockery On TikTok In Hilarious Trend,"A recent TikTok trend is using a hilarious audio recording of President Biden epically failing to convince Americans he is “mentally focused.” The gaffe comes from a September interview on “60 Minutes” when CBS correspondent Scott Pelley asked Biden about his mental capacity to run the United States. “How would you say your mental focus is?” asked Pelley, to which Biden responded by rambling off a slew of bizarre and incoherent fragments. “Oh it’s focused,” answered Biden with a laugh. “I’d say it’s — I think it’s — I haven’t. Look, I have trouble even mentioning, even saying to myself, my own head, the number of years. I no more think of myself as being as old as I am than fly.”

Social media users seized the audio and have used it for a host of comedic content. One user lip-synced to Biden’s response but changed the words to “mental focus after three kids,” writing in her caption “You could say I have Biden brain.”

https://www.tiktok.com/@meghandeese/video/7158211595951263022?_r=1&_t=8XR13hAlXJ5&is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7158211595951263022

These two police officers played the Biden gaffe to explain their deteriorating attention spans due to watching too much TikTok.

A mom likened Biden’s response to what her daughter says when asked about how her day was at school.

This girl said the Biden gaffe was like “an actual replay of the day [she] was diagnosed with ADHD.”

One woman joked that the gaffe was similar to her “focus during prayer.”

A student used the quote to show what it’s like when his English teacher asks for his thoughts on an assigned reading he didn’t do.

One man compared the Biden gaffe to athletes taking a concussion test.

This isn’t the first time TikTokers have turned an embarrassing Biden gaffe into a hilarious trend. Gym-going TikTokers have been mocking Biden for an unintelligible “motivational” quote for months now. Both TikTok trends are funny, but Biden’s cognitive decline is no joke.

The president’s bizarre response to a question about his mental faculties ironically proved that he is not at all “mentally focused.” Practically every week there are new Biden gaffes to reinforce the unsettling feeling that our president is not fit to serve. At a news conference in Bali on Monday, the president couldn’t read from a paper that reportedly contained a list of pre-approved reporters for him to call on. “Um—uh, I’m having trouble reading this,” said Biden. “Reuters, Natandya Bo—Bose.” The reporter’s name is Nandita Bose.

Twice last week Biden mixed up Colombia and Cambodia. The first time was ahead of his trip to Cambodia for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit when he told reporters he was “heading over to Colombia.” The second time was during the summit when he referred to the ASEAN chair, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, as the prime minister of Columbia.

Fox News reported that between Sept. 26 to Oct. 24, while Biden was on the campaign trail for Democrats ahead of the midterms, he averaged nearly a gaffe per day. Notably, he called General Motors CEO Mary Barra “Amy Barrett.” Barrett is not in fact the CEO of General Motors, but a Supreme Court justice. Then he referred to Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., as a “friend in the Senate,” and he even forgot the name of a candidate he was at that time endorsing in Maryland. “And, of course, you got that next governor. What’s his name? Wes… Wes…” said Biden at the get-out-the-vote rally. He then turned to the audience members holding “Wes Moore” signs and exclaimed “Wes Moore!” once he read the candidate’s name on their posters. “The guy’s the real deal, man.”

Perhaps the worst Biden gaffe in recent memory was during the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, when the president asked for the late Rep. Jackie Walorski, R-Ind., who had been killed the month prior in a tragic car accident with two members of her staff.

During the following White House press conference, reporter after reporter (from both sides of the political aisle) grilled Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, asking repeatedly what the president meant by “Where’s Jackie?” and whether Biden was aware of Walorski’s death. Jean-Pierre clumsily dodged each question with the confusing answer that Walorski was “top of mind” for the president.

Biden’s health concerns are deeply serious. Clearly, the leader of the free world is not in his right mind. His deteriorating mental faculties have made America the laughingstock of international news outlets and made our country appear vulnerable to foreign adversaries, particularly in China. It also begs the disquieting question, since Biden’s cognitive state indicates he is incapable of leading the country: who is behind the scenes running the show?

"After Biden Buys Votes With Loan Bailout, SCOTUS To Weigh In","The Supreme Court will decide whether the Biden administration acted lawlessly when it authorized the cancellation of hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans. The high court announced on Thursday that it would expedite an appeal brought by the Biden administration challenging a lower court’s injunction freezing its loan “forgiveness” program, promising a hearing in February on the issues.

Until then, the Supreme Court will let stand the injunction the Eighth Circuit issued in Nebraska v. Biden. That injunction prevents the Biden administration from cancelling student loans of up to $20,000 per borrower, pending resolution of the legal challenge to the debt-forgiveness plan brought by six states: Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Carolina.

In petitioning the Supreme Court for relief, the Biden administration initially sought an order vacating the Eighth Circuit’s injunction, but the administration argued alternatively that, if the high court declined to dissolve the injunction, it should instead hear the case on appeal on an expedited schedule. The Supreme Court’s decision to take the case on appeal presents a unique situation, given that the Eighth Circuit has not yet addressed the merits of the states’ lawsuit.

Come February then, the Supreme Court will need to decide whether the lower court erred in finding that the states lacked standing to challenge the Biden administration’s cancellation of student loans. The states present an array of arguments for why they had standing, or the legal ability to sue, with Missouri advancing the strongest argument for standing.

Specifically, Missouri maintains loan forgiveness will harm the state because the state, throughout its Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, or MOHELA, raises funds to support grants and further loans by processing student loans. Fewer student loans to process, because of loan forgiveness, means fewer resources flowing to MOHELA, according to the state, and thus Missouri has standing, they argue.

If the Supreme Court concludes at least one state has standing to sue, the case can proceed. Then the question will be whether the Biden administration had authority under the HEROES Act to bail out the loans. The HEROES Act is a federal statute Congress passed following the 9/11 attacks that, among other things, authorized the secretary of education to “waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student assistance programs” when the secretary deems it “necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency…”

Because the HEROES Act defines the term “national emergency” to include “a national emergency declared by the President of the United States,” the Biden administration maintained that its secretary of education can “modify” the student assistance programs by cancelling the principle of those loans. The states, as well as other plaintiffs who have challenged the loan-cancellation program, counter that canceling student loans is not a “modification” or “waiver” of a program and that, in any event, Covid did not cause the debtors’ financial difficulties.

Those challenging the Biden administration’s loan bailout also rely on “the major-questions doctrine,” which teaches that “a federal agency may regulate on issues of immense ‘economic and political significance’ only with explicit congressional authorization.” Because the student-loan forgiveness plan has immense “economic and political significance,” but the HEROES Act contains no explicit authorization to eliminate student loans based on income levels, the states argue the HEROES Act cannot be read to authorize the loan cancellation.

These arguments, while seemingly mundane, present a political risk to Biden when the Supreme Court hears the case in February, first because the Biden administration purposefully crafted the loan-cancellation program in a way to prevent anyone from obtaining standing. Such gamesmanship seems unlikely to impress the Supreme Court and, in fact, risks censure by the justices.

Likewise, oral argument over the scope of the HEROES Act seems likely to prove embarrassing to the Biden administration, given that its economy, policies, and runaway inflation hold more direct responsibility for the hardships experienced by many debtors than Covid. The justices will likely also push the Biden administration on separation-of-powers concerns, on Congress’s refusal to pass a loan-forgiveness plan, and on the president’s political posturing related to student loan cancellation.

The Biden administration may also face more tough questions if, before February’s hearing, the Supreme Court consolidates the government’s appeal of a Texas district court decision vacating the loan-forgiveness program. In that case, Brown v. United States, debtors filed suit against the administration arguing the government exceeded its authority under the HEROES Act and acted arbitrarily. The district court agreed and “vacated,” or declared a nullity, the loan cancellation plan.

The government appealed the district court’s decision and sought a stay pending appeal in the Fifth Circuit. In its filings to the Supreme Court in Nebraska v. Biden, the president explained that if the Fifth Circuit denies a stay, the Biden administration intends to seek relief from the high court. If it does, it is likely the Supreme Court will consolidate the Brown case with the Nebraska case.

The Biden administration will then face a doubly tough appeal because the Brown plaintiffs present a separate theory for standing. Namely, they claim that as students denied full loan cancellations, they suffered an injury. The Brown plaintiffs also expose the arbitrariness of the loan-forgiveness program, with one of the plaintiffs earning substantially less than the earnings cap, but still limited to $10,000 in loan forgiveness because the borrower had not received any Pell Grants while in college — a requirement established by the Biden administration to qualify for $20,000 in loan forgiveness.

The Biden administration might not care about losing in the Supreme Court, however, as it succeeded in rolling out the loan cancellation plan before the midterms. And if the Supreme Court eventually strikes the plan down, Democrats can pretend they kept their pledge to college students and place blame instead on the conservative justices — just in time to make the Supreme Court an issue for the next election.

"If A Legitimate Free Press Existed, The Twitter Files Wouldn’t","Twitter management knew immediately they had bombed big time when the tech giant censored the Hunter Biden laptop story, internal communications published on Friday by independent journalist Matt Taibbi reveal. Little else surprising emerged from the first installment of “The Twitter Files,” but the concrete proof provided by new owner Elon Musk of Twitter’s entanglement with the government and Democrat interests nonetheless vindicated conservatives who have been screaming for years of Big Tech’s squelching of their speech.

The Twitter Files should raise the ire of all Americans, however, and not because of what they expose about tech companies — but because they illustrate the corporate media’s complicity in the censorship of stories that prove harmful to powerful people and preferred politicians.

A little over a week ago, Musk tweeted a promise to release evidence of the company’s “free speech suppression” in what he branded The Twitter Files. “The public deserves to know what really happened,” the new Twitter owner stressed. Late Friday, Musk kept his promise when Taibbi published a detailed Twitter thread highlighting, with screen grabs, high-level internal Twitter discussions concerning the company’s censorship of posts and specifically the blocking of the New York Post’s story about the Hunter Biden laptop.

The Post published its exclusive bombshell report on emails culled from a laptop Hunter Biden abandoned at a Delaware computer repair store a mere three weeks before the U.S. presidential election. “How Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian businessman to VP dad,” the Post titled its Oct. 14, 2020 story that then opened by detailing that an email confirmed Hunter had introduced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive at the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma “less than a year before the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company.” The email to Hunter, dated April 17, 2015, came from Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of Burisma — a board on which Hunter served “at a reported salary of up to $50,000 a month,” according to the Post’s article.

Soon after the Post broke the story, Twitter and Facebook “deprecated” the story, meaning the social media giants prevented the algorithm code from allowing the story to be amplified. By mid-afternoon, however, Twitter moved to banning the sharing of the story both in tweets and in direct messages. At the time, “Twitter representatives pointed press to the company’s hacked material policy, which prohibits sharing links to or images of hacked content. Twitter’s guidelines for blocking URLs, which were updated this July, also include provisions for hacked material and content that ‘interferes with civic and election integrity.’”

Twitter’s staff went further, though, locking out the Post’s primary Twitter account (@nypost), claiming in a letter to the outlet that “the Hunter Biden stories violate its rules against the ‘distribution of hacked material.’” Twitter also locked Trump spokeswoman Kaleigh McEnany out of her account merely for tweeting about the story.

Twitter reinstated McEnany’s account the following day and later reversed itself, allowing the Post’s article to be shared. However, the Post remained locked out of Twitter for another two weeks, preventing the outlet from directly sharing its many follow-up articles, such as its Oct. 15, 2020, piece that revealed additional emails obtained from Hunter’s abandoned laptop.

That article discussed email exchanges concerning a business venture Hunter was negotiating with CEFC China Energy — an investment Hunter said would be “interesting for me and my family.” Another email featured in the Post’s follow-up article was sent to Hunter and included the subject line “Expectations.” The email detailed the “remuneration packages” planned for six individuals “involved in an unspecified business venture” and floated as a suggested share, “10 held by H for the big guy?” A former Biden business associate, Tony Bobulinski, would later claim in a late-October 2022, Tucker Carlson interview that the referenced “big guy” was Joe Biden.

In Friday’s Twitter Files, Taibbi revealed that while still blocking the story, Twitter insiders were questioning the legitimacy of the censorship decision. “Can we truthfully claim that this is part of the policy?” the then-Vice President of Global Communications Brandon Borrman asked in response to the Twitter team framing the ban as based on Twitter’s hacked policy.

In response, Twitter’s then-Deputy General Counsel Jim Baker framed the censorship decision as based on “caution.” “There are some facts that indicate that the materials may have been hacked, while there are others indicating that the computer was either abandoned and/or the owner consented to allow the repair shop to access it for a least some purposes,” Baker wrote in an internal email.

Taibbi highlighted these emails and others; he also revealed details from interviews he had with Twitter sources. And noting he had obtained thousands of internal documents, Taibbi promised more revelations in the days to come.

But even as Taibbi’s reporting confirmed Twitter’s unprincipled censorship of the Post’s story, because there was no single smoking gun among the details dropped, the same news media that buried the Biden-family scandal mere weeks before the 2020 presidential election — or falsely reported it was misinformation — mocked Taibbi, claiming he had fallen from a respected journalist to running “PR for the world’s richest man.”

The projection from these supposed reporters couldn’t have been any more ironic because had there been a widespread outbreak of journalism following the Post’s bombshell coverage of the Biden family scandal, Twitter’s censorship would not have happened — or, if it did, it would not have mattered.

Had journalists from legacy outlets and especially the supposed standard-bearers of journalism, such as The New York Times and The Washington Post, approached the story with the seriousness it deserved, it seems unlikely Twitter would have dared censor the story. Or such censorship, had it occurred, would have been futile because journalists would be falling over themselves to report the latest details in a political scandal that suggested the Democrat candidate for president had participated in a pay-to-play enterprise with his son while vice president.

Real journalists would have tracked down and authenticated the laptop materials, as they did a belated two years later. Real journalists would have questioned Bobulinski and reported his collaborating statements. Real journalists would have demanded answers from Joe, Hunter, and James Biden, the president’s brother who also profited from the many deals; they would have sought answers on every detail suggesting corruption discussed in the emails and other materials recovered from the laptop. And real journalists would have pushed intelligence agencies, and the former members of them who signed on to a letter casting the laptop as Russian disinformation, on the basis for that claim.

Nothing Twitter did or could have done would have buried the Biden family scandal story had journalists just done their jobs. But they didn’t, and a retrospective review of their contemporaneous “reporting” shows they took pride in their non-coverage, as best illustrated by an Oct. 18, 2020, CNN story titled “The Anatomy of the New York Post’s Dubious Hunter Biden Story.”

In reference to the bombshell story, Brian Stelter called it “a classic example of the right-wing media machine.” The story is a “manufactured scandal,” the former host of CNN’s “Reliable Sources” said. Yochai Benkler, a Harvard Law School professor, agreed with Stelter, telling him approvingly, “The media world has largely ignored the Post’s Hunter Biden story.” Trump’s team is “so confident that the story’s just going to be too much fun for serious journalists not to pick up,” Benkler added. “They’re trying to produce it now, but the media at the moment — major professional media — doesn’t seem to be falling for it.”

PolitiFact likewise celebrated the media’s refusal to cover the Biden family scandal story, writing that “no credible news outlets have reported any wrongdoing or role held by Joe Biden…” And NPR announced it was not covering the story because it didn’t “want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories,” and didn’t “want to waste the listeners’ and readers’ time on stories that are just pure distractions.”

For all the outrage and anger directed at old Twitter for its censorship of the Biden family scandal, the lack of a vibrant journalistic class proved more problematic to free speech. And for all the kudos and back-patting bestowed on Musk for his efforts to remake Twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech, reforming Big Tech will do nothing to right the news media — and the condescension dripped on Musk and Taibbi since Friday show the corrupt journalists have no intention of curing themselves.

"Under Joe Biden, Threat Of Nuclear War Has Gone Up","Ten months after Russia invaded Ukraine and two years into the disaster-prone Biden presidency, there’s no denying the world is at a greater risk of nuclear escalation — not just in Eastern Europe, but also on the other side of the world in the South China Sea.

A majority of Americans overwhelmingly don’t want to go to war with Russia over Ukraine, especially as the conflict escalates to nuclear levels. Yet, objective reality indicates that, under President Joe Biden’s leadership, the U.S. is not only committed to an indefinite proxy war, but has only increased its contemplation of the use of tactical nuclear weapons.

Just this week, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, admitted that at the beginning of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, he believed the chance of nuclear war to be zero. Now, he knows that the possibility of using nuclear weapons has changed.

“Look, Ukraine is a tragedy of monumental proportions, but it could actually be worse because if you asked me a year ago when this war began, ‘What are the chances that it will degrade to tactical nuclear weapons,’ which is sort of a longer way of saying, ‘entering nuclear weapons,’ I would have told you zero,” Netanyahu told Chuck Todd on Sunday’s “Meet the Press.” “Today, I would still say that the odds are very low but they’re not zero. And that could be the greatest tragedy of all because in three quarters of a century, we have not crossed that threshold. We must not cross that threshold.”

Netanyahu isn’t the only one who thinks the world is much closer to nuclear conflict now than before. A majority of Americans, 69 percent, say they are “extremely” or “somewhat” concerned that the world could experience a thermonuclear war within the next five years. That number is up 8 percent since November 2021.

Even corrupt corporate media are willing to acknowledge the risk of nuclear war is “now a daily issue for the Biden administration.”

What they refuse to admit, however, is that Biden’s leadership (or lack thereof) has significantly contributed to that increased threat. Instead of questioning Biden’s penchant for escalation, the propaganda press blames Vladimir Putin not just for his own aggression but also for any failures of the American president.

It’s true that Putin’s wartime rhetoric and actions are not short on portending nuclear disaster, but neither are Biden’s.

“First time since the Cuban missile crisis, we have a direct threat of the use (of a) nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path they are going,” Biden told attendees at a Democrat fundraiser in New York in October. “I don’t think there’s any such thing as the ability to easily (use) a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon.”

Biden’s comments paired with the tens of billions of American taxpayer dollars flowing to Ukraine demonstrate that he is not backing down. As a matter of fact, Biden and his administration have done nothing but reassure Americans who say they don’t trust the Democrat to handle this conflict well that if Russia goes nuclear, the U.S. will too.

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan confirmed that the White House is not above escalation in the form of retaliatory nuclear assault when he staunchly refused to deny that the U.S. would enter a war with Russia if Putin deployed nuclear weapons.

That was after he promised that “any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia.”

“We have communicated directly, privately, and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the U.S. and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail,” Sullivan said on “Face The Nation” in September.

White House National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby similarly confirmed that “the stakes are very high right now.”

“The president was accurately reflecting the fact that the stakes are very high right now.”



National Security Council spokesman John Kirby tells @MarthaRaddatz that Pres. Biden’s warning about nuclear weapons follows Putin’s “irresponsible rhetoric.” https://t.co/AVno0YUpZU pic.twitter.com/MOEyFS3mj4 — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) October 9, 2022

The Biden administration hasn’t just signaled the willingness to go nuclear, it has also enabled Putin to escalate with nukes if he wants to. By signing off on Nord Stream 2, Biden helped give Putin the hegemonic confidence he needed to make a power grab in Ukraine.

“Nothing is going to stop them [Russia] now marching deeper into Ukraine, because their gas pipeline system — I mean the Ukrainian one — is going to be redundant pretty soon after the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is completely established and fully operational,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki predicted in June of 2021.

Similarly, it was Biden’s laxity with China that opened the door for Xi Jinping to further follow through on his own hegemonic desires. Despite Xi’s recent demonstrations of weaponry, the Biden administration still has made no formal announcement about defending Taiwan against China’s expansion, with Biden instead making off-the-cuff declarations that are quickly walked back by his staff. In the meantime, China is stockpiling hundreds of nuclear warheads.

There’s no denying the Biden administration’s history of seriously discussing nuclear aggravation. Yet, the media deliberately leaves the White House out of their finger-pointing. That decision is especially insulting given the press’s treatment of former president Donald Trump when it came to nukes.

For more than four years, the media and their Democrat allies accused Trump of bringing the world closer to the brink of nuclear war, only to be met with four years of peace. Contrast that with months of Trump accurately noting that the Biden administration’s dangerous pivot towards escalation has the potential to lead us straight into a nuclear conflict with dire consequences.

“We have to be very smart and very nimble. We have to know what to say, what to do. And we are saying exactly the wrong thing. We’ll end up in a World War III,” Trump said at an October rally in Arizona. “We must demand immediate negotiation of a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine, or we will end up in World War III and there will never be a war like this. We will never have had a war like this and that’s all because of stupid people that don’t have a clue. And it’s also because of the kind of weaponry that’s available today.”

During another October rally, Trump warned his followers about the “n-word”– “nuclear.”

“The N-word is the nuclear word, and the nuclear word is something that’s not supposed to be discussed. You don’t talk about it. You don’t talk about it, but Putin’s been talking about it,” Trump said.

Instead of taking Trump’s warnings about the threat of nuclear war under Biden seriously, The Washington Post used the moment as an opportunity to accuse Trump of flirting with racism.

As my colleague John Daniel Davidson noted in April, “The chances that Putin will accept total defeat in Ukraine without escalation that involves the use of nuclear weapons, or that involves widening the war, are probably lower than most Americans are comfortable with.” Meanwhile, Xi in China is asserting power over his own people and over his country’s neighbors more aggressively too.

Putin isn’t backing down anytime soon and the Biden administration, as it has publicly made clear, isn’t either. Unless someone gives, the U.S. could be doomed to a nuclear tit-for-tat war with Russia over Ukraine, which Biden is doing nothing to stop. And while the Biden administration is busy dealing with Russia and depleting U.S. defense resources for Ukraine, Xi has pledged his willingness to take “all measures necessary” to expand the Chinese Communist Party’s rule to Taiwan.

The White House’s Antisemitism Roundtable Was A Sham,"Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff brought together representatives of a handful of Jewish organizations — notably not the ones who’ve taken issue with Biden policies that hurt Jews and Israel — to discuss Jew-hatred in a Wednesday roundtable on antisemitism. While this roundtable could have been a good first step, on antisemitism, the Biden administration must actually walk the walk.

The event was reportedly staffed by White House Domestic Policy Adviser Susan Rice, advisers Keisha Lance Bottoms, Josh Geltzer, and Shelley Greenspan, and the special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt. Groups in attendance included the left-wing Anti-Defamation League and National Council of Jewish Women, the American Jewish Committee, headed by former Democrat Congressman Ted Deutch, representatives of the major religious streams of Judaism, some campus groups, the Jewish Federations, and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.

Yet the Zionist Organization of America, the leading major American Jewish organization unapologetically defending Israel and the Jewish people, was not invited to the roundtable, nor were other organizations that have criticized left-wing antisemitism or President Joe Biden’s dangerous-to-Jews policies, appointees, and supporters.

President Biden tweeted that “silence is complicity” when it comes to Holocaust denial. I agree. Therefore, the Biden administration should immediately and vociferously denounce Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Ph.D. thesis, from a Soviet university, was a denial of the Holocaust that he then expanded into a book. Abbas has repeated this stance numerous times, yet President Biden calls him “my friend.”

The Palestinian Authority pays terrorists to murder Jews and Americans in Israel, and it does so with American taxpayer dollars. This “pay to slay” program awards lifelong stipends to Palestinian Jew-killers or their families; the more Jews they kill, the more money they make. Abiding by American law, the Taylor Force Act, then-President Donald Trump ended direct funding to the Palestinian Authority, but almost as soon as he took office, President Biden found ways to restore that money. You can’t sincerely decry antisemitism if you give money to people who kill Jews.

Furthermore, Abbas himself was reportedly the financier of the 1972 Munich Olympic Massacre in which Israeli athletes and coaches were kidnapped, tortured, and killed. Abbas is not a moderate, but a blood-soaked terrorist — and yet President Biden calls him a “partner” and seeks to increase engagement with his corrupt regime, which has repeatedly rejected offers of statehood made by the Israelis. Abbas should be utterly condemned.

Biden Administration’s Antisemite Staff

Not long ago, President Biden elevated Hady Amr to the position of special envoy to the Palestinians. Amr is notorious for writing, “I was inspired by the Palestinian intifada,” the terror wars in which Palestinian Arab terrorists murdered or maimed 10,000 Jews. If silence on antisemitism is complicity, what is hiring and promoting someone who finds the murder of Jews inspiring?

The Biden administration is staffed up and down, including in important roles, by appointees with varying degrees of animus toward Jews and Israel.

Current U.S. special envoy on Iran Robert Malley has met with Hamas, a U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group. Malley helped negotiate then-President Barack Obama’s catastrophic Iran deal, which, in the Biden administration, he has sought to rejoin officially and to unofficially appease Iran at every turn. The nuke-seeking mullahs of Iran, who chant “death to America” as well as “death to Israel,” have sworn to wipe Israel — and the millions of Jews who live there — off the map.

Biden Administration Friendly with Antisemites

Secretary of State Antony Blinken brought Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., to the World Cup in Qatar and, in so doing, the Biden administration is effectively mainstreaming her antisemitism. Omar has compared the U.S. and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban. Promoting age-old canards that Jews are money-grubbing evildoers who seek to control the world, she has tweeted regarding Israel that “It’s all about the Benjamins baby” and “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” Even President Biden’s own antisemitism envoy, Ambassador Lipstadt, who attended the roundtable, has acknowledged that these comments and others accusing American Jews of dual loyalty are antisemitic.

While she didn’t get a free trip to Qatar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., has earned explicit praise from Biden, who said, “I tell you what, Rashida — and I want to say to you that I admire your intellect, I admire your passion, and I admire your concern for so many other people.” Those people, apparently, do not include the Jews who live in Israel. Tlaib has retweeted, “From the river to the sea Palestine will be free,” an explicit call for the replacement of Israel with an Arab supremacist terror state, if not a complete genocide of the Jews.

Biden cannot be serious about battling antisemitism when he embraces Jew-haters and allows bigotry against Jews to flourish in the United States. There have been numerous opportunities for the administration to act against the epidemic of physical assaults on Jews and the surge in campus Jew-hatred. Jewish Americans are, per capita, targeted in more hate crimes than any other group of people. Nearly two-thirds of Jewish college students feel unsafe on campus and half feel the need to hide their Jewish identity.

The Zionist Organization of America led the charge for including Jewish students under the protections of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act; in fact, we were alone for much of that battle. More than any other organization, our Center for Law and Justice has filed cases and engaged educational entities through the legal process to battle Jew-hatred under Title VI, while the Biden administration ignores its application to Jews. Any serious effort to combat antisemitism would benefit from our expertise.

Antisemitism is possibly the one position right-wing and left-wing extremists agree on. Biden must take real action, not try to score partisan points. Politicizing the suffering of the Jewish people is inexcusable.

Morton A. Klein is national president of the Zionist Organization of America and is widely regarded as one of the leading Jewish activists in the United States.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/09/the-white-houses-antisemitism-roundtable-was-a-sham/,2022-12-09
Hunter Biden's Strategy To Go On The Offensive Indicts The Feds,"Two months after the FBI subpoenaed the laptop Hunter Biden had abandoned at a Delaware computer repair store, the Drug Enforcement Administration searched the office of Hunter’s one-time psychiatrist Keith Ablow and seized a second laptop Hunter had left with him. The timing of the DEA raid and the fact that criminal charges were never filed against Ablow, coupled with whistleblowers’ claims that the FBI buried evidence against Hunter Biden, raises the question of whether the search was a pretext to recover Hunter’s laptop and protect the Biden family.

While the DEA’s recovery of the second Hunter Biden laptop escaped scrutiny over the last nearly three years, a Washington Post article from Saturday brings that laptop into focus — and with it questions about the DEA’s seizure of the laptop and agents’ decision to return it to Hunter.

Back in the News

In a weekend article titled “Some Hunter Biden Allies Making Plans to go After His Accusers,” The Washington Post reported that Hunter and his closest advisers are plotting an offensive for when Republicans assume control of the House of Representatives in January. The strategy sessions to counter what Biden associates frame as “an expected onslaught of investigations by House Republicans” began last September, according to the Post, with a meeting at the California home of Hunter Biden’s friend and lawyer Kevin Morris.

Morris, already famous in the entertainment industry as an attorney for the co-creators of “South Park,” gained notoriety when the New York Post reported that Morris “footed Hunter Biden’s overdue taxes totaling over $2 million.” In addition to Morris, David Brock, a liberal activist, reportedly joined in the September 2022 strategy session. “At one point, Hunter Biden himself happened to call into the meeting, connecting briefly by video to add his own thoughts,” according to the Post.

While not detailing Hunter’s purported thoughts, The Washington Post reported that Morris suggested “it was crucial” “for Hunter Biden’s camp to be more aggressive.” According to Saturday’s article, Morris then described during the September meeting at his California home the “defamation lawsuits the team could pursue against the presidential son’s critics, including Fox News, Eric Trump and Rudy Giuliani.” Morris also reportedly “outlined extensive research on two potential witnesses against Hunter Biden — a spurned business partner named Tony Bobulinski and a computer repairman named John Paul Mac Isaac.”

Brock provided more insight, telling the Post: “They feel that there is a whole counternarrative missing because of the whole Hunter-hater narrative out there.” “What we really got into was more the meat of it, the meat of what a response would look like,” Brock said of the September meeting. To aid the efforts, Brock planned to start a new group — since launched — named Facts First USA, which Brock described as a “SWAT team” designed to “ensure that the media and public do not accept the false narratives that flows from congressional investigations.”

More recently, according to the Post, “Brock’s group, Facts First, is engaging with Hunter Biden and those in his immediate circle.” Brock is reportedly “reviewing research that Morris has conducted on Biden’s adversaries, including Bobulinski and Mac Isaac.”

According to The Washington Post, Morris and others are also focused on whether the data claimed to be recovered from the laptop Hunter Biden abandoned at the Delaware computer repair store, “was improperly obtained and distributed,” with Hunter and his allies suggesting that the materials released by Giuliani and others may not have originated from the laptop Hunter abandoned at the repair shop. Instead, the help-Hunter crew posits that the information may have been improperly taken from a laptop Hunter left with Ablow, whom the Post frames as “close to Republican activist Roger Stone.” The Post then reported that “Morris has been overseeing a forensic analysis of that laptop to determine if it was the basis of the hard drives that were later distributed by Trump allies.”

Morris began floating a similar tangled conspiracy theory in May 2022, with CBS News reporting, “Morris and his team have been circulating provocative slides that tease a coming counter-narrative to political attacks against the president’s son.” The slides describe a “contextualized theory” positing that “there was no laptop dropped off with Mac Isaac, just a laptop which Hunter abandoned on Feb. 1, 2019, at the office of his psychiatrist, Dr. Keith Ablow.”

The New York Post’s Miranda Devine also lighted the conspiracy theory Morris floated in May, writing: “Morris alleges in his scrawled mind map, and in conversations with confidants, that Trump ally Roger Stone and his lawyer, Tyler Nixon, masterminded a plot with Ablow and Mac Isaac to create ‘clones’ of the laptop left in Newburyport to damage Joe before the 2020 election.” Morris pushed the theory based on Stone writing a foreword for Ablow’s 2020 book, “Trump Your Life,” and Ablow’s appearances on Fox News.

But as Devine detailed in her article, the material contained on the MacBook abandoned at Mac Isaac’s business included material created after Hunter had left the laptop with Ablow: “The biggest problem with Morris’ conspiracy theory of the ‘Ablow clones’ is that there are authentic videos and other material unique to the Mac Isaac laptop that were created after Hunter left his second laptop at Ablow’s office.”

Ablow has also dismissed the counternarrative as “a work of fiction,” stating: “I never looked at any laptop belonging to Hunter Biden, much less shared any laptop belonging to Mr. Biden with anyone, ever.” “I wouldn’t know how to access a password-protected laptop if my life depended on it,” Ablow added. Stone reportedly said the theory is “insane conjecture bordering on defamation.” Mac Isaac described it at the time as a “loose effort to muddy the waters.”

In response to Morris’s most recent push, as captured in Saturday’s Washington Post article, Mac Isaac’s attorney, Brian Della Rocca, told The Federalist, “As we have always said, Hunter Biden knows it is his laptop. That is why neither he nor his father have ever actually denied that it is his.” “The night before the story broke,” Della Rocca added, “Hunter’s attorney reached out to John Paul to ask about whether he still had Hunter’s laptop.” What Morris is doing now, Mac Isaac’s attorney claims, is “nothing more than trying to create more of a stir so the story will be worth more in Hollywood.”

Beneath the Surface

Whether crafting a Hollywood story or an offensive strategy to protect Hunter Biden, what Morris and Hunter’s other confidants fail to realize, however, is that by pushing the theory that the material recovered from the Delaware laptop originated from the laptop left with Ablow, they are resurrecting a story that received little scrutiny at the time: the DEA’s raid of Ablow’s office. And since Morris first pushed this conspiracy theory in May 2022, “highly credible whistleblowers” have come forward and accused the Department of Justice and FBI “of burying ‘verified and verifiable’ dirt on President Biden’s troubled son Hunter by incorrectly dismissing the intelligence as “disinformation.”

So, the question arises: Was the DEA’s raid of Ablow’s office a pretext to recover Hunter’s second laptop? And relatedly: Did the DEA return the laptop to Hunter without securing the evidence first for the criminal investigation against the now-president’s son?

While most Americans now know of the infamous laptop Hunter reportedly abandoned at a Delaware computer repair store, shortly after the New York Post broke the news that material recovered from the laptop implicated Joe Biden in Hunter’s shady business dealings, NBC News reported on Oct. 30, 2020: “[A]ccording to two people familiar with the matter, a different Hunter Biden laptop landed in the custody of the DEA in February when they executed a search warrant on the Massachusetts office of a psychiatrist accused of professional misconduct,” the psychiatrist being Ablow.

The February 2020 raid on the office of Hunter’s one-time Massachusetts-based psychiatrist Ablow received only passing mention at the time, with local outlets reporting that the DEA claimed the execution of the search warrant was part of an “ongoing investigation.” Coverage at the time also highlighted the revocation of Ablow’s medical license for alleged “inappropriate sexual activity with patients and illegally giving prescriptions to employees.”

There was no mention of the recovery of a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden at the time, or at any time until two unnamed sources told NBC News of that detail on Oct. 30, 2020. Since then, Ablow confirmed that Hunter left his laptop at a bungalow attached to Ablow’s office in 2019, where the Biden son was reportedly staying for intravenous ketamine treatments for his addiction in December 2018 and January 2019.

Ablow reportedly “made repeated efforts to persuade Hunter Biden to retrieve his computer,” with Ablow even contacting Hunter’s attorney to arrange for its return.” However, the second laptop reportedly remained in a safe in Ablow’s basement for a year, and the DEA raided the psychiatrist on Feb. 13, 2020, then returned the computer to Hunter’s lawyer George Mesires.

Red Flags

The timing of the raid and the return of the computer to Hunter’s lawyer raises several red flags, especially since federal charges were never brought against Ablow. First, the Feb. 13, 2020, DEA raid occurred some nine months after the Massachusetts Board of Medicine suspended Ablow’s medical license on May 15, 2019, for purportedly diverting “controlled substances from patients,” among other things. One would think the DEA would act more promptly to execute a search warrant to prevent the destruction of evidence.

Second, the DEA only executed the search warrant after the FBI issued a grand jury subpoena in mid-December of 2019 to seize the first Hunter Biden laptop from the Delaware store owner, raising the question of whether the real goal was to ensure there were no more Biden laptops floating about before the 2020 presidential election.

Third, even if there was nothing pretextual or nefarious about the raid on Ablow’s office, that the DEA returned the laptop to Hunter’s lawyer raises other concerns because at the time, and still to this day, Hunter Biden was under investigation. In fact, it was that investigation that served as the basis for the FBI to subpoena the laptop from the Delaware repair store. Given the ongoing investigation into Hunter Biden, why would the DEA return the laptop to his attorney?

Given the FBI whistleblowers’ claims that government agents buried incriminating evidence against Hunter Biden, the House oversight committees should pose these questions to the DEA to ensure that federal agency was not also acting as a protect-Biden front. And we can thank Morris and The Washington Post for reminding us of the DEA’s seizure of that second Hunter laptop — something that at the time seemed straightforward but, given the developments over the last six months, now smells suspect.

Editor’s note: This article has been updated to reflect that NBC News, not CBS News, first reported on the DEA’s recovery of a second laptop.

8 Times Our Federal Government Ran A Protect-Biden Racket,"For years, our federal government has quietly operated a protect-Biden racket. The public, however, has only recently — and haphazardly — learned of the lengths federal law enforcement officials and government employees have gone to safeguard the Biden family secrets. Here are eight times our government squelched scandals.

1. Censoring the Hunter Biden Laptop Story

The most recent and most well-known example of the feds protecting the Biden family stems from efforts by intelligence agencies to squelch news coverage of the New York Post’s reporting that Hunter Biden “introduced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm less than a year before the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company.” The Post discovered that detail, and many more implicating Joe Biden in a pay-to-play scandal, in a cache of emails and text messages recovered from a laptop Hunter had abandoned at a Delaware computer repair store.

Before the New York Post broke the story on Oct. 14, 2022, about Joe Biden’s knowledge of and potential involvement in his son’s business dealings, the FBI warned Facebook that it “should be on high alert.” “[W]e thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election,” the FBI said, adding that “we have it on notice that basically there’s about to be some kind of dump similar to that so just be vigilant.”

Based on that warning, Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg explained that “when the New York Post broke the Hunter Biden laptop story on Oct. 14, 2020, Facebook treated the story as potentially misinformation, important misinformation for five to seven days while the tech giant’s team could determine whether it was false.”

Federal law enforcement agencies likewise warned Twitter in the lead-up to the 2020 general election “that they expected ‘hack-and-leak operations’ by state actors might occur in the period shortly before the 2020 presidential election, likely in October.” Twitter’s then-head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, further acknowledged that in meetings with federal law enforcement agencies, he learned “that there were rumors that a hack-and-leak operation would involve Hunter Biden.” According to a letter Twitter’s lawyer sent to the Federal Election Commission, the tech giant explained it was “the prior warnings of a hack-and-leak operation and doubts about the provenance of the materials republished in the N.Y. Post articles,” that led its Site Integrity Team to preliminarily determine “the materials could have been obtained through hacking.”

Of course, the Hunter Biden laptop was not part of a “hack-and-leak operation,” and it wasn’t “Russian propaganda” or “important misinformation” — and the FBI knew that fact because it had seized the laptop from the computer repair store nearly a year earlier, in December of 2019. But the FBI nonetheless deceived the tech giants to induce them to censor the pay-to-play scandal that likely would have cost Joe Biden the election.

2. Quietly Seizing Hunter’s Laptop from Repair Shop

While it was the FBI’s lies that prompted the tech giants to censor the New York Post’s coverage of the Biden family pay-to-play scandal, the bureau’s efforts to protect the Biden family from the damning material contained on the laptop may have also included the FBI’s seizure of the laptop from the repair store owner, John Paul Mac Isaac. Had Mac Isaac not made a copy of the hard drive before the FBI seized Hunter’s laptop in December 2019, the FBI could have kept the entire story quiet. One can’t help but wonder if the bureau’s true motivation in seizing the laptop was to protect the Biden family.

A comment by one of the agents who seized the computer suggests just such a motive. When Mac Isaac joked with the agents who seized the laptop that he’d remember to change their names when he wrote a book about the incident, according to the repair store owner, one of the agents rejoined: “It is our experience that nothing ever happens to people that don’t talk about these things.”

3. Seizing and Returning Hunter’s Second Laptop

Another Biden-clean-up mission may have taken place two months later when, in February 2020, the Drug Enforcement Administration raided the office of Hunter Biden’s former psychiatrist, Keith Ablow. In executing the search warrant, the DEA seized from Ablow’s safe a second laptop that belonged to Hunter. Even though Hunter was under investigation at the time, the government returned the laptop to his lawyer.

At the time of the DEA search, no mention was made of the Hunter Biden laptop. Instead, the limited public coverage of the raid consisted of reports that the DEA claimed the execution of the search warrant was part of an “ongoing investigation” and references to Ablow’s medical license being recovered in May of 2019 for alleged “inappropriate sexual activity with patients and illegally giving prescriptions to employees.”

That the DEA waited nine months before searching Ablow’s office for evidence and that the government never charged Ablow for any crimes seems rather suspect, especially given the raid only followed the FBI’s seizure of Hunter Biden’s first laptop. But even if there were nothing nefarious about the raid, returning the laptop, while Hunter Biden remained under federal investigation, fits the pattern of the feds protecting the Biden family.

4. Downplaying or Ignoring Intelligence Threats to Provide Plausible Deniability

The Delaware laptop contained hordes of compromising information on both Hunter Biden and his father. Beyond that scandalous material, the laptop also included another significant revelation: that Hunter Biden believed the Russians had stolen another laptop that contained material ripe for blackmailing the Biden family.

As The Federalist reported exclusively in August of 2021, a lawyer for Mac Isaac confirmed the laptop Hunter had abandoned at the Delaware repair shop contained a video in which the Biden son recounted the story of his stolen laptop. In the video, Hunter spoke of how he almost overdosed during the summer of 2018 while partying in Las Vegas with his drug dealer and two other guys. Also present “was this Russian 35-year-old, really nice, pure brunette,” Hunter explained. Soon after coming to, Hunter discovered his laptop was missing.

“I think he’s the one that stole my computer,” Hunter is heard on the tape explaining. “I think the three of them, the three guys that were like a little group. The dealer and his two guys, I took them everywhere,” Hunter explained. “They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex, f-cking, you know,” Hunter added. “My computer, I had taken tons of like, just left like that cam on,” Hunter continued, “and somebody stole it during that period of time.”

When asked whether he worried the Russian thieves would try to “blackmail” him, Hunter said, “Yeah, in some way, yeah,” noting his father is “running for president,” and that “I talk about it all the time.”

It is difficult to overstate the national security risk that would exist if the Russians had possession of a laptop filled with not just personal information about Hunter Biden, but communications implicating his father in a pay-to-play scandal. And the FBI, had it properly processed the laptop upon subpoenaing it from Mac Isaac, would have known of that risk and, at a minimum, provided Joe Biden a defensive briefing.

However, according to whistleblowers, under the auspices of not interfering with the 2020 election, FBI leaders told employees, “You will not look at that Hunter Biden laptop.” The whistleblowers further claimed that “the FBI did not begin to examine the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop until after the 2020 presidential election.”

If true, to protect Joe Biden from any fallout flowing from the laptop, the FBI failed to properly assess the national security risks posed by the details on the laptop.

The FBI’s see-nothing approach also provided Joe Biden plausible deniability, such that he could claim the laptop represented Russian disinformation. In fact, at his last presidential debate, when President Donald Trump said, so the “laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?” Biden responded: “That’s exactly what [I] was told.”

While the intelligence community should have been providing Biden a defensive briefing on the laptop, it instead appears to have opted to protect the Democrat candidate by ignoring the national security risk.

5. Running Sham Investigations and Burying Information

The FBI did more than delay the investigation into the laptop, however, according to whistleblowers who claimed that “agents opened a sham investigation into Hunter Biden to brand reliable and verifiable derogatory evidence as ‘disinformation.’”

According to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, “multiple FBI whistleblowers, including those in senior positions,” raised “the alarm about tampering by senior FBI and Justice Department officials in politically sensitive investigations,” including “investigative activity involving derogatory information on Hunter Biden’s financial and foreign business activities.” Grassley alleged that the whistleblowers claimed Washington Field Office Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy “Thibault and other FBI officials sought to falsely portray as disinformation evidence acquired from multiple sources that provided the FBI derogatory information related to Hunter Biden’s financial and foreign business activities, even though some of that information had already been or could be verified.”

A news release issued by Grassley’s officer further claimed that “in August of 2020, FBI supervisory intelligence analyst Brian Auten opened an assessment, which was used by a team of agents at FBI headquarters to improperly discredit and falsely claim that derogatory information about Biden’s activities was disinformation, causing investigative activity and sourcing to be shut down.” “The FBI headquarters team allegedly placed their assessment findings in a restricted access subfolder, effectively flagging sources and derogatory evidence related to Hunter Biden as disinformation while shielding the justification for such findings from scrutiny,” according to Grassley.

The whistleblowers’ charges, if accurate, indicate that the FBI went to great lengths to protect Hunter Biden, and by extension his father, at a time Hunter was reportedly already under investigation by the Delaware U.S. Attorney’s Office.

6. Stepping Up When Hunter’s Gun Goes Missing

In October of 2018, Hunter Biden purchased a gun, completing a “Firearms Transaction Record” that shows him responding “no” to a question on the form that asked, “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?” Notwithstanding Hunter’s very public and long-standing addiction to drugs, no charges were ever filed against the president’s son.

Beyond the government apparently looking the other way over Hunter Biden’s seeming false statement, the gun and that form feature heavily in another example of the deep-state clean-up crew.

According to Politico, on Oct. 23, 2018, Hallie Biden, Hunter’s sister-in-law-turned-lover, removed “Hunter’s gun and threw it in a trash can behind a grocery store, only to return later to find it gone.” After the manager of the grocery store called police, who launched an investigation, “a curious thing happened,” as Politico put it: “Secret Service agents approached the owner of the store where Hunter bought the gun and asked to take the paperwork involving the sale…”

“The gun store owner refused to supply the paperwork, suspecting that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” Politico’s sources said. The store owner later provided a copy of the paper to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.

While the Secret Service claims it has no record of any involvement of its agents, this story suggests agents again worked to protect the Biden family.

7. Stepping In When Ashley Biden’s Diary Shows Up

While the investigation into Hunter’s missing gun and the potentially fraudulent representation he made on the Firearm Transaction Record ended without charges, the Department of Justice brought federal charges against two individuals who attempted to sell a diary reportedly belonging to Ashley Biden. And not only did the government come down heavy on those individuals, but the FBI also raided the home and office of Project Veritas founder James O’Keefe.

According to O’Keefe, “the diary was allegedly abandoned in a room that [Ashley Biden] had stayed at” and the two individuals who discovered the diary approached Project Veritas and other media outlets to sell the book. “Project Veritas gave the diary to law enforcement to ensure it could be returned to its rightful owner. We never published it,” O’Keefe said. “Now, Ms. Biden’s father’s Department of Justice, specifically the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, appears to be investigating the situation, claiming the diary was stolen. We don’t know if it was but it begs the question: In what world is the alleged theft of a diary investigated by the President’s FBI and his Department of Justice? A diary?” O’Keefe asked.

In addition to raiding O’Keefe’s home, the Biden administration’s DOJ obtained “secret warrants, orders, and a subpoena,” over the course of 16 months, to maintain “‘unchecked’ and ‘unfettered’ access to the emails and contacts of Founder and CEO James O’Keefe and seven other staff members.” Project Veritas maintains the government targeted him and his fellow journalists because of their “news-gathering activities surrounding allegations against then-candidate, Joe Biden, made by his daughter, Ashley Biden, in her diary.”

If true, it is yet another example of the men in black protecting the Bidens.

8. Keeping the Ducks in a Row and Quiet

Attorney General Merrick Garland represents the final and biggest protector of the Biden family, with the investigation into Hunter Biden continuing under the oversight of the Biden administration’s Department of Justice. Similarly, the DOJ, through the Western District of Pennsylvania’s U.S. Attorney’s Office, “is still overseeing the criminal investigation into the bankrupt health care business from which James Biden allegedly siphoned hundreds of thousands of dollars to finance repairs to his beach house.”

Notwithstanding the clear conflicts of interest, Garland has ignored calls by congressional leaders to appoint a special counsel to investigate the financial dealings of the Biden family. Instead, Garland appointed Jack Smith as a special counsel to investigate Trump.

Apparently, the only thing as strong as the get-Trump attitude of the deep state is the protect-the-Bidens stance of the federal government.

FBI Office Probing Hunter Requested Pre-Election Censorship,"Emails released on Saturday as part of the latest dump of the “Twitter Files” reveal that the week before the 2020 presidential election, the FBI field office investigating Hunter Biden sent multiple censorship requests to Twitter — so many in fact, a top attorney for the tech giant found it “odd.” This blockbuster detail from the weekend came mere days after the FBI issued a statement framing coverage of the “Twitter Files” as “misinformation” being peddled by “conspiracy theorists.”

The FBI has “some folks in the Baltimore field office and at HQ that are just doing keyword searches for violations,” then-Twitter legal executive Stacia Cardille stressed in a Nov. 3, 2020, email to Jim Baker, the then-deputy general counsel for Twitter. “This is probably the 10th request I have dealt with in the last 5 days,” Cardille continued, before telling Baker to let her know if he had any other questions.”

Less than an hour later, Baker responded to Cardille, noting it was “odd” that the FBI is “searching for violations of our policies.”

Independent journalist Matt Taibbi published these emails as part of a 50-something Christmas Eve “Twitter Files” thread that he remarked showed “the FBI acting as doorman to a vast program of social media surveillance and censorship, encompassing agencies across the federal government – from the State Department to the Pentagon to the CIA.”

The entire thread is newsworthy, but that FBI agents in both the Baltimore field office and at FBI headquarters were running keyword searches for supposed Twitter violations proves hugely significant because both offices were involved in the Hunter Biden investigation.

While the Delaware U.S. Attorney’s Office is — and was at the time of the 2020 election — handling the investigation into Hunter Biden, reportedly for potential money laundering and tax crimes, there is no separate Delaware FBI field office. Rather, the Baltimore FBI field office covers all of Delaware for the bureau and thus supported (and continues to support) the Delaware U.S. Attorney’s Office in its investigation of Hunter Biden.

We also know from multiple FBI whistleblowers that FBI headquarters entangled itself in the Hunter Biden probe: In July 2022, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, announced that “multiple FBI whistleblowers, including those in senior positions,” had claimed that “in August of 2020, FBI supervisory intelligence analyst Brian Auten opened an assessment, which was used by a team of agents at FBI headquarters to improperly discredit and falsely claim that derogatory information about Biden’s activities was disinformation, causing investigative activity and sourcing to be shut down.”

“The FBI headquarters team allegedly placed their assessment findings in a restricted access subfolder, effectively flagging sources and derogatory evidence related to Hunter Biden as disinformation while shielding the justification for such findings from scrutiny,” according to Grassley.

Given the involvement of both Baltimore FBI and FBI headquarters in the investigation of Hunter Biden — and the latter’s attempt to shut down the probe — the revelation that “some folks in the Baltimore field office and at HQ” were “doing keyword searches for violations,” suggests the FBI undertook a full-court press to interfere in the 2020 election.

Previously released “Twitter Files” and statements from Twitter and Facebook established the FBI lied to the tech giants, representing the Hunter Biden laptop story as Russian disinformation and prompting the censorship of the Biden-family scandal mere weeks before the 2020 election. Internal Twitter communications also revealed that the night before the New York Post published emails from Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop that implicated Joe Biden in a pay-to-play scandal, “the FBI used a private communications channel to send 10 documents to a top Twitter executive.”

The “Twitter Files” also exposed “Twitter’s contact with the FBI was constant and pervasive, as if it were a subsidiary of the FBI,” as Taibbi explained in an earlier thread. The “Twitter Files” Taibbi previously reported showed that from “January 2020 to November 2022, there were over 150 emails between the FBI and former Twitter Trust and Safety Chief Yoel Roth.” Those communications indicated “agencies like the FBI and DHS regularly sending social media content to Twitter through multiple entry points, pre-flagged for moderation.”

These earlier threads, however, all focused on either communications coming from the San Francisco FBI field office or discussed the monthly and then weekly meetings between Twitter and the federal government’s Foreign Influence Task Force, or FITF. As Taibbi noted, the FBI greatly expanded the number of agents assigned to the FITF following the 2016 election, with the task force swelling to 80 agents.”

With FBI San Francisco and the FITF already liaisoning with Twitter, why then would the Baltimore field office and FBI headquarters have any involvement in communicating with Twitter? And as Saturday’s emails reveal, those officers were not merely passing on information they received, they were, according to a Twitter legal executive, running “keyword” searches — something even Baker, who was previously general counsel for the FBI, found “odd.”

And the Baltimore field office and FBI headquarters conducted these “keyword” searches and shared the results with Twitter for one reason only: to prompt Twitter to censor the speech the week before the 2020 presidential election.

“Odd” doesn’t even begin to capture the situation — which, given the connection between those two FBI offices and the Hunter Biden investigation, suggests a new wing to the Big Tech scandal: one in which FBI agents proactively sought out people and speech to censor for the benefit their politician of choice.

Ironically, the Wednesday before Taibbi broke this latest news, the FBI issued a statement claiming that “the correspondence between the FBI and Twitter show nothing more than examples of our traditional, longstanding and ongoing federal government and private sector engagements, which involve numerous companies over multiple sectors and industries. … It is unfortunate that conspiracy theorists and others are feeding the American public misinformation with the sole purpose of attempting to discredit the agency.”

When the bureau’s own former general counsel calls the FBI’s conduct “odd,” it’s pretty clear who is discrediting the agency: It isn’t conspiracy theorists — it’s the FBI.

Here’s A Better Reason To Cheer For The Supreme Court’s U.S. Border Reprieve,"On Tuesday, the Supreme Court ruled the Trump-era suspension of entry at the Mexico border must remain in place while the high court considers an appeal filed by 19 states that sought to intervene in the case to defend the policy. The order in Arizona v. Mayorkas prompted cheers from Americans frustrated with the Biden Administration’s failure to defend our country’s borders. But it is not the justices’ job to make or enforce immigration policy, and conservatives applauding the stay for that reason should re-think their response.

And yet, there is a legitimate reason to celebrate the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the appeal in Arizona v. Mayorkas, as it provides the high court the vehicle to end the abusive use of friendly settlement agreements to sidestep the political or administrative process.

In response to Covid-19, in March 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), issued a regulation immediately suspending entry at Canadian or Mexican ports of entry of individuals lacking proper travel documents or whose entry would otherwise be illegal. Informally called the “Title 42 system,” after the title of the United States Code that authorized the CDC to suspend admission into the country to prevent the spread of a communicable disease, the rules established in March 2020 were extended several times, with the final rule issued on Sept. 11, 2020.

Aliens subject to expulsion from the country under Title 42 filed suit in Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas in January of 2021 in a federal court in D.C., alleging the Trump Administration’s CDC expulsion rules violated various federal statutes. While the Huisha-Huisha case was pending, in April 2022, the CDC, now under the Biden Administration, entered an order terminating its previous Title 42 orders. In response, a coalition of states filed suit against the Biden Administration in a federal court in Louisiana, alleging the order terminating the Title 42 system violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because the CDC issued the rule without the required notice and comment period, and also because the rule was arbitrary and capricious.

The states’ lawsuit argued that the CDC’s termination order was “‘plainly at war with other policies of the Biden Administration,’ such as refusing to lift the mask mandate on airline travelers, refusing to repeal vaccination mandates, and insisting on discharging members of the military who sought religious exemptions from those mandates.”

The states also argued the “CDC utterly failed to consider the consequences of the Termination Order on the States, which even Biden Administration officials acknowledged would lead to an ‘influx’ of migrants, inflicting a ‘surge on top of a surge’ that would irreparably harm the States.”

A federal judge in the Louisiana case concluded the Biden Administration violated the notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements of the ADA and entered a preliminary injunction preventing the CDC’s termination order of Title 42 from going into effect. The Biden Administration filed an appeal of the Louisiana district court’s decision with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Three months later, on November 15, 2022, in Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, the federal court in D.C. ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in their challenge to the Trump Administration’s Title 42 system. Specifically, the D.C. federal court declared the regulations and all decisions issued by the CDC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suspending the right of entry under Title 42 were “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of the APA.

Within hours of the federal court in D.C. declaring invalid the Trump Administration’s Title 42 system, the Biden Administration filed an “Unopposed Emergency Motion for Temporary Stay,” seeking a temporary delay in ending the Title 42 system to allow the federal government “to resolve resource and logistical issues” related to the ending of the Title 42 order. The court granted that motion, staying its decision striking Title 42 until midnight on December 21, 2022.

The Biden Administration then turned to the Louisiana court, notifying the judge who had frozen the CDC’s newly adopted rule terminating the Title 42 system that the federal court in D.C. had struck the Title 42 system. Thus, come December 21, 2020, the Biden Administration stressed, there will “ be no legal authority for the government to continue to enforce the Title 42 policy.” In other words, it no longer mattered whether the Biden Administration’s CDC properly terminated the Title 42 system because a federal court had declared the Title 42 system illegal.

At that point, fifteen states, led by Arizona, filed a motion in the D.C. federal court in Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas seeking to intervene in the case as an interested party. Four additional states joined the motion soon after, with the states all requesting permission from the court to enter the case to defend the legality of the Title 42 system, as the Biden Administration appeared unwilling to defend the earlier rules to effectuate a termination of the Title 42 system —something it had tried to do by regulation but that was enjoined by the Louisiana federal court.

After the states filed the Motion to Intervene, the Biden Administration filed an appeal in the Huisha-Huisha case to the D.C. Circuit Court, leading the states to request permission to intervene from the federal appellate court. The D.C. Circuit denied the state’s leave to intervene, which prompted the 19 states to seek a stay from the Supreme Court of the trial court’s order in Huisha-Huisha striking the Title 42 system. Following a temporary stay granted by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, agreed to hear the state’s appeal of the D.C. Circuit’s denial of its Motion to Intervene. The Supreme Court further held the lower court’s decision striking the Title 42 system could not take effect until the high court resolved the issue of intervention, which would be done on an expeditated basis with a hearing to proceed during the February 2023 argument session.

The four justices dissenting from the Supreme Court’s stay included the three liberal justices, Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson, joined by Justice Gorsuch. And in a brief two-page dissent, joined by Justice Jackson, Justice Gorsuch explained his opposition to the stay and the decision to take the appeal.

“Reasonable minds can disagree about the merits of the D. C. Circuit’s intervention ruling,” Justice Gorsuch wrote, before stressing “that case-specific decision is not of special importance in its own right and would not normally warrant expedited review.” Rather, “the D. C. Circuit’s intervention ruling takes on whatever salience it has only because of its presence in a larger underlying dispute about the Title 42 orders.”

But, even then, “it is unclear what we might accomplish,” Justice Gorsuch added. “Even if at the end of it all we find that the States are permitted to intervene, and even if the States manage on remand to demonstrate that the Title 42 orders were lawfully adopted, the emergency on which those orders were premised has long since lapsed.”

“And it is hardly obvious why we should rush in to review a ruling on a motion to intervene in a case concerning emergency decrees that have outlived their shelf life,” the dissenting justice posited.

“The only plausible reason for stepping in at this stage,” Justice Gorsuch opined, was that we “face an immigration crisis at the border and policymakers have failed to agree on adequate measures to address it.” Justice Gorsuch then continued with a passage every conservative should study:

“The only means left to mitigate the crisis, the States suggest, is an order from this Court directing the federal government to continue its COVID-era Title 42 policies as long as possible—at the very least during the pendency of our review. Today, the Court supplies just such an order. For my part, I do not discount the States’ concerns. Even the federal government acknowledges ‘that the end of the Title 42 orders will likely have disruptive consequences.’ But the current border crisis is not a COVID crisis. And courts should not be in the business of perpetuating administrative edicts designed for one emergency only because elected officials have failed to address a different emergency. We are a court of law, not policymakers of last resort.”

Justice Gorsuch is right on all points, but one.

More on that one point shortly, but for now consider what celebrating Tuesday’s order represents — applauding the judiciary acting as legislators. That is most assuredly not a conservative response. Yes, our borders need protecting. Yes, the Biden Administration, Congress, Democrats, and Republicans have failed. And yes, the damage to the country and ordinary Americans is great. But the answer is not five justices sticking their fingers in the morass.

Yet of the solidly conservative court, only Justice Gorsuch spoke out. Why?

Because on one point Justice Gorsuch was wrong: There is another plausible reason for the Supreme Court, including conservative justices to step in, and that is to address what, in a similar case, Chief Justice Roberts called “the tactic of ‘rulemaking-by-collective-acquiescence.’” In fact, in their motion to the Supreme Court seeking a stay, the 19 states focused foremost on the Biden Administration’s gaming of litigation to achieve its end goal of terminating the Title 42 system, and only secondarily on the harm ending Title 42 will cause.

Here, it is important to note that last term in Arizona v. City and County of San Francisco, the Supreme Court had agreed to address a similar question concerning intervention in “another dispute over a Trump-era immigration policy that the Biden administration sought to revoke but that red states fought to retain.” However, in that case the Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the “case without resolving the question about state intervention,” concluding it had taken the appeal improvidently.

Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch all concurred in dismissing the appeal in Arizona v. City and County of San Francisco, but in doing so highlighted their concerns over the Biden Administration seizing on consent judgments, which are judgments agreed to by the parties, to avoid the notice-and-comment procedures required by the APA: By entering into friendly settlement agreements, the Biden Administration successfully implemented its preferred policy preferences, while immunizing its regulations from legal challenge.

“These maneuvers raise a host of important questions,” the four justices stressed, “the most fundamental is whether the Government’s actions, all told, comport with the principles of administrative law.” Yet because in Arizona v. City and County of San Francisco that issue was tangled with many other questions, such as standing, mootness, and the appropriateness of vacatur, among others, the Supreme Court decided to leave the question for another day.

That day is now, or rather sometime during the February argument session, and the Supreme Court appears poised to address the manipulative use of consent decrees and settlement agreements. It is to answer that question — and not to mandate immigration policy — that the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed vacatur of the Title 42 system and agreed to hear the appeal by the 19 states which sought to intervene. And while a decision by the high court on the intervention question won’t secure the border, conservatives shouldn’t want the justices to make immigration policy. But putting a halt to the Biden Administration’s abusive litigation strategies is a worthy endeavor and one the Supreme Court seems ready to tackle.

Biden's Top 10 Blunders Of 2022 That Prove He's In Decline,"It’s no secret President Joe Biden is no longer in his prime physical and cognitive state.

The 80-year-old isn’t just a serial liar. He’s a chronic gaffe machine who puts the country at risk pretty much every time he opens his mouth. The president is so bad at giving speeches that Generation Z made some of his most notable verbal stumbles into a TikTok trend.

Contrary to corporate media claims, these blunders aren’t just byproducts of Biden’s childhood stutter, they are signs of a bigger problem. Here are 10 gaffes from the grandpa in the White House that should make every American question whether he’s just a figurehead.

1. Biden Forgets What Year It Is

Biden started off 2022 strong with a New Year’s-themed White House address in which he forgot what year it is.

“There’s a lot of reason to be hopeful in 2020,” Biden said.

2. Biden Cusses Out Fox Journalist on Hot Mic

A hot mic caught Biden calling Fox News’s Peter Doocy a “stupid son of a b-tch” during a White House photo op in January of 2022.

“Do you think inflation’s a political liability in the midterms?” Doocy asked as reporters were rushed to the exit.

“It’s a great asset, more inflation,” Biden said. “What a stupid son of a b-tch.”

3. Biden Calls For Regime Change in Russia (and Meant It)

Hardly a slip of the tongue, one of Biden’s most problematic statements came in March when he publicly called for regime change in Russia.

“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden declared about Vladimir Putin during a speech in Warsaw, Poland.

Regime change in Russia is the unofficial policy of our ruling class, but the corporate media, unwilling to admit it, called Biden’s outburst a “gaffe.” The White House, similarly, couldn’t decide between standing by Biden’s comments or downplaying them as simple “moral outrage” toward Putin.

4. ‘Repeat the Line’

In July, during a speech about his new abortion-focused executive order, Biden struggled to properly vocalize the script on his teleprompter.

Joe Biden accidentally reads the part on the teleprompter that says ""repeat the line"" when they wanted him to say the line again lmfao pic.twitter.com/pS3GdXPe5N — Greg Price (@greg_price11) July 8, 2022

Clips of the speech clearly show the gaffe-prone president saying, “End of quote. Repeat the line.” The White House transcript of Biden’s address, however, claims Biden said, “End of quote. Let me repeat the line.”

When pressed about the retroactive edits, White House Assistant Press Secretary Emilie Simons tried to gaslight her Twitter followers into believing Biden wasn’t really reading cues directly from the teleprompter.

“No. He said, ‘let me repeat that line,’” she wrote.

5. Biden Falsely Claims He Had Cancer

In a “climate crisis” speech about fossil fuels in Massachusetts in July, Biden incorrectly claimed he has cancer caused by oil pollution. Biden said that growing up, pollution in Delaware was so bad that his mother had to use windshield wipers to “get literally the oil slick off the window.”

“That’s why I and so damn many other people I grew up [with] have cancer,” Biden said.

Biden says that his mother using windshield wipers to ""get literally the oil slick off the window"" is ""why I and so damn many other people have cancer."" pic.twitter.com/YIoBlZadRJ — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) July 20, 2022

The White House physician rushed to release a statement clarifying that Biden does not, in fact, have cancer.

6. Biden Says American Troops Are ‘Selfish’

During a trip to the Middle East in July, Biden mixed up the words “selfish” and “selfless” at the most inconvenient time possible.

“We’ll always honor the bravery and selfishness — selflessness,” Biden said. “And sacrifices of the Americans who served, including my son, Major Beau Biden, who was stationed in Iraq for a year.”

7. Biden Calls the Holocaust Honorable

During a visit to Israel, Biden claimed he was there to “keep alive the truth and honor of the Holocaust.”

“And continue — which we must do every, every day — continue to bear witness, to keep alive the truth and honor of the Holocaust,” Biden said.

He later corrected himself by saying the “horror of the Holocaust.”

8. ‘Where’s Jackie?’

Perhaps the worst of Biden’s 2022 blunders was when he tried to call upon Rep. Jackie Walorski weeks after she died in a car accident in her home state of Indiana.

“Jackie, are you here? Where’s Jackie? She must not be here,” Biden said at the Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health on Sept 28.

President Biden seems to forget that Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-IN) died in a car crash in August, seeking her out in the audience:



""Jackie, are you here? Where's Jackie? She must not be here."" pic.twitter.com/inzKDHrPK7 — The Recount (@therecount) September 28, 2022

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tried to brush off Biden’s mistake by claiming Walorski was “on top of mind.”

“These moments of confusion are happening with increased frequency, Karine,” one reporter, unsatisfied with Jean-Pierre’s answer, shouted above the hubbub.

W.H. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre battles the media after President Biden called out the name of deceased congresswoman Jackie Walorski, as if she were in the room. ""Jackie, where's Jackie?,"" Biden asked.

Polling conducted shortly after the Jackie incident found that a majority of Americans, including Democrats, were at least “somewhat concerned” about Biden’s mental state.

9. A ‘Mental Focus’ Word Salad

Biden isn’t particularly fond of people questioning his cognitive abilities, and his attempts to convince Americans he is mentally equipped for office, or even a walk in the park, fall short.

“How would you say your mental focus is?” CBS’s Scott Pelley asked during a “60 Minutes” interview in October.

“Oh, it’s focused,” Biden replied. “I’d say it’s, it is, I haven’t… look. I have trouble even mentioning, even saying to myself, in my own head, the number of years. I no more think of myself as being old as I am than fly.”

REPORTER: How is your mental focus?



JOE BIDEN: *nervous wheeze*

“Oh focused. Ha ha ha I’d say it’s, it is I haven’t … here, look. I have trouble even mentioning, even saying to myself, in my head, the number of years. I no more think of myself being old as I am than fly.”



??? pic.twitter.com/QZzLRty0my — Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) September 19, 2022

During an interview the following month, Biden appeared to fall asleep mid-answer.

10. Biden Gets Lost on Stage

Even when he’s not speaking, Biden shows severe signs of mental impairment. Shortly after his speech during the Global Fund’s Seventh Replenishment Conference in New York, Biden appeared to get lost on the stage before eventually finding his way down.

10 Scandals To Keep Your Eye On In 2023,"The new year is upon us and with it a fresh start for more corruption. But 2023 also offers the opportunity to bring closure to some long-running scandals. Here are 10 to track in the upcoming year.

1. Government’s Puppeteering of Big Tech and Media

The ongoing release of the “Twitter Files” closed 2022 with a new scandal, as the internal communications of the tech giant exposed extensive coordination between the government and Twitter, Facebook, Google, and other big players controlling the flow of information. While conservatives have known — and complained — for years of Big Tech’s censorship and shadowbanning, by purchasing Twitter and giving independent journalists access to corporate emails, Elon Musk provided indisputable confirmation that Twitter both censored and blacklisted conservatives.

The censoring of the Hunter Biden laptop story and the silencing of scientific criticism of the government’s heavy-handed Covid regime, both at the prompting of federal agents, proved the most appalling.

As Musk continues to provide access to internal communications, a watchful eye is warranted in 2023.

2. Intelligence Agencies’ 2020 Election Interference

A related scandal to track in 2023 concerns intelligence agencies’ interference in the 2020 election. Even before Musk took over at Twitter, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed the FBI’s role in prompting the censorship of the Hunter Biden story.

As I previously reported, during an August 2020 interview with Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg revealed that before the Hunter Biden laptop story dropped, the FBI had warned the Facebook team to “be on high alert.” According to Zuckerberg, the FBI told Facebook, “[W]e thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election” and that “we have it on notice that basically there’s about to be some kind of dump similar to that so just be vigilant.” Based on the FBI’s warning, when the New York Post broke the Hunter Biden story, Facebook treated it as potential misinformation and limited the visibility of the scandal.

While Zuckerberg hedged on whether the FBI identified the Hunter Biden story as the one that prompted the warning, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, signed a declaration attesting that during their “regular meetings with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and industry peers regarding election security,” “federal law enforcement agencies communicated that they expected ‘hack-and-leak operations’ by state actors might occur in the period shortly before the 2020 presidential election, likely in October.” Roth noted that during those meetings he learned “that there were rumors that a hack-and-leak operation would involve Hunter Biden,” and that Twitter censored the story based on the warning.

Of course, the Hunter Biden laptop was real and not Russian misinformation as the intelligence community had presented it to both Facebook and Twitter, prompting the tech giants to censor the politically devasting story mere weeks before the 2020 election. The FBI’s interference in the 2020 presidential election is a huge scandal, yet just began to percolate in the press in late 2022.

This scandal will continue in 2023, but even more damning details are likely to drop this year given that the “Twitter Files” revealed FBI Special Agent Elvis Chan sent a “Heads Up” to Roth on the late evening of Oct. 13, 2020 — hours before the Post story hit. Chan’s email alerted the Twitter executive to a “Teleporter link” that would allow Roth to download 10 documents. “It is not spam!” Chan stressed, asking Roth to confirm receipt of the link. Two minutes later, at 6:24 p.m., California time, Roth acknowledged he had received the message and downloaded the files.

Chan sent a similar email to high-level Twitter executives two days after the Post story first ran, with the Oct. 16, 2020 message from Chan telling Roth and a high-level Twitter attorney, “I just got something hot off the presses today,” and then telling the duo to monitor their Teleporter messages for “two documents to download.”

Teleporter, as the “Twitter Files” detailed, is a one-way communication platform that allowed the FBI to send secret messages to the tech behemoth. Those messages, however, reportedly disappear after 24 hours, and to date, both the content of the Teleporter messages and the documents the FBI attached for Twitter’s review remain unknown. But the timing suggests further evidence may exist showing the FBI lied to Big Tech to rig the 2020 election — and 2023 may be the year for it to emerge.

3. The Biden Laundromat

Since at least 2020, Hunter Biden has been under investigation by federal prosecutors. Many expected charges to come last year, when in March of 2022, The New York Times — one of the go-to media outlets for Democrats to prime with inside information to blunt the effects of soon-to-be-released negative news — reported based on unnamed sources that David C. Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware overseeing the criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, had a grand jury conducting “a wide-ranging examination” of Hunter “Biden’s international business dealings, with prosecutors considering charges for tax fraud, criminal foreign lobbying, and money laundering.”

If Weiss intends to indict, 2023 will be the year to move because after that the country returns to campaign mode and it seems unlikely the DOJ would drop an indictment of the president’s son during an election year. But whether Weiss indicts or not, the House of Representatives, now under Republican control, will most assuredly investigate the Biden family money-making machine — and there is a lot to investigate, including the financial dealings of Hunter Biden, James Biden, Sara Biden, and all the corporate entities linked to them, and how Joe Biden benefitted from those financial dealings.

Further, beyond Ukraine and Hunter’s dealings there, both Hunter and James Biden (the president’s brother) negotiated deals with the communist Chinese regime, with financial records showing various entities run by President Joe Biden’s family members received wire transfers “from communist-connected Chinese businesses” that “totaled $5,000,000, with the proceeds reaching Hunter and James Biden through a variety of business organizations they controlled.”

Profiteering from communist China represents but one aspect of the duo’s financial dealings. According to The New York Times, Hunter Biden’s joint global equity firm, the Bohai Harvest Equity Investment Fund, helped arrange the purchase by a Chinese mining company of the world’s largest cobalt source in the Congo. “Hunter reportedly launched that new joint enterprise with Chinese business partners less than two weeks after he traveled to China on Air Force Two with his then-vice president father.”

A Senate report also documents Hunter Biden’s receipt of a combined $3.5 million from the wife of the former Moscow mayor, a Kazakhstan investor, and several other individuals. “Closer to home, James Biden’s financial dealings also evidence a complicated pay-to-play scandal underlying his investing in the health care sector” with a business called Americore. James Biden reportedly held out a “promise of a large investment from the Middle East based on his political connections,” before taking “a six-figure personal loan out of Americore’s coffers,” but then the Middle East investment never materialized, and neither did James Biden’s repayment of the loan.

Between federal prosecutors and Republican House oversight committees, 2023 promises to hang out the Biden family’s financial dirty laundry.

4. FBI Corruption

Since SpyGate exploded in 2018 with then-House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes’ release of his memorandum detailing the FBI’s abuse of the FISA court system, evidence of FBI malfeasance has continued to mount. While, to date, the FBI has avoided any real consequences for SpyGate and the burying of the Hunter Biden laptop story, last year saw a slew of agents becoming whistleblowers.

These whistleblowers include some in “senior positions,” who reportedly told Sen. Chuck Grassley’s office that FBI officials “falsely portray[ed] as disinformation evidence acquired from multiple sources that provided the FBI derogatory information related to Hunter Biden’s financial and foreign business activities, even though some of that information had already been or could be verified.”

More whistleblowers also reached out to GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, reporting that FBI officials “allegedly pressured agents to label cases as ‘domestic violent extremism’ to boost case numbers.” And multiple whistleblowers “have disclosed how the FBI leadership is conducting a ‘purge’ of FBI employees holding conservative views,” and is allowing political bias to affect FBI investigations.

The potential for more whistleblowers, coupled with the “Twitter Files” and House oversight committees now in Republican hands, could reveal more fully the FBI’s corruption in 2023.

5. Eugene Yu Versus True the Vote

A fifth scandal to watch in 2023 concerns the fight between Eugene Yu and True the Vote.

Last year ended with the L.A. County district attorney’s office dismissing criminal charges against Yu, the founder of the Michigan-based election-management software company Konnech. The L.A. County D.A. had previously announced Yu’s arrest, stating in a press conference on Oct. 4, 2022, that “under its $2.9 million, five-year contract with the county, Konnech was supposed to securely maintain the data and that only United States citizens and permanent residents have access to it.” Yet according to the press release, “District Attorney investigators found that in contradiction to the contract, information was stored on servers in the People’s Republic of China.”

Shortly after Yu’s arrest, the self-proclaimed “nation’s leading voters’ rights and election integrity organization,” True the Vote, announced that it had “played a small role” in the investigation of Konnech and applauded the L.A. County D.A.’s office for its work on the case. True the Vote’s involvement in the case apparently prompted the far-left D.A. to rethink the charges and eventually led to the dismissal of the criminal case, because of its concerns “about both the pace of the investigation and the potential bias in the presentation and investigation of the evidence.”

While LA. County did not rule out refiling charges against Yu, to date, none have been filed. Meanwhile, Yu has pending a civil lawsuit in a federal district court against True the Vote and two of its representatives for defamation and other claims. Yu, for his part, maintains that Konnech has never stored election worker data on Chinese servers. Conversely, True the Vote maintains it provided the FBI with evidence confirming Konnech illegally used foreign servers.

2023 will see these conflicting accounts play out and, more importantly, reveal the FBI’s role in the scandal — because the real import concerns neither Yu nor True the Vote, but the FBI.

Court documents indicate a confidential human source provided the FBI with evidence that Konnech maintained the personal information of election workers on a Chinese server, and it was based on that evidence the L.A. County D.A. office indicted and arrested Yu. But those charges were later dismissed because the state prosecutor seemed concerned about the authenticity of the evidence.

While the public still does not know whether the CHS’s server data was authentic, the FBI does and did long before Yu was arrested. But following Yu’s arrest, the FBI remained silent, apparently abandoning multiple confidential human sources and discarding an 18-month investigation into evidence that Yu maintained the personal information of tens of thousands of American election workers on a server in China. The other option is that the bureau allowed Yu to be arrested for crimes he did not commit and permitted the innocent American to be branded a felon and traitor by not informing the L.A. district attorney’s office that the China-server data was false.

With Yu’s civil case against True the Vote still pending in Texas, this year should bring some clarity to the question.

6. Supreme Court Leak

While much overdue, 2023 should also bring closure to the Supreme Court leak scandal. That scandal, of course, concerns the leak of Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization to Politico. The May 2022 leak prompted Chief Justice John Roberts to direct Gail Curley, a former Army colonel and the court’s marshal, to investigate the source of the leak.

At the time, Roberts promised a full investigation and indicated the justices could expect a report from him in late fall, but to date, no report has been made public. Watch for 2023 to reveal details — and hopefully justice for the leaker.

7. Covid-19

Several scandals related to Covid-19 seem poised to blossom in 2023. The “Twitter Files” revealed the government’s push to silence critics of the federal response, and those details will likely spur many questions about those efforts — from the origins of Covid-19 and the likelihood of a lab leak, to the funding of gain-of-function research, to the safety and efficacy of the jab. Related scandals may also evolve if it becomes clear that those responsible for formulating the government’s response to Covid knew of the validity of contrary scientific opinions and lied to the public.

8. SpyGate

2023 will likely also be the year Special Counsel John Durham finishes his investigation of the Crossfire Hurricane and Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigations. Conventional wisdom says Durham’s team is done indicting individuals and that all that remains is a written report. If true, those hoping for significant jail time for conspirators will be disappointed. Nonetheless, a detailed synopsis of the Russia collusion hoax will expose the depth of the deceit peddled to our country by corrupt actors in the deep state.

Such a report, when coupled with “Twitter Files” revelations and the growing number of whistleblowers, might be just the impetus needed for a cleaning of intelligence agencies.

9. Pro-Life Targeting

Another scandal developing in 2023 concerns the Biden administration’s targeting of pro-lifers, with the federal prosecution of Mark Houck providing a platform to expose further DOJ politicization.

The Biden administration’s targeting of Houck first made news when some 20 law enforcement officers, including many with ballistic shields, long guns, and a battering ram, swarmed his family home in late September 2022 to arrest the father of seven on charges that he violated the Federal Access to Clinic Entrances, or FACE, Act. Since then, Houck has fought back in court, filing a motion to dismiss the charges and asserting it was the purported escort for Planned Parenthood, not Houck, who violated the FACE Act. Houck also argued in the motion that the Biden administration’s selective use of the FACE Act to prosecute pro-lifers compels the dismissal of the charges.

While a court has yet to rule on the motion, Houck will surely appeal a denial, forcing the Biden administration to defend its ham-handed attack on pro-lifers. And if the charges aren’t dismissed, Houck’s defense — that the Planned Parenthood escort was both the aggressor and the true perpetrator of a FACE Act crime — will be paraded for both the jury and the public at large. At the end of the day, it will likely be the Biden administration on trial.

10. Journalists’ Silence

The tenth scandal of 2023 is one that can’t be watched because it is the dog that didn’t bark: the press that didn’t report.

After years of left-leaning bias in the press, Trump broke the establishment media. The reporters employed by the supposed standard-bearers of journalism abandoned any pretext of professionalism. They peddled the Russia collusion hoax and ignored the Hunter Biden laptop scandal. They stopped being watchdogs for our constitutional republic and began being propagandists for their preferred politicians. And given the media elite’s lack of response to the first nine scandals, their continuing silence in 2023 seems an assured final scandal.

Biden's Border Plan Takes Illegal Immigration To A New Level,"President Biden has finally found a solution to address the surge in illegal crossings at the southern border: tell the tens of thousands of aliens unlawfully entering the United States from Mexico that they can come to America “legally” if they instead fly to a port-of-entry in the interior of the country.

Seriously, for all the Biden administration’s spin, that’s his plan — and it is illegal.

Of course, when Biden announced his administration’s newest policy on Thursday in advance of his midterm inaugural trip to the southern border on Sunday, the press release heralded the plan as a “new border enforcement action.” But as National Review’s Andrew McCarthy exposed in his weekend column, it’s a scam.

The scam, though, is layers thick, both legally and politically. And to reach the core truth — that Biden refuses to faithfully execute his duties as the president of the United States by defending our sovereign border — one must first unpeel the specifics of the newest plan buried in the Department of Homeland Security’s official notice of the changes, while also analyzing the relevant immigration law.

The Plan

Today’s edition of the Federal Register, which serves as “the Daily Journal of the United States Government,” contains the details of DHS’s supposed “new border enforcement action,” in four separate “notices,” titled respectively: “Implementation of a Parole Process for Cubans,” “Implementation of a Parole Process for Haitians,” “Implementation of a Parole Process for Nicaraguans,” and “Implementation of Changes to the Parole Process for Venezuelans.”

Each notice summarizes the Biden administration’s supposed “solution” to the flooding of the southern border, which in short consists of allowing, on a monthly basis, a total of 30,000 aliens to enter the United States “legally” if they are Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, or Venezuelan nationals. To qualify, aliens must have a “U.S.-based supporter,” which could be “non-governmental entities or community-based organizations,” and must “provide for their own commercial travel to an air [port-of-entry] and final U.S. destination.” National security and public safety vetting are also required, as well as any additional public health requirements, such as vaccinations.

But how is it that illegal-alien border crossers can become lawful noncitizens by just jumping through a few hoops and flying to the interior of the country, rather than sneaking over the southern border?

They can’t. And in crafting its latest immigration plan, the Biden administration is again acting lawlessly.

Biden’s Lawlessness

The Biden administration maintains it has the authority to allow aliens from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to enter the United States legally under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, or INA. That section provides the secretary of homeland security the authority to “parole” noncitizens “into the United States temporarily under such reasonable conditions as [the secretary] may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.”

“Parole” for purposes of the INA is a “legal fiction” in which “a paroled alien is physically allowed to enter the country,” but the alien maintains the same legal status as if he or she were held at the border waiting for an application for admission to be granted or denied. But besides obtaining the legal right to be present in the United States, an alien paroled into the United States may obtain employment authorization to work here lawfully.

As the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently explained, “Parole began as an administrative invention that allowed aliens in certain circumstances to remain on U.S. soil without formal admission, with Congress codifying the practice when it initially enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act (the ‘INA’) in 1952.” At that time, Congress gave the attorney general “discretion to parole into the United States temporarily under such conditions as he may prescribe … any alien applying for admission to the United States.”

However, “throughout the mid-twentieth century, the executive branch on multiple occasions purported to use the parole power to bring in large groups of immigrants,” prompting Congress twice to amend the INA “to limit the scope of the parole power and prevent the executive branch from using it as a programmatic policy tool.” First, as the Fifth Circuit explained, in 1980, Congress added a requirement that the executive branch only parole refugees where “compelling reasons in the public interest with respect to that particular alien,” exist. Then, in 1996, Congress amended the INA to provide “parole may be granted ‘only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.’”

While the DHS’s just-announced parole plans claim the department is making parole decisions on a case-by-case basis, the qualifications set forth by the DHS establish that the Biden administration is illegally using parole power “as a programmatic policy tool,” rather than as designed by Congress, for example, by “paroling aliens who do not qualify for an admission category but have an urgent need for medical care in the United States and paroling aliens who qualify for a visa but are waiting for it to become available.”

The Biden administration’s lawless use of its parole power should come as no surprise, though, as since November of 2021, the president’s team has relied on Section 212(d)(5)(A) to release “family units” at the border to supposedly deal with “capacity constraints.” Florida has challenged the Biden administration’s granting of such carte blanche parole, as well as the president’s failure to detain illegal aliens as mandated under the INA, and trial is set to begin on both those claims later today in a federal court in Florida.

The ‘Standing’ Problem

A similar legal challenge to the Biden administration’s recent parole plan seems likely, although by requiring applicants to secure a vetted “supporter” who will commit to providing for the parolees’ financial needs while they are present in the United States, it will be challenging for anyone to show “standing” to challenge DHS’s plan.

For instance, in the Florida case, while the Biden administration argued the state lacked “standing,” or the right to sue, the court rejected that argument, reasoning Florida “plausibly alleged that the challenged policies already have and will continue to cost it millions of dollars, including the cost of incarcerating criminal aliens and the cost of providing a variety of public benefits, including unemployment benefits, free public education, and emergency services to aliens who settle in Florida after being ‘paroled’ into the country.”

But other than providing “free public education,” the same types of monetary harms are lacking in the case of the Biden administration’s latest parole proposal. And it is questionable whether a court will find that providing free public education to children paroled under DHS’s plans will be enough to establish standing.

Absent a plaintiff with standing to challenge DHS’s plan to parole some 30,000 aliens into the United States every month, the only way to fight the Biden administration’s latest lawless move will be politically. Here, those seeking to secure the southern border have ample ammunition, including highlighting the fact that the Biden administration’s plan does nothing to address that portion of the 200,000-some individuals crossing the southern border every month that herald from countries other than Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.

Further, while converting 30,000 illegal border crossers into parolees at ports of entry in the interior of the country may provide a reduction to the problem on paper, it does not secure the border nor promise any reduction in the number of individuals attempting to enter via Mexico.

The parole plan presumes, though, that there will be an even greater reduction in illegal border crossings than the 30,000 who enter as part of the parole process. The parole plan, according to the Biden administration, creates a disincentive for citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to enter illegally at the southern border because the DHS’s new policy also provides that aliens who bypass the parole process and enter the United States without authorization will be subject to an expedited removal to Mexico or their country of origin.

If so, then why not just institute a policy of expediting the removal of individuals who enter illegally at the southern border?

Biden’s Border Disaster

According to the figures included in last week’s DHS notices, prior to the surge at the southern border that followed the Biden administration’s change in enforcement policies, there weren’t even 30,000 aliens from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela crossing the border illegally on an annual basis.

For instance, the notice reported that for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 respectively, DHS encountered only 3,039 and 4,431 Haitian nationals at the southwest border, but by 2021 the number exploded to 43,484.

From 2014 to 2019, DHS encountered 589 Cubans on average every month, but by 2022, the average monthly encounter at the land border totaled 17,809, and in October and November of 2022, some 62,000-plus Cuban nationals attempted to cross the border.

From fiscal 2014 through 2019, border agents encountered a monthly average of 127 Venezuelan nationals, but by fiscal year 2022, the average number of Venezuelans crossing the border illegally on a monthly basis totaled 15,494 and rose to more than 33,000 in September of that year.

For Nicaraguan nationals, in 2022, DHS encountered an estimated 157,400 aliens, or an average of 13,113 per month, compared to an average of 316 per month from fiscal years 2014-2019.

These figures show the Biden administration does not need a parole policy: It needs an enforcement policy.

No End in Sight

There is a telling admission hidden in the DHS notice from last week that announced changes to the parole plan established for Venezuela in October of 2022. As originally established, the Venezuela plan capped the number of “parolees” at a total of 24,000 beneficiaries. But, as the DHS acknowledged in its notice modifying that plan, just two months in, “demand for the Venezuela process has far exceeded the 24,000 limit.”

“Absent immediate action,” the DHS notice explained, “there is a risk that DHS meets the 24,000 cap, which would in turn cause the [government of Mexico] to no longer accept the return of Venezuelan nationals and end the success of the parole process to date at reducing the number of Venezuelan nationals encountered at the border.” Further, should it reach the 24,000 limit, thereby making prospective migrants no longer eligible for parole, the “DHS anticipates that we would then see increased irregular migration of Venezuelans.”

In other words, the Biden administration is allowing aliens to come to America “legally” because if it doesn’t, foreign nationals will just start crossing the border illegally again.

Further, while the Biden administration’s current plan caps the number of parolees at 30,000 per month, the DHS notices indicate it may revisit that figure if necessary. What then, is there to stop the Biden administration from increasing the 30,000 cap two-fold or ten-fold? Or what is there to prevent the administration from expanding parole to aliens from countries beyond the four — maybe 14, or even 40?

While the intricacies of immigration law are detailed and often convoluted, the bottom line of the Biden administration’s parole plan should be clear to all Americans: Joe Biden has no intention of securing our border or faithfully executing his duties as the president of the United States.

"'Differences' Between Biden, Trump Document Troubles Mean Little","Our political media really want you to know that Joe Biden’s classified document controversy is completely different from Donald Trump’s. And, as soon as CBS News reported that Attorney General Merrick Garland had assigned the U.S. attorney in Chicago to review how “roughly 10” classified documents ended up in President Biden’s office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, pundits and reporters began trying to mitigate the political fallout and diffuse claims of a double standard.

In today’s Politico Playbook, “courts guru” Josh Gerstein tells us that one of the distinctions “worth noting” between the two incidents is that there are fewer documents at stake, “about 300 in the Trump case versus ‘a small number’ at the think tank.”

Listen, I’m no guru, but I was unaware that there was a “small number” exemption in the laws pertaining to the mishandling of classified information. After all, Clinton’s National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, who was about to testify in front of the 9/11 Commission, stuffed copies of a single classified report down his pants in 2004. He was sentenced to two years of probation and 100 hours of community service, was stripped of his security clearance, and lost his law license. As a legal and political matter, the attempted destruction of a single report detailing the Clinton administration’s failures regarding Islamic terrorism mattered quite a bit at the time. Certainly, it’s not just a matter of numbers.

Nevertheless, Gerstein argues that it’s not unusual “for small numbers of emails or documents that are classified to get mixed in with unclassified records,” but it is “hard to argue you don’t know what’s lying around your house if there’s a lot of it.”

Is it? The media keeps mentioning this “think tank” to convince readers that it’s all just a big misunderstanding. I mean, who does anything wrong at a think tank, right? Of course, the institution in question was home to Biden’s personal office at a “job” he held with the University of Pennsylvania from 2017-19 — where he made nearly a million dollars for nine visits to the actual school (one of them to sell his novel, “Promise Me, Dad.”) Does Trump know what’s “lying around” his 62,500-square-foot, 58-bedroom home any more than Biden does his office? Maybe. It is almost surely the case that security at this larger residence, provided by the Secret Service, is as good as what one might find on the sixth-floor office of a “think tank” in the middle of D.C.

The “where” doesn’t really matter.

In truth, most fights over classified documents are overblown. Who knows? Maybe both Biden and Trump accidentally lifted classified documents. Or maybe both hand-picked embarrassing documents they didn’t want made public and took them. (Unmentioned in most stories is the fact that vice presidents have fewer privilege than presidents when handling sensitive documents.) Maybe they’re both lying about how many documents they have. Maybe neither of them knew. The one major difference right now, as Joy Behar might say, is that Biden is given “the benefit of the doubt.”

In its initial report on the Mar-a-Lago raid, The Washington Post had insinuated that Trump had snuck nuclear codes out of the White House. Hysterics like Michael Hayden and Michael Beschloss wanted the former president dragged to the electric chair for selling secrets to the Ruskies. As with every Trump story, it was prudent to wait. We still don’t know what documents were in his possession.

The same goes goes for Biden. CNN reports that two sources — both, almost certainly connected to Biden — say that the former vice president was in possession of “intelligence memos and briefing materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom.” Those topics seem quite relevant. Where is the outrage? CNN tempers the news by assuring us that the “vast majority of the items in the office contained personal Biden family documents, including materials about Beau Biden’s funeral arrangements and condolence letters.” One assumes that the vast majority of boxes at Mar-a-Lago are also teeming with personal business. It’s completely irrelevant. As is CNN’s preposterous embedded infographic comparing the two cases — Biden is “cooperating” with his own administration, it notes, but Trump is “under investigation for obstruction,” and so on.

The highly curated leaks from Biden’s people are meant to get in front of the news. That’s their job. The political media, in turn, repeated, nearly verbatim, what they are told. That’s not their job. Their job is to be as skeptical of Biden’s contentions as they were of Trump’s or Clinton’s. The president, after all, has proven to be an inveterate liar.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/10/none-of-the-medias-concocted-differences-between-biden-and-trumps-document-controversies-are-convincing/,2023-01-10
Difference In Biden And Trump's Classified Docs Isn't What You Think,"Nearly six years after Joe Biden’s term as vice president ended, classified materials — including some reportedly top-secret files — were discovered in the closet of a think tank housed on the sixth floor of a private D.C. office building.

The news comes less than four months after President Biden called former President Donald Trump “irresponsible” following the seizure from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home of documents marked classified. The Biden administration has already moved to preempt claims of hypocrisy by leaking the existence of a Justice Department investigation into the matter, but it is much too late to undo the double standard that led to the FBI raiding Trump’s Florida home last year.

“Attorney General Merrick Garland has assigned the U.S. attorney in Chicago to review classified documents found at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, two sources with knowledge of the inquiry told CBS News,” yesterday’s breaking news story opened. Richard Sauber, a special counsel to President Biden who was reportedly hired by the White House in May of 2022 to assist in the administration’s response to any potential Republican-led investigations, confirmed to CBS News that the classified documents were discovered on Nov. 2, 2022.

According to Sauber, while Biden’s personal attorneys “were packing files housed in a locked closet to prepare to vacate office space at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C.,” they discovered the documents. Unnamed sources told CBS News that the classified documents were in a folder stored within a box containing other unclassified papers.

While CBS News noted that the sources did not reveal “what the classified documents contain[ed] nor their level of classification,” CNN later reported that “the classified materials included some top-secret files with the ‘sensitive compartmented information’ designation, also known as SCI, which is used for highly sensitive information obtained from intelligence sources.”

The discovery that Biden had stored classified documents at a private D.C. think tank is especially embarrassing for the president given comments he made in September 2022 when he sat down with Scott Pelley of “60 Minutes.” When asked how he reacted to seeing photographs of several documents bearing classification markings seized at Mar-a-Lago, Biden remarked that he wondered, “How that could possibly happen,” and “how anyone could be that irresponsible.”

“I thought,” Biden said to Pelley, “What data was in there that may compromise sources and methods?” “It’s just totally irresponsible,” Biden repeated.

While Biden has yet to personally address the discovery of the classified documents, having ignored questions on the issue from reporters covering his Mexico City summit, his administration is already spinning the story. One Biden source told CNN that the president’s “lawyers immediately contacted the National Archives and Records Administration, which started looking into the matter.” “Biden’s team cooperated with NARA, which later came to view the situation as a mistake due to lack of safeguards for documents,” the unnamed source claimed.

But the similarities between the situations remain striking, with the classified documents both at Mar-a-Lago and at the Biden think tank, comingled with unclassified documents, reportedly including “top secret” documents, and stored in a closet.

At least, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home was private and protected by the Secret Service, while the Penn Biden Center was located at a busy D.C. office building that spanned some 10 stories and included numerous public areas, including a reception area on the roof that hosted weddings and other private events.

Nonetheless, the Biden administration seeks to squelch the controversy by focusing on his cooperation with the National Archives and Records Administration. But it is the lack of cooperation by the National Archives and Records Administration with former President Trump that marks the real difference in the situations.

Even before the Obama-Biden administration ended, former President Obama “rented a private facility in Hoffman Estates to serve as a storage place for his presidential papers, and by October of 2016, while he was still in office, shipments of artifacts from his presidency began arriving at the suburban Chicago storage facility.” The National Archives and Records Administration would later work with Obama to ship his documents to the Chicago suburb. And the Obama documents — both classified and unclassified — remained at the Hoffman Estates location well into 2018.

As I wrote in August, shortly after the FBI’s raid on former President Trump’s home:

The only difference between the Hoffman Estates’ storage of the Obama presidential records that began in 2016 and the Mar-a-Lago storage of Trump’s presidential records was that the documents were technically within the possession of NARA. But even though the documents were legally the property of NARA, Obama still had the right to access the records, including the classified documents.

So if the NARA had legitimate concerns about Trump’s possession of presidential records at Mar-a-Lago, the NARA “would have worked to arrange for the documents to be preserved under the auspices of NARA control in a location chosen by Trump, as it had done with Obama.”

But the NARA didn’t work with Trump, with the records instead suggesting that “a backbench bureaucrat’s partisan grievance spurred the FBI’s nakedly political raid on Trump.” And that is where the real double standard is seen.

Who knows, too, what classified documents the FBI might have discovered had it raided all the Biden and Obama properties mere months after they left office, as agents did to Trump?

We’ll never know that answer, though, because the NARA properly partnered with the former Obama-Biden administration. And that is the appropriate comparator to consider, not how the NARA or the DOJ responded to the recent discovery of Biden’s secreted classified documents. Of course, given their very public mistreatment of Trump, the NARA had to refer the case to the DOJ, and Attorney General Merrick Garland had to assign a U.S. attorney to investigate the matter.

But the supposed equal treatment on display now does not undo the NARA’s partisan targeting of Trump that began the day he walked out of the White House for the last time. Nonetheless, it is quite satisfying to watch the Biden administration eat crow.

"Despite Biden's Denials, NYT Confirms Involvement In Family Biz","To this day, President Joe Biden denies his long history of involvement in the lucrative Biden family business, but the corrupt corporate media are finally admitting the president’s participation in the financial dealings spearheaded by his son Hunter Biden.

The New York Times published an article this week claiming, “a close look at [Hunter’s] story shows that it differs in important ways from the narrative promoted by Republicans,” who, with their newfound majority in the House, are investigating the Biden family’s “deliberate, repeated deception of the American people, abuse of the executive branch for personal gain, [and] use of government power to obstruct the investigation.”

The article merely acknowledges what conservative media outlets have reported for years about Biden’s involvement in Hunter’s overseas business dealings. Yes, then-Vice President Biden, who was tasked with “overseeing U.S. policy in Ukraine,” met with Hunter’s “main point of contact” at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma at a charity dinner event, the NYT confessed, but waved off Biden’s visit with Pozharskyi as the U.S. leader’s attempt “to spend time” with his addict son.

Followers of the unraveling Biden family corruption story have already known for over a year and a half that Pozharskyi confirmed this interaction in an email thanking Hunter for “giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent some time together.”

Biden, The New York Times conceded in a paragraph buried deep in the article, also met with Hunter’s Chinese business partners. He even authored an optimistic note to Devon Archer, arguably Hunter’s closest associate, on White House letterhead to congratulate him on snuggling up to China’s then-head Hu Jintao.

The Times also reported that Biden “met regularly with Eric Schwerin, his son’s business manager,” and even handed over management of the then-VP’s personal finances. Schwerin, the Times admitted, would occasionally “pay a bill for Vice President Biden out of one of his son’s accounts and then assure that he was repaid.” Biden’s ties to Schwerin are no surprise considering that he reportedly rubbed shoulders with more than a dozen of Hunter’s business associates, sometimes in the West Wing of the White House. Yet The New York Times argues that the 2010 emails evidencing the existence of these shared accounts and entanglement of finances shouldn’t matter because anonymous sources reportedly close to the Biden family said Hunter and his dad never “had joint bank accounts or direct access to each others’ money.”

Over and over and over and over and over, Biden and his White House denied not just wrongdoing, but an association of any kind with Hunter’s money-making schemes. Apparently at the behest of the FBI, the regime’s allies in the corporate media have long accepted and helped amplify Biden’s lies, forming a bogus “fact-checking” and election-meddling apparatus for tech giants to censor anyone who exposed Biden family corruption.

Now, as mountains of evidence point to Biden’s deep ties to activity that’s at best unethical and possibly illegal, the Times, even in admitting Biden’s involvement, is once more writing off Hunter as “a man battling with personal demons against the background of family tragedy,” with his dad merely getting caught in the crossfire. In predictable spin, the NYT instead tries to make the story about Republicans, whom it says merely “intend to intensify their scrutiny of Hunter Biden in a bid to inflict damage on his father as he prepares for his likely 2024 re-election bid.”

An inquiry into the Bidens, however, is long overdue and an unsurprising development given the GOP’s newly acquired majority in the lower chamber. House Republicans’ investigation seeks to finally expose how the president’s proximity to his son’s twisted and likely illicit bargaining may have compromised the security of the United States. After all, Hunter didn’t just exchange access to his father, the then-second-highest executive officer in the United States, for cash to fund the family’s lavish lifestyle. He was paid off by oligarchs and businessmen in countries with a vested interest in meddling with U.S. affairs.

The New York Times’ attempt to write that off as “complex” is just further evidence of its allegiance to the Biden administration instead of the truth.

New Biden Docs Cache Makes Media Excuses Look Even Dumber,"Not unlike his predecessor, President Joe Biden seems to like to keep important information close to home.

A new trove of classified materials was discovered this week in a “locked” garage and at least one room of Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware mansion. Biden confessed to reporters on Thursday that most of the sensitive documents recovered at his home from his years as vice president were kept next to his Corvette until they were found in December.

Instead of launching an hours-long raid at the sitting president’s swanky $2 million property as the FBI did when they discovered former President Donald Trump had classified documents in his private residence, Attorney General Merrick Garland reported that the FBI peacefully retrieved the materials from Biden’s home.

Similarly, the classified Obama-era documents discovered in November, shortly before the midterm elections, in a closet at Biden’s Washington, D.C.-based Penn Biden Center were quietly retrieved and turned over to the National Archives. Word of the classified materials recovered from Biden wasn’t revealed to the public until months later.

All things considered, the document scandal ranks low on Biden’s list of self-inflicted crises over the last two years, as Federalist Senior Legal Correspondent Margot Cleveland noted in her coverage earlier today.

The media’s compulsion to cover for the regime, however, propelled audible and written defenses of the president for the same behavior they eviscerated Trump for.

All week, corporate media preoccupied themselves with outlining how the Trump and Biden document discoveries were marked by several “clear distinctions.” Biden only possessed a “small number” of classified documents compared to Trump, media argued, automatically making his offense much smaller than the Republican’s.

Trump likely broke the law, publications like The New York Times and talking heads on MSNBC suggested. Biden, however, is being painted as blameless since his team agreed to “cooperate” with his own administration’s DOJ and National Archives — just not Republican investigators.

Another distinction suggested by the press, even before the latest round of documents was reported, was that Trump’s storing documents at his private residence, a secure property protected by the Secret Service, was somehow far worse than Biden leaving documents in a closet in a busy public office building in Washington D.C.

“The Biden papers were said to be stored in a locked closet. The Mar-a-Lago classified documents were found in 12 boxes piled in a storage room, as well as in Trump’s office,” one opinion contributor argued in the pages of The Hill.

“Another difference between the Trump & Biden doc cases is the nature of the storage. Biden’s docs were discovered in a locked closet. Trump kept his docs in an unsecured location at Mar-a-Lago (a known target of foreign intel ops) & refused to secure them after DOJ asked them to,” a columnist for The Independent tweeted.

Using the “where” to distinguish between Trump and Biden’s document problems was a bad argument from the start. Now that Biden is fending off criticism for keeping classified materials in his home, that weak excuse is null and void.

When the FBI launched a surprise raid on Mar-a-Lago, ostensibly over classified materials, the media used the “where” to justify their ongoing persecution of Trump. But when classified materials were discovered in Biden’s private residence, Biden and his allies in the media lamely insisted the documents were safe and secure in a “locked” garage.

Doocy: ""Classified materials next to your corvette? What were you thinking?



Biden: ""My corvette is in a locked garage.""

The true distinction between Trump and Biden’s document snafus, of course, lies not in how, when, or where the documents were discovered but in the National Archives’ lack of cooperation with Trump.

Will that be considered by the special counsel, handpicked by the same guy who authorized the raid on Trump? Likely not.

Regardless, the corporate media will keep shilling for Biden, even as the so-called “clear distinctions” between his and Trump’s behavior become further muddled.

"On Classified Documents, Joe Biden Is Out Of Excuses","Every president probably stashes away classified documents. The chances of any president being successfully prosecuted for pilfering them are infinitesimal. Nevertheless, now that we’ve learned Joe Biden has engaged in the same behavior as Donald Trump — perhaps worse, considering vice presidents are afforded less leeway on classified documents — precedent and transparency, our very democracy, demand Attorney General Merrick Garland name a special counsel to investigate (I get results!)

Right now, none of the rationalizations offered by the media for Biden’s actions over the past few days are operational. When the story first broke, outlets stressed that one of the vital “distinctions” between the two incidents was that Biden was in possession of fewer documents than Trump. Biden aides, we learned, had been utterly shocked to discover only a “small number” of classified documents “locked” in the personal offices of the president’s “think tank” — as if the location or the number of documents, or the alleged lock, rather than the contents, were the most newsworthy aspect of the story.

Today, we learned that a second “batch” of classified documents was uncovered at an “undisclosed” location. Suddenly, everything got incredibly vague. Biden aides, we are told, began diligently rummaging through boxes to ensure they were in complete compliance with the law. A completely independent source told collusion-hoaxer Ken Dilanian that the “search was described as exhaustive, with the goal of getting a full accounting of all classified documents that may have inadvertently been packed in boxes when Biden cleared out of the vice president’s office space in January 2017.” It’s heartening to know that the Bidens are such diligent, law-abiding folk.

Yesterday, we were told that classified documents that are found in a serious office setting, rather than just “lying around” in a home, was an important difference between the two cases. Today, Biden’s lawyer says that “small number” of classified documents was also found “locked” in Biden’s garage and an “adjacent” room of his Wilmington home. (Don’t worry, the president assures us it was safely stored next to his beloved Corvette.) You know, if we find another “small number” of documents, we might just have ourselves a full cache.

No doubt, journalists are super curious to know how those classified documents got into Joe’s garage. I mean, the guy had a think tank office at his disposal in D.C. Moreover, the initial documents were alleged to have been discovered before midterms, and yet we’re only hearing about new ones months later — and in convenient dribs and drabs.

Soon after CBS’s initial story, a four-byline puff piece from CNN reported that the documents found in the think tank were related to Ukraine, Iran, and the U.K., so not just keepsakes and letters and such. This week we also learned, in another soft-peddled report by The New York Times, that Biden, despite his insistence that he knew nothing about his son Hunter’s foreign entanglements, had met with a liaison from the Ukrainian energy interest Burisma, among many other revelations. Recall, Obama officials had also raised concerns about the Biden family business. Is there any chance those Ukrainian documents would have been embarrassing to the president? Seems a reasonable question.

What’s important now, we’re going to be instructed, is that Biden “immediately” contacted the authorities and is fully “cooperating.” Is it possible, and I’m just theorizing here, that Biden and his aides are lying? For one thing, cooperating is fine, but it’s not everything. Trump has every right to hire a lawyer and fight the Archives over documents. Maybe he’s got a case, maybe he doesn’t. But perhaps Biden also simply picked an opportune time to cooperate with his own administration in an effort to avoid any transparency. Far from “immediately” handing over this material, the president’s been in possession of classified documents for nearly seven years. How does the DOJ know there aren’t more documents stashed away? How does it know Biden, like Trump, didn’t put them in his garage on purpose? Because he says so?

Don’t get me wrong, it’s entertaining watching the comically obvious attempts to mitigate the damage. But if Biden hasn’t done anything wrong, he has absolutely nothing to fear.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/12/we-need-a-special-counsel-to-investigate-joe-bidens-classified-documents-case-pronto/,2023-01-12
5 Times Media Ran Cover For Biden In Classified Docs Scandal,"A fourth tranche of documents marked classified was found at President Joe Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware residence, White House counsel revealed over the weekend.

The discovery follows that of other documents from Biden’s time as vice president, which were found at a Washington think tank and in his personal garage. A third discovery, this time of a classified document in Biden’s Delaware home, occurred on Thursday. When classified documents were supposedly found at former President Donald Trump’s palace at Mar-a-Lago through an FBI raid, Biden shamed his Republican predecessor as “irresponsible.”

“How that could possibly happen, how one — anyone could be that irresponsible,” Biden said.

From the moment the first records were discovered at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, however, Biden’s allies in the legacy press corps jumped to give cover for the flagrant hypocrisy. And of course, shortly after news of the records surfaced, the narratives collapsed.

1. Washington Post Says Biden Docs Are Different

Just after CBS News dropped its bombshell report on the classified documents from Biden’s time as vice president discovered in a Washington office, The Washington Post sought to dispel comparisons to the FBI raid conducted on Trump’s Palm Beach home.

“The case will likely draw comparisons to Mar-a-Lago but appears quite different,” the Post reported. “Officials have said the Trump investigation concerns not just the possible mishandling of classified documents, but possible obstruction of justice or destruction of records.”

While the two cases aren’t all that different, there are major distinctions between them worth highlighting. Biden kept the documents for six years. The timeframe exceeded the entire tenure of President Obama’s Republican successor. Was team Biden hiding certain material from the Trump administration? Some of the material found reportedly had to do with Ukraine, where Hunter Biden was engaged in a myriad of business ventures now under investigation by his father’s Department of Justice (DOJ).

Biden’s attorneys also found four tranches of classified documents stored across multiple unsecured locations. Federal law enforcement confiscated records at Trump’s 128-room complex in Florida, and nowhere else.

2. CNN Uses Dead Son as Shield for Docs Scandal

On Thursday, CNN published a frenzied narrative of Biden’s final days in the Obama administration that may have led to the mishandling of classified material.

“Partly to wrap up his policy portfolios, partly to tout his accomplishments, and partly to occupy himself following the death of his son a year earlier,” CNN explained, “Biden thrust himself into work in a final sprint to mark what then appeared to be the end of a four-decade run at the highest levels of government.”

3. ‘The View’ Ladies Suggest Republicans Planted Documents in Biden’s Home

Joy Behar, a longtime co-host of ABC’s “The View,” insinuated Republicans planted the documents in Biden’s residence.

“I’ve never seen a luckier person than Donald Trump,” Behar said. “Just as we’re this close to getting him, somehow these documents appear.”

“Does it feel like the Republicans are behind it?” asked co-host Sunny Hostin a few minutes later.

4. Behar Pardons Biden Because Biden Doesn’t ‘Lie’

Behar also tried to exonerate President Biden last week by claiming the commander-in-chief never lies.

“We all know that Trump is a liar and a thief,” Behar said on the daytime program. “We don’t think that Biden is a liar and a thief, so we give him the benefit of the doubt.”

Behar missed The Federalist’s lie trackers here, here, and here.

5. ABC News Repeats White House Talking Points

ABC News sought to shield the president from any appearance of misconduct by amplifying White House talking points contrasting the snafu to the administration’s raid at Mar-a-Lago.

According to the Media Research Center last week, ABC justice correspondent Pierre Thomas went on “World News Tonight” to downplay the classified documents found in Biden’s private possession.

“The White House emphasizes that as soon as Biden’s attorneys discovered the documents, they quickly contacted the National Archives, which in turn reached out to the Justice Department, which has launched a preliminary investigation,” Thomas said. “Former President Donald Trump, on the other hand, who took more than 300 classified documents with him to Mar-a-Lago, refused to turn over all the material for months, which ultimately led the FBI to search his home.”",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/16/5-times-media-ran-cover-for-biden-in-classified-documents-scandal/,2023-01-16
"Here's Why Hunter Biden Story Is Worth Investigating, Chuck Todd","This weekend, NBC’s Chuck Todd and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson had a tense exchange over the importance of the Hunter Biden story. After whatabouting the issue for a bit, an agitated Todd asked: “Senator, do you have a crime that you think Hunter Biden committed? Because I’ve yet to see anybody explain. It is not a crime to make money off of your last name.”

There can’t be an investigation until we know for certain that something criminal occurred, but we can’t know if anything criminal occurred until there’s an investigation. Convenient. This, of course, is not the standard journalists have ever embraced for scrutinizing presidential wrongdoing in the past. Todd regularly entertained notions about Donald Trump’s alleged seditious conspiracy in 2016 — which would have been the most diabolical political crime in American history — without any tangible evidence of criminality.

Also, not inconsequentially, Hunter is already under criminal investigation for tax and gun charges by federal prosecutors in Delaware. So, surely, the case has hit the threshold of a criminal investigation. Does Todd not know about this?

That said, a president doesn’t necessarily have to break a specific criminal code to be corrupt. And this scandal isn’t about Biden’s son or his brother, but about Joe. At worst, Biden benefitted and participated in the family influence peddling, or, at best, he spent years lying to the American public about his knowledge of that business. Even if we found pictures of Trump and Putin taking shots of Imperia vodka together to celebrate the defeat of American democracy, it still wouldn’t change the fact Biden has much to answer for.

Recall that in an interview with Axios, Biden claimed he knew absolutely nothing about what Hunter was doing with Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company that was paying the younger Biden $50,000 monthly. Joe said he trusted Hunter, who had accepted a no-show job while his father was overseeing the Obama administration’s policy in Ukraine. That firm was led by an oligarch who at the time was under investigation for corruption.

Joe Biden claims that as vice president, he threatened Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko with the withdrawal of United States aid if he didn’t fire state prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma at the time. That, at the very least, was a serious conflict of interest. In 2015, some Obama administration officials — not exactly right-wing conspiracy theorists — raised concerns about the Bidens and Ukraine.

Because of the New York Post’s investigation into Hunter’s laptop — a story ignored by the Chuck Todds of the world for transparently partisan reasons — we also learned that an executive from Burisma thanked Hunter for facilitating a meeting between him and Joe while the latter was still vice president. This week, The New York Times gingerly confirmed that Biden had, indeed, met with Burisma reps. We also know that Hunter’s business partner made at least 19 visits to the Obama White House. We know that former Hunter associate Tony Bobulinski has sworn that Joe Biden discussed the family business. Emails suggest that Biden was the recipient of 10 percent in all those deals. I suspect if this was about Donald Trump, Chuck Todd would care more?

None of this even gets into the fact that Hunter’s associates allegedly facilitated a meeting between then-Vice President Biden and Chinese Communist Party members and billionaires in Beijing. Or that Hunter’s emails claim that You-Know-Who got a 10 percent share in a deal Hunter struck with a Chinese energy firm.

Todd, incidentally, decried the “political” nature of the Hunter investigation in an interview with incoming House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer last week. Of course there’s a political motivation here. Every investigation into Trump had a political motivation, as well. Virtually every congressional investigation in history, to some extent, is politically motivated. This is how the American government works. One side keeps the other honest. That alone doesn’t make the underlying claims untrue. Remember, Hillary Clinton’s illegal server and influence peddling were ferreted out in the Benghazi investigation — which, unsurprisingly, Todd also claimed was propelled by “conspiracy theory.”

It’s not the partisan incentive that made the Russia collusion narrative a hoax, it was the complete lack of merit and evidence. Republicans would be wise not to obsess over Hunter Biden, but they already have far more genuine evidence to justify a House investigation.

Now, I’m not certain if taking a cut from the family racket is technically a criminal offense, but it’s most definitely a worthwhile story. Maybe Joe Biden, noted civil rights activist and college football star, merely lied to distance himself from his son, or maybe not. How will we ever know? Republicans can’t rely on the political media to do its job. Todd, Jake Tapper, Joe Scarborough, and many others don’t merely dismiss inconvenient stories as unworthy of their attention, they act like members of the Biden Praetorian Guard.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/16/heres-why-the-hunter-biden-corruption-story-is-worth-investigating-chuck-todd/,2023-01-16
"Republicans Are Investigating Corruption, Not Hunter Biden","Fresh off their attacks on Republicans for spending time to debate and negotiate over the leadership of and House rules for the 118th Congress, the corporate media have executed a perfectly synchronized pivot to now assailing Republicans for investigating Hunter Biden. But House Republicans, now in the majority, aren’t investigating Hunter Biden: They are investigating evidence of corruption by Joe Biden and the FBI, as well as other government actors’ efforts to run defense for the now-president, including by pressuring private companies to censor speech.

By regaining a majority in the House, Republicans now hold control over oversight committees, such as the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Judiciary Committee, and with that control, subpoena power. In addition to the standing committees, soon after the just-elected Speaker Kevin McCarthy gaveled in the new Congress, the House passed a resolution temporarily establishing a Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, which will be led by the chair of the Judiciary Committee, Republican Jim Jordan.

Both the Oversight Committee and the select subcommittee will be investigating evidence of misconduct, as Jordan and Kentucky Rep. James Comer, the chair of the Oversight Committee, explained during a joint press conference late last year.

“We’re going to provide you all with something you’re not used to with respect to judicial hearings,” Comer opened the Nov. 17, 2022, press conference, “and that’s evidence.” Comer then detailed some of the evidence compiled to date and what that evidence suggested.

From talking with numerous whistleblowers, to analyzing the communications and records recovered from Hunter Biden’s laptop, to reviewing various financial documents, committee Republicans “have identified over 50 countries the Biden family sought businesses in,” Comer stressed. That evidence showed, he added, that “the Bidens flourished and became millionaires by offering access to the family,” both internationally and within the United States.

With Comer now the official chair of the Oversight Committee, the committee has announced it is “investigating the Biden family’s domestic and international business dealings to determine whether these activities compromise U.S. national security and President Biden’s ability to lead with impartiality.” “Members of the Biden family have a pattern of peddling access to the highest levels of government to enrich themselves, often to the detriment of U.S. interests,” the announcement continued, noting that the committee is “committed to following the Biden family and associates’ money trail — consisting of many complex, international transactions worth millions of dollars — and providing answers to the American people.”

Last week, Comer made several moves to advance the investigation, first by requesting from the Department of the Treasury any Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) generated by banks that flagged the suspicious financial activities of Hunter Biden, Jim Biden (the president’s brother), and an array of Biden family associates and related companies. Comer further sent letters to three former high-level Twitter executives including the former deputy general counsel of Twitter, James Baker, and Yoel Roth, the former global head of trust and safety of Twitter, requesting they appear at a committee hearing the week of Feb. 6 to address their “role in suppressing Americans’ access to information about the Biden family on Twitter shortly before the 2020 election.”

The Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government will likely also probe matters connected to Hunter Biden, as its charge is to “investigate matters related to the collection, analysis, dissemination, and use of information on U.S. citizens by executive branch agencies, including whether such efforts are illegal, unconstitutional, or otherwise unethical.”

But again, the subcommittee is not targeting the president’s son but investigating evidence, including some brought forward by whistleblowers. President Biden is not a vicarious target of the probes; rather, his own involvement in the various influence-peddling activities is at issue. Equally at issue is the malfeasance of the FBI and other government agents who, according to whistleblowers, buried evidence implicating the Bidens while lying to Big Tech outlets that the scandal was Russian disinformation to prompt the censorship of the story before the 2020 election.

The matters meriting investigation are many and complicated, as Comer made clear: The Biden family solicited business opportunities in some 50 countries and used a complex web of shell businesses to operate. And while private emails and text messages, as well as individuals involved in some of the business ventures, implicate Joe Biden, the committees will need to unwind the money trail and obtain further testimony to undercover precisely the breadth and depth of the scandal.

Likewise, unraveling the FBI’s complicity will prove complex. Sen. Chuck Grassley’s office has already revealed that “multiple FBI whistleblowers, including those in senior positions,” claimed the “Washington Field Office assistant special agent in charge Timothy Thibault and other FBI officials … ‘falsely portray[ed] as disinformation evidence acquired from multiple sources that provided the FBI derogatory information related to Hunter Biden’s financial and foreign business activities, even though some of that information had already been or could be verified.’” But those allegations could be but the tip of the FBI’s malfeasance iceberg.

Did FBI headquarters bury other evidence? Did it share with the field offices investigating Hunter Biden and Jim Biden the laptop and all of the information it had obtained? Did the FBI intend to bury Hunter Biden’s laptop? Did the FBI provide the intelligence community access to the laptop and together provide Joe Biden a defensive briefing? Why did the FBI return to Hunter’s attorneys another laptop recovered during a raid of his psychiatrist’s office?

And what about the FBI’s role in pushing the false narrative that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation? “The Twitter Files” exposed an entirely new angle to the FBI scandal by revealing that the FBI had monthly and then weekly meetings with Twitter, Facebook, and other tech executives and pushed the various tech giants to censor stories. “The Twitter Files” also revealed that the FBI maintained a secret communications channel by which it shared information with Twitter, including several files the night before the Hunter Biden laptop story broke.

While both Twitter and Facebook have already publicly acknowledged they censored the New York Post’s explosive reporting on the Hunter Biden laptop story because of the warnings the FBI provided about Russian disinformation, we don’t know the extent of warnings, who else the FBI pushed to censor the stories, and who at the FBI is responsible for peddling the myth that the laptop story was Russian disinformation. The House committee’s investigation into the FBI will help answer these questions too.

This brief synopsis of the scandals meriting investigation barely scratches the surface but makes clear nonetheless that while the Biden-family defenders, in their adjunct role as journalists, frame the planned investigations as Republicans’ fallacious targeting of Hunter Biden to taint his father, this burgeoning narrative ignores the reality of the situation — and the evidence.

4 Absurd Media Narratives To Distract From Biden's Many Scandals,"President Biden and his official representatives, whether members of his legal team or part of the White House’s press office, as well as his surrogates in the Democrat Party, find themselves drowning in scandal.

With House oversight committees now in the hands of Republicans, the Biden administration can no longer spurn demands for documents and answers to questions related to President Joe Biden’s involvement in and profiting from his son Hunter’s international financial entanglements. Add to that long-ignored scandal the incoming flood of questions concerning the discovery of three separate batches of unsecured classified documents dating back to his time as vice president, and we have a perfect storm set to destroy Biden’s presidency.

But Biden need not fret, as the legacy media have dispatched their journalists to moonlight as a PR team for the president, as best exemplified by The New York Times’ lengthy piece from last week, “Hunter Biden’s Tangled Tale Comes Front and Center.” The Times is not alone, however, in spinning the scandals. While it is still early days, here are four narratives that have already launched.

1. Republicans Pounce

No matter the scandal, the Democrat-defending media reflexively run with the “Republicans pounce” formula, and so the coverage of the investigations into Biden’s financial dealings and his mishandling of classified material predictably followed that approach. The story became about Republicans’ reaction to the scandal, not the scandal itself.

“Republicans pounced on the discovery on Saturday of more classified documents at Joe Biden’s residence, accusing the president of hypocrisy and questioning why the records were not brought to light earlier,” The Guardian opened its coverage of the revelation that Biden had stored classified documents at him home, in addition to in a closet at a D.C. office building.

Other outlets, such as CNN, moved away from the overused “Republicans pounce” framing, substituting “attack” for the overworn cliché: “As House Republicans officially take over Congress and clamor to investigate the Biden administration, a new line of attack fell squarely into their laps: classified documents recovered from one of President Joe Biden’s private offices when he served as vice president,” CNN began its coverage of the growing list of investigations Biden faces.

While the “pounced,” “attacked,” “seized,” and other thesaurus-ready descriptors of Republicans’ responses to the scandals permeate much of the corrupt media’s coverage of the Joe Biden scandals, The New York Times deserves accolades for creativity, with the Old Gray Lady making the story about Republicans in a fresh new way.

“The way Republicans tell it,” the Times opened, “President Biden has been complicit in a long-running scheme to profit from his position in public life through shady dealings around the world engineered by his son, Hunter Biden.” Then over the course of some 6,000 words, the Times presented the Biden family’s tale as its own.

While not the “Republican pounce” headline conservatives expect, this new introductory technique allows apologists in the press to divert attention away from the story by presenting the news as mere claims made by Republicans. The Times, however, quickly reverted to the pounced-light “attack” charge to soften the financial scandal, to wit:

After his father became vice president, Hunter Biden, a 52-year-old Yale-educated lawyer, forged business relationships with foreign interests that brought him millions of dollars, raised questions about whether he was cashing in on his family name, set off alarms among government officials about potential conflicts of interest, and provided Republicans an opening for years of attacks on his father.

2. Poor Hunter

The New York Times’ nearly 6,000-word tome also introduced the prominent “poor Hunter” spin, hoping pity for the surviving Biden son would diminish the scandals — or at least sidetrack readers.

“And after the death of his brother, Beau, in 2015, Hunter descended into a spiral of addiction and tawdry and self-destructive behavior,” the Times told readers. Stressing Hunter is sober now, the supposed standard-bearer of journalism then framed his legal troubles as “stemming from his behavior during his most troubled years.” And as for Hunter lying on a form he filled out to purchase a handgun in 2018, falsely saying he was not using drugs, the Times sought to downplay any such charges by noting that Hunter “has openly acknowledged his years of struggle with drugs and alcohol…”

[READ: The Gun Background Check Form Where Hunter Biden Claimed He Wasn’t Using Drugs]

The potential gun charges and the tax evasion charges being looked into by the Delaware U.S. attorney’s office, the Times claimed “trace back” to a time when Hunter had “intensifying problems with addiction and his loss of relationships with three of the people closest to him: a longtime colleague, his wife and his brother.” The Times then spoke of Hunter’s business manager as his “safety net” who was in on the Biden family secret: Hunter’s alcoholism. But it was Beau, Hunter’s older brother, who ensured Hunter “attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and steered him back toward sobriety whenever he relapsed.”

“After Beau died of brain cancer in 2015,” the Times explained, “Hunter had another relapse and, for the first time, his brother was not there to help him. Hunter brought his drinking briefly back under control, but the first anniversary of Beau’s death sent him into a spiral of depression that led to an addiction to crack cocaine.”

On and on the New York Times went, adding details of Hunter’s failed marriage, his unsuccessful stints in rehab, and his toxic relationship with Beau’s widow. Then, once softened up by the sob story, the Times took to transcribing the Biden version of Hunter’s financial dealings and President Biden’s supposed lack of involvement in the pay-to-play scandals.

3. Orange Man Bad

One approach the corrupt media seems convinced will work to vindicate Joe Biden, though, is to focus on Donald Trump. The corporate press immediately resorted to this tactic to dampen the scandal swirling around Biden’s mishandling of classified documents from his time as Obama’s vice president.

Since news first broke that some 10 documents marked classified — including some marked top secret — had been discovered in a closet at a D.C. office building housing a think tank connected to Biden, the left-leaning press paraded for its audience all the ways Trump’s handling of classified documents was supposedly worse.

Biden immediately cooperated with the National Archives, his apologists stressed; Biden had only misplaced a fraction of the documents Trump had retained, the corporate media intoned. Of course, the media ignored Biden’s own condemnation of the mishandling of classified documents as “irresponsible,” because the bottom line for the press and other TV personalities is clear: That the 46th president mishandled classified documents doesn’t matter because Trump is a liar and a thief, and Biden isn’t.

The Orange Man Bad defense also made an appearance in the article the Times published to counter the evidence of corrupt business dealings by the Biden family. Seeking to make the overwhelming evidence of Biden family corruption about Trump, the Times claimed Trump had attempted “to muscle Ukraine into helping him sully the Bidens,” for which Trump was later impeached.

Legacy media outlets are likewise framing the forthcoming investigations of FBI malfeasance as about Donald Trump. “The new House Republican majority plans to create a special committee that could serve as a one-stop shop for investigating perceived wrongdoing by the federal government against conservatives, including former president Donald Trump,” NBC News opened its piece reporting on the establishment of a Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government. The network then quoted at length Democrats who framed the committee as nothing but a Trump “MAGA Grievance Subcommittee.”

From the early coverage, then, it appears Democrats and their paramours in the press plan to ignore the overwhelming evidence of FBI misconduct and peddle the Orange Man Bad narrative. But while Trump may be a polarizing figure, it is doubtful his glow will blind Americans to the many ways the FBI and other government agencies were weaponized, including against parents and scientists dissenting from the Covid party line.

4. Americans Want GOP to Solve Real Problems

A fourth narrative the complicit press is pushing to advantage their Democrat friends seeks to silence the scandals entirely by pretending that any investigation interferes with Congress’s ability to solve the serious problems facing our country.

Again, we see a legacy network, this time CBS News, providing this pro-Democrat spin by polling Americans on their preferred priorities for the upcoming Congress. “Inflation remains a concern, and Americans across the political spectrum want Congress to focus on it, amid the usual calls for bipartisanship from most of the nation,” CBS News said, pushing its poll of 2,144 Americans. The article then highlighted the “big bipartisan majorities” that “say Congress should address inflation, reduce crime, and protect Social Security and Medicare.”

In contrast, CBS News noted, “over half of today’s Republican identifiers also put a ‘high priority’ on the House investigating the president, and also his son, Hunter Biden — especially those who define themselves as part of the MAGA movement.” “Most Americans, and most non-MAGA Republicans, do not agree,” CBS News stressed, gifting Democrats the “Americans want Congress to focus on the real issues facing the country and not Hunter Biden” talking point.

But it is not an either-or proposition: Republicans and the House can address inflation and corruption at the same time. And the focus of the House Oversight Committee is just that: oversight. Likewise, the new subcommittee’s focus on the weaponization of the FBI and the rest of the bureau’s friends in the federal government takes nothing away from Republicans attempting to address serious problems our country faces.

Nonetheless, the corrupt media will likely push the narrative that any Republican investigation distracts from addressing the country’s real problems. But as disingenuous as it is, at least that narrative acknowledges the reality of the mess America is in thanks to the Biden administration.

9 Questions Biden Should Answer About His Documents Scandal,"On day one of President Joe Biden’s presidency, the White House pledged to “bring transparency and truth back to government.”

Days into Biden’s latest scandal involving multiple discoveries of several classified documents from his years as vice president in his office, home, and garage, it’s more clear than ever that the Biden administration has no intentions of transparency when it comes to this issue.

So far, corporate media coverage of the sensitive materials has largely centered on any details that can be manipulated to distance Biden’s scandal from the classified documents dispute that prompted the Biden FBI to raid former President Donald Trump’s home at Mar-a-Lago (no such raid has been executed at any of the locations where Biden stashed documents). While media run cover for Biden — and their own double standard — there are still at least nine important and outstanding questions that the White House should but likely won’t answer about “garage gate.”

1. Why Were the Documents in Biden’s Possession?

The White House claims Biden didn’t know about the documents and was “surprised” they were found in his office at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C.

“I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there were any government records that were taken there to that office. But I don’t know what’s in the documents. My lawyers have not suggested I ask what documents they were,” Biden said at the North American Leaders’ Summit in Mexico.

House Intelligence Committee members, however, reject that claim.

“For those who think that well, the president didn’t realize that he had those in his possession. It just is nonsense. Of course he knew that he had them. They’re so obvious,” Republican Rep. Chris Stewart said on “Face The Nation.”

2. Why Were Biden’s Lawyers Poking Around?

The official reasoning given to justify Biden’s lawyers’ snooping was that the legal team was “closing out” his Penn Biden Center office in Washington D.C. and stumbled across the documents. Reports suggest the first batch of classified materials was discovered in a manila folder labeled “personal.”

That discovery reportedly prompted the Democrat’s lawyers to extend their search and review, which is how they found other records in Biden’s Delaware garage near his Corvette and in his home.

It’s still unclear why Biden’s personal attorneys were tasked with clearing out his old office in the first place.

3. Why Did Biden’s Lawyers, the DOJ, and the National Archives Keep the Documents Quiet for Months?

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the National Archives and Department of Justice were notified “the minute that his lawyers found those documents,” but the same can’t be said for the public.

Biden’s lawyers found the documents in his Penn office mere days before the 2022 midterm elections. They uncovered more records in his home in December. News about the discoveries, however, didn’t come until early January.

Why did the Biden administration, DOJ, and National Archives choose to hide that information from Americans until now? Did some of Biden’s allies in the press know about the documents and choose to keep them quiet? Did delaying news about Biden’s potential crime affect the election like the subversion of material from his son’s laptop did?

4. Did the White House Ask the DOJ to Delay Involvement in Investigation?

A new Wall Street Journal report seems to suggest so. According to the article published on Jan. 17, Biden’s legal team struck a deal with the DOJ to keep the FBI, which eagerly facilitated a raid on Trump’s home, away from the search for more material.

“Instead, the two sides agreed that Mr. Biden’s personal attorneys would inspect the homes, notify the Justice Department as soon as they identified any other potentially classified records, and arrange for law-enforcement authorities to take them,” the article reported.

5. Did Biden’s Lawyers Sift Through Docs Before Handing Them Over to Archives?

Because the DOJ granted Biden’s legal team the luxury of sifting through the confidential records without surveillance or oversight, there’s no way for the public to know if Biden’s legal team vetted, removed, or tampered with the materials before handing them over.

Early reports suggested the files recovered from the Biden Center include “US intelligence memos and briefing materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom.”

Considering Biden’s history of leading the White House’s relations with Ukraine as VP and his son’s history of profiting off of a Ukrainian energy company during that same time, documents with sensitive information about Ukraine could be useful for congressional Republicans investigating Biden family corruption.

6. Will the Special Counsel Execute the Probe Without Political Bias?

Attorney General Merrick Garland eventually hand-picked special counsel Robert Hur to oversee the probe into Biden’s sensitive records but there’s no guarantee the special counsel will divert from the DOJ’s politicized agenda.

As a matter of fact, Hur was involved in the FBI’s communications with Russia collusion hoaxer No. 1 Christopher Steele. Hur was also a member of the DOJ team that tried to subvert a congressional exposé of the intelligence community’s failures during that same collusion hoax.

7. Who Had Access to the Sensitive Materials?

Despite claims from Biden, the White House, and the corporate media that the classified materials were securely stored, it’s clear that foot-trafficked areas such as a “locked” garage next to a car, a house that is occupied frequently by the president, and a closet in a busy office building are no place for sensitive documents.

Who all had access to these locations?

Well, we know that Hunter Biden, the president’s scandal-plagued son, lived in his parents’ Delaware home where the sensitive documents were stored for years. He even lied at one point that he owned the property.

As for anyone else, the Secret Service denies keeping a record of any comings and goings around Biden’s house. The White House previously alluded to the existence of visitor logs but now claims they never existed.

8. What’s in the Classified Documents?

Perhaps the most pressing and important question about Biden’s classified documents is what do they contain? In the wise words of Federalist Editor-in-Chief Mollie Hemingway: “we don’t know what we don’t know.”

Do the files actually hold sensitive Obama-era information about Ukraine, Iran, and the United Kingdom, as reports suggest? If so, that makes the $51 million the University of Pennsylvania received from foreign, anonymous donors since Biden’s inauguration look extra suspicious. Especially since the bulk of those donations originated from China, one of the Biden family’s foreign entanglements, but won’t be publicly identified because the Biden administration no longer requires U.S. universities to disclose that funding to Americans.

9. Why Is the Biden Administration Scrambling?

The corporate media is clearly on Biden’s side so why can’t his administration pull itself together enough to give direct answers to questions that badly need answering?

Releasing statements that are “incomplete at best, misleading at worst” or mumbling excuses about Corvettes and locked closets does nothing but deepen Americans’ distrust in the incompetent administration in charge of handling this mess.

After days of running cover for the president, some corporate media mouthpieces are now willing to admit that the Biden administration’s scrambling looks like a coverup of something bigger.

“It looks like they were trying to kind of hide that and cover that up until after the midterms,” Matt Lewis, senior columnist for The Daily Beast, said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

CNN 'Breaks' News The Federalist Reported Years Ago On Bidens,"CNN published a nearly 4,000-word story Tuesday outlining the Biden family network of influence peddling, in which clan members touted their relationship to Joe Biden for personal profits.

“A famous last name, business deals and a looming probe: Republicans ramp up investigation of Biden family,” read the CNN headline, which, as always, frames Republicans as the aggressors.

The story highlighted how President Joe Biden’s brothers, Frank and James, have leveraged the family name for years to land lucrative business deals both at home and abroad. Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, also infamously served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars in excess compensation despite no prior experience in the industry.

Many of the details branded as revelations in CNN’s reporting, however, were already reported by The Federalist years ago.

In May 2020, Federalist Editor Mark Hemingway reported on a lawsuit alleging James Biden committed fraud and racketeering in deals with Americore Health, a health care management company focused on rural hospitals. Former Americore CEO Grant White claimed that James Biden promised to exploit the family’s name and political connections to drive tens of millions of dollars in international investment toward the company. Americore ultimately went bankrupt when said investment never came to fruition, White said, and the FBI raided his home.

Documents reported on by Hemingway allege James lined his own pockets instead with money that was promised for the company. According to CNN, James has since paid out $350,000 in a settlement.

Biden family business deals are currently under investigation by President Biden’s Department of Justice, both by the Delaware U.S. attorney’s office and in Pittsburgh.

According to Federalist Senior Legal Correspondent Margot Cleveland, the president’s appointed prosecutor appears to be allowing James Biden to escape a substantive federal investigation in the Western District of Pennsylvania.

“That the U.S. attorney Joe Biden appointed to the job, and who has since been nominated by the president to a federal appellate judgeship, is overseeing this investigation is scandalous,” Cleveland wrote. “Attorney General Merrick Garland should immediately tap a special counsel to investigate Jim Biden’s involvement with Americore.”

Garland appointed a special counsel to probe President Biden’s apparent mishandling of classified documents last week, but no special counsel has been appointed to delve into the potential corruption concerns of Biden family members leveraging their proximity to the president in shady business deals. The family business ventures were among Cleveland’s top 10 scandals to watch in 2023.

Transactions between James and Hunter Biden and influential individuals connected to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), meanwhile, were flagged in September 2020 by Senate investigators as potential criminal activity.

Journo Proves Biden Did No Wrong By Assuming He Did No Wrong,"If the entire news media, plus Biden’s vindictive Justice Department, hadn’t put the country through months of insanity over the petty “confidential documents” drama at Mar-a-Lago, Biden’s own scandal of having illegally retained government material when he was a private citizen would be a pretty boring affair.

But they didn’t. They decided to get cute and make this a criminal matter. Now they get the same treatment.

Wait! they claim in unison. This is different! Biden did the right thing and Trump did the wrong thing!

Admittedly, that’s a totally fair and obvious point when you start with the assumption that over the six years Biden was in wrongful possession of government secrets, the material just sat there, untouched and unread (and make the concurrent assumption that the same wasn’t true of the Trump documents). They simply gathered dust, month by month, sound asleep in office drawers and garage boxes, forgotten by Biden, time, and the federal bureaucracy. Then, when one fateful day Biden’s lawyers happened upon the documents, they immediately dialed the National Archives for a swift transfer to the proper authorities.

That’s the entire premise of longtime Washington, D.C., journalist Garrett Graff’s essay this week in The New York Times: Biden says he did nothing wrong, and anyway, he immediately handed over all the materials that he possessed (but definitely never looked at) for six years!

“Mr. Biden’s scandal so far feels more like an administrative error; there’s no evidence he even knew the documents were misplaced or in his possession, and when discovered they were promptly and properly returned to authorities,” wrote Graff. “The government didn’t know they were missing (which itself is a bit of a mystery, since classified documents are usually tightly controlled, which is how the National Archives knew Mr. Trump had missing documents in the first place), and Mr. Biden didn’t try to hold onto them in the face of a legal process ordering otherwise.”

See?! Biden had no problems turning over the documents he’d been sitting on, doing absolutely nothing with, for six years! Besides, the government didn’t even know they were missing! No harm, no foul!

That version of events doesn’t do what Graff, Washington’s least interesting writer, thinks it does. He thinks it portrays Biden as an innocent hoarder who didn’t realize the things in his possession were not his to have. What it does is prove what right-wingers have been saying all along: that Donald Trump (along with what he represents) is the subject of a political persecution, that the rules don’t apply to everyone, and that the media are every bit a part of the corruption.

Missing classified documents are only a problem when a president that the bureaucracy doesn’t like has them. If they like you, hold onto them — for six years, even! Meanwhile, Trump was in possession of what he purportedly believes is his property and it took far less time for the FBI to decide to raid his private residence to get it back.

As for the presumption of innocence — that’s reserved for people whom Graff and Washington like. Biden says he never used the government secrets while he was a private citizen. He didn’t even know he had them.

What’s that you say? Biden’s son Hunter regularly rakes in hundreds of thousands of dollars doing business with foreign governments? Totally unrelated! Besides, like Biden said, he didn’t know he had the classified documents!

When you start with the assumption that Biden is innocent because he says he’s innocent, and because he turned over classified material after six years without hesitation, it’s very easy to see the difference between one person illegally retaining classified government material, and another person doing the exact same thing.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/19/d-c-journalist-proves-biden-did-absolutely-nothing-wrong-by-assuming-he-did-absolutely-nothing-wrong/,2023-01-19
A Disaster Per Month: The Worst Failures Of Biden's Second Year,"The first year of Joe Biden’s presidency prolifically delivered examples of corruption and incompetence, and his second year in office — which drew to a close on Thursday — has been no different.

Last year, The Federalist collected “A Scandal For Every Month: The Biggest Botches, Failures, And Mess-Ups Of Joe Biden’s First 12 Months In Office.” At the end of that piece, I expressed hope that 2022 would see fewer disasters flow from the White House. Unfortunately for the country, the roundup from year No. 2 is just as grim.

January: Biden Compared Filibuster Defenders to Historical Racists

Last year’s list concluded with a bonus item for January 2022: Biden comparing his agenda’s critics — which include Democrat Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona — to former Alabama Gov. George Wallace and Confederate leader Jefferson Davis.

In a Jan. 11 speech urging the U.S. Senate to ditch filibuster rules in order to pass his radical and unconstitutional federalization of election laws, Biden asked, “Do you want to be the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? Do you want to be the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? Do you want to be the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?”

February: Incompetent Response to Russia-Ukraine War

Before, during, and since Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine in February, the Biden administration’s response has been marked by incompetence. Biden waived sanctions on the Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline before the war in 2021, crippled American energy production, and turned to Russian ally Venezuela for oil after the conflict erupted. In January 2022, right before Russia’s invasion, Biden signaled a green light to Russian President Vladimir Putin, responding to a question about potential plans to impose sanctions on Russia with the comments, “It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion [into Ukraine],” and “My guess is [Putin] will move in. He has to do something.”

“Are you effectively giving Putin permission to make a small incursion into the country?” a reporter asked. Biden’s answer: “That’s how it did sound like, didn’t it?”

A month into the Russia-Ukraine war, Biden recklessly called for regime change in Russia, before reversing course and insisting he did no such thing. By November 2022, the United States had shipped out a whopping $68 billion in aid to Ukraine, with Biden requesting another $37.7 billion to put total aid in the 12-figure range.

March: Hunter Biden Corruption Scandal Resurfaces as NYT Admits Laptop’s Legitimacy

Eighteen months after the New York Post reported on a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden that contained incriminating emails about his shady foreign business deals — a bombshell that was censored in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election — The New York Times finally, quietly admitted in March that the laptop was legitimate. As The Federalist’s Senior Legal Correspondent Margot Cleveland noted at the time, conceding the laptop’s authenticity also meant conceding that the numerous scandals contained in the laptop’s trove of documents were real.

Those scandals include an apparent pay-to-play in Ukraine, where Hunter was receiving $50,000 a month to sit on the board of corrupt energy company Burisma while his VP dad oversaw American foreign policy toward the country. During that time, Joe Biden leveraged U.S. aid to Ukraine to pressure the firing of the state prosecutor who was investigating Burisma. Hunter Biden’s scandalous transactions also indicate a deal with a Chinese company in which 10 percent was “held by H for the big guy,” presumed to be Joe Biden.

April: Biden Admin Debuts Thought Police Board

In a congressional hearing on April 27, Biden’s Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced the creation of a “Disinformation Governance Board” to crack down on the “threat” (his word) of speech that challenges the Biden administration’s narrative on social media. The administration tapped Hunter Biden laptop truther, Christopher Steele fangirl, and censorship aficionado Nina Jankowicz to helm the project, before “pausing” the project after three weeks of outrage. Make no mistake, though — DHS assures us it’s still “continuing” to “address” speech it doesn’t like.

May: White House ‘Encourages’ Intimidation of SCOTUS Justices

After a leaker funneled a draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade to Politico in early May, furious abortion supporters swarmed the private homes of the Republican-appointed justices. One left-wing group offered money to activists in return for descending on justices’ residences, even publishing their alleged addresses online. When asked about the intimidation tactics levied against the court, then-White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki refused to condemn the demonstrations, telling reporters that the Biden administration “certainly continue[s] to encourage that outside of judges’ homes.”

In June, the threats culminated in an assassination attempt on Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s life, when a California man was arrested near Kavanaugh’s home with “a Glock handgun, ammunition, a knife, pepper spray, and various tools for forced entry.”

June: Gas Prices Surpass $5 in Record High

After the Biden administration cracked down on domestic gas production, canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, and spurred nationwide inflation, gas prices climbed. June saw several regrettable milestones.

On June 3, The Federalist recorded that the country had seen 18 records for high gas prices in just 19 days. On June 6, gas prices officially doubled what they were when Biden took office. On June 11, the national average price of a gallon of gas hit $5.00 for the first time ever. On June 14, the price of gas hit its all-time high of $5.016, and on June 19, diesel topped the charts at $5.816.

July: The Joe Biden Recession Becomes Official

As rampant inflation continued to reach and break 40-year records — exacerbated by packages dumping trillions of dollars into the economy under Biden’s watch, while the president touted his “transition” of the economy to a green pipe dream — the nation officially hit the criteria for a recession at the end of July. Gross domestic product fell by 0.9 percent in 2022’s second quarter, hitting the benchmark of back-to-back quarters of negative growth that has traditionally signaled recession.

As Federalist CEO Sean Davis noted at the time, “Private investment dropped by double digits, its worst showing since the COVID shutdown,” while “disposable personal income has now fallen for five straight quarters.”

August: Biden’s FBI Raids a Former President

Under the leadership of partisan Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Biden administration’s FBI conducted an unprecedented raid on Biden’s predecessor, 2020 presidential opponent, and potential 2024 rival Donald Trump. The stated reason for the raid was a documents dispute with the National Archives under the Presidential Records Act — but executive branch staffers and appointees (who, unlike the president, don’t have the power to declassify documents) have mishandled memos before and received wrist slaps.

The politicized nature of the raid — and of the DOJ’s attempt to turn the documents dispute into a scandal ahead of Trump’s candidacy in the 2024 election — became even more obvious after President Biden was discovered to have withheld multiple troves of classified documents from his time as vice president in multiple locations, including his garage. His own DOJ’s deference to Biden’s lawyers in that documents scandal makes their hubbub over the Trump case all the more absurd.

September: Biden’s FBI Raids Pro-Life Dad

Discontent to stop at Biden’s predecessor, the FBI executed a raid on pro-life Catholic and father of seven Mark Houck the following month. Houck’s wife described north of 20 agents with more than a dozen vehicles descending on their family home, with “big, huge rifles pointed at Mark and pointed at me and kind of pointed throughout the house,” before dragging Mark away.

What was his crime? The Justice Department accused Houck of “attacking a patient escort” at a Planned Parenthood facility, but Mark’s wife says he simply pushed away a pro-abortion man who was verbally and physically antagonizing Mark’s 12-year-old son. The man had previously had a lawsuit against Mark thrown out of district court, but the DOJ picked it up in its war on pro-life demonstrators post-Dobbs. By October, the DOJ had announced indictments of 22 pro-lifers.

October: Illegal Immigration Closes Worst Fiscal Year in History

The year 2022 was full of new records for out-of-control illegal immigration under Biden’s watch, but by the time the fiscal year closed out and the 2023 fiscal year started in October, migrant apprehensions had smashed the previous annual record. In FY 2022, Customs and Border Protection recorded nearly 2.4 million apprehensions of illegal immigrants at the southern border, compared to 1.7 million in 2021 and not even 460,000 in 2020. The totals for every month but July and August eclipsed previous years (totals for July and August 2021, also under the Biden administration, were higher than in 2022). May of 2022 saw the highest monthly number of migrant encounters ever recorded.

November: Biden Buys Votes with Unconstitutional Student Loan Bailout

Biden’s plan to put taxpayers on the hook for roughly $300 billion to cover student loan debts for affluent college graduates found itself smacked down by the judiciary several times in November — but not before the president had used the illegal scheme to win over young voters for his political allies in the midterm election. Announced in August, the plan constituted an unconstitutional usurpation of the legislative branch’s authority to expend government (i.e., taxpayer) funds.

A survey from Intelligent in the summer of 2022 found that 23 percent of voters said they wouldn’t vote for Biden in 2024 unless he made “some or all” student loan debt disappear. The ploy did what it was designed to do in November, with Gen Z and millennials turning out in high numbers for Democrats.

December: ‘Twitter Files’ Show Biden Asked Big Tech for Censorship

A cache of internal Twitter documents revealed in December showed the Biden administration had pressured Twitter to censor and “de-platform” accounts that challenged the regime’s narrative about Covid shots. Other “Twitter Files” released the same month revealed that even before Biden won the White House, his campaign team was sending similar censorship requests to the Big Tech company, this time about embarrassing images of his scandal-embroiled son, Hunter.

The Biden team’s penchant for colluding with Big Tech to censor unflattering information or dissenting opinions is consistent with the administration’s 2021 admission that it was “flagging” social media posts it deemed “misinformation” for its allies at Facebook.

None Of Biden's Excuses For Having Classified Docs Make Sense,"With every new cache of classified documents discovered in Joe Biden’s possession, the president’s excuses become more farfetched.

Biden’s defenders like to stress that the president has “cooperated” with investigators. No harm, no foul. Ana Navarro of “The View” argues “it’s very important to understand the difference between cooperation and obstruction.” Neal Katyal snarks that it’s “amazing how you don’t need a search warrant when a President is actually willing to invite investigators inside.”

Not really. Biden’s lawyers almost surely asked for an FBI search of the president’s property after they knew special counsel Robert Hur would be compelled to obtain a warrant and conduct a search. Don’t take my word for it. Buried in today’s New York Times piece on the matter, we learn that, “[e]veryone involved understood and agreed that the discovery of those six pages meant that the government would have to conduct its own search of the work and storage areas in the house…” There was no political or legal upside in resisting the inevitable.

Which brings us to another pervasive defense of the president, which asserts that Biden had “immediately” handed over documents found in his “think tank,” just as protocol dictates. No harm, no foul. This claim is also preposterous. All we know for sure is that Biden was in possession of classified documents, including some top secret ones, for at least six years — perhaps decades, since some of the documents date back to his time in the Senate. That, at best, points to a pattern of mishandling documents over many years, not a single filing mistake. That is true regardless of what Trump did or didn’t do.

Even if we allow that the first small batch of classified documents was accidentally stashed in his Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, why did it take six weeks for Biden’s lawyers — who have no security clearance — to search the president’s garage and “adjacent rooms”? If they really believed that the documents found in Penn Biden documents were just a weird oversight, why start rummaging through boxes in the president’s garage? For that matter, why did Biden tap lawyers, rather than interns or movers or aides, to search reams of files and folders that had been sitting in drawers — allegedly undisturbed for years — at Biden’s “think tank” in the first place? Did a government or law enforcement agency contact Biden in connection to those documents?

We did not learn about any of this until Jan. 9. The documents were uncovered on Nov. 2. A cynic might also point out that the week lawyers supposedly stumbled across classified documents, Biden was aware Republicans were likely to take over the House. The GOP, he knew, would soon be armed with investigatory powers and they might take an interest in his slush-fund-y “think tank.” It makes sense that he would deploy personal lawyers, covered by attorney-client privilege, to find any problematic documents.

Perhaps there are other, more innocent, explanations, but the initial justifications for Biden’s possession no longer make sense. Today’s Times piece grapples with this reality, noting that “former officials who had been involved in the process of packing and shipping such material” theorize that one set of materials was documents that “might be useful to Mr. Biden for his post-vice-presidential career in public life or teaching, like his speeches and unclassified policy memos about topics he was interested in” and the other set was more personal stuff. All that sounds innocuous enough.

The problem, though, is that the White House claimed on numerous occasions that Biden had no inkling that classified documents were in his possession. Let’s say the president never opened any of those documents to assist in writing his memories or to teach his class (the nine times he showed up for a million-dollar gig). It is highly improbable that aides packing these boxes, divvying up documents into specific categories for Biden’s use, would not have noticed six “items” potentially filled with classified documents. Surely you remember the leaked picture of marked classified documents splayed across the floor at Mar-a-Lago?

Of course, if Biden was a stickler for transparency, he would have released a statement on Nov. 3. If he had nothing to hide, his personal lawyer Bob Bauer wouldn’t be using weaselly legalese to claim that the Department of Justice seized “six items consisting of documents with classification markings and surrounding material” this weekend, rather than providing the number of overall documents found. An “item” could be a cabinet. But you’ll remember one of the big distinctions between the Trump and Biden scandals was that the current president was supposedly in possession of far fewer documents, and thus the crime was less severe. CNN even produced a little infographic stressing the disparity in the number of documents. Now what?

As Politico’s Josh Gerstein pointed out when the Penn Biden Center story broke, it’s not unusual “for small numbers of emails or documents that are classified to get mixed in with unclassified records,” but it is “hard to argue you don’t know what’s lying around your house if there’s a lot of it.” Indeed, one would have to abandon all healthy journalistic skepticism and common sense to believe the excuses Biden and his defenders have offered to this point.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/23/none-of-bidens-excuses-for-having-classified-documents-make-any-sense/,2023-01-23
Biden A National Security Threat Long Before Documents Fiasco,"Long before classified and potentially compromising documents were discovered in President Joe Biden’s “think tank” office and Wilmington home and garage, the Democrat’s actions posed a threat to U.S. national security.

The discovery of even more top secret documents dating back to Biden’s time as vice president and senator sparked widespread concerns that the current president hid material that put U.S. national security at risk, potentially for decades.

Republicans worried — and even partisan hacks such as Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff conceded — that Biden’s harboring of classified documents in high-traffic, unsecured areas could have put Americans or the U.S. government at risk.

“Is it possible that national security was jeopardized here as many, including you, raised that possibility with the Mar-a-Lago documents?” ABC’s “This Week” co-anchor Jonathan Karl asked.

“I don’t think we can exclude the possibility without knowing more of the facts,” the disgraced former chair of the House Intelligence Committee replied.

It seems logical to investigate Biden’s recent scandal to ensure he didn’t compromise any sensitive material. But the truth is, he opened up the U.S. to a myriad of national security crises, abuses, and disasters long before news broke of his document scandal.

Since taking office, Biden, who is charged with ensuring the national security of the U.S., has put Americans and their security at risk countless times.

By openly pursuing a policy of escalation in the U.S.-funded proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, Biden and his administration have significantly increased the threat of nuclear war. A conflict that only ends on Ukraine’s terms and might result in a radioactive third world war compromises Americans’ safety and tax dollars.

It also leaves countries like Taiwan vulnerable to communist China’s hegemonic operations. While China stockpiled hundreds of nuclear warheads and prepared to expand its influence, Biden was further emboldening his country’s No. 1 foreign threat. First, he did business with the Chinese gas giant with ties to his son. Then Biden pushed the Saudis into an amicable relationship with the Eastern communist government.

Speaking of the Middle East, it was Biden’s botched Afghanistan withdrawal that sent tens of thousands of Afghan refugees into U.S. cities without proper screening, vetting, and inspection. This lapse in security resulted in two known security risks and dozens more evacuees tainted by “derogatory information” entering the country unmonitored.

Domestically, Biden and the same agency that failed to vet Afghan refugees jeopardized U.S. national security by escorting in the worst illegal immigration influx in recorded U.S. history and then doing nothing to fix it. Under Biden’s watch, more than 100 potential terrorists and hundreds more criminals crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.

Even dating back to his time as vice president, Biden sacrificed national security for profit by keeping his son Hunter Biden close. Hunter didn’t just exchange access to his father for cash to fund the family’s lavish lifestyle, he was paid by oligarchs and businessmen in countries that have a vested interest in meddling with U.S. affairs.

That’s likely why the inexperienced Hunter was handed a lucrative position at a prominent Ukrainian energy company at the same time his father took the lead on Ukraine policy for the Obama administration.

At one point, Biden used a non-government email to share official White House business with Hunter, a civilian who shouldn’t have had access to sensitive material. Republican senators’ attempts to investigate the emails and the role they may have played in enriching the Biden family business were ignored.

Biden’s willingness to share delicate information with his son, whose own documents stored on an abandoned laptop likely pose a serious threat to the national security of the United States, is more than problematic. Combine that with Biden’s knowledge of and involvement in Hunter’s business with foreign oligarchs, and you have a long list of foreign entanglements and finances that could severely hamper the elder Biden’s ability to put American interests first.

If early reports are correct in noting that some of the recovered Biden documents included “US intelligence memos and briefing materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom,” Biden’s information cache does warrant investigation and transparency. But don’t be fooled into thinking this is the first time Biden has sacrificed U.S. national security to protect his personal interests, preserve the Biden family business, and advance his radical agenda.

27 Things The FBI Likely Found In Biden's Homes,"News broke on Wednesday that FBI agents, once again, were sifting through one of President Biden’s homes in an effort to find more classified documents he has harbored since his time in the U.S. Senate.

The searches began before the 2022 midterm election but, so far, the Department of Justice remains close-lipped about what they are looking for and what they’ve already discovered.

Thanks to Biden’s long history of rambling, we have a pretty good idea about many things the FBI has likely uncovered between their first search and now. Here’s everything the feds are likely to have found alongside sensitive information concerning Ukraine, Iran, and the United Kingdom during their search of Biden’s homes.

1. Dozens Of Sunglasses

Aviators, to be precise.

2. Groucho Glasses

These were specifically labeled with a name tag that says “The Big Guy” in Joe’s handwriting.

3. Lots Of Ice Cream

The same chocolate, chocolate chip the corporate media fawned over during Biden’s first year in office was found in a giant ice cream freezer, which Biden apparently was using on loan from Nancy Pelosi.

Pelosi got a lot of attention for doing fun interviews about ice cream and baskets of chocolate in front of a $24K freezer.

11. Posters Of Kamala Harris’s Most Motivational Quotes

As the vice president once said, “It is time for us to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day.” For Biden that, apparently, means harboring classified documents at his house for decades.

14. Biden’s Three Diplomas

Those diplomas don’t just show Biden is an academic superstar. They also represent the pride Biden has as the first person in his family to go to college (if you don’t count his mother’s side), for winning “the international moot-court competition,” and receiving the “outstanding student in the political science department” award.

Remember, Biden probably has a “much higher IQ than you do.”

Biden's 'Cooperation' With His Own FBI Means Nothing,"It’s hard to read the news and not keep coming to the conclusion that the media think you’re stupid.

Case in point: On Wednesday, it was reported that the FBI was at President Biden’s home in Rehoboth, Delaware, once again scouring the place as part of its investigation into Biden’s mishandling of classified documents. It is at least the third time the FBI has searched Biden’s effects as part of the investigation, and one of those searches was done so discreetly it wasn’t public knowledge until months after the fact.

In addition to his home, classified documents were also found at the Penn-Biden center, the president’s Chinese-funded think tank. The Justice Department has also graciously trusted Biden’s personal attorneys — who did not have security clearances — to sift through his papers and identify any potentially incriminating documents without DOJ supervision.

These searches of Biden’s home and private papers came just a few months after the FBI raided former President Donald Trump’s home at Mar-a-Lago for the identical crime of mishandling classified documents. The Biden situation is arguably worse since he allegedly retained classified documents from his Senate tenure, which doesn’t have any declassification authority that comes with the presidency. But now after weeks of breathless speculation about how the Justice Department prosecution could be used to keep Trump from running for president again, the media are at pains to explain why Trump’s crimes are somehow worse than Biden’s.

And so the media haven’t coalesced so much as collapsed around a central narrative: Biden’s violations of the law are somehow excused because he’s fully cooperating with the FBI investigation. As Exhibit A, here’s The New York Times write-up on the latest FBI search of Biden’s home:

WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. is conducting a search of President Biden’s vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., the president’s personal lawyer said on Wednesday morning, as investigators continue looking into his possession of classified documents. The search, like at least two others conducted at locations associated with Mr. Biden, was undertaken with the cooperation of the president and his legal team. It was not clear whether any documents were recovered at the beach house. “Today, with the president’s full support and cooperation, the D.O.J. is conducting a planned search of his home in Rehoboth, Del.,” Bob Bauer, Mr. Biden’s personal lawyer, said in statement.“Under D.O.J.’s standard procedures, in the interests of operational security and integrity, it sought to do this work without advance public notice, and we agreed to cooperate.”

So yes, they are downplaying that a sitting president is at the center of a months-long FBI investigation. This mere fact was routinely cited as disqualifying when Trump was president, regardless of how meritless the FBI’s Russia-collusion investigation proved to be. But you almost have to admire the chutzpah of framing the entire story around Biden’s exculpatory excuses, replete with a generous quote from Biden’s lawyer explaining as much.

Do note the sophistry of declaring that this was all done “under D.O.J.’s standard procedures” as if the FBI repeatedly, albeit reluctantly, digging through a sitting president’s house for evidence of crimes is just another day at the office.

Then there’s the declaration that “it sought to do this work without advance public notice, and we agreed to cooperate.” There’s a big difference between “without advance public notice” and being given no notice at all when armed federal agents show up over the same crime and start going through your wife’s underwear drawer. Similarly, you can detect a subtle difference between the way The New York Times runs ostensible press releases from Biden’s lawyer in the third paragraph, versus media outlets running with grossly misleading and possibly illegal leaks from the feds about what they found in their surprise raid of Trump.

Prior to Mar-a-Lago being raided, Trump’s attorneys had been communicating with the DOJ about their concerns that Trump might be illegally retaining classified documents. Were Trump and his legal team uncooperative? If Biden is allegedly cooperating more than Trump in parallel investigations of mishandling classified documents, how would we know? “Cooperation” in this context appears to be solely defined by Biden’s mouthpieces: a largely unaccountable federal agency that previously investigated Trump on demonstrably false charges and the credulous media.

Suffice to say, if you’re not a sitting Democratic president, don’t expect such deference — cooperation with the feds often doesn’t end well for ordinary citizens seeking justice. Earlier this week, pro-life activist Mark Houck was acquitted in one hour by a jury after being prosecuted for violating an obscure federal law — one with troubling First Amendment implications — that makes it a crime to “injure, intimidate or interfere with anyone providing abortion services.” Houck frequently protested in front of abortion facilities, as is his constitutional right, and got involved in a physical altercation with a volunteer Planned Parenthood escort.

Rather than blocking access to the facility, however, Houck says the altercation occurred because the volunteer was harassing his young son. Local authorities in Philadelphia declined to charge Houck with assault. Eventually, Planned Parenthood officials admitted the volunteer Houck said was going after his son had been spoken to “numerous times” about violating their “non-engagement policy.” A federal judge eventually said the application of federal law appeared “to be stretched a little thin here.”

Anyway, after being strung up on federal charges, a handful of Republican senators looked into the egregious prosecution of Houck. It’s quite clear that he did everything he reasonably could to cooperate with the federal investigation, in spite of the fact that the charges against him were vindictive and baseless from the start. And this is what that cooperation got him:

Mr. Houck retained an attorney, Matt Heffron, who is a former federal prosecutor. Mr. Heffron informed the committee that he communicated to Assistant U.S. Attorney Anita Eve twice via phone and left voice messages after she didn’t pick up. After not receiving a return call, Mr. Heffron emailed Ms. Eve to note that he left voice messages on May 21, 2022, and June 7, 2022, and said in his email that if the Department intended to indict Mr. Houck, he would receive the summons on Mr. Houck’s behalf and that he would appear voluntarily. According to Mr. Heffron, Ms. Eve did not respond. Mr. Heffron made clear to the committee that he and Mr. Houck were cooperative with the Justice Department; however, in return the Justice Department failed to communicate with them. Given their cooperation with federal law enforcement, the family did not expect to be awakened at 7 a.m. with reportedly over 20 FBI agents surrounding their home wearing armor plated tactical vests, ballistic helmets and holding ballistic shields and long guns. Mrs. Houck reportedly stated that “[t]hey said they were going to break in if [my husband] didn’t open [the door]. And then they had about five guns pointed at my husband, myself, and basically at my kids.” Based on allegations, when Mr. Houck opened the door he was handcuffed and arrested. Mr. Houck allegedly asked his wife for his rosary and a sweatshirt before being transported to jail.

The Justice Department does not care about “cooperation” — if it wants to prosecute you, it is going to prosecute you. Anyone who thinks it’s meaningful that Biden is said to be cooperating with the investigation into him is either knowingly making excuses or willfully blind to just how political the Justice Department has become.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/02/bidens-cooperation-with-the-fbi-is-meaningless-and-misleading/,2023-02-02
Exclusive: Mac Repairman Slams Plot To Sic DOJ On Hunter's Foes,"High-priced attorneys for Hunter Biden dispatched letters on Wednesday to the Delaware attorney general and the Department of Justice pushing them to launch investigations into a slew of individuals who had shared information allegedly retrieved from the laptop abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop. But yesterday’s transparent attempt to sic top state and federal law enforcement officials on those exposing the Biden family pay-to-play scandal is already backfiring, with Biden’s attorney clarifying the letters are not an admission that the laptop was Hunter’s.

In two detailed, 14-page letters penned by Winston & Strawn attorney Abbe David Lowell, the Hunter Biden attorney requested the attorney general of Delaware and the Department of Justice investigate whether John Paul Mac Isaac, Robert Costello, Rudy Giuliani, Stephen Bannon, Jack Maxey, Garrett Ziegler, and Yaacov Apelbaum committed state or federal crimes. “There is considerable reason to believe” those individuals violated various laws “in accessing, copying, manipulating, and/or disseminating Mr. Biden’s personal computer data,” Hunter’s attorney opened his Wednesday missive.

The lengthy letters then detail each of the individuals’ purported actions that Lowell claims provide “considerable reason to believe” they committed various state or federal crimes, which the Winston & Strawn attorney then identifies and analyzes.

Starting with John Paul Mac Isaac, the owner of the Delaware repair shop where the laptop was left for repairs, Lowell asserts, “Mr. Mac Isaac has admitted to gaining access to our client’s personal computer data in Delaware without Mr. Biden’s consent.”

“Mr. Mac Isaac has admitted to copying that data without Mr. Biden’s consent, and Mr. Mac Isaac has admitted to distributing copies of that data from his place in Delaware,” the letter to the Delaware AG continues.

Given that Mac Isaac has maintained from day one that the “computer data” he copied was contained on a laptop abandoned at his repair shop by an individual he believed was Hunter Biden, yesterday’s letters to the Delaware attorney general and the DOJ appeared as an apparent admission by Hunter that yes, the laptop was his.

But when asked whether Hunter “now acknowledge[s] he or someone on his behalf dropped off his laptop for repairs at Mac Isaac’s store,” Lowell told The Federalist, “These letters do not confirm Mac Isaac’s or others’ versions of a so-called laptop. They address their conduct of seeking, manipulating and disseminating what they allege to be Mr. Biden’s personal data, wherever they claim to have gotten it.”

In an exclusive interview with The Federalist, Mac Isaac’s attorney Brian Della Rocca seemed flabbergasted by the continued obfuscating by Hunter Biden’s legal team. “Is Hunter denying that he was in Delaware in April of 2019 then? To this day, he has not denied being in Wilmington at that time,” he said. “Nor has he ever denied dropping off the laptop with John Paul. Is he denying doing so now?”

“John Paul has not, nor will he ever manipulate the data on Hunter’s hard drive. That is just not who he is,” Della Rocca told The Federalist. And it would be easy to confirm the authenticity of the data, Della Rocca explained, stressing that “the data on the drive he has can be compared to the laptop, which is in the possession of the FBI, to show he has not made any changes to the information.”

Della Rocca also condemned the letters’ attempt to suggest Mac Isaac lied to law enforcement officials.

“Mr. Mac Isaac has insisted that he did not make a bit-by-bit copy or clone of the hard drive,” page eight of the Biden attorney’s letter maintained, continuing:

Nor could he make such a copy because the hard drive was soldered to the laptop’s mother board, and he could not stay logged into the waterlogged laptop long enough to copy the entirety of the hard drive because the waterlogged laptop would periodically turn off. Instead, Mr. Mac Isaac chose what he wanted to access and copy from Mr. Biden’s personal data that Mr. Mac Isaac unlawfully obtained. Thus, any representation by Mr. Mac Isaac to law enforcement that what was in his possession was the entire hard drive would have been a knowing false statement. Moreover, the absence of a true clone of the hard drive created the opportunity for mischief—namely, the addition of files to this “hard drive,” the manipulation of files on this “hard drive,” and the destruction of files from this “hard drive.”

Mac Isaac’s attorney told The Federalist this passage represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the process for retrieving data from a damaged MacBook Pro 13. “Due to the damaged condition and poor stability of the MacBook, John Paul had to manually recover the user data,” Mac Isaac’s attorney explained. “John Paul was able to recover the entire contents (220GB) [of] the folder named, RobertHunter.”

“Per Hunter’s request, no attempt to recover the remaining system files or applications was made because they did not include personal data,” Mac Isaac’s lawyer stressed. Della Rocca added that “the only law enforcement agency to which John Paul has provided a copy of Hunter Biden’s laptop was the FBI,” and that the FBI also took custody of the laptop at the same time, making it possible for the FBI to compare what Mac Isaac recovered from the “RobertHunter” folder on the original laptop. “There would be no difference,” Mac Isaac’s attorney emphasized.

The accusation that Mac Isaac accessed Hunter Biden’s personal data without his consent is also “absolutely false,” Della Rocca told The Federalist.

While Della Rocca did not elaborate, the signed repair contract stated that if the laptop was not retrieved within 90 days of “notification of completed service,” it would be treated as “abandoned.” Hunter Biden’s attorney did not respond to The Federalist’s inquiry on whether it was his position that Hunter Biden had “not abandoned the property under the repair contract,” with the Winston & Strawn attorney instead stressing the letters do not confirm Mac Isaac’s “versions of a so-called laptop.”

The repair contract further provided that the owner of the equipment agreed to hold Mac Isaac “harmless for any damage or loss of property.”

Yet, here we are, with “another privileged person hiring yet another high-priced attorney to redirect attention away from his own unlawful actions,” Della Rocca scoffed. “This is entirely a P.R. move,” he added, telling The Federalist he first saw the lengthy letters from Hunter’s attorney when CBS contacted him for comment.

The public relations move, however, is already backfiring, with the general public interpreting the letter as an implicit acknowledgment that the laptop from hell was Hunter Biden’s. And things may only get worse, if the FBI is forced to confirm that, yes, the damning documents publicly circulating are authentic copies of the material contained in the MacBook’s “RobertHunter” folder.

Here Are The Statements That Aged The Worst On Hunter Biden,"Hunter Biden admitted, in a roundabout way through his lawyers, that the infamous laptop featuring a trove of explicit content that surfaced in 2020 was his. On Wednesday, his attorneys demanded that Biden allies in the Justice Department launch investigations of the people who found the computer.

Biden’s lawyers sent two 14-page letters to the Delaware attorney general and the Department of Justice this week calling on officials to probe whether the people who gave the laptop — which was abandoned property at a Delaware computer repair shop owned and operated by John Paul Mac Isaac — to the New York Post violated state or federal laws.

“There is considerable reason to believe” that the individuals involved “in accessing, copying, manipulating, and/or disseminating Mr. Biden’s personal computer data” may have committed crimes, the attorneys wrote. “Mr. Mac Isaac has admitted to copying that data without Mr. Biden’s consent, and Mr. Mac Isaac has admitted to distributing copies of that data from his place in Delaware.”

[EXCLUSIVE: Biden Laptop Repairman Blasts Hunter’s Attempt To Sic DOJ On Hunter’s Foes]

In other words, the laptop is undoubtedly Hunter Biden’s despite the remarkable spin from Democrats, the president, and the media who were desperate to dismiss the computer as Russian disinformation. Below are some of the statements that aged the worst.

Lesley Stahl: CBS ‘Can’t Verify’ the Laptop

A CBS “60 Minutes” interview with President Donald Trump stands out in the hall of fame of media malpractice.

During the interview — which aired on Oct. 25, the week before the 2020 election, and garnered nearly 17 million views — the longtime anchor flat-out denied that the Biden family was under any sort of scandal at all. The interview was so combative that the Trump campaign released the full raw footage before network publication.

“He’s in the midst of a scandal,” Trump said in reference to emails from the laptop revealing Joe Biden was lying about involvement with Hunter’s overseas business ventures.

“He’s not,” Stahl said, interrupting the president to outright dismiss the criticism. “He’s not, no.”

Stahl went on to deny that then-Vice President Joe Biden spied on the Trump campaign in 2016, and claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop couldn’t be verified.

TRUMP: ""What can't be verified?""



STAHL: ""The laptop!""



TRUMP: ""Why do you say that?""



STAHL: ""Because it can't be verified.""



TRUMP: ""The family, on the laptop — He's gone into hiding for five days.""



STAHL: ""Well he's preparing for your debate."" pic.twitter.com/sfOj8AgyMx — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) October 22, 2020

In November, Stahl’s own network verified the laptop.

[READ: Here’s All The Evidence Lesley Stahl Falsely Claimed Doesn’t Exist]

CNN’s Christiane Amanpour: Laptop Is Russian Disinformation

CNN’s Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour self-righteously declared herself a “journalist” who “follows the facts” by claiming Hunter Biden’s laptop was an operation of Russian interference. Never mind the rare, on-the-record statements from the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Department of National Intelligence, and the Department of State as evidence that it wasn’t.

“I’m a journalist and a reporter, and I follow the facts. And there has never been any issues in terms of corruption,” Amanpour said of the Bidens.

“How do you know that?” RNC spokeswoman Liz Harrington said after citing the FBI investigation into the laptop.

“I’m talking about reporting, and any evidence,” Amanpour said.

When Harrington called on Amanpour and the rest of the media to start doing journalism and begin investigating, Amanpour scoffed.

“No! We’re not going to do your work for you,” Amanpour said.

Jonah Goldberg: You Believe That Story?

Jonah Goldberg, editor-in-chief at The Dispatch, was shocked in the fall of 2020 that anyone would believe Joe Biden’s crack-addicted son would irresponsibly forget about a laptop brought in for repairs at a Delaware shop.

“Wait you believe the computer repair shop story? Like at face value?” Goldberg wrote in a tweet.

Mac Isaac, the repair shop owner, is now suing networks and Democratic politicians who smeared him as a Russian agent.

Ben Rhodes: Big Tech Needs to Censor GOP

Ben Rhodes, MSNBC contributor and former deputy national security advisor in the Obama White House, wrote on Twitter in 2020 that the conservative reaction to the Hunter Biden laptop story illustrated why censorship was an important weapon for corporate tech giants to wield against Republicans.

“The Republican freak out over not being able to spread disinformation unchecked demonstrates why you should not be able to spread disinformation unchecked,” Rhodes wrote. “They know they have no political viability without the capacity to spread lies.”

In another post, Rhodes admonished a journalist who asked Joe Biden about the laptop’s incriminating emails as “acting as the far end of a Russian disinformation operation.”

David Frum: Laptop Is ‘Obviously Bogus’

The Atlantic’s David Frum wrote off the story as “obviously fake” and “bogus” in an October 2020 tweet.

“The people on far right and far left who publicized the obviously bogus [New York Post] story were not dupes,” Frum wrote. “They were accomplices. The story could not have been more obviously fake if it had been wearing dollar-store spectacles and attached plastic mustache.”

Adam Schiff: Laptop Originated from the Kremlin

As chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, California Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff claimed the laptop came from Russia.

“Well, we know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin,” Schiff said on CNN. “Clearly, the origins of this whole smear are from the Kremlin, and the president is only happy to have Kremlin help in trying to amplify it.”

Rep. Adam Schiff says he’s concerned that he hasn’t “gotten much from the intelligence community” on Russia peddling disinformation.

In January, new House Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy removed Schiff from the House Intelligence Committee altogether.

Rachel Maddow: Laptop Will Lead to Trump Impeachment

MSNBC prime-time anchor Rachel Maddow went on an unhinged rant in October 2020 claiming Hunter Biden’s laptop will lead to Trump’s impeachment in a second term.

“If the president gets through all this and gets himself re-elected to a second term, we do today have a pretty good beat on what he’ll be impeached for in his second term,” Maddow said. Despite apparent warnings that Rudy Giuliani, the conduit for the laptop hard drive from the Delaware repair shop to the New York Post, was a Russian asset, Trump amplified the story, proving collusion with the Kremlin, according to Maddow. “The president, regardless, is promoting it.”

What Biden Won't Tell You About The Dire State Of Our Union,"The state of our union is a complete, unmitigated disaster.

The economy is in shambles, the border is two years into the worst migrant influx in U.S. history, taxpayer dollars are flying into the hands of a corrupt Eastern European regime without oversight, and our No. 1 enemy — Red China — has compromised our president, our politicians, our phones, and our skies.

Much as he did in his lie-riddled speech last year, President Joe Biden will likely try to use his State of the Union address to Congress this week to credit himself for helping the nation back onto its feet. In reality, he’s done nothing but subject Americans to more crippling crises that prompt historic levels of disapproval.

In an unprecedented “level of sustained pessimism,” 71 percent of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track. Four in 10 Americans, the most in 37 years, told ABC News/Washington Post pollsters they have become financially worse off since Biden took office in January of 2021.

In the last few months, even Democrats have turned on their party leader after seeing his incompetence. Following the 2022 midterm elections, 52 percent of Democrats expressed a desire for Biden to seek reelection in 2024. Days before his address, support for a second Biden term fell to 37 percent among the president’s key voting bloc.

Polls may be a flawed means for gauging the public’s reaction but even without them, it isn’t difficult to see that the Biden regime is an absolute embarrassment from top to bottom.

Here’s what Biden will conveniently fail to mention in Tuesday night’s address.

The Economy Is Not ‘Roaring Back’

Biden will likely spend a good portion of his speech boasting that financial legislation such as the ill-named Inflation Reduction Act passed by the Democrat-controlled Congress is restoring American jobs, wages, and savings and causing inflation to “fall.”

Yet, two years after the president greenlit the beginning of Democrats’ expensive spending spree, Americans are still suffering from gas prices well above $3 per gallon, being gaslit about how Biden didn’t induce a recession, and paying 60 percent more for eggs than they did in 2021.

In 2022 alone, U.S. households lost $6.8 trillion in wealth thanks to record-high inflation that isn’t going away, crashing stocks, and a teetering housing market.

No matter which way Biden, the “experts,” or the corporate media try to spin it, the economy and Americans’ pocketbooks are not roaring back as Biden told Congress they would last year.

The Border Is Getting Worse

One year after he removed the border protections his predecessor enacted, Biden told Congress in his 2022 SOTU address that he wanted to “secure our border.”

""If we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure our border and fix the immigration system,"" President Joe Biden says. ""As you might guess, I think we can do both."" #SOTU https://t.co/OpTY2nX7Ns pic.twitter.com/qHE7eum9Ax — PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) March 2, 2022

Then, the president spent the next 10 months ignoring the rapidly expanding humanitarian and criminal crisis before finally making a performative visit to El Paso in early January.

If history tells us anything, Biden’s 2023 SOTU speech will point to his trip and the new border crossing loopholes he created as “proof” that he’s finally doing something about the millions of illegal border crossers flooding into the United States.

But Biden’s plan to grant “legal” status to illegal border crossers from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela so long as they fly to a port of entry in the U.S. only emboldens corrupt cartels and does nothing to stop the pipeline of fentanyl responsible for taking American lives.

The U.S. Isn’t Tough on China

Biden’s speechwriters will probably credit the downing of Red China’s spy balloon, which completed its mission before it was shot down, as a symbol of the administration’s toughness on our nation’s No. 1 competitor.

What they won’t likely mention is that Biden sold oil from our emergency reserves to his son’s friends at a Chinese state-controlled gas giant before pushing the Saudis into an amicable relationship with the CCP.

Biden may have agreed to ban TikTok from government devices, but that won’t stop House Republicans from getting to the bottom of his family’s financial connections to Red China.

Biden Is Under Investigation for His Failures

Not only will Biden skip over his failures, but you can also expect him to pretend he’s not under investigation by congressional Republicans for various derelictions of duty including failing to secure the border, weaponizing the federal government against its political enemies, and harboring classified documents from his time as a senator and vice president.

Ukraine Is a Taxpayer-Funded Money Pit

Biden opened his 2022 SOTU with a tribute to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a promise that the U.S. would keep providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom.

One year and approximately $113 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars later, there is no end to the conflict in sight. Nothing is guaranteed other than Biden’s repeated promise to funnel American tax dollars to Ukraine for “as long as it takes” to stave off Russia.

Instead of ending the conflict, Biden’s overeagerness to get involved in a proxy war Congress hasn’t formally authorized the U.S. to participate in has just increased the threat of nuclear war.

Biden Is No Moderate

Biden spent a good portion of his 2022 SOTU masquerading as a social moderate who wanted to “secure the border” and “fund the police” instead of discuss identity politics.

As evidenced by another year of radical policies and actions like weaponizing the Department of Justice against law-abiding, pro-life Americans such as the recently acquitted Mark Houck and the former president, the Biden administration is far from abstaining from the culture war.

Since this is the first SOTU since the Supreme Court’s landmark Dobbs v. Jackson case, Biden will likely use his speech as a platform to push for abortion on demand throughout all nine months of pregnancy. He might even discuss his administration’s attempts to push back on states that ban mutilative transgender surgeries.

…and He’s Certainly No Unifier

Favorable corporate media coverage predicts that Biden will use his address on Tuesday to call for a “fresh start” and bipartisan cooperation between the GOP-controlled House and Democrat-run Senate. Biden wants to look like he’s Mr. Nice Guy by giving the other side of the aisle a chance to work with him.

But the few times Biden gave formal addresses in 2022, he demonized the half of the country that didn’t vote for him and tried to criminalize the conservative agenda ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. He has no tolerance for House Republicans and certainly has no tolerance for the voters and values those legislators represent.

Simply put, Biden’s track record is indefensibly terrible. It shouldn’t be hard for viewers to look past his inevitable gaffes to see this SOTU will be another unremarkable speech littered with lies and failed promises.

"In Spy Balloon Faceoff Between The US And China, Everyone Lost","For a few days last week, Americans focused their attention on the sky as a Chinese spy balloon floated across most parts of the continental U.S. The Biden administration waited until last Saturday to finally shoot the balloon down. The whole incident and the responses from both Beijing and Washington exposed serious policy miscalculations on both sides.

Most people want to know why the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sent a spy balloon to the U.S. a week before the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to Beijing. There are several probable explanations. One is that CCP might want to use relatively low-cost and low-tech equipment to test the U.S. air defense system. As The Wall Street Journal reported, the Chinese spy balloon likely had no “radar or other electronic emissions that would have given away [its] presence,” which initially made the balloon challenging to detect.

The CCP probably hoped to gather crucial intelligence, such as how long it would take the U.S. military to notice the balloon and initiate a response, and what type of response it would be. The CCP almost certainly expected the U.S. military to take down the spy balloon eventually. But Xi and his comrades might not be too concerned about losing the balloon because it wasn’t an advanced surveillance tool, so it wouldn’t reveal much of China’s surveillance technology capability.

Another plausible explanation is that Beijing attempted to put the Biden administration in a psychologically uncomfortable place before Secretary Blinken’s trip. The CCP believes the United States is inevitably declining, especially under President Joe Biden. When the Biden administration held its first high-level meeting with communist China in Anchorage, Alaska, in March 2021, Yang Jiechi, the head of the Chinese delegation, broke a diplomatic norm by lashing out at his U.S. counterpart for more than 15 minutes in front a worldwide audience. The CCP likes to open negotiations with a psychological advantage by intimidating its opponent.

Therefore, the CCP might have believed it could release a spy balloon into the U.S. to test the Biden administration’s resolve and gain some psychological upper hand before Blinken’s trip. Undoubtedly, the CCP sought to exploit any weaknesses in the Biden administration’s response and apply them to its talks with Blinken.

Regardless of the CCP’s motives, it neglected to factor in the American public’s reaction to its foreign policy calculation. Since there is no free election in China, Xi and his comrades never have to be concerned about answering to voters. Without a free press in China, the CCP can easily hide its mistakes under the rug and keep the public in the dark.

But America is different. Americans do not like to feel unsafe in their own backyards. Regardless of political ideology, the majority of voters see that one of the government’s essential functions is protecting its citizens against hostile foreign forces. The sight of a Chinese spy balloon floating uninterruptedly in America’s sky for days unnerved many Americans last week. Unlike the CCP, American politicians have to answer to voters.

The CCP’s hope of putting the Biden administration in a weakened position before a negotiation backfired. The call for action was so loud in the U.S. that the Biden administration was forced to shoot down the spy balloon and postponed Blinken’s visit. Xi’s miscalculated foreign policy gambit became a blunder, and prolonged tension between the U.S. and China will be bad news for China’s weakened economy.

The CCP’s latest miscalculation is its Foreign Ministry claim that the balloon was a civilian weather balloon knocked off the course, and that America’s action was a “serious violation of international practice.” Beijing vowed to reserve the right to take further actions. The CCP’s preposterous statement after being caught red-handed will only anger the American people further and increase public pressure on the Biden administration and Congress to come up with policies to address the CCP’s security threat to America and its allies.

The spy balloon incident also exposed the Biden administration’s policy miscalculations. The Biden administration reportedly had kept its knowledge of a Chinese spy balloon in America’s airspace from the public for days, hoping not to disrupt Blinken’s trip to Beijing. Now we learn that China had sent a similar spy balloon to the U.S. before and apparently, the Biden administration didn’t bother to develop a plan to address China’s blatant violation of U.S. sovereignty.

The Biden administration probably was counting on America’s left-leaning corporate press to downplay or ignore the Chinese spy balloon story, just like how they refused to cover Hunter Biden’s laptop. But this time, the American media didn’t let Biden off the hook so easily. The national press gave the spy balloon wall-to-wall coverage and kept the story front and center till the Biden administration shot the balloon down and canceled Blinken’s trip to Beijing.

Wishing the American public not to look up to the sky and a friendly media not to report about the balloon was a miscalculation. Not bringing the balloon down as soon as it entered U.S. airspace was a miscalculation. Waiting for days to take action was a miscalculation because Chinese intelligence could have already received tons of data collected by the balloon.

The most severe policy miscalculation the Biden administration has committed is its belief that climate change is the biggest threat to humanity and that it needs the CCP’s cooperation to save the planet. Yet, China remains the world’s worst polluter even after it signed the Paris Climate Accords.

The CCP sees the Biden administration’s blind faith in climate change as a weakness that Beijing can exploit. For example, pushing for the broader adoption of solar panels is essential to Democrats’ “Green New Deal.” But China dominates the global solar industry. It “control[s] an estimated 80% of the global supply chain for solar manufacturing and produce[s] nearly half of all the equipment needed to manufacture solar panels and their components,” according to The Wall Street Journal. The Biden administration’s push for solar energy has increased American dependence on China and endangered the U.S. economy and national security.

When the CCP sees a weakness in its opponent, it will waste no time exploiting it. Recently, China announced its plan to restrict exports of key solar manufacturing technology, perhaps hoping its plan will cause so much disruption of the Biden administration’s green agenda that the U.S. may relax its controls on semiconductor technology exports to China.

The Chinese spy balloon has exposed serious policy miscalculations in both the U.S. and China. The two nations are engaging in the great power competition of the 21st century. If the U.S. doesn’t learn from policy mistakes and make proper adjustments quickly, it may not come out as the winner.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/06/in-spy-balloon-faceoff-between-the-u-s-and-red-china-everyone-lost/,2023-02-06
15 Whoppers Joe Biden Told During State Of The Union Address,"President Joe Biden mumbled through his second State of the Union address to a divided Congress on Tuesday night.

His aim wasn’t just to beg House Republicans to pass Democrats’ legislative wish lists. The president sought to convince Americans that the state of our union — crippled by inflation, overrun by drugs and migrants trafficked across the southern border, and in the midst of a debilitating culture war incited by left-wing aggression — isn’t in dire straits.

The speech was remarkably similar to last year’s address, riddled with lie after lie.

Here are 15 lies the president told during his 2023 State of the Union speech:

1. Chuck Schumer Is Minority Leader

Before his speech even began, Biden greeted Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as “Senate Minority Leader.” Schumer has been the majority leader since Biden took office in 2021.

Biden: ""Congratulations to Chuck Schumer, another term as Senate minority leader. You know, only this time you have a slightly bigger majority. You are the majority leader. Not that much bigger?"" pic.twitter.com/VlTFx9t9rH — Greg Price (@greg_price11) February 8, 2023

2. More Jobs Created in Two Years Than Any Other President

“I actually created, with the help of many people in this room, 12 million new jobs,” Biden said. “More jobs created in two years than any president has created in four years. Because of you.”

Biden didn’t create new jobs, as he often likes to claim. The only reason the job rate is growing is that millions of people are returning to work after tyrannical bureaucrats shut down the economy for months in the name of stopping the spread of Covid-19.

3. Fastest Growth in 40 Years

Biden also repeated his infamous lie that he initiated the “fastest job growth in 40 years.”

Records, however, show that employment from May 2020 to January 2021 under Trump grew by 12.5 million. During approximately that same time period, the unemployment rate also declined by 8.3 percent.

In January alone, American payroll jobs under Biden fell by more than 2.5 million.

4. Inflation Is ‘Coming Down’

Another lie Biden repeated from previous speeches is that inflation in the U.S. “is coming down.”

Yet, two years after the president greenlit the beginning of Democrats’ expensive spending spree, Americans are suffering from gas prices still well above $3 per gallon, weathering a recession, and paying 60 percent more for eggs than they did in 2021. Biden may not be responsible for the fastest job growth in the last four decades, but inflation under his watch rose at its fastest rate in 40 years.

[READ: Biden, Media Taunt Struggling Americans By Insisting 6.5% Inflation Is A Good Thing]

Biden tried to blame the nation’s economic misfortune on the pandemic and the “unfair and brutal war in Ukraine” but the truth is, inflation in the U.S. directly coincides with the time he took office.

5. Democracy Faced ‘Greatest Threat Since Civil War’ On Jan. 6

President Biden forgot about the attacks on Pearl Harbor, 9/11, and the repeat episodes of violence at the Capitol when he claimed the riot on Jan. 6 was the “greatest threat since the Civil War.”

Look at McCarthy’s reaction as Biden repeats the lie that the Jan 6 riot was the greatest threat since the Civil War.



pic.twitter.com/XqNUDRmQJn — The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) February 8, 2023

Biden made the same hyperbolic claim at his first State of the Union address before Congress in April.

6. I’m Responsible for the Largest Deficit Cut in U.S. History

Biden wants to take credit for cutting the national deficit “by more than $1.7 trillion – the largest deficit reduction in American history” in his first two years in office.

“Under the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a row. Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor,” Biden said.

The truth is, federal spending under Biden increased more than $10 trillion since his first month in office. That’s more than any other president spent in his first two years in U.S. history.

7. Republicans Are Trying to Cut Social Security

Biden pledged to halt desperately needed cuts to bloated entitlement programs as Congress debates raising the debt ceiling.

“If anyone tries to cut Social Security,” the president said, “I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.”

The Democrats’ reconciliation bill passed last summer, however, raided nearly $300 billion from Medicare to boost insurance companies by removing leverage from negotiations on drug prices.

""If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.""



This guy raided almost $300 billion from Medicare prescription drug spending to hand over to health insurance companies and green energy interests last year!!! — Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) February 8, 2023

8. Fires Have Burned an Area the Size of Missouri

President Biden tried to claim more wood had been burned by forest fires than the area of the entire state of Missouri.

“More timber has been burned than I’ve observed from helicopters than the entire state of Missouri,” Biden said.

Biden on forest fires: ""More timber has been burned — that I’ve observed from helicopters — than the entire state of Missouri"" 🤔 pic.twitter.com/yXlPS3KHXY — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) February 8, 2023

In 2022, however, 7.5 million acres burned, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Missouri’s forests span 14 million acres, and the state itself is 44.6 million acres large.

The remark appears to have been made off-script from what the White House released as the president’s prepared speech.

9. Biden Repeats Claim Fast Food Workers Sign Noncompete Agreements

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy could be seen laughing in the background when Biden complained fast food workers were signing noncompete agreements with employers.

“A cashier at a burger place can’t walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make a few bucks more,” Biden said.

Biden claims that McDonald’s cashiers sign noncompete agreements which prevent them from working for other burger chains. 😂 pic.twitter.com/cXyPHE7lvk — John Curtis (@Johnmcurtis) February 8, 2023

Biden made the same claim at a business roundtable in July 2020, earning the then-candidate a “false” rating from PolitiFact.

10. Biden Blames Crime Wave on Covid After Democrats Defunded Police

Biden blamed the coronavirus lockdowns for the nation’s recent crime wave.

Covid left scars, the president said, “like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.”

It was the Democrats’ rush to “defund police,” however, that left cities and neighborhoods vulnerable to criminals who remained free to roam the streets. Democrats in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and New York cut police funding by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of the social justice fever that took over the country. More than a dozen cities saw the highest homicide rates ever reported as a result.

According to a poll from Politico last year, 3 in 4 Americans blamed the crime spree on the efforts to defund police.

11. I Re-Upped Funding for Cancer Research

One of Biden’s top priorities going into tonight’s speech was his “Cancer Moonshot” initiative, which allocates funding to cancer research and care.

“Jill and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead,” Biden said.

Biden may have restarted the program to “provide more support for patients and families” but it was his pet legislation, the ill-named Inflation Reduction Act, that cut cancer research spending by nine times as much as his program is supposed to put toward it.

12. Immigration ‘Reform’ Will Secure the Border

Biden pointed to his “new border plan” as evidence that he’s finally doing something about the millions of illegal border crossers flooding the U.S.

But his plan to grant “legal” status to illegal border crossers from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela only emboldens corrupt cartels and does nothing to stop the pipeline of fentanyl responsible for taking American lives, something several hecklers pointed out during his speech.

Biden said his “comprehensive immigration reform” would “fix” the national security threat that American border woes have become. In reality, that legislation would only encourage the millions of migrants overwhelming Border Patrol agents to keep paying the criminal organizations that control northern Mexico to escort them to the U.S.

13. Mass Shootings Went Down After Assault Weapon Ban

Biden claimed the federal assault weapons ban, which barred the manufacturing of semi-automatic rifles for civilian use from 1994 to 2004, caused mass shootings to drop.

“In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled,” Biden said.

That’s a lie based on a flawed study that claimed the ban reduced mass shooting deaths.

Accurate data recorded during the ban shows that more so-called mass shootings occurred during the firearm prohibition. Even after the ban expired, mass shootings did not increase, as Democrats suggested they would.

14. Life-Saving Pro-Life Laws Are Extreme

Biden wrongfully characterized pro-life legislation in several red states as “extreme” for limiting women’s ability to kill their unborn babies.

“Already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans,” he said.

In reality, it’s Biden’s abortion-on-demand throughout all nine of months of pregnancy agenda that is extreme. New polling suggests 7 in 10 Americans support limiting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy.

Biden also criticized Republicans for trying to pass what he said is a “national abortion ban.”

As pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America noted, the GOP has not proposed a total ban on abortions. They’ve just worked to bring U.S. abortion law up to speed with other civilized countries, which recognize abortion beyond 15 weeks gestation as a barbaric practice.

15. ‘I’m Here to Be President for All Americans’

In addition to promising unity via bipartisan cooperation, Biden falsely claimed he is “here to be president for all Americans.”

Yet, the few times Biden gave formal addresses in 2022, he demonized the half of the country that didn’t vote for him. His smears against “MAGA Republicans” shows he has no tolerance for conservative voters or their values.

A president for all wouldn’t sic his Department of Justice on parents concerned that their children’s education stays indoctrination free or a pro-life father who rightfully defended his son from a deranged abortion activist.

Don’t Fall For Joe Biden’s Economic Fairy Tale,"Like Nero bragging about rebuilding Circus Maximus after burning it down, Joe Biden took to the podium tonight to take credit for solving a slew of problems he helped create.

At the top of his State of the Union address, the president boasted that he had “created more jobs in two years than any president created in four years.” No president — not Joe Biden nor Donald Trump — creates jobs. But Biden’s contention was exceptionally misleading, considering he inherited an economy that had been unplugged by an artificial, state-induced shutdown. If the government compels businesses to shutter, it doesn’t “create” jobs when allowing them to open.

On more than one occasion during the night, a mercurial Biden contended that Covid-19 had shut down the economy. No, states did. Politicians did.

Biden was an aggressive proponent of those shutdowns. During the 2020 presidential campaign, the president regularly attacked Republican governors for opening too early and for ignoring federal health officials. Even in August of 2021, after it was clear that shutdowns hadn’t saved any lives, Biden was still criticizing Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis for rejecting a new round of Covid authoritarianism, telling him to “get out of the way” of those trying to “do the right thing.”

Three years ago, the unemployment rate was at 3.5 percent. Today, Biden reminded us that it was at a historic low of 3.4 percent. More than 30 million people lost their jobs to Covid lockdowns. Biden claims to have “created” 12 million jobs during the past two years. The one big difference is that the labor participation rate still hasn’t recovered to pre-Covid numbers. It’s great that people are working again. But millions fewer are in the market for jobs.

Biden also boasted that Americans were seeing “near” historic unemployment lows for black and Hispanic workers. These historic lows were achieved before Covid lockdowns. So, if Biden deserves credit for this, doesn’t Trump? Of course, there is no specific Biden economic policy that brought us near-historic unemployment lows for minorities or an unemployment rate 0.1 percent lower than the previous administration. Washington wasted trillions of dollars propping up an economy that it previously shut down.

Speaking of spending, Biden claimed that the preposterously misnamed “Inflation Reduction Act,” which you might recall was initially called “Build Back Better,” had helped alleviate spiking prices. Only when inflation became non-transitory, and a politically problematic issue, did Biden begin arguing that more spending would mitigate inflation.

And only then did Democrats rename their bill, which was crammed with the same spending, corporate welfare, price fixing, and tax hikes — all long-desired progressive wish-list items. “The Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever in climate change,” Biden said during his address, as if this sentence made any sense.

Presidents are often unduly blamed or given credit for economic events beyond their control. But it is no accident inflation took off as Democrats pumped hundreds of billions into a hot economy (in the case of the “infrastructure” bill, with the help of Senate Republicans) and aggravated foreseeable problems with policies that disincentivize work and undercut energy production. All this led to the biggest inflation spike since 1982. We are still at historic highs. A slew of products that consumers rely on still remain atypically expensive, and fears of additional price hikes have started to seriously corrode consumer confidence.

Biden lied that “25 percent” of the national federal debt was incurred by the previous administration when most of that debt was driven by entitlement programs passed, expanded, and revered by Democrats. And he misled the nation by claiming that his administration had “cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion — the largest deficit reduction in American history,” when, in fact, those “cuts” were sunsetting pandemic emergency spending that Democrats had complained wasn’t enough.

Biden went into his well-worn platitudes and myths about how the rich don’t pay taxes — “[n]o billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter!” — and proposed higher rates on the wealthy and corporations. He also promised to micromanage the economy with a slew of new regulations that would interfere in voluntary contracts struck between employees and employers and consumers and businesses.

Biden implored Congress to pass the PRO Act, a bill that would empower the government to impose unions on businesses and workers who want no part of them. Biden hawked an entire menu of crude economic populism — including price controls and protectionist trade policies that would undermine growth, competition, job creation, and innovation while driving up the cost of virtually every construction project in the country.

There were numerous lies, half-truths, and deceptions. There was a slew of antiquated economic ideas and sloganeering. But, surely, the president’s biggest lie of the night was to claim, “I’m a capitalist.”",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/08/dont-fall-for-joe-bidens-economic-fairy-tale/,2023-02-08
"Joe Biden Tried Multiple Times To Cut Medicare, Social Security","Many of the positions on deficits and spending that President Joe Biden assailed in his State of the Union message he once espoused. That contrast demonstrates one of the prime reasons Washington will not get federal spending under control—opportunistic political charlatans like the current occupant of the Oval Office.

When the president attacked lawmakers who “want Medicare and Social Security to sunset,” he should have begun by using the perpendicular pronoun. In July 1975, then-Senator Biden proposed legislation to terminate “all provisions of law in effect on the effective date of this Act which authorize new budget authority for a period of more than four fiscal years.”

Biden’s supporters may try to parse that language by claiming that terminating the authorizations for Medicare, Social Security, or the military would not necessarily prevent federal dollars from flowing to those programs. But such claims stand at odds with Biden’s own comments regarding his bill. He said the bill “requires every program”—including Medicare and Social Security—“to be looked at freshly at least once every four years. The examination is not just of the increased cost of the program, but of the worthiness of the entire program.”

Similarly, when Biden claimed that “if anyone tries to cut Social Security [and Medicare], I will stop them,” he omitted his long history of supporting proposals reducing spending on these programs. In spring 1984, Biden, along with Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kansas, proposed an across-the-board freeze on federal spending.

The bill would have eliminated all cost-of-living increases in federal employee pay, as well as Social Security and Medicare benefits, for fiscal year 1985. In a joint Washington Post op-ed, Biden and three other senators claimed they supported the freeze because “federal deficits are a clear and present danger to our economic recovery.”

Also, when Biden claimed that Republicans “say if we don’t cut Social Security and Medicare, they’ll let America default on its debt for the first time in our history,” he neglected to mention that he previously wanted to do exactly that. In October 1984, Biden supported an amendment to a debt limit bill offered by Sen. Paul Tsongas, D-Mass. The Tsongas amendment would have provided for a smaller increase in the debt limit than the underlying bill, and prohibited further debt limit increases until Congress acted on a spending freeze for the following fiscal year.

Biden said he supported Tsongas’ action precisely “because it says we cannot increase the debt limit again until we have acted on a budget freeze”—one that would, like Biden’s spring proposal, have frozen Medicare and Social Security benefits. When the Tsongas amendment failed, Biden voted against raising the debt limit.

As important as Biden’s support for a freeze was his publicly stated reason for suggesting it. In an October 1984 floor speech, he claimed a total federal spending freeze would work because voters “are not stupid…They are not dumb. These folks understand. They know that to cut the deficit, everybody has to be in it.”

Given his volte face—whereby Biden has pledged to veto any bill that reduces spending on the largest two federal programs, Social Security and Medicare—a heretofore supine press might inquire as to exactly when, and under what circumstances, the president grew to believe in the stupidity of the American public.

Voters should find Biden’s behavior disqualifying, and not just because he takes the public for fools. The Medicare trustees, all members of Biden’s own administration, state that the program’s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will become insolvent in 2028. But Biden has yet to release any plan to avoid an insolvency scenario projected for his potential second term.

Ironically enough, Biden’s earlier proposals to regularly review spending programs and freeze federal spending across-the-board represent possible solutions to tackle our $31 trillion in accumulated debt. But making difficult choices requires a level of forthrightness lacking from a president utterly beholden to his party’s radicalized left.

Consider that in July 2011, President Obama stated that “if you look at the numbers, then Medicare in particular will run out of money, and we will not be able to sustain that program no matter how much taxes go up.” A dozen years later, Biden, by vowing to veto any “cuts” to Medicare, has articulated a position that none other than Barack Obama has characterized as unsustainable.

At a time the nation demands signal leadership, Biden has thrown in his lot with a leftist movement whose underlying philosophy—power through dependence—views Medicare as little more than a bloody shirt to wave at political opponents, or a slush fund to expand dependency elsewhere, rather than a solemn commitment to seniors and the most vulnerable.

Confronted by his own past positions, Biden should come to his senses, and negotiate a bipartisan package that charts a pathway to fiscal sanity. But if he insists on attacking politicians who propose common-sense steps to control our skyrocketing debt, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy should bring to his next White House meeting a gift to remind the president he doesn’t have far to look to find a target for his demagoguery: A mirror.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/08/joe-biden-tried-multiple-times-to-cut-medicare-and-social-security/,2023-02-08
Twitter Execs' Election-Meddling Choices Look Flimsier Than Ever,"When the New York Post dropped its bombshell reporting on documents recovered from Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop in October of 2020, Twitter did not reach out to the FBI to ask whether the reporting was Russian disinformation — despite extensive coordination with the FBI to prepare to combat foreign election interference. Instead, according to testimony at Wednesday’s House Oversight Committee hearing, Twitter relied on the tweets of supposed experts, making the tech giant’s decision to censor the Post’s story even more outrageous.

The House Oversight Committee, now in the hands of Republicans, questioned four former Twitter executives on their decision to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., pushed Twitter’s former global head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, to explain the timing of Twitter’s decision to censor the New York Post story.

Biggs noted that in an 8:51 a.m. email on Oct. 14, 2020, Roth had taken the position that the laptop “isn’t clearly violative of our Hacked Materials Policy.” But then, by 10:12, Roth emailed his colleagues with Twitter’s decision to censor the story, stating that “the key factor informing our approach is consensus from experts monitoring election security and disinformation that this looks a lot like a hack-and-leak operation.”

What cybersecurity experts had Roth consulted between 9 a.m. and 10:15 a.m. on Oct. 14, 2020, the morning the Post story broke, Biggs asked the former Twitter executive.

Roth responded that the experts were ones the Twitter heads were following on the platform. “We were following discussions about this as they unfolded on Twitter,” Roth explained. “Cybersecurity experts were tweeting about this incident and sharing their perspectives, and that informed some of Twitter’s judgment here.”

Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D., was incredulous: “After 2016, you set up all these teams to deal with Russian interference, foreign interference, having regular meetings with the FBI, you have connections with all of these different government agencies, and you didn’t reach out to them once?”

“That’s right,” Roth said, noting he didn’t think it would be appropriate.

Instead, Twitter relied on the tweets of supposed national security experts.

Who those experts were, Roth didn’t say, but here we have another strange coincidence: In his testimony on Wednesday, Roth told the committee that a few weeks before the Post story dropped, he had participated in an exercise hosted by the Aspen Institute, with other media outlets and social media companies, that posed a hack and leak October surprise involving Hunter Biden. Roth testified that Garrett Graff facilitated that event.

And at 8:23 a.m. on Oct. 14, 2020, after the Post story broke, Graff tweeted his playbook for how the media should react to “this Biden-Burisma crap.”

Graff followed about some 10 minutes later, tweeting, “Also, what a TOTAL coincidence that this fake Hunter Biden scandal drops the literal day after it becomes clear that both of Bill Barr’s other intended October surprises—the Durham investigation and the unmasking investigation—have fallen apart??!”

Not long after Graff began pushing the “fake” Hunter Biden scandal narrative, Vivian Schiller joined in, calling the Hunter Biden story “nonsense” and claiming Graff’s exercise was “to test readiness of some MSM.”

And who is Schiller? According to Graff, Schiller “designed and ran” the Hunter Biden tabletop exercise that Roth participated in. She was also the former head of news at Twitter, in addition to previously being the CEO of NPR, among other gigs.

In addition to Graff and Schiller, CNN’s consultant and so-called national-security expert weighed in at 8:23 a.m., questioning the “amplifying” of the New York Post’s story, stressing that “amplification is the key to disinformation.”

Natasha Bertrand also tweeted an early morning “warning” that a Russian agent had been “teasing misleading or edited Biden material for nearly a year.”

Bertrand, also known as Fusion Natasha for falling for Fusion GPS’s Steele dossier and Alfa Bank hoax, was joined in pushing the disinformation narrative by The Washington Post’s alleged fact-checker Glenn Kessler.

By 8:30 a.m., Kessler had shared The Washington Post’s policy “regarding hacked or leaked materials,” and told Twitter users to “be careful what is in your social media feeds.”

Mother Jones’ D.C. bureau chief David Corn followed with a 9:07 tweet declaring that the “whole story” was predicated on “false Fox/Giuliani talking points” and pronouncing the Post as advancing “disinformation.”

Twitter’s decision to censor the Hunter Biden story was bad enough before, but to think the executives may have relied on so-called experts like these raises the outrage another octave.

Former Twitter Deputy General Counsel James Baker likewise indicated in an email that he had “seen some reliable cybersecurity folks question the authenticity of the emails in another way (i.e., that there is no metadata pertaining to them that has been released and the formatting looks like they could be complete fabrications.)” Baker, however, did not say whether he had spoken with the “cybersecurity folks,” and given that when pushed by the committee he hid behind attorney-client privilege, getting any more answers from Baker seems unlikely.

Beyond learning that Twitter executives opted to rely on the tweets of so-called experts over asking the FBI if the laptop was fake, Wednesday’s hearing consisted mainly of grandstanding — some on both sides of the aisle — and Democrats attempting to make the hearing about Trump when they weren’t complaining that the entire session was a waste of time. One additional salient fact came out, however, in addition to a review of the basics of Twitter’s censorship efforts.

Specifically, Roth clarified for the House committee that the FBI had not previously warned that an expected “hack-and-leak” operation was rumored to likely involve Hunter Biden. Rather, according to Roth’s testimony, the rumor that the hack-and-leak operation would target the Biden son came from another tech company.

Roth claimed in his Wednesday testimony that his Dec. 21, 2020, statement to the Federal Election Commission was being misinterpreted. In that statement, Roth had attested that “since 2018 he had regular meetings with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and industry peers regarding election security.” His signed declaration then noted that the “expectations of hack-and-leak operations were discussed throughout 2020. I also learned in these meetings that there were rumors that a hack-and-leak operation would involve Hunter Biden.”

According to Roth, he should have worded his statement differently because it was not the FBI that had raised Hunter Biden as a potential subject of the hack and leak, but a peer company. One would think, however, that Roth would have clarified this point to his lawyer some two-plus years ago when Twitter’s Covington & Burling attorney represented to the FEC in a cover letter that accompanied Roth’s statement that “reports from the law enforcement agencies even suggested there were rumors that such a hack-and-leak operation would be related to Hunter Biden.”

Clearly, the former Twitter executives seek to separate themselves from the FBI, but “The Twitter Files” make that next to impossible to accomplish. And, really, being beholden to the so-called experts tweeting out warnings of supposed Russian disinformation would hardly be an improvement.

Media 'But Trump' To Distract From GOP's Biden Investigation,"One of House Republicans’ first steps after regaining the majority was to launch an investigation into President Joe Biden’s role in the Biden family’s lucrative pay-to-play business. Corporate media, however, are trying to distract from the first family’s scandals by conflating them with the conduct of the Trump family.

The Washington Post published an article last week, during the height of buzz about the House Oversight Committee’s investigation into the Biden family’s influence-peddling operation, pointing the corruption finger at former President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.

“An investment fund overseen by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is backing ventures that profit the former president and his senior adviser, raising questions of conflict,” the article alleges.

Within days of the report’s publication, corporate media outlets such as CNN, MSNBC, and even Rolling Stone featured anti-Trump information on their pages and networks.

The point of amplifying the report is twofold. First, it gives the media and their Democrat allies more ammo against Trump’s third presidential run. The Washington Post is clear about that:

Now, with Trump running for president again, some national security experts and two former White House officials say they have concerns that Trump and Kushner used their offices to set themselves up to profit from their relationship with the Saudis after the administration ended.

Second, reports about the Trumps give anyone looking to escape conversations about the Biden family’s well-documented history of enriching their bank accounts with funds from foreign oligarchs an excuse to pivot to their favorite scapegoat.

Already, leftist commentators are claiming the Biden family “deserves grace,” while the Trumps deserve investigation. Despite countless real reports and ongoing federal investigations into the Biden family’s affairs, MSNBC’s Mehdi Hasan even bizarrely asserted there is “no real evidence” that the Biden family business leveraged Joe Biden’s status for personal profit.

""The president & a close family member making a ton of money off their dealings with a foreign country, peddling access to enrich themselves. It's an outrageous abuse of power. But I’m not talking about Hunter Biden. I'm talking about Jared Kushner.""

The Political Enemy Playbook

Even before Trump’s White House tenure, the corporate media did everything in their power to make him look like a corrupt politician who was sold out to foreign governments. When they weren’t amplifying the Russia hoax, a fake scandal created and paid for by Democrats, the propaganda press scrutinized Trump’s tweets, twisted his words, and tried to undermine his presidency with lies that won Pulitzers.

They also aided Democrats in orchestrating two sham impeachments against Trump, whom they claimed was guilty of treason. These political attacks were sustained with plenty of negative press coverage of Trump’s sons, daughters, and son-in-law.

Where was the media’s outrage about White House familial corruption when Hunter exploited his father’s political reputation to strike business deals with oligarchs in Ukraine and China and then likely gave a cut to his dad? Joe Biden and his youngest son are the epitomai of the scandal and corruption Democrats and the corrupt corporate media desperately want Trump and his family to be.

There are literal receipts of the Biden family conducting shady business dealings overseas and profiting from relationships with sworn enemies, yet publications such as The Washington Post and The New York Times worked overtime to downplay and mischaracterize the findings to save the Biden patriarch from criticism and losing the 2020 election.

They didn’t want the public to know that when Biden was vice president and overseeing the Obama administration’s Ukraine relations, Hunter received a whopping $50,000 per month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company he had no qualifications to be on. They didn’t want the public to hear that Hunter also raked in millions from the wife of the former Moscow mayor, and they certainly didn’t want Americans to discover that just two weeks after he traveled to communist China on his dad’s Air Force Two jet, Hunter helped his Chinese business partners secure a deal that gave them control of a cobalt mine in Congo.

No, for the media, there was no politically advantageous reason to expose that “an arm of the Chinese government” funneled money directly to a company managed by Hunter to compensate him for offering legal representation to the vice-chairman and secretary-general of Chinese energy company CEFC, Dr. Patrick Ho Chi Ping, the “spy chief of China.” And there was certainly no good reason for them to communicate that Ho, who was arrested, charged, and later convicted for using millions of dollars to “bribe top officials of Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for CEFC,” made a phone call to James Biden, Joe’s brother.

Instead of covering bombshell stories about the questionable actions of a tight-knit family whose patriarch is in charge of the U.S. government, the propaganda press is still hyper-fixated on the Trumps.

When they aren’t going after the former first family, the media are amplifying the current president’s excuses and shilling for his son, who admitted through his lawyers that the infamous laptop exposing the Biden family’s foreign dealings was his. This investigation, they have claimed over and over and over and over and over, is a politically motivated one. But it’s not.

It’s About Joe, Stupid

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., has repeatedly declared Republican investigators are interested in Joe Biden’s “knowledge of and role in his family’s foreign business deals to assess whether he has compromised national security,” not Hunter.

“Evidence obtained in our investigation reveals the Biden family business model is built on Joe Biden’s political career and connections. Biden family members attempted to sell access around the world, including individuals who were connected to the Chinese Communist Party, to enrich themselves to the detriment of American interests,” Comer said in a statement last week. “If President Biden is compromised by deals with foreign adversaries and they are impacting his decision making, this is a threat to national security.”

Despite the corporate media’s attempts to distract from, stifle, and smear Republicans’ investigation into the Biden family business by going after Trump again, the GOP can’t give up. Unlike when Democrats rallied their partisan network to falsely paint Trump as a Russian asset, this legitimate and evidence-based investigation is essential to determining whether U.S. national security is compromised from top to bottom because of Biden.

Biden Can't Explain Why He's Soft On Chinese Spy Balloons,"Image Credit PBS News/YouTube

The three unidentified objects the U.S. military shot out of North American airspace last week using six-figure missiles were “most likely” instruments owned by private research and recreation organizations for scientific purposes, President Joe Biden told reporters during a press conference on Thursday.

According to Biden, the U.S. government is still uncertain about what these objects are and what they were used to do, which is why crews are working to uncover the downed objects’ debris.

“We don’t yet know exactly what these three objects were,” Biden admitted. “But nothing, nothing, right now suggests they were related to China’s spy balloon program or they were surveillance vehicles from other any other country.”

Biden says the three objects that he ordered shot down last week after they let the Chinese spy balloon fly across the country were most likely weather balloons. pic.twitter.com/RvePtENh21 — Greg Price (@greg_price11) February 16, 2023

Despite the objects’ seemingly innocuous purposes, Biden bragged that if “any object presents a threat to the safety and security of the American people, I will take it down.”

But what about objects that aren’t classified by Biden, his advisers, or anyone else in the intelligence-military complex as a “threat to the safety and security of the American people?” That’s what happened with the Chinese spy balloon.

Unnamed bureaucrats repeatedly assured Americans that the Chinese spy balloon, which was clearly equipped with “multiple antennas” that were “likely capable of collecting and geo-locating communications” for “intelligence surveillance” above some of the nation’s most sensitive locations, did not “pose a military or physical threat.” The Biden administration used that unsourced claim as justification to wait to take out the enemy device until it had made its way across the entire continental U.S.

The Pentagon repeated similar assurances about the next three unidentified flying objects that were discovered hovering over North America days later.

“These objects don’t present a military threat to anyone on the ground,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said.

But the objects were quickly fired out of the sky with missiles that cost $400,000 each because officials claimed the UFOs were a hazard to commercial aircraft.

How is it that the U.S. military, informed by intelligence agencies and commanded by Biden, scrambled to shoot down objects that officials clearly said didn’t pose a threat to U.S. national security, but wouldn’t shoot down an object launched by the United States’s top foreign adversary?

To recap, Biden said no one can definitively state what these objects were used for, but then said they are probably weather balloon lookalikes. The Pentagon said these UFOs weren’t a threat to national security, but then shot them down anyway. Meanwhile, the real threat, Red China’s espionage device, didn’t get blown out of the sky and sunk below the waves in the Atlantic Ocean until more than a week after it was detected.

None of Biden’s justifications for quickly shooting down weather balloons but not the Chinese spy balloon make sense, but Biden still insisted Americans should be proud of him.

“We shot it down, sending a clear message, clear message: the violation of our sovereignty is unacceptable. We will act to protect our country and we did,” Biden said.

The president brushed off questions about his own major conflicts of interest. Independent journalists have documented multiple Biden family members accepting millions from foreign officials throughout Joe Biden’s time in high-level government positions. Some of the largest of these national-security-implicating payments to Bidens have come from Chinese Communist Party officials, according to journalist Peter Schweizer and former Biden family business partners.

Biden said his job as president and commander-in-chief is to “always act to protect the interest of the American people and the security of the American people,” but Americans aren’t going to buy that when he can’t articulate why he rushed to shoot down a potentially friendly research device yet waited days to go after a hostile one.

The Twitter Files Reveal An Existential Threat,"The following is adapted from a talk delivered at Hillsdale College on Feb. 7, 2023.

Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter last October and the subsequent reporting on the “Twitter Files” by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, and a handful of others beginning in early December is one of the most important news stories of our time. The “Twitter Files” story encompasses, and to a large extent connects, every major political scandal of the Trump-Biden era. Put simply, the “Twitter Files” reveal an unholy alliance between Big Tech and the deep state designed to throttle free speech and maintain an official narrative through censorship and propaganda. This should not just disturb us, it should also prod us to action in defense of the First Amendment, free and fair elections, and indeed our country.

After Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter, he fired a slew of useless or insubordinate employees, instituted new content moderation policies, and tried to reform a woke corporate culture that bordered (and still borders) on parody. In the process, Musk coordinated with Taibbi and Weiss on the publication of a series of stories based on internal Twitter documents related to an array of major political events going back years: the Hunter Biden laptop scandal, Twitter’s secret policy of shadowbanning, President Trump’s suspension from Twitter after the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot, the co-opting of Twitter by the FBI to suppress “election disinformation” ahead of the 2020 election, Twitter’s involvement in a Pentagon overseas psy-op campaign, its silencing of dissent from the official Covid narrative, its complicity in the Russiagate hoax, and its gradual capitulation to the direct involvement of the U.S. intelligence community — with the FBI as a go-between — in content moderation.

As Taibbi has written, the “Twitter Files” “show the FBI acting as doorman to a vast program of social media surveillance and censorship, encompassing agencies across the federal government — from the State Department to the Pentagon to the CIA.”

The “Twitter Files” contain multitudes, but for the sake of brevity let us consider just three installments and their related implications: the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story, the suspension of Trump, and the deputization of Twitter by the FBI. Together, these stories reveal not just a social media company willing to do the bidding of an out-of-control federal bureaucracy, but a federal bureaucracy openly hostile to the First Amendment.

Hunter Biden’s Laptop

On Oct. 14, 2020, the New York Post published its first major exposé based on the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop, which had been dropped off at a Delaware computer repair shop in April 2019 and never picked up. It was the first of several stories detailing Biden family corruption and revealing the close involvement of Joe Biden in his son’s foreign business ventures in the years during and after Biden’s vice presidency. Hunter, although doing no real work, was making tens of millions of dollars from foreign companies in places like Ukraine and China. The Post’s bombshell reporting shined a bright light on what was happening.

According to the emails on the laptop, Hunter introduced then-Vice President Biden to a top executive at Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that was paying Hunter (who had no credentials or experience in the energy business) up to $50,000 a month to sit on its board. Soon after this meeting, Vice President Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor investigating the company.

In an earlier email, a top Burisma executive asked Hunter for “advice on how you could use your influence” to benefit the company. The Post’s ensuing stories revealed more of the same: a shocking level of corruption and influence-peddling by Hunter Biden, whose emails suggest his father was closely connected to his overseas business ventures. Indeed, those ventures appear to consist entirely of Hunter providing access to Joe Biden.

Twitter did everything in its power to suppress the Biden story. It removed links to the Post’s reporting, appended warnings that they might be “unsafe,” and prevented users from sharing them via direct message — a restriction previously reserved for child pornography and other extreme cases. In an extraordinary step, Twitter also locked the Post’s account and the accounts of people who shared links to its reporting, including White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. These actions were justified under the pretext that the stories violated Twitter’s hacked-materials policy, even though there was no evidence, then or now, that anything on the laptop was hacked.

Twitter executives at the highest levels were directly involved in these decisions. Former head of legal, policy, and trust Vijaya Gadde, the company’s chief censor, played a key role, as did former head of trust and safety Yoel Roth. Oddly, all this seems to have been done without the knowledge of Twitter’s then-CEO Jack Dorsey. And it was done despite internal pushback from other departments.

“I’m struggling to understand the policy basis for marking this as unsafe,” wrote a Twitter communications executive in an email to Gadde and Roth. “Can we truthfully claim that this is part of the policy?” asked former VP of global communications Brandon Borman. His question was answered by Deputy General Counsel Jim Baker — a former top lawyer for the FBI and the most powerful member of a growing cadre of former FBI employees working at Twitter — who said that “caution is warranted” and that some facts “indicate the materials may have been hacked.”

But there were no such facts, as Baker and other top Twitter executives knew at the time. The laptop was exactly what the Post said it was, and every fact the Post reported was accurate. Other major media outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post would begrudgingly admit as much 18 months later, after Joe Biden was ensconced in the White House.

If there were no hacked materials in the Post’s reporting, why did Twitter immediately react as if there were? Because long before the Post published its first laptop story, there had been an organized effort by the intelligence community to discredit leaked information about Hunter Biden. The laptop, after all, had been in federal custody since the previous December, when the FBI seized it from the computer repair shop. So the FBI knew very well that it contained evidence of straightforward criminal activity (such as illicit drug use) as well as of corruption and influence-peddling.

The evening before the Post ran its first story on the laptop, FBI Special Agent Elvis Chan sent 10 documents to Roth at Twitter through a special one-way communications channel the FBI had established with the company. For months, the FBI and other federal intelligence agencies had been priming Roth to dismiss news reports about Hunter Biden ahead of the 2020 election as “hack-and-leak” operations by state actors. They had done the same thing with Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted as much to Joe Rogan in an August 2022 podcast.

As Michael Shellenberger reported in the seventh installment of the “Twitter Files,” the FBI repeatedly asked Roth and others at Twitter about foreign influence operations on the platform and were repeatedly told there were none of any significance. The FBI also routinely pressured Twitter to hand over data outside the normal search warrant process, which Twitter at first resisted.

In July 2020, Chan arranged for Twitter executives to get top secret security clearances so the FBI could share intelligence about possible threats to the upcoming presidential election. The next month, Chan sent Roth information about a Russian hacking group called APT28. Roth later said that when the Post’s story about Hunter Biden’s laptop broke, “It set off every single one of my finely tuned APT28 hack-and-leak campaign alarm bells.” Even though there was never any evidence that anything on the laptop was hacked, Roth reacted to it just as the FBI had conditioned him to do, using the company’s hacked-materials policy to suppress the story as soon as it appeared, just as the agency suggested it would, less than a month before the election.

Suspending the President

The erosion of Twitter’s content moderation standards would continue after the Hunter Biden laptop scandal, reaching its apogee on Jan. 8, 2021, two days after the Capitol riot. That is when Twitter made the extraordinary decision to suspend President Trump, even though he had not violated any Twitter policies.

As the “Twitter Files” show, the suspension came amid ongoing interactions with federal agencies — interactions that were increasing in frequency in the months leading up to the 2020 election, during which Roth was meeting weekly with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. As the election neared, Twitter’s unevenly applied, rules-based content moderation policies would steadily deteriorate.

Content moderation on Twitter had always been an unstable mix of automatic enforcement of rules and subjective interventions by top executives, most of whom used Twitter’s censorship tools to diminish the reach of Trump and others on the right through shadowbanning and other means. But that was changing. As Taibbi wrote in the third installment of the “Twitter Files”:

As the election approached, senior executives — perhaps under pressure from federal agencies, with whom they met more as time progressed — increasingly struggled with rules, and began to speak of ‘vios’ [violations] as pretexts to do what they’d likely have done anyway.

After Jan. 6, Twitter jettisoned even the appearance of a rules-based moderation policy, suspending Trump for a pair of tweets that top executives falsely claimed were violations of Twitter’s terms of service. The first, sent early in the morning on Jan. 8, stated: “The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” The second, sent about an hour later, simply stated that Trump would not be attending Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20.

That same day, key Twitter staffers correctly determined that Trump’s tweets did not constitute incitement of violence or violate any other Twitter policies. But pressure kept building from people like Gadde, who wanted to know whether the tweets amounted to “coded incitement to further violence.” Some suggested that Trump’s first tweet might have violated the company’s policy on the glorification of violence. Internal discussions then took an even more bizarre turn. Members of Twitter’s “scaled enforcement team” reportedly viewed Trump “as the leader of a terrorist group responsible for violence/deaths comparable to Christchurch shooter or Hitler and on that basis and on the totality of his Tweets, he should be de-platformed.”

Later on the afternoon of Jan. 8, Twitter announced Trump’s permanent suspension “due to the risk of further incitement of violence” — a nonsense phrase that corresponded to no written Twitter policy. The suspension of a sitting head of state was unprecedented. Twitter had never taken such a step, even with heads of state in Nigeria and Ethiopia who actually had incited violence. Internal deliberations unveiled by the “Twitter Files” show that Trump’s suspension was partly justified based on the “overall context and narrative” of Trump’s words and actions — as one executive put it — “over the course of the election and frankly last 4+ years.”

That is, it was not anything Trump said or did; it was that Twitter’s censors wanted to blame the president for everything that happened on Jan. 6 and remove him from the platform. To do that, they were willing to shift the entire intellectual framework of content moderation from the enforcement of objective rules to the consideration of “context and narrative,” thereby allowing executives to engage in what amounts to viewpoint discrimination.

Private companies, of course, for the most part have the right to engage in viewpoint discrimination — something the government is prohibited from doing by the First Amendment. The problem is that when Twitter suspended Trump, it was operating less like a private company than like an extension of the federal government.

***

Among the most shocking revelations of the “Twitter Files” is the extent to which federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies came to view Twitter as a tool for censorship and narrative control. In part six of the “Twitter Files,” Taibbi chronicles the “constant and pervasive” contact between the FBI and Twitter after January 2020, “as if [Twitter] were a subsidiary.” In particular, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security wanted Twitter to censor tweets and lock accounts it believed were engaged in “election misinformation,” and would regularly send the company content it had pre-flagged for moderation, essentially dragooning Twitter into what would otherwise be illegal government censorship. Taibbi calls it a “master-canine” relationship. When requests for censorship came in from the feds, Twitter obediently complied — even when the tweets in question were clearly jokes or posted on accounts with few followers.

Some Twitter executives were unsure what to make of this relationship. Policy Director Nick Pickles at one point asked how he should refer to the company’s cooperation with federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, suggesting it be described in terms of “partnerships.” Time and again, federal agencies stressed the need for close collaboration with their “private sector partners,” using the alleged interference by Russia in the 2016 election as the pretext for a massive government surveillance and censorship regime operating from inside Twitter.

Requests for content moderation, which increasingly resembled demands, came not only from the FBI and DHS, but also from a tangled web of other federal agencies, contractors, and government-affiliated think tanks such as the Election Integrity Project at Stanford University. As Taibbi writes, the lines between government and its “partners” in this effort were “so blurred as to be meaningless.”

The Deputization of Twitter

After the 2016 election, both Twitter and Facebook faced pressure from Democrats and their media allies to root out Russian “election meddling” under the thoroughly debunked theory that a Moscow-based social media influence operation was responsible for Trump’s election victory. In reality, Russia’s supposed meddling amounted to a minuscule ad buy on Facebook and a handful of Twitter bots. But the truth was not acceptable to Democrats, the media, or the anti-Trump federal bureaucracy.

In 2017, Twitter came under tremendous pressure to “keep producing material” on Russian interference, and in response it created a Russia Task Force to hunt for accounts tied to Moscow’s Internet Research Agency. The task force did not find much. Out of some 2,700 accounts reviewed, only two came back as significant, and one of those was Russia Today, a state-backed news outlet.

But in the face of bad press and threats from Democrats in Congress, Twitter executives decided to go along with the official narrative and pretend they had a Russia problem. To placate Washington and avoid costly new regulations, they pledged to “work with [members of Congress] on their desire to legislate.” When someone in Congress leaked the list of the 2,700 accounts Twitter’s task force had reviewed, the media exploded with stories suggesting that Twitter was swarming with Russian bots — and Twitter continued to go along.

After that, as described by Taibbi, “This cycle — threatened legislation wedded to scare headlines pushed by congressional/intel sources, followed by Twitter caving to [content] moderation asks — [came to] be formalized in partnerships with federal law enforcement.”

Late in 2017, Twitter quietly adopted a new policy. In public, it would say that all content moderation took place “at [Twitter’s] sole discretion.” But its internal guidance would stipulate censorship of anything “identified by the U.S. intelligence community as a state-sponsored entity conducting cyber-operations.” Thus Twitter increasingly allowed the intelligence community, the State Department, and a dizzying array of federal and state agencies to submit content moderation requests through the FBI, which Chan suggested could function as “the belly button of the [U.S. government].” These requests would grow and intensify during the Covid pandemic and in the run-up to the 2020 election.

By 2020, there was a torrent of demands for censorship, sometimes with no explanation — just an Excel spreadsheet with a list of accounts to be banned. These demands poured in from FBI offices all over the country, overwhelming Twitter staff. Eventually the government would pay Twitter $3.4 million in compensation. It was a pittance considering the work Twitter did at the government’s behest, but the payment illustrated a stark reality: Twitter, a leading gatekeeper of the digital public square and arguably the most powerful social media platform in the world, had become a subcontractor for the U.S. intelligence community.

The “Twitter Files” have revealed or confirmed three important truths about social media and the deep state.

First, the entire concept of “content moderation” is a euphemism for censorship by social media companies that falsely claim to be neutral and unbiased. To the extent they exercise a virtual monopoly on public discourse in the digital era, we should stop thinking of them as private companies that can “do whatever they want,” as libertarians are fond of saying. The companies’ content moderation policies are at best a flimsy justification for banning or blocking whatever their executives do not like. At worst, they provide cover for a policy of pervasive government censorship.

Second, Twitter was taking marching orders from a deep state security apparatus that was created to fight terrorists, not to censor or manipulate public discourse. To the extent that the deep state is using social media companies like Twitter and Facebook to subvert the First Amendment and run information psy-ops on the American public, these companies have become malevolent government actors. As a policy matter, the hands-off, laissez-faire regulatory approach we have taken to them should come to an immediate end.

Third, the administrative state has metastasized into a destructive deep state that threatens to bring about the collapse of America’s constitutional system within our lifetimes. Emblematic of the threat is the fact that “the intelligence community” has proven itself incapable of not interfering in American elections. The FBI in particular has directly meddled in the last two presidential elections to a degree that should call into question its continued existence. Indeed, the FBI’s post-9/11 transformation from a law enforcement agency to a counter-terrorism and intelligence-gathering agency with seemingly limitless remit has been a disaster for civil liberties and the First Amendment. We need either to impose radical reforms or scrap it entirely and start over.

The late great political scientist Angelo Codevilla argued that our response to 9/11 was completely wrong. Instead of erecting a sprawling security and surveillance apparatus to detect and disrupt potential terrorist plots, we should have issued an ultimatum to the regimes that were harboring Al Qaeda: You make war on these terrorists and bring them to justice or we will make war on you. The reason not to do what we did, Codevilla argued, is that a security and surveillance apparatus powerful and pervasive enough to do what we wanted it to do was incompatible with a free society. It might defeat the terrorists, but it would eventually be turned on the American people.

The “Twitter Files” leave little doubt that Codevilla’s prediction has come to pass. The question we face now is whether the American people and their elected representatives will fight back. The fate of the republic rests on the answer.

"When Media Say Biden's Winning, They Mean He’s Radicalizing","Inside the corporate media bubble, President Joe Biden is a champ on a winning streak. From an economy that is in not quite so dire straits as it was last summer to a midterm election result that was not as disastrous as expected and the passage of massive spending bills to fund the Democrats’ pet causes on the environment and the war in Ukraine, left-wing outlets are all in agreement that everything’s coming up roses for Joe.

Every opportunity they get to reinforce this theme, including a lackluster State of the Union speech, is treated as more evidence of Biden winning. When some Republicans in the House chamber refused to sit quietly while the president smeared them as heartless politicians who want to take Social Security and Medicare away from seniors, they treated this raucous exchange not as a good opportunity for a fact-check of that collection of half-truths, fibs, and flat-out lies, but instead cited it as proof that Biden had exposed his political foes as louts and extremists.

But this Biden victory narrative is not just missing a more sober perspective that would point out that most of his alleged victories are, in fact, not so much wins as they are examples of avoiding complete disaster or outright defeats. What those touting his winning streak are really cheering is the way his administration has faithfully done the bidding of his party’s left-wing base. With his abandonment of the country’s southern border, the hijacking of legislation that was supposed to address inflation and collapsing infrastructure but instead poured funding into the Democrats’ climate change projects, and the takeover of the government by exponents of the DEI — diversity, equity, and inclusion — racialist catechism, what Biden has given Americans is more or less what they feared would be the result of a Bernie Sanders presidency.

Press Covering for the President

Though radical leftists are far from entirely satisfied with what they’ve gotten from Biden in his first 25 months, he has given them deeply consequential achievements that have, in fact, far outpaced what the left received from President Barack Obama during a similar time span at the start of his presidency.

The notion of Biden’s success is largely the result of favorable coverage. Biden’s press cheerleaders have acted as faithful bodyguards since his party rallied around him as the only plausible alternative to Donald Trump in 2020, when it seemed as if Sanders was on his way to the nomination. Despite some fleeting hiccups of journalistic integrity in which they have noticed his hypocrisy and incompetence (i.e., classified documents stored in his garage or the disgraceful rout in Afghanistan), they’ve stayed true to him. Nor have they called him out when he engaged in divisive rhetoric demonizing Republicans rather than acting on the unifying agenda he ran on.

Corporate media coverage has been a studied disinterest in dwelling on Biden’s impressive list of failures, or attempts to interpret them in ways that made them seem less bad.

Record inflation, which has been a catastrophe for middle-income and working-class Americans, was consistently dismissed as insignificant by major media outlets until it was time to start saying it was going down, an outcome that was, again, treated as a Biden win rather than a natural result of a disaster bottoming out.

Corporate Media and Democrats Unite in Gaslighting

The same networks and publications have dutifully followed administration talking points about his two great legislative victories. The 2021 “Build Back Better” and the 2022 “Inflation Reduction Act” were wins that demonstrated some remarkable discipline on the part of a Democratic Party with slim margins in both the House and the Senate. The more conservative and moderate factions of the Republican Party wage near-continuous civil war on each other. Democrats may snipe at each other, but they understand that when it comes to passing the kind of game-changing massive spending bills that can help transform America into a place that more closely resembles their nightmare leftist vision, disunity is not an option.

In both cases, Democrats understood that the labels on the legislation were a successful attempt to gaslight the public. What they passed were bills that put the full weight of the federal budget behind a radical environmental agenda that might have fallen short of New York Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal” plan but gets the country closer to it than most people understand.

The same applies to the back-and-forth on the left about the disaster at the border. Leftists can be counted on to vocally oppose even the slightest evidence of the administration enforcing immigration laws. They know that what Biden has done is essentially create the open border that the hard left has wanted for decades. This has resulted in the country being flooded by millions of illegal immigrants, resulting in a massive humanitarian disaster as well as a boost for the Mexican drug cartels that have been the engine of the opioid epidemic afflicting working-class America.

Racial Quotas

Perhaps even more significant but also far below the radar screen even for many conservatives is the opening that Biden gave his party’s intersectional left-wing base to take over the government bureaucracy. On Biden’s first day in office, he signed an executive order mandating that every government department and agency create action plans to implement the woke DEI agenda that is the embodiment of critical race theory ideas about making an obsession with race the centerpiece of American society. He followed this up with further executive orders culminating in one issued last week that mandated implementation of these plans, which are blueprints for racial quotas.

The entire idea of “equity” is a rejection of the idea of a society based on equality and inculcates a mindset that sees the goal of a color-blind society as not merely unattainable but undesirable, freezing in place race as the primary way to define individuals. This will have the sort of far-reaching effect on government allocations, hiring, and administrative actions that is nothing less than making official policy from the worst of the toxic CRT ideas promoted by racial hucksters like Ibram X. Kendi and “White Fragility” author Robin DiAngelo. Far from acting as a restraining force on the Black Lives Matter movement and the far left, Biden has been essentially recruited into its ranks.

Biden’s decisions and actions demonstrate the way the Democratic Party establishment has undergone a fundamental shift since the 1980s and ’90s. He was expected to despise his party’s radicals and their ideological obsessions. But as president, he and his inner circle wound up leaving little daylight between the White House and the rhetoric of the congressional “squad” and other hard-core leftists.

Rather than being the expression of the moderation of the Democratic Party that had governed successfully during the Clinton presidency, Biden’s White House has signaled the death of that wing of their party. Instead of cooling down political rhetoric, Biden’s claims about Republicans being “semi-fascists” and opponents of democracy fueled the continuing decline of public discourse into bitter vituperation. What the media have called a White House winning streak is just evidence that the forces that Biden was elected to resist are the ones who are winning.
