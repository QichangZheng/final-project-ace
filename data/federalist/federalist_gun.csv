"Abortion, Guns and the Shelf-Life of Wedge Issues","When the recall effort against two of the Colorado senators who passed restrictive gun control legislation heated up this year, liberal activists went to the playbook. Planned Parenthood Votes Colorado subtly described the two senators’ electoral opponents as “lifelong anti-choice, anti-women’s health advocates.” A TV ad from another group claimed they opposed “common forms of birth control” and wanted police to investigate miscarriages.

And why not? The phony “War on Women” did wonders for President Barack Obama. From the moment ABC News anchor George Stephanopolous asked Republican candidates if they thought states should be able to ban birth control, the media carried much of the Obama 2012 campaign’s water for shoring up female support.

As President Obama coasted to a 12-percentage-point victory among female voters, Democratic candidates throughout the country followed his lead, coming up with increasingly fantastical predictions about what a Republican candidate would do if elected. Female Republican voters wondered if or when Republican Party candidates would get out of their defensive crouch and begin to articulate conservative principles in a way that resonated with women and didn’t sound so apologetic. That challenge remains.

But here’s something worth noting. The “War on Women” scaremongering didn’t achieve the desired result in Colorado. From the Denver Post:

Opponents of an effort to recall two Democratic state senators for supporting stricter gun laws borrowed a page from an earlier playbook, arguing reproductive rights were in peril if the lawmakers were kicked out of office. But the message — so effective in keeping Republican Ken Buck from becoming a U.S. senator in 2010 — failed to protect Senate President John Morse and Sen. Angela Giron, who were recalled by their constituents Sept. 10.

If the “War on Women” messaging didn’t work in Pueblo, Colorado — an overwhelmingly Democratic district — on behalf of a female candidate, where does it work? And it’s not like Giron was recalled narrowly. She lost by 12 percentage points.

What Happened?

A lot happened. This was an irregular election, held in September, and without the use of mail-in ballots. The motivated voters were the ones pushing for recall. And then there’s the fact that the recalls happened in overwhelmingly Democratic strongholds populated by Roman Catholics. Planned Parenthood should have researched better whether Roman Catholic Democrats in Pueblo and Colorado Springs view protection of unborn children as a net positive or net negative. And Morse and Giron were vulnerable, both showing utter disdain for their constituents in recent years.

All that said, though, there are instructive reasons why the “War on Women” playbook failed in Colorado. One is that Colorado women aren’t like women nationally when it comes to gun rights.

Women nationwide are much more supportive of gun control than men. National Journal reported in April:

A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows that 65 percent of women favor stronger gun laws, compared to 44 percent of men. That’s consistent with previous polling; a recent Quinnipiac University poll showed 61 percent of women and 45 percent of men in favor stricter gun laws.

Americans are much more supportive of gun control in the abstract than they are actual proposals that restrict gun ownership or use. However, it’s clear that we have a huge gender gap on this issue. But while the gender gap also exists in Colorado, there’s a big difference. According to a Quinnipiac Poll of Colorado voters from August:

All voters oppose 54 – 40 percent the stricter new gun control laws which led to the recall effort. Democrats support the stricter laws 78 – 16 percent, while opposition is 89 – 7 percent among Republicans and 56 – 39 percent among independent voters. Women are divided on the stricter laws 48 – 45 percent, with men opposed 64 – 33 percent.

OK, so the gender gap is still there. But you see that Colorado women are very closely divided on the actual issue of whether governments should restrict 2nd Amendment rights. And many women in Colorado love exercising their 2nd Amendment freedoms. Gun shops, gun ranges and gun enthusiasts market toward women in Colorado. It’s not uncommon for a range to have special classes for women and to have those classes be well attended.

Women were also prominent in the battle against gun control legislation as well as the in favor of the recall effort. In fact, one of the more successful radio ads of the recall campaign featured a rape victim testifying in the legislature and asking Morse why she should be robbed of her right to defend herself. Other women’s groups deluged the airwaves talking about their right to choose how to defend themselves. The recall effort’s main public speaker was female.

Gun Rights And Women’s Rights

In other words, in Colorado, while gun control isn’t necessarily a women’s issue, gun rights is a women’s issue. This isn’t just in Colorado. Two thousand miles away, that’s what motivated Florida woman Barkha Herman to start HerRights.org, a group focused on free markets, school choice and gun rights. She explains why she started the group:

I feel very strongly that feminism has been overtaken by apologists for the left and what they’re pitching is not really women’s empowerment. Women like myself — a first-generation immigrant, career woman, wife and mother, small business owner — I feel like I’m not represented by modern feminism. I felt the need to create an organization that better represented someone like me. I wanted to illustrate that women’s issues are not all about birth control and abortion.

Herman, a self-described “Atheist, libertarian, computer scientist, Indian who enjoys cooking and entertaining,” has already run three training courses for women interested in guns (a scene from one is pictured above). Imagine how offended she’d be by ads reducing her to her reproductive organs.

The Shelf Life of Wedge Issues

Here’s another thing that makes Colorado different. The Centennial State was one of the only states where Mitt Romney closed the gender gap. In fact, Romney won more support from women than men in Colorado. That’s part of a larger story about effective organization of female voters around a broad array of issues. But part of it is because Colorado Republicans had a two-year start on the “War on Women.” “The War on Women” was born in Colorado. It worked, contributing to Ken Buck’s defeat in a close election. After that, it was rolled out nationwide.

But three years, now, of being constantly reduced to nothing more than an empty womb is tiring. Women in Colorado became less and less receptive to hearing outlandish stories about how Republicans were monsters-go-boom-in-the-night. The belittling and condescending message lost its appeal. In a word, it became tiresome.

There’s a lesson in this for campaign strategists of all stripes. Wedge issues are effective manipulative tools for turning given elections. They’re less effective in the long run. Ask Karl Rove. His 2004 campaign for President George W. Bush included a Get Out The Vote effort capitalizing off of state-based efforts to retain traditional marriage. It worked for a time. Brilliantly so. Now it’s something of an albatross around Republican necks.

The “War on Women” works in the short-term. In the long-run, it requires a populace that views pregnancy as a disease instead of a blessing. It necessitates the constant stoking of grudges against men. And it only works if women are not allowed to have their own thoughts about guns, economic prosperity, education and every other challenge facing Americans. It only works if women aren’t considered full participants in the political process.

And more broadly, overhyping hot-button issues is a short-term electoral strategy that discourages both Republicans and Democrats from campaigning on substantive policy. Americans have many important problems to confront, and wedge issue politics are a distraction we can’t afford to indulge.

"Sorry, But Owning A Gun Is An Individual Right","Of all the Constitutional debates to be had in modern America, there is very possibly none more given to incoherent statements than those surrounding the Second Amendment. It is true that big government types are given to bizarre, expansive interpretations of the Interstate Commerce Clause, say, or the General Welfare clause; but these are arguments based more or less in degree, not in kind. “What constitutes interstate commerce?” is where you must begin debating the former, for instance, and from there you can go just about anywhere (and, as the grotesque specter of Obamacare illustrates, many people will). We can criticize the rampant statism to be found in an enormously-broad definition of “commerce,” but at least it kind of makes sense. If you’re given to mangling the English language, anyway.

The Second Amendment is different. It reads: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” One may have to read it twice to understand it, but that’s about all it should take. It is remarkable in its straightforwardness: the people retain a right to arm themselves, and that right shall not be infringed. What constitutes “infringement,” is, like debating the eccentricities of commerce, a necessary debate to be had. But no sensible debate about the Second Amendment can begin without first acknowledging the fact that it guarantees an individual right to firearms, and without first acknowledging how plainly obvious that is.

Such a debate is a nice idea, anyway. There is still a large amount of the American body politic that is under the impression that the Second Amendment doesn’t mean what it means. The presence of the word “militia” in the first clause is, to these people, the end-all-be-all of the entire text: the constitutional provision that clearly guarantees an individual right evidently does no such thing, even though it does. I do not mean to make light of many peoples’ well-intentioned and passionate beliefs regarding the Second Amendment, but quite simply, there is a wrong way and a right way to look at it. And a great many people, those who cleave to the militia clause contained therein, are wrong.

The reigning anti-individualist interpretation to the Second Amendment is one in which the text grants a right to governments, not people; it is, in the words of the ACLU, a “collective right,” which presumably means a government “right.”

The reigning anti-individualist interpretation to the Second Amendment is one in which the text grants a right to governments, not people; it is, in the words of the ACLU, a “collective right,” which presumably means a government “right.” One school of thought holds that it grants states the right to maintain militias, in order to provide a militaristic check against otherwise-unchecked federal power. The other holds that the Second Amendment places the burden upon the Federal government to uphold states’ militias—again in order to ensure that states will have localized defenses against a centralized standing army. Both are wrong on a functional level, because both ignore extant and binding clauses within the Constitution itself—and the second is such a wacky explanation that one struggles to know where to begin.

For starters, the states themselves are forbidden from keeping troops without the consent of Congress—period, with no exceptions. That’s in Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution. There has never been any evidence that the Second Amendment changed this. Indeed, the Federal government’s own records contradict this. Every provision of the original Constitution that has been changed by subsequent amendments is highlighted to show such a change. In some texts an altered clause is marked with an asterisk; in others, in brackets. On the government’s own website it is noted: “Items [in the Constitution] that are hyperlinked have since been amended or superseded.”

And yet the provision that bans states from keeping troops shows no such demarcation—not on archives.gov, and not in any physical copy of the Constitution across which I’ve come. If the Second Amendment truly allows states to maintain their own militias—if it confers a “right” upon which the Federal government cannot infringe—then the editors of every copy of the Constitution over the last couple of centuries have been mercilessly sloppy.

Similarly, the Constitution has never been edited to suggest that the Federal government has the duty to maintain state militias; Article 1, Section 8 of the document still maintains that the Federal government may do whatever it pleases regarding the militia, and with no duties or responsibilities attached. If the feds were truly required to provide for state militias, then where is the change that reflects this reality? There isn’t one, because they’re not required to do so, and they never have been.

An an otherwise-noble quest to try and reduce the amount of gun violence in modern America, the anti-gun lobby often indulges in any number of bizarre political contortions in order to get its point across.

And with good reason: how on earth could a federally-sponsored militia somehow protect against the federal government? That would be like allowing a violent criminal to dictate the manner and execution of a restraining order taken out against him. People who claim that the Second Amendment guarantees states the “right” to a militia from Washington seem to think that the American people are supposed to seek security and protection against a tyrannical government from the tyrannical government itself. How on earth would this work?

If we’re to take the “collective right” explanation on its face, then the Second Amendment created a right that the states are powerless to execute, that the Federal government has no duty to provide, and that would be useless and oxymoronic if the latter did so anyway. If one spends five minutes thinking about the “collective right” theory, it quickly becomes apparent that the individual right is the only one that can possibly function appropriately, and is thus the only right that the amendment was ever intended to protect. To put it bluntly, the “collective right” approach makes no sense.

It does to some people, however. In an otherwise-noble quest to try and reduce the amount of gun violence in modern America, the anti-gun lobby often indulges in any number of bizarre political contortions in order to get its point across. Lowering the number of gun deaths in the United States—a number that is dismayingly high—should be any right-thinking, sensible person’s priorities. Yet we shouldn’t indulge in bizarre historical and linguistic psychoses in pursuit of that laudable end. The Second Amendment guarantees an individual right—subject to reasonable regulation and control, of course, but individual nonetheless. The only way to change this reality is to amend the Constitution again. Then, at least, the anti-gun crowd would be honest; but then again, they would probably lose in the attempt. Which makes it clear why they resort to falsehoods instead.

A Reddit Gun Lover Has A Hilarious Present For Anti-Gun Mother Jones,"If there’s one thing the anti-gun zealots at Mother Jones hate, it’s firearms in the hands of law-abiding American citizens. If there’s another thing Mother Jones hates, it’s probably the ability of those same law-abiding citizens to manufacture their own means of self-defense from the comfort of their own homes via a 3D printer.

One gun lover at reddit decided to 3D-print his own homage to Mother Jones: a homemade lower receiver for an AR-15-style rifle, complete with serial number. And just for kicks, he made sure the serial number matched the phone number for the main office at Mother Jones. The redditor even printed the Mother Jones logo on the receiver.

The redditor posted the picture of the Mother Jones-themed lower receiver in response to an article Mother Jones published, entitled “How Reddit Became a Gun Market—and Authorized Its Logo on Assault Rifles.”

Since 2011, part of the popular online forum Reddit has grown into an active marketplace for assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, and other powerful firearms, according to an investigation by Mother Jones. In the last six months alone there have been more than 1,000 listings posted by more than 400 Redditors on the GunsForSale subreddit, one of thousands of niche communities on the sprawling discussion site. Not only has Reddit allowed a gun market to thrive, it has also literally put its stamp on it: Gun purchases brokered through the site have included nearly 100 AR-15s engraved with Reddit's alien logo, which was used on the assault rifles with explicit permission from the company—while it was owned by media giant Condé Nast—according to email correspondence obtained by Mother Jones.

After Mother Jones published its article, “WarFairy” posted a thread of his own at reddit, entitled “In honor of Mother Jones’ article, I present the Mother Jones 3D printable AR-15 Lower Receiver.”

“Bonus points to the person that figures out what the serial number means,” WarFairy wrote.

“Since this has generated so much interest, I figure I might as well plug the project. To everyone that is interested in printing firearms, you don’t have to go it alone! Swing by the FOSSCAD chat room for the latest MegaPack containing all of my and many other designer’s firearm and accessory files, as well as tech support for printers of all shapes, flavors and sizes,” WarFairy added after the thread began to garner attention.

Another commenter in the thread, in reference to the Mother Jones phone number/serial number on the 3D-printed lower receiver, offered a helpful script for those who might want to call the number to ask if the Mother Jones article itself was facilitating private gun sales via reddit:

I've prepared a script for you guys. ""Hello, is this Mother Jones? I'm a user of Reddit, I have a few questions. Can you confirm that you are a journalist? What is your license number? How much revenue do you generate from ad views on Mother Jones? Rather than writing journalism for another group, why do you write for a gun proliferation organization such as Mother Jones? How is it different from DailyKOS, Slate, Armslist, or GunBroker? What portion of your personal income originates from ad revenue or salary from Mother Jones? Why do people buy and sell firearms on Mother Jones? Will you voluntarily decline all ad revenue generated from page views on the recent piece where, for approximately 12 hours, you facilitated the unfettered purchase of at least 3 AR-15 combat assault rifles of murder war and a Glock 17 undetectable plastic gun? Can you document the destruction of this ad revenue and present it to federal authorities? If no sale took place, can you furnish proof?"" We can has journalism too!

At least one commenter in the reddit thread claimed to have used the comments section in the Mother Jones article to sell several rifle magazines that he had been trying to sell at reddit for over a year.

“[I]t’s easier to sell than on reddit,” the commenter wrote. “I just unloaded my last uzi mags on mother jones 5 hours ago. [I]’ve had them posted on reddit for over a year with no takers[.]”",https://thefederalist.com/2014/01/09/a-reddit-gun-lover-has-a-hilarious-present-for-anti-gun-mother-jones/,2014-01-09
"If Guns Cause of More Crime, Why Isn't There More Of It?","Last week I reiterated what most people already know and what the Supreme Court has upheld multiple times—that, in contrast to the “collective rights” model of the Second Amendment, owning a firearm is an individual right. It might have been worth it to write something else, if only because the FBI recently hammered the point home itself: 2013 counted the most background checks for firearm purchases since 1998, when the National Instant Criminal Background Check System went into place.

The FBI’s report doesn’t tell the whole story. Reportedly, household gun ownership has declined to a record low of 34%; yet, in contrast, another poll showed nearly 50% of houses self-reported having a gun on the property. In any event, it remains that America still has the highest rate of private gun ownership in the world.

Yet where’s the exploding crime rate? The gun control lobby has been claiming for years that the more guns in private hands, the more gun violence we’ll see; the perennial hyperventilation is given to fears of a kind of Wild West America of lawless anarchy, wherein every gun owner is prepared to shoot from the hip at the first sign of danger.

Well. Last year the Department of Justice released a report revealing that firearm homicides declined nearly 40% between 1993 and 2011, and nonfatal firearm injuries declined nearly 70% within the same time period. Every year since 2002 has seen a rise in the number of NICS background checks performed, yet in 2011 the firearm homicide rate was lower than it was in 2002; in fact, all firearm violence, both fatal and nonfatal, was lower the former year than the latter.

The United States retains the highest rate of civilian gun ownership on the planet, and it maintains the highest number per capita of gun homicides in the developed world—which is enough to convince gun controllers that civilian gun ownership is a failed experiment that needs to be scrapped. Yet curiously enough, the gun controllers never seem to notice—or else they’re plainly ignoring—the baffling cases of countries like Brazil, a nation that has nearly twenty times less the amount of civilian-owned guns as the United States, yet has nearly triple the amount of gun homicides. (Of course, Brazil isn’t part of the “developed” world, so it generally isn’t lumped in with first-world countries like the United States—a useful divider when one is attempting to ignore inconvenient facts).

So what gives? Why do we have more guns in private hands, yet less gun violence? Why do some countries with drastically lower gun ownership nonetheless have grossly higher gun violence rates? However we might propose to lessen the amount of gun violence in the United States, it is plainly self-evident that the simple equation of “Less Guns, Less Crime” doesn’t really add up, not in this country, and not when we’ve seen more guns and less crime over the past few decades. If we’re going to reduce gun homicides in the United States, the solution must necessarily be more complicated than the honest but uninformed notions that have colored the gun control movement for the past twenty years or so.

Advancing on a single issue

With that in mind, there is every reason for gun rights advocates to be wholly suspicious of the even moderate encroachments upon America’s gun freedoms that frequently arise. While this columnist was last week bloviating about the individual right to own a gun, California’s legislature did me one better and proposed background checks for ammunition purchases. According to state senator Kevin de Leon:

“The ammunition is the fuel that feeds the violence. The gun itself…is the delivery device. The gas, the fuel, is the ammunition, and no one knows who buys it.”

From a purely stylistic point of view, one has to concede that this is a dramatically muddled and sloppy metaphor. Violence is committed, for one, not fed; it is an act, not a set of circumstances. Yet even if we concede the senator that bizarre rhetorical device, his characterization of a gun is a real head scratcher—it’s a “delivery device” for “fuel” that “feeds violence.” What does this really even mean?

In any event, the rationale for ammunition background checks is tenuous: in 2012, the Sacramento Police Department “reported that it had tracked 349 people prohibited from owning firearms who nonetheless purchased ammunition.” We don’t learn if these people ever ended up using the ammunition to commit gun violence, and indeed we’re not given any compelling evidence that background checks for ammunition has any negative effect on gun violence rates.

It’s a mark of the lobby’s anti-gun devotion that the major gun control proposal of last year—a dramatic expansion of background checks mandated by Washington—would not have stopped massacres like those that occurred at Newtown, Tucson or Aurora.

But the gun control lobby doesn’t really need compelling evidence, or really much evidence at all, to justify gun legislation of any kind. It’s a mark of the lobby’s anti-gun devotion that the major gun control proposal of last year—a dramatic expansion of background checks mandated by Washington—would not have stopped massacres like those that occurred at Newtown, Tucson or Aurora. Even successful legislation like the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 dealt primarily with cosmetic features, did not outlaw any weapons manufactured prior to the passage of the law, and didn’t end up having a measurable effect on violent crime rates.

So why the ineffective, inconclusive and seemingly-pointless legislation? As economics professor Walter Williams put it, laws that strip Americans of their fundamental liberties “are always advanced as a single issue.” There’s every reason to believe that politicians and pundits might honestly recognize that mandated background checks for ammunition won’t have much of an effect on crime—yet they know that once Californians, say, have become comfortable with such a law, it will then becomes much easier to pass another, more restrictive law. Gun controllers, for instance, are ceaselessly lecturing gun owners about how under the National Firearms Act of 1934 we effectively cannot own fully automatic weapons, thereby stipulating that gun rights are subject to some limitations. But the NFA’s prohibition on automatic weapons does not ipso facto legitimize any other firearm law—and more importantly, the NFA does not ipso facto legitimize the NFA.

A self-referential appeal to authority hardly justifies a government to continually strip its citizens of their rights. But for many people, it’s a perfectly reasonable justification, which is why little piecemeal maneuvers such as California’s ammunition law are so troubling: if it passes, we can expect a kind of legislative stare decisis a few years down the road, where a new gun control measure cites ammo background checks as an authority. As we’ve seen, gun violence is a complicated and critical issue that deserves a great deal of thought, but our commitment to making America safer should not come at the cost of our vital liberties—and we should be aware of the little but significant efforts to take those vital liberties away.

The Gospel According To Bloomberg,"So the prophet Bloomberg descended from his penthouse in Upper East Side Jerusalem and spoke to the crowd gathered before him. “I have been given a message from God on how you can earn your way into Heaven.”

“We have heard of the one called Jesus,” said one of the crowd, “and that we need to follow Him to receive salvation.”

Bloomberg shook his head. “No. This is much more practical than that. For God has told me what He hates the most: unhealthy living. Like eating lots of fatty foods.”

“We saw you pigging out at a feast right before you came out here,” another in the crowd said.

Bloomberg scoffed. “Don’t worry about me; I know what I’m doing. But other people — they’re going to get fat and unhealthy, and we have to do something about them. When you stop people from having too much salt or sugar or from being able to smoke anywhere, then you will earn your way into Heaven.”

“So the key to getting to Heaven is pestering people about minor things?” one woman asked.

“I think what he’s saying,” a man in the crowd said, “is that to please God, we need to go out and make people choose healthier habits.”

Bloomberg shook his head. “No. That’s wrong. There should be no choice. We need to get the government involved. We rendered unto Caesar, so now Caesar needs to get down here and prevent people from having access to unhealthy things.”

“That sounds a bit beneath his concern,” said one of the people.

“No. This is exactly what a good government should be involved in. For one thing, we need him to come in and prohibit vendors from selling large sodas.”

The people looked confused. “What’s a soda?”

“It’s a sugary drink that’s carbonated — has bubbles in it,” Bloomberg explained.

“That sounds neat,” one man said. “Where can I get one?”

“They’re not healthy,” Bloomberg warned. “We don’t want them.”

“So you’re saying soda is unclean?” asked another man.

“Yes… if it’s in a container larger than sixteen ounces,” Bloomberg said. “We need to make sure soda is only sold in small cups.”

“Can’t someone just get two small cups if he wants to drink a lot of soda?” a woman asked.

“No. That’s impractical,” Bloomberg answered. “Then he’d have a soda in each hand. No one is going to do that.”

The crowd considered his words. “And you’re sure God said this?”

“Moving on, I want to talk about an even more important topic,” Bloomberg announced. “The thing God despises the most: guns.”

Again the crowd was confused at his words. “What’s a gun?”

“Well… it’s like a sword. But it makes a loud noise and can stab someone from really far away.”

“That sounds awesome!” one man said. “I want a gun!”

“No!” Bloomberg shouted. “You do not want one! They are awful. One day the streets will be full of violent people running around with guns and shooting people.”

The crowd thought about this. “Why will you have all these violent people who want to hurt others?” one woman asked. “It sounds like no one is addressing the root cause of the violence.”

Bloomberg shook his head. “Don’t worry about that. We’re talking about the guns right now.”

“It sounds like we need guns so we can defend ourselves against these people,” someone said.

“No. That’s a horrible idea,” Bloomberg replied. “You all need to give up your guns, and then hopefully we can also get the guns from the violent criminals, too.”

“So you’re saying that if we put down our guns in an act of faith,” one woman said, “then God will protect us from the guns of criminals?”

“Well, not necessarily God,” Bloomberg said. “But if you have a problem with an armed criminal, the police will be there to help in ten to twenty minutes. It’s a good system, and it works.”

The people thought about this. “So where does one buy a gun?”

“You’re not getting it!” Bloomberg shouted. “Let me tell you a parable: A man was going on a journey and called his three servants to him. He gave each of them some talents. The first traded and increased his talents. So did the second servant. But the third servant used his talents to pay for someone to distribute scrolls attacking officials opposed to gun control. And while ultimately the official most opposed to gun control was appointed governor, at least the wise servant laid the groundwork to eventually get things moving on the issue of guns.”

The crowd considered the prophet’s words. “I don’t think you know what a parable is.”

“So how does one carbonate a beverage?” asked one of the people.

The Pharisees then came to question the prophet Bloomberg. “Do you really think you’re helping anyone with this?”

“I’m very popular, and I’m doing good work,” Bloomberg assured them.

“Haven’t you noticed how all your former disciples are distancing themselves from you, as you’re not… you know… polling very well?”

Bloomberg shook his head. “I haven’t noticed anything.”

“We’ll just be frank with you,” said the Pharisees. “Maybe in one small coastal area of Israel you were actually the best possible prophet they could get — which is such a sad commentary that you’d think people should flee that place and not look back lest they turn into pillars of salt — but in middle Israel — you know, caravan-over country — everyone hates your guts. They think you’re an annoying, out-of-touch, arrogant little jerk. Do you understand?”

Bloomberg seemed to snap out of a trance. “Sorry. I didn’t hear a word you just said, because I was thinking about how good the work is that I’m doing and how everyone loves me. Now, I need to continue to spread my message, as I got these words straight from God.”

The Pharisees looked skeptical. “Did you?”

“Well, I wrote them,” Bloomberg admitted. “But when I looked at them, I said to myself, ‘This is definitely what God would say… if there is a God.'”

So Bloomberg ignored the doubts of the crowd and the Pharisees and gave his next sermon to a mirror, where it was received with much adulation.

America’s Elites Love Fearmongering About Gun Policy,"For all its braggadocio about being the political faction dedicated to “science” and reason and fact-driven opinion and intelligence, the elitist Left is remarkably uneducated and illiterate when it comes to firearms. It is common knowledge that progressives are prone to using terms like “military-style assault weapon” without grasping what such terms even mean; it is equally well-known that they are unable to grasp firearm terminology to the point where they can tell the difference between a magazine and a clip. It is unsurprising in a sense that the Left would not deign to use or even learn the nomenclature of guns, given that they view firearms as antediluvian throwbacks to the days before the Left figured out nobody needed firearms. And yet the full-blown inability for progressives to understand guns must go beyond mere contempt and disdain for the devices: there is a willfulness in the Left’s ignorance, a deliberate avoidance on their part of accuracy, reality and rigorous thought.

Such was on display on a recent episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, on which the titular host and his panelists went on a predictable and predictably-uninformed rant against both guns and the Second Amendment. Recently, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens declared that the Second Amendment should be edited to read, in part, “The right of the People to keep and bear arms when serving in a militia shall not be infringed.” For years, and ever-more vociferously since 2008’s excellent D.C. v. Heller Supreme Court decision, progressives have held that the Second Amendment established not an individual right to “keep and bear” firearms, but a “collective” right that tied firearm ownership directly to service in a state militia—hence Justice Stevens’s desire to make the distinction explicit.

“This is the original intent of the Second Amendment,” Maher declared.

That is an utter falsehood. It is questionable why someone with the obvious intelligence of Bill Maher would ever utter such an incorrect, ahistorical and easily refutable a proposition. I have written in these pages before of the individual right that is self-evidently contained within the Second Amendment. As I wrote, a simple textual analysis of the Constitution makes this clear, and it would take the average reader no more than 15 minutes to do so. We must assume that Bill Maher has read the Constitution. It would be improbable for him to have managed to avoid doing so up to this point. Allowing for that assumption, then, the only reasonable explanation is that Maher knows that the “collective right” theory of the Second Amendment is wrong, and he simply chooses to believe otherwise.

This theory would seem dubious if not for the fact that the Left counts among its philosophical pillars the notion that an armed citizenry is a bad citizenry—or more accurately, that the government is the correct and appropriate dispenser of self-defense and personal protection. A body politic of gun-toting freeborn citizens simply does not square with the progressive worldview; it apportions sovereignty and authority too broadly among the citizenry, and divides self-sufficiency in ways that make authoritarians distinctly uncomfortable. There is no Second Amendment in North Korea. “Why do you need a gun?” is a common question from the Left, as if needs determine rights or as if the Left’s hostility toward, and often-outright fear of, guns means nobody should have them. If the Left acknowledges that the individual right to own firearms is explicitly codified into our Constitution, they then must admit that they have lost not merely the political battle, but the philosophical one as well. From the get-go, we have not only been a nation of gun owners, but a gun owner nation, not merely possessing the natural right to self-defense but the chartered right as well: that right “shall not be infringed,” blithering about the militia be damned. To be perfectly fair, don’t we all sometimes wish to deny things such as these, when they are so devastating to our worldview?

If progressives are unable to confront the legal and Constitutional realities that are part and parcel of the civic and governmental fabric of the United States, they are equally-unable to review and process the modern-day, straightforward, unbiased statistics regarding guns and gun laws. On the same edition of Real Time, Bill Maher’s panel guest John Avlon, the editor-in-chief of The Daily Beast, reflected on the most recent “guns everywhere” law in Georgia which expands carry zones throughout the state: “Guns in bars? I mean, what could possibly go wrong?”

That’s a great question! If Avlon had mustered the gumption to do a little research, he would have perhaps seen the aftermath of Virginia’s passage of a similar “guns in bars” law a few years ago: crimes at bars dropped. “What could possibly go wrong?” In Virginia, less went wrong. It apparently did not occur to John Avlon to look at different states’ experiences with similar laws, if only because the progressive worldview does not demand one back up one’s anti-gun convictions with actual data or facts. All that is required is that you hate firearms and steadfastly ignore or deny any inconvenient truths regarding them. Why look into it any further?

Give him credit, Avlon certainly knows how to hire them. Over at the Daily Beast, in the wake of the “guns everywhere” bill, columnist Cliff Schecter declared that it “doesn’t matter that this legislation flies in the face of all public health statistics, common sense, and modernity. Or that more people will now die.” His evidence that “more people will now die?” A study that showed “widespread American gun ownership is fueling America’s gun violence epidemic.” Never mind that this claim is entirely dubious: the Georgia bill has nothing to do with owning guns and everything to do with carrying them. Gun ownership is totally and completely immaterial to the new Georgia law, but Schecter does not care that he cannot even craft a coherent argument: all he wants you to know is that guns are bad and we should be afraid of them.

These are not isolated incidences; they are not infrequent. Those of us who are familiar with guns and appreciative of the Second Amendment’s immense importance to maintaining a healthy republic are, by now, used to the tiresome liberal tendency to remain woefully uneducated about firearms. Nevertheless, it is still troublesome to witness how frequently and aggressively wrong they are on the subject, and how easily they can misguide the uninformed. Why shouldn’t they? After all, the ultimate aim of the anti-gun left is near-total civilian disarmament, and for that they will need to confuse as many people as they possibly can. A populace blinded to its natural God-given rights, and without the ability to defend itself: what could possibly go wrong?

I Lived A Completely Gun-Free Life — Until Now,"We just became a Second Amendment family. For the first time in my life, my home contains an object that is, by the manufacturer’s intent, a deadly weapon.

I received fair warning that this would happen. Even before we were married, my husband announced his general intention to own a gun. A year or so back he started researching the topic more earnestly, and then one afternoon there was a gun sitting on my kitchen table. It was unloaded, of course. We had extensive conversations about trigger locks and all the other safety measures. I know that the kids can’t get it, and are in fact far more likely to be injured by stairs or cleaning solutions or sporting equipment. Intuitively it still feels like a menace.

The thing is, I don’t come from a gun-happy culture. Apart from my husband, I doubt any of my near relations have experience with firearms. Mind you, I was raised by conservatives, but Mormons trend towards a communitarian, good-government brand of conservatism. They’re rarely drawn to the more suspicious and individualistic culture of the N.R.A. If my parents had any gun-owning friends when I was growing up, I wasn’t aware.

Thus, I can tell you how it feels when you’ve lived a completely gun-free life, and suddenly have a gun under your roof. Your instincts tell you: we don’t need it. It’s threatening. Bad things happen to people who own guns.

I’m pretty sure this instinct is dramatically reinforced by the violence-drenched entertainment that we (like most Americans) consume in considerable quantities. This might seem counter-intuitive, especially to men, but psychologically it feels to me like the obvious dividing line between the world of television (in which people regularly die horrible deaths) and the world I live in (in which they don’t) is the presence of guns. Leave guns alone and they’ll leave me alone, or so my subconscious tells me. It’s worked for me so far.

There’s a reason I’m admitting to all of this. It’s a kind of public service.

There’s a reason I’m admitting to all of this. It’s a kind of public service. See, I’m pretty sure gun-hating liberals have similar feelings to mine, but unlike me, they don’t see it as a matter of personal psychology. Instead they want to codify those feelings into more formal arguments. In their minds we have Gun America and No-Gun America, and the bad stuff happens in the first one.

Statistics play an enormous role in liberal arguments against guns. They point out that gun-happy states have higher murder rates, and that personal firearms are statistically unlikely to be used to fend off a home intruder, but are far more likely to be used in suicide or domestic violence. Rightly lamenting that there is too much gun violence in our society, liberals point fingers at “gun culture,” as though this is a single, monolithic phenomenon. They sometimes go so far as to suggest that having guns itself actually erodes character.

The statistical arguments are distasteful, at least insofar as the point is to urge individual people not to own guns. That’s not because I have an aversion to reality. Statistics have their place. But there’s a fundamental problem with using a statistic to convince a particular person not to own a tool. It’s succinctly expressed in the familiar N.R.A. slogan: “Guns don’t kill people; people kill people.”

Liberals hate this phrase. They’ve spilled buckets of ink trying to dismiss it. But their arguments aren’t effective, because they make the mistake of assuming that gun supporters are using the expression as a verbal weapon, flippantly shrugging off responsibility for their firearms and their vicious, destructive “gun culture.”

Serious gun owners do take responsibility for their firearms.

That’s not really what’s happening, at least among morally serious supporters of the Second Amendment. Serious gun owners do take responsibility for their firearms. They want guns as a means to standing up to the wanton violence that is a real problem in our society. People kill people, and so, if you’re not the sort of person who would do that, it might be beneficial for you to have a gun.

As a statistical matter, it’s not remotely surprising that people with guns are more likely to be involved in gun-related tragedies. In this world there are evil people, as well as some who are dangerously unstable. Guns considerably worsen the damage those people can do. That being the case, gun owners should of course think very seriously about who could possibly have access to their weapons. Trigger locks and other safety features notwithstanding, my husband and I agreed that we would remove any and all firearms from the house, should we ever have a depressed or unstable teenager.

Gun violence is not some mysterious malady that simply befalls us against our will, like a cancer or a natural disaster.

As individuals, though, we can transcend statistics. Gun violence is not some mysterious malady that simply befalls us against our will, like a cancer or a natural disaster. When you think about it, it would be ridiculously insulting to tell a responsible, loving father of three that he shouldn’t own a firearm because he’s far more likely to use it to kill his wife than to protect his family.

Liberal arguments against guns tend to presume the worst: that a yearning for gun ownership must in some way be rooted in the desire to hurt. But gun culture at its best is rooted in a desire to protect, and especially to protect the people we love. Even for those who are unlikely to need deadly force for that purpose, there can still be significance to having the capacity. The point isn’t that the police are untrustworthy. Part of the point is that the police can’t be everywhere at once. Even more importantly, though, fathers naturally feel on a deep level that they, not the state, are the primary protectors of their families.

It’s distressing that people so often fail to take this seriously. A relative was appalled that my husband would want a gun “with little kids in the house.” It didn’t seem to occur to her that that was precisely why he wanted it; as a bachelor he never worried about such things. Now he feels responsible for the safety of our children, and for my safety. Reflecting on the matter, I realized that I too implicitly assign him that role. If we were woken in the night by the sounds of an intruder, and he asked me to go check it out, I’d definitely feel betrayed.

But gun culture at its best is rooted in a desire to protect, and especially to protect the people we love.

Given that fact, I guess I have to respect his wish to own a gun. I did jokingly suggest that we could protect ourselves more effectively by filling our property with Second Amendment bumper stickers and yard signs. Since we live in an intensely liberal neighborhood, we’d definitely pay a social price for that. But if you were a burglar scoping out possible marks, would you choose the one house on the block that appeared to be owned by N.R.A. zealots? Probably not.

Truthfully though, we’re probably just the sort of people who should own a gun. We have no history of violence. We don’t take the responsibility lightly. We’re likely the only people on the block with a firearm in the house, so if emergency neighborhood protection should ever be required, we’re it.

And on some level, I wouldn’t really want my sons growing up with the Gun vs. No-Gun paradigm. I want them to be the sort of men who protect their families. I want them to see the distinction between embracing violence, accepting it and opposing it. I like the idea that taking care of people will mean more to them than just calling the professionals.

So that’s another Constitutional freedom exercised. If any troops should be looking for quarters, don’t come knocking. I’m on a roll this week.

"Gun Control Won’t Work, But Ammo Control Could","Firms and tinkerers have improved 3D printed weapons greatly since Cody Wilson first fired the Liberator in 2013. The Liberator is the first fully 3D-printed (except for the firing pin), single-shot, smooth-bore, underpowered pistol made from ABS plastic, the same material used in Legos. Just as the Internet mockery of the Liberator began to die down, 3D printing company Solid Concepts printed a workable metallic M1911—the most beloved American handgun. The sale of metal 3D printers is up and their prices are falling rapidly, which means it’s only a matter of time before gun control is rendered obsolete, and ammunition control becomes the anti-gun lobby’s focus.

Most gun aficionados view 3D printed guns as unreliable novelties. Large-gun firearm manufacturers haven’t developed breaches, bolts, barrels, or gas systems out of polymers because they lack the strength, hardness, or high melting point of steel. Polymers can melt or crack at temperatures a firearm may reach inside, causing it to fail. For that reason, store-bought quality firearms cannot be printed at home—yet.

3D printed lower receivers, however, are a reality. Lower receivers house the smaller moving parts, like the trigger assembly, in firearms such as the AR-15. They are also regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) as a firearm. Lower receivers can be made of polymers because they aren’t exposed to the heat from firing rounds.

How to Circumvent Gun Control

3D printing is just one way people could theoretically circumvent gun control laws. Loopholes in gun control regulations have prompted some businesses to start selling lower receivers that are only 80 percent complete, requiring the purchaser to finish assembling the additional 20 percent. Selling 80 percent receivers (sometimes with instructions on how to complete them) circumvents gun laws and registration in some states like California. After all, the state can’t require anyone buying a billet of steel to register it as a firearm—that would defeat the purpose of registration—so selling the components separately or partly manufactured is one way around gun laws.

ATF recently raided Ares Armory for selling 80 percent receivers because they refused to turn over lists of their customers. Suppose the government forces all 80 percent receivers to be registered. Retailers will start selling, say, 70 percent receivers with instructions, and the resulting race to the bottom will make the registration laws worthless. Ironically, cracking down on 80 percent, 70 percent, or whatever percent new regulations decree must be registered will only turn customers toward 3D printing lower receivers instead. And that’s already happening.

Wanted: A Few Good Bullets

Technological innovation and circumventing gun control legislation leaves only one path toward control guns: ammunition control. The New York SAFE Act has already begun to move in that direction. By restricting ammunition sales, registering it, requiring a license, or raising prices, states might effectively enact gun control by controlling ammunition. After all, what good is a firearm without the bullets?

Restriction of ammunition supply is already happening. Ammunition prices have already spiked in recent years, as have gun sales, leading to dramatic shortages every gun owner notices when browsing at the store. Ammo stockpiling from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other agencies like the U.S. Post Office is not reducing the demand, either. The AFT has already moved in this direction by banning some surplus ammunition imports from Russia.

By definition, polymers, or even metal, cannot be 3D printed into gun powder. The components of gun powder are easily subject to regulations, and 3D printers don’t produce granulated powder. In other words, home production of ammunition would require workarounds and technological innovations which do not yet exist.

People should oppose gun control restrictions and registration requirements, but we shouldn’t let these turn our eyes from the existential threat of ammunition control. If ammunition printing ever becomes as cheap and effective as printing firearms parts currently is, then we can all rest assured that the right to keep and bear arms will never again be as infringed as it is today. Until that day comes, ammunition controls may be the most effective form of gun control.

"If You Want To Ban Guns, Just Say So","While answering a few questions on Tumblr this week, President Obama informed participants that “our levels of gun violence are off the charts.” He claimed that it was incomprehensible that congress hadn’t reacted to overwhelming public opinion and passed legislation to expand gun background checks, adding that nations like Australia had long ago enacted sensible gun control laws to stop mass shootings:

Couple of decades ago, Australia had a mass shooting, similar to Columbine or Newtown. And Australia just said, well, that’s it, we’re not doing it, we’re not seeing that again, and basically imposed very severe, tough gun laws, and they haven’t had a mass shooting since.

This isn’t the first time Obama has brought up Australian gun control laws. He did so after the Navy Yard DC shooting, as well. Actually, on the left, Australian laws are frequently cited as a way to limit shooting rampages — perhaps get rid of them altogether. A few years ago, Nicholas Kristof, after mischaracterizing the law, recommended that it should be the “road map” for United States policy.

What are they talking about here? Longer wait times? Banning “assault weapons”? Not really. In 1996, after a ghastly massacre at Port Arthur, the Australian government passed firearms regulations that banned ownership of almost all semiautomatic weapons, all self-loading rifles and shotguns, and instituted strict restrictions on all sale of ammunition for the weapons. A person can own a gun if they can demonstrate to the state that he has a “genuine reason” for having one – and “self-defense” is not considered a legitimate basis for ownership. Australia proceeded to run a buyback program that lasted nearly a year, in which time the government ended up paying citizens for 640,000 prohibited firearms. It was, in other words, a massive confiscation of guns.

You may believe this sounds like a constructive idea. A person doesn’t have to live in a survivalist bunker to understand that a sizable number of Americans are perplexed or appalled by the idea of average Americans walking into a store and buying a Glock or a shotgun. I know lots of these people. So why do we keep acting like we’re engaged in debate about waiting periods, magazine size limits, gun-free zones, or background checks, when nearly every liberal pundit that takes up the gun issue either attacks individual gun ownership as some misunderstood 18thcentury gibberish or laments the nihilistic “gun culture” they imagine exists in this country. This is a dispute about the prevalence of guns in American society, not the newest incrementalist gun-control scheme.

So it’s also worth remember two things:

First: The very premise of Obama’s claim is false. In reality, gun homicides fell by 49 percent between the 1993 and 2010, according to a Pew Research Center study. And according to 2011 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, ”Firearm-related homicides dropped from 18,253 homicides in 1993 to 11,101 in 2011 and nonfatal firearm crimes dropped from 1.5 million victimizations in 1993 to 467,300 in 2011.” Throughout this time gun ownership has remained relatively steady.

Now, I don’t claim to know if more guns or less guns reduce crime, but the idea that we’re experiencing an unprecedented spike in gun violence is a perception driven by the dramatic nature of recent crimes. Which doesn’t mean that the rash of shootings we’ve seen are any less of a tragedy for those involved, or any less jarring or horrifying for all Americans, especially parents who live with the fear of this nightmarish scenario every time they drop their kids off at school.

Second: Ever since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the president has repeatedly implied that passing his legislation would have helped stop most of these attacks – as if we didn’t already have background checks in this nation. Even in California, where stringent gun control laws surpass anything Obama has proposed, citizens are not immune from someone like Elliot Rodger. Obama knows this. The ineffective and redundant legislation Democrats are peddling these days is meant to be a broad victory against the culture of guns and the NRA. It would be far more useful for him to talk about Australian policy, because they haven’t had a mass shooting since. Is there an American alive who doesn’t desire this outcome? Since he’s brought it up twice now, it’s fair to ask: What part of the Australian plan does Obama believe we should implement here in the United States? Surely he doesn’t believe the legislative effort now sitting in Washington is enough. What is enough?

"In Ferguson Protests, Media Somehow See Case Against Gun Rights","Anti-police protests continue in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting of an unarmed teenager after an altercation there. Police have chosen to respond to public anger over this shooting (as well as opportunistic rioting and looting) not with deescalation of a tense situation but by pointing a lot of guns at citizens and using their monopoly on force to disperse protesters. They’ve used tear gas, rubber bullets, sound control and flash-bang grenades. They’ve hidden the identity of the policeman who killed the teenager. Media have been arrested and told to turn off their cameras. A local alderman was arrested for being out and about.

The situation in Ferguson is not great, Bob. And so I found one reaction among liberal journalists to be particularly curious. Let’s look at a few tweets:

Talk about gun rights is ridiculous. If the all the protesters in Ferguson had guns they'd all be dead — AdamSerwer (@AdamSerwer) August 14, 2014

@AdamSerwer Please do not tell me that people are actually holding this up as an argument for more guns — Max Fisher (@Max_Fisher) August 14, 2014

Huffington Post politics and immigration reporter Elise Foley also was disdainful toward gun rights, noting that Twitter users actually seemed to think gun rights a good thing, “sadly.”

To be honest, I don’t quite understand this point from BuzzFeed national editor (or is he still at MSNBC?) Serwer. Is he saying that gun rights are a bad thing because they give police officers more reasons to kill us? I mean, it’s one thing to say that this police force in Ferguson doesn’t seem like the kind of police force to respect individual rights and entirely another to say that therefore those rights are “ridiculous.”

I mean, let’s move back from the Second Amendment to the First Amendment and consider press rights. Let’s rework Serwer’s tweet a bit:

Talk about press rights is ridiculous. If more media were in Ferguson reporting this story, they'd be arrested, too.

The response to media being arrested in Ferguson isn’t to say that press rights are ridiculous, even if press rights clearly agitate the police. Or maybe Serwer and his friends actually do think that, I don’t know.

But more than that, it’s impossible to understand what being American means without understanding our belief in self-government. That belief in self-government is laid out in our founding documents. The Constitution, a document Vox’s Ezra Klein has found both confusing and old, begins with the words “We the People.” That’s us. And we the people became a people in the Declaration of Independence, where the authors announced the revolution and explained why we were revolting by writing:

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

So we have the right to revolt against despotic governments with a long train of abuses. The right to revolution assumes a means of revolution. And that means arms — the weapon kind, not the hugging kind. This is something that our media clearly don’t understand, much less agree with, but their beef is with self-government or logic more than the NRA.

Anyway, that’s what gun rights are about. Read the Second Amendment again with a mind toward recent events:

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

People have the right to keep and bear arms because it’s necessary for self-government, something other Twitter users picked up on when observing the media’s typical hate-fest for gun rights. Here were some of my favorite sarcastic tweets attempting to get the point across:

You're right, @Max_Fisher, #Ferguson is showing how important it is for police to have all the guns. @AdamSerwer — AmishDude (@TheAmishDude) August 14, 2014

@TheAmishDude @Max_Fisher @AdamSerwer Govt. should have all the guns to maintain proper public order – George III @sunnyright — Arthur Kimes (@ComradeArthur) August 14, 2014

There are people who see an oppressive state and out-of-control police and simultaneously think they should be the only ones armed. — SunnyRight (@sunnyright) August 14, 2014

The police, and state they represent, are thugs and tyrants. Tune in tomorrow when we explain why this means you should give up gun rights. — SunnyRight (@sunnyright) August 14, 2014

While being clear that no one has a sufficient understanding of the unstable situation in Ferguson or the events that led to it, if you can’t see the benefit of free people being armed as a curb against despotism — that is, the exercise of absolute power, especially in a cruel and oppressive way — you will likely never see it.

Which, as it turns out, is a good way to find yourself suffering under ever more despotic regimes.

Ferguson’s Imaginary Gun Problem,"Does anybody think things wd be better in Ferguson if the demonstrators were armed? — David Frum (@davidfrum) August 14, 2014

Can you imagine what Ferguson would look like if all these demonstrators were armed?

It’s a question that’s popped up in my Twitter feed in various forms over the past few days. And as my colleague Mollie Hemingway has already done a fine job of pointing out, many in the media revealed they have only a muddled understanding of gun rights.

But let’s go with David Frum’s hypothetical proposition, because it brings to mind a few broader points.

Yes, if all protestors had loaded firearms in their hands, the situation would almost certainly have degenerated into a more violent mess. But the fact is protestors could have armed themselves. Mostly, they didn’t. Though there is no way to precisely calculate the number of Missourians that own guns – one Daily Beast report uses NICS background checks numbers to come up with 14,712 per 100,000 residents, which doesn’t include inherited weapons, shotguns, etc. – there are doubtlessly plenty of firearms to be found in St Louis county. Getting your hands on a weapon in Missouri doesn’t seem to be a particularly challenging endeavor.

In this situation, it was the state that behaved as if it had been deployed for war, not the majority of protestors. Most civilians don’t use guns recklessly in these situations (or any, for that matter) for reasons of self-preservation and more vitally – and this may surprise some people – because most people have absolutely no desire to shoot at the police. Even protesting civilians. Even angry protesting civilians.

So a more appropriate observation might be: Isn’t it amazing that in a country with over 250 million guns in circulation, violent political protests are almost nonexistent?

Fewer guns in hands of the policed ==> less need for body armor on those who do the policing — David Frum (@davidfrum) August 14, 2014

Apparently not. Because despite this reality, Frum is far more troubled by the idea of civilians exercising their rights than he is about authorities abusing their power. The entire line of argument has certain authoritarian ring to it. The public – or as Frum sees them, the “policed” – ought to surrender their own right to self-defense lest they compel the police to don excessive military gear to face hypothetical threats.

Well, if our only theoretical concern is to make “things better,” why stop with Second Amendment?

For example:

Wouldn’t things have been better in Ferguson if the authorities could suspend the right of civilians to assemble and protest?

Wouldn’t things have been better in Ferguson if the press weren’t exacerbating the situation with all their pictures and questions?

Wouldn’t things have been better in Ferguson if the police could proactively arrest anyone they assumed was going to be troublemaker?

Surely they would be more peaceful in short run. But, in the long run, probably not any better.

We also shouldn’t forget those Ferguson business and home owners who purchased guns which are discouraging the peripheral criminality that almost always arises during these combustible situations. How many lawless acts are preemptively thwarted by the mere thought of a gun being present in a home or a business? How many more police officers would St Louis county need to outfit in camouflage and combat gear if freelancing troublemakers were on the loose?

Obviously, anti-gun advocates don’t believe such deterrence exists. That’s fine because it’s definitely not the best reason for gun ownership.

In my understanding, owning guns for self-defense or sport are only secondary reasons to support the Second Amendment. Though gun advocates often shy away from making the case, the best and most vital purpose of an armed citizenry is to be a buttress against tyrannical government. Now, I’ve never owned a gun, and I have no reason to believe that the time for aiming muskets at government troops is close or inevitable. And if it needs to be pointed out, those who do are nuts. As tragic as events of Ferguson have been, the situation certainly doesn’t call for any armed rebellion.

And yet. When the police block Main Street with tanks and aim their high-powered rifles at unarmed protestors, I don’t think to myself: “Hey, thank goodness those citizens have no way to defend themselves.” Apparently some people do.

Gun Owners Aren’t Hypocrites For Wanting To Protect Obama From Guns,"If you’re wondering to what depths modern liberalism has fallen, look no further than the fact that the headline of this story is necessary. To understand how we got to this point, we first need to briefly review the ongoing Secret Service scandal.

First, we had the reports that Secret Service agents were getting busy with Colombian hookers. Then we learned that the Secret Service had no clue somebody shot repeatedly at the White House, and that the Secret Service didn’t come to know this fact until several days later. The president and his wife did not learn about the shooting from the Secret Service, though. Michelle Obama found out about from a White House usher. Then we learned that the Secret Service had allowed a convicted felon with a weapon to ride on an elevator with the president. That’s right: a convicted felon was armed and in a very confined space with the president, and the Secret Service didn’t know about. Oh, and when the agency tasked with protecting the president found out about that, they didn’t tell Obama. He found out about it, as he apparently finds out about most things, from the news media.

Julia Pierson resigned her position as head of the Secret Service yesterday as a result of the repeated SNAFUs and cover-ups.

Here’s how the Washington Post summarized the incident of the armed convict who ended up in an elevator with Obama:

A security contractor with a gun and three convictions for assault and battery was allowed on an elevator with President Obama during a Sept. 16 trip to Atlanta, violating Secret Service protocols, according to three people familiar with the incident.

As you can imagine, a ton of people are pretty angry about the current state of the Secret Service. Some of these people are even Republicans.

“But how is that possible?” a dumb liberal with a crippling case of projection might ask. “I figured all Republicans wanted people they don’t like to drop dead.” For example (NSFW language warning):

I'm sorry, if you say someone hates and is destroying America and you want to keep them safe, one of those two statements is a fucking lie.



joeypiazza (@joeypiazza) October 1, 2014

Smart take, bro.

Then we have TNR’s Brian Beutler, who has decided that you are a dumb hypocrite if you simultaneously want to 1) protect the president from being attacked by crazed loons with guns, and 2) protect your family from being attacked by crazed loons with guns.

For those keeping score at home, conservatives who express concern about the physical security of the leader of the free world are apparently either liars or hypocrites. There’s no other option. Given the vitriol that was spewed at George W. Bush during his presidency — including, mind you, a film that included a fictionalized assassination of George W. Bush — I guess it makes sense that the gap between “I don’t like that guy” and “I wish that guy were dead” isn’t all that big in the minds of nutcake progressives.

Beutler’s piece mocked Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), a gun owner himself, for having the audacity to criticize an agency that allowed an armed convict to get in a confined space with the president. Here’s the headline of the piece:

Here’s what Beutler wrote about the incident:

The armed felon in the elevator represents a different level of failure. There appears to be widespread recognition of this fact in both the media and in Congress. That’s good, and important, but it’d be nicer still if elected gun enthusiasts thought through the logical implications of their completely warranted outrage.



[…]



Chaffetz is appalled that USSS allowed a person to carry a concealed handgun around the president without conducting a background check, but supports legislation to make it significantly easier for people—many of whom come into lawful possession of firearms without undergoing background checks—to carry concealed weapons around you and me.

So much dumb to unpack.

For starters, the only guns I want around the president of the United States are those handled by people who are employed to protect him. And I say that as Second Amendment enthusiast who really, really, really likes guns. A lot. How on earth did the Secret Service fail to identify a freaking gunman next to the president?

Second, as much as Beutler desperately wants to make this whole affair about background checks rather than, oh, I don’t know, the seemingly constitutional inability of the current Secret Service to properly protect the commander-in-chief of the U.S. military, it has nothing at all to do with background checks.

I’m not all that upset that a crook ended up standing next to Obama. I’m upset that a convict with a gun was standing next to the president. I can’t get through an airport with a tube of toothpaste, but this guy can get a gun next to the president, and Beutler’s main concern is about background checks? Really?

“But wait a minute,” you might say. “I thought convicted felons were prohibited by federal law from possessing firearms?” You would be correct. They are. It’s almost like felons don’t care at all about obeying laws.

For some reason, though, people who aren’t allowed to have guns keep ending up with guns. Even in places that do their best to ban guns. Places like Chicago, for example, where 269 people have been killed with guns so far in 2014. Chicago’s got a lot of problems, but lax gun laws aren’t one. Or places like Washington, D.C., which also does everything in its power to ban handguns. According to the National Institutes of Health, gun violence in D.C. is really bad:

When it comes to firearm deaths, Hawaii has the fewest gun deaths in the United States, while the District of Columbia has the highest, according to new research.



Over the past decade, deaths from gun-related violence — including murders, suicides and unintentional shootings — varied widely across the United States, the study revealed. Hawaii’s rate was roughly three per 100,000 citizens. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the District of Columbia had the highest rate of gun deaths, with about 22 per 100,000 citizens.

Third, contrary to Beutler’s assertion that this whole episode was due to “lax carry laws,” the state of Georgia, where the incident occurred, doesn’t just allow anybody with a pulse to carry a concealed weapon. As we’ve already noted, the elevator gunman was already banned by federal law from possessing a firearm thanks to three felony convictions. Georgia only allows licensed residents to carry concealed weapons. And guess what you have to go through in Georgia in order to get a concealed carry license? You guessed it: a background check, complete with fingerprints. What does this mean? It means that in addition to breaking federal law by possessing a firearm, the gunman was violating state law by concealing it on his person.

But wait, there’s more! You know what else is prohibited by federal law? Bringing a firearm into a federal building.

In short, despite clear prohibitions against this individual possessing a firearm, concealing a firearm, and bringing a firearm into a federal building, this individual managed to possess a firearm, conceal a firearm, and bring a firearm into a federal building. If you look at all those facts and decide that they call for yet another gun law, you’re either a propagandist or a painfully naive dupe. In Beutler’s case, maybe both.

If anything, this whole situation highlights exactly why law-abiding citizens must have the right to carry a concealed weapon in order to protect themselves and their loved ones. Heck, after reading about the story, it makes me wish Obama regularly carried a concealed weapon so he can protect himself in the event the Secret Service fails to do its job.

There’s an old mantra that when seconds count, the police are only minutes away. If an armed madman decides he wants to kill you or your family, do you want your life to be in the hands of his good graces, or would you rather have the right to not be a victim? I’m going to go with the latter option there. One of the main reasons concealed carry advocates are so adamant about their rights is that it’s impossible for police to be everywhere at all times. Most people don’t have the luxury of an armed security force that literally follows them everywhere in order to protect them. But you know what? The president does. And even his protectorate, believed to be one of the most qualified in the world, couldn’t prevent him from ending up in the same elevator as an armed felon.

Concealed carry advocates aren’t hypocrites for being horrified by repeated and preventable security lapses that have imperiled the president’s safety. Believing in the right of self-defense against a violent, armed felon with no regard for the law isn’t hypocritical, it’s perfectly logical and wonderfully American.

"Relax, Open Carry Won’t Get You Shot At Kroger","I have written before of gun controllers’ tendency to be woefully uneducated about the very things they seek to control: from firearm terminology, to the constitutional basis for and history of American gun ownership, to the causes and factors of gun violence, the anti-gun crowd is usually embarrassingly off-base. Aside from pro-abortionists, there is perhaps no political constituency less informed about its animating principle than the gun control bloc.

Nevertheless, it’s worth considering each gun-control issue on a case-by-case basis, if only to give due consideration to the law of averages: at some point they have to get it right, just as those monkeys with typewriters will, at some point, spell out the entirety of “Hamlet.” Alas for both the monkeys and anti-gun zealots, that time has still not come. If Moms Demand Action’s latest media stunt is any indication, Big Gun Control is continuing its tradition of being wrong about every policy for which it advocates.

If you weren’t in the know, MDA—one of the country’s premier gun control groups, the coalition à la mode of the gun control haut monde—recently delivered a petition of 300,000 signatures to Kroger, demanding (of course demanding) that the grocery giant “ensure the safety and security of its customers and employees by asking guests not to openly carry guns in its stores.” Moms Demand Action also took a poll in which a majority of respondents “want a grocery shopping environment free of openly carried firearms.” “It’s well past time,” founder Shannon Watts announced a while ago, that the Kroger higher-ups “listen to their customers, employees, and elected officials and prohibit open carry inside their stores.”

“When state laws don’t protect children and families,” Watts continued, “it’s up to businesses that depend heavily on female clientele to put policies in place that protect them on their private property.”

If that wasn’t enough, three U.S. senators have joined in the fight: Dianne Feinstein from California and Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, both from Connecticut, co-authored a letter to Kroger imploring Kroger to ban open carry because of “gun extremists [who] have exploited the current Kroger gun policy.” A couple of Connecticut Democrats and the ex-mayor of San Francisco do not exactly suggest a government-led shakedown, but still, it’s pretty weird of these politicians to have written such a letter to a private corporation.

Does Anyone Shoot Up Grocery Stores?

Well, anyway, there has to be a good rationale; one assumes these folks have strong reason to oppose Kroger’s liberal open-carry policy. There must be a greater danger associated with shopping at a grocery store that allows customers to openly carry firearms, and MDA, along with the Gang of Kroger Three, must have facts to back up their crusade. They must, in other words, be able to convincingly prove that there is an extant and prominent threat associated with open-carry grocery stores: these stores must have higher incidences of shootings and gun violence, and the stores that do not allow open-carry must have lower incidences of such tragedies. Right?

Would any of these three instances of gun violence have been prevented by a ‘no-open-carry’ rule in Kroger? I can’t see how.

Well, I struggled mightily to find any evidence to either confirm or refute this hypothesis. There doesn’t seem to be a breakdown, anywhere, of the most violent or dangerous grocery stores in which one has the highest risk for getting shot. You can find a number of news stories regarding shootings at Kroger, though it’s hardly the stuff gun control petitions are made of: in one shooting, an employee (not a customer) used his gun to shoot and kill a robber who was attempting to assault the employee; another shooting occurred outside of a Kroger, and was perpetrated by an alleged criminal; there were some others, but none of the stories I read involved the shooter openly carrying his weapon, and none of the shootings seemed like they’d have been prevented if Kroger had banned weapons from its stores.

I did find an article that linked to a few of MDA’s examples of Kroger-related gun violence: one shooting in Gwinnett County, Georgia back in February, which was perpetrated by a mentally ill man who believed people were “after him.” The man was allegedly on drugs, and he possessed his weapon illegally. Another instance MDA cited: a murder-suicide in Atlanta. This shooting, however, occurred once again outside the Kroger, not in. The killer first shot from her car, got out and continued firing, and then turned the gun on herself.

An Everytown for Gun Safety press release in support of MDA listed just three Kroger gun violence events: the two listed above, and one in which a woman ran to her car, retrieved her firearm, and used it to threaten someone with which she was having an argument. Would any of these instances of gun violence (or the threat of it) have been prevented by a “no-open-carry” rule in Kroger? I can’t see how. In fact, I’m prepared to say that banning open carry would have had absolutely no effect on these events.

There are allegedly many more examples of Kroger shootings to which Moms Demand Actions refers, but the group is oddly silent about it. Their #GroceriesNotGuns page lists exactly zero such incidents, though you’d imagine they’d want to put the evidence front and center in order to prove their point. Moreover, the whole thing kind of defies logic in another way: if getting shot were such a clear and present danger at your neighborhood Kroger, it seems likely that Kroger’s chain of command would have issued such a ban a long time ago. There’s nothing a grocery store hates more than losing customers to competitors (something MDA is counting on), and there’s nothing that would cause more customer loss than your grocery store being a statistically deadly environment. If Kroger were dangerous for its customers, Kroger would be doing everything it could to keep its customers safe.

Gun Antagonists Provide No Statistics

So there’s no readily-identifiable evidence that shoppers are really in danger of getting shot at grocery stores that allow open carry. It’s just not there. So I figured, why not ask the folks who appear to know? I e-mailed MDA to ask them for some data or statistics that justify their fear of armed Kroger shoppers; I e-mailed senators Feinstein, Blumenthal, and Murphy to ask them for the same. I also contacted Kroger to see if they might have any opinion as to whether their stores were more or less dangerous for having open-carry policies.

Moms Demand Action seems to be operating a crusade of fear, not facts.

Blumenthal and Murphy both informed me that, as I did not live in what Murphy called “the great state of Connecticut,” they thought my inquiries would be better served by asking my own representative (but they didn’t write the letter, senators). Blumenthal did allow that I might mail his office via the U.S. Postal Service (fat chance, buster—I’m trying to cut down on my carbon emissions). I heard nothing from Feinstein one way or the other. I considered calling their offices to see if I might be able to get some comments over the phone, but that seemed like a stretch—and at any rate, the letter that the senators wrote contains no data on Kroger shootings, just rhetoric on “bizarre displays” of openly-carried rifles and scare talk about “gun extremists.”

Oh, well. What about Moms Demand Action? They never got back to me, either. (Being a writer for The Federalist will get you into a fair number of exclusive DC-area oxygen bars and a top-tier steakhouse or two, but it doesn’t seem to hold much sway with liberal politicians and gun-control groups.) I did not hear back from Kroger, as well. The grocery giant has been silent on the matter in public—at the time of this writing, there were no press releases yet regarding the issue of guns in its stores. (According to Shannon Watts, one Kroger manager in Ohio refused to take the list of petition signatures that an MDA representative brought to her, but this was as close to an official statement on the matter as I could find.)

After all this, I’m forced to conclude there really isn’t any statistical danger in shopping alongside openly-carried rifles and other firearms; there doesn’t seem to be any data at all to justify being afraid of someone carrying a gun in Kroger. Indeed, the only instance I could find of a potential shooting involving an openly-carrying Kroger customer was in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which the police showed up and drew their guns on a man who had been carrying his rifle while he shopped. The man had been breaking neither state law nor Kroger policy.

Moms Demand Action seems to be operating a crusade of fear, not facts; they seem less concerned with objective proof and more considered with terrors that do not exist. It will be up to Kroger to decide whether to ban guns within its stores. Perhaps, after all these goings-on and negative publicity, it would be a smart business decision to do so—but it will have been borne of a campaign of misinformation, fear-mongering ,and total ignorance of the evidence. Who would want to give into the demands of such intolerant and irrational bullies?

"California Just Banned Arrest For Gun Theft, Date Rape Drug Possession","If you want to steal guns or sell date rape drugs and suffer no real consequences, move to California.

Proposition 47, a ballot initiative that California owners just supported with over 58 percent of the vote, requires misdemeanor instead of felony sentences for a number of so-called “non-serious” crimes. And that includes gun theft and possession of date rape drugs. Seriously. That’s not my personal opinion. It’s the official opinion of California state officials. Here’s what the state-sanctioned voter guide said about the “cons” of the ballot initiative:

Potentially releases 10,000 felons from state prison. Reduces penalties for stealing guns. Reduces penalties for possession of “date rape” drugs. Opposed by prosecutors, law enforcement, and the business community. Opposed by crime victims and sexual abuse victims. Vote NO on Proposition 47.

Are you freaking kidding me? I get the need for smarter sentencing laws and all that, but at what point did firearm theft and possession of date rape drugs become non-serious offenses? But it gets worse. It’s not just that gun theft is no longer a felony. The new law required by Proposition 47 now bans arrests for gun theft. Instead of arresting those suspected of stealing guns, police are required to write them a ticket and ask for them to appear in court.

If that sounds like what you would expect from a traffic ticket, it’s because it is. California just forced its law enforcement community to issue tickets for gun theft and date rape drug possession.

Here’s what the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department wrote about the new law on its Facebook page late last night:

1. In most instances, many crimes that were previously “arrestable” as a felony will now only be “citable” as a misdemeanor. That means they may not be booked into jail but rather given a citation (similar to a traffic ticket) with a court date to appear, and released in the field. They will not be held pending trial. Such felony crimes that are now misdemeanors include:

• Commercial burglary (theft under $950)

• Forgery and bad checks (under $950 value)

• Theft of most firearms

• Theft of a vehicle (under $950 value)

• Possession of stolen property (under $950 value)

• Possession of heroin, cocaine, illegal prescriptions, concentrated cannabis, and methamphetamine

This kind of nonsense is exactly what gun rights and self-defense advocates are talking about when they say we need to enforce existing gun laws instead of passing new ones to make life harder for law-abiding citizens who just want to defend themselves and their families.

If gun violence is a real problem (and it obviously is), why did California voters just make it easier for criminals to illegally obtain guns that they can use to perpetrate violence? Out of one side of their mouth, they lecture gun owners on why they’re not responsible enough to own guns, and out of the other side, they support new laws that turn serious gun crimes into non-arrestable misdemeanors.

BUT THAT’S NOT ALL. Seriously, it gets worse. The new California law also reduced penalties for possession of date rape drugs. Instead of being a felony, possessing date rape drugs is now a petty misdemeanor. Here’s what the L.A. Times wrote about that provision:

Opponents point out, though, that in reducing simple possession of most controlled substances from felonies or wobblers to misdemeanors, Proposition 47 covers roofies. Currently, a person caught with Rohypnol in his pocket can be prosecuted for a felony and end up in state prison for three years. If the initiative passes, he would be liable only for a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. But, as a practical matter, he may do no jail time at all. It would be merely a “slap on the wrist,” according to the ballot pamphlet rebuttal arguments signed by, among others, Sandra Henriquez, executive director of California Coalition Against Sexual Assault.

In one fell swoop, California voters just made it a whole lot easier for criminals to commit gun crimes and perpetrate date rape.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/11/06/california-just-banned-arrests-for-gun-theft-date-rape-drug-possession/,2014-11-06
Knives Killed Five Times As Many People As Rifles Last Year,"According to crime statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), knives are consistently used to kill people far more often than rifles are used. And the numbers aren’t even close: five times as many murders were committed with knives than were committed with rifles last year.

The FBI statistics show that knives have been used as a murder weapon far more often than rifles — even those evil “assault weapons” we hear so much about — for quite a while. In 2013, knives or other cutting instruments were used to kill 1,490 victims. In contrast, rifles were the cause of death of 285 murder victims. Shotguns were used in 308 murders. In 2009, the ratio was very similar: knives were used in five times as many murders as rifles.

The 2013 numbers are even more interesting when you compare them to data from 2003, the last year in which the 1994 federal “assault weapon” ban was in effect. In 2003, 390 people were murdered with a rifle. That’s right. The number of rifle murders is 27 percent lower today — ten years after the expiration of the “assault weapon” ban — than it was in 2003, the last year “assault weapons” were banned by the federal government.

“But what about handgun murders?” you might ask. “They’re responsible for the majority of gun murders, so why don’t we just ban them and stop worrying about rifles?”

Easy: because gun bans and strict gun control don’t really prevent gun violence. Take, for example, Illinois and California. In 2013, there were 5,782 murders by handgun in the U.S. According to FBI data, 20 percent of those — 1,157 of the 5,782 handgun murders — happened in Illinois and California, which have two of the toughest state gun control regimes in the entire country. And even though California and Illinois contain about 16 percent of the nation’s population, those two states are responsible for over 20 percent of the nation’s handgun murders.

Chicago is a perfect example of the total failure of gun controllers to prevent gun violence. Until recently, the city basically banned any and all transfers or sales of handguns. It was virtually impossible to get a concealed carry permit. Did that do anything to stem the tide of gun-related bloodshed? Of course not. Chicago was the murder capital of the U.S. in 2012.

In 2013, however, Chicago’s murder rate fell to its lowest level in 48 years. What could have possibly led to such a drastic change? This might help explain it.

Gun owners in the nation’s third-largest city will no longer have to register their firearms with the local authorities, ending a policy that has helped the police track guns here for decades.



Chicago’s City Council voted to make the change on Wednesday, modifying the municipal code to comply with a new state law that will make Illinois the last in the nation to allow people to carry concealed weapons in public. While the city’s strict bans on assault weapons and gun dealers remain, the loss of control over its own registry, in effect since 1968, was another setback for gun control proponents — this time in President Obama’s hometown, in a state run by Democrats.

The 2013 law passed by the Chicago city council didn’t just kill the city’s gun registry. More important, it also removed a ban on gun possession outside the home, a much-needed change that finally gave law-abiding citizens the ability to protect themselves throughout the city. And earlier that year, the state legislature in Illinois finally passed a law allowing lawful citizens to carry concealed weapons to protect themselves.

Meanwhile, new polling data from Gallup suggests that the American public increasingly believes that guns are necessary to keep Americans and their homes safe from criminals. Over the past 15 years or so, Americans have become more and more supportive of basic gun rights:

While Gallup figures on U.S. gun ownership have not shifted much since 2006, the percentage of Americans who say that having a gun in the home makes that household safer has drastically climbed over the past eight years.



Americans own guns for a wide array of reasons, but the increase in the perceived safety value of owning them suggests that guns are taking on more of a protective role than they have in the past.

Baseless gun control laws don’t keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Instead, those laws keep lawful, innocent Americans from being able to protect themselves from the very same criminals who regularly violate the nation’s gun laws. Thankfully, that’s a fact that more and more Americans understand.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/11/11/knives-kill-more-people-each-year-than-rifles-time-for-knife-control/,2014-11-11
Surprise! Yet Another Poll Shows Widespread Popularity Of Gun Rights,"A new poll released today by the Pew Research Center confirms similar findings from other recent polls that the popularity of gun rights is on the rise.

Since December 2012, when Pew last released a major poll on gun rights, the percentage of those who believe that guns help to prevent people from becoming crime victims has shot up significantly. And for the first time in over 20 years, a majority of those polled by Pew, 52 percent, say it’s more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns than it is to control gun ownership:

In the new Pew poll, 57 percent of adult respondents said guns “protect people from becoming crime victims,” compared to only 38 percent who said guns “put people’s safety at risk.” In 2012, the pro-gun spread between those two responses was 11 percentage points vs. a 21-point pro-gun gap in the latest numbers. And it turns out that a belief in the fundamental right to self-defense now spans partisan, gender, and racial divides.

A majority of independents (62), women (51 percent), and blacks (54 percent) told Pew that guns do more to protect innocent people than they do to endanger others’ safety. In the December 2012 poll, only 29 percent of blacks polled said guns did more to protect people from crime. The numbers have swung from a -24-point gap to a +13-point pro-gun gap, a net swing of 37 percentage points:

Here’s how Pew characterized the results:

Over the past two years, blacks’ views on this measure have changed dramatically. Currently, 54% of blacks say gun ownership does more to protect people than endanger personal safety, nearly double the percentage saying this in December 2012 (29%). By contrast, whites’ views have shown less change: 62% now view guns as doing more to protect people, up from 54% in December.

Significant upticks in support for gun rights were also registered in nearly ever age group, with a big jump in support coming from 18- to 29-year-olds:

Liberal Democrats are the only partisan/ideological group polled by Pew to register a drop in support for the statement that guns can help protect people from crime. The percentage of liberals polled who agreed with that statement fell from 15 percent to 14 percent.

Your Child’s Pediatrician Has No Business Lecturing You On Gun Ownership,"No development in U.S. healthcare over the last three decades has imperiled us more than the idea that we benefit from physician oversight of life events and circumstances that are not inherently medical. At its most intrusive, this process, called medicalization, creates a clinical conundrum out of the mere act of living and posits medical solutions for things (such as how to live a healthier lifestyle) that frequently benefit more from individual concentration and perseverance than professional intervention. We are thus bearing witness to tortuous reformation of what it means to be a physician in America: a formerly independent and autonomous profession is now our societal hall monitor.

Adam Goldstein, M.D., of North Carolina exemplifies the problem. His facile positioning of firearms as the new tobacco, coating the argument in a patina of medical benevolence, is testament to the profession’s creativity in dragging into its sphere things that do not belong there. There is, of course, no Constitutional right to smoke. But Dr. Goldstein doesn’t stop there. He wants national standards of licensure and professional behavior, especially regarding physicians and guns, akin to what is seen with commercial truckers. He also supports legal designation of all healthcare settings as “gun-free” zones, without a trace of irony about the fact that schools already occupy that space.

The conflation of smoking and firearms ownership is an almost laughable canard. I know of no reasonable claim that the firearms industry has been intentionally deceptive in its marketing, distribution, or sales, or encouraged gun buyers to engage in reckless behavior (which smoking is, by definition). This is quite a bit different from tobacco purveyors who willfully lied about the dangers of their products for decades, and, indeed, used physicians to deliver the lie and persuade potential smokers that all was medically hunky dory.

It is not so difficult to sense that the bottom line of anti-gunners is a grandiose tobacco-style financial punishment of the firearms industry for its alleged transgressions. If gun rights opponents want to use the legal system to pursue their goals, why not sue the family of Adam Lanza and the estate of Nancy Lanza, to create a theory of civil liability that puts the onus on gun owners to secure their firearms? If you live with someone you know, or ought to know, could use your guns wrongly, it is your obligation, not the gun maker’s, to secure them. Suing Bushmaster, the distributor, and the now-defunct retailer makes no more sense than suing the manufacturer and dealer of the car Margo Bronstein was driving in Redondo Beach, CA on December 17, 2014. She is suspected to have been under the influence of, among other things, prescription drugs.

As I have written elsewhere, the Affordable Care Act’s statutory language against gathering information about gun ownership is a subterfuge. The feds clearly want to doctors to inquire about and document in medical records information about gun ownership; absent that desire, there was no reason for an Executive Order clarifying that the prohibition really wasn’t one. Establishment medicine, as represented by groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, has firmly glommed on to the federal teat, which dispenses nearly forty cents of every healthcare dollar we spend, more if you count the forgone taxes on health insurance premiums and in-name-only not-for-profit health plans and hospital systems and other provider groups.

As physicians increasingly become employees, we can expect them to behave as such; they will ask about what their employers and their employers’ overseers want to them ask about, all under the guise of quality healthcare and helping to save us from ourselves. There is no request of the government that they will fail to heed because there is too much money, power, and influence in play to take seriously the notion that both policy positions and patient interactions ought to be framed by evidence and modesty.

The longer term play here is much more sinister. Doctors will be asked to promote safe guns even though there is no demand amongst gun owners for the technology and even less confidence in its utility. My cell phone periodically reboots without warning; will my safe gun reboot when I need it?

In keeping with the Executive Order, doctors will be asked to promote the idea that they are just trying to find people with mental illness who might be a danger to themselves or others. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has just struck down as unconstitutional a federal law that bars gun ownership by anyone history of institutionalization for mental illness even if they are now deemed healthy.

A new paper in the American Journal of Public Health casts even more doubt on the idea that we can use mental health/illness as the government’s stalking horse to prevent gun deaths, which are in a 20-year-long decline. Discomfortingly, the authors speculate whether psychiatrists “could help society interrogate [emphasis added] what guns mean to everyday people, and why people feel they need guns or reject guns out of hand.” I, for one, am not assuaged by the proposal that we need a cultural interrogation on guns led by the psychiatry industry. How big a step is it from the idea that mental illness promotes gun violence (it doesn’t, according to the authors) to the conclusion that gun ownership is evidence of a mental disorder? If there is creeping encroachment on the concept of competence by the mental health professions, how will we challenge it?

It is bad enough that Obamacare enlists doctors in the feckless pursuit of Americans clinically. This policy meme, all by itself, foments overtreatment, overdiagnosis, overscreening, and just, pure outright medical harm, in a system that already wastes 30% of the resources put into it. Instead of engaging physicians to fix these issues, Obamacare welcomes them as the straws stirring a toxic drink of paternalism and unsustainable deference to people who have no legitimate intellectual or moral claim to the work they’re being asked to do.

The debate we need to have is this one: is it possible for a free society to try to prevent every potential tragic or adverse event? At what cost in commerce, individual freedom, professional autonomy, and respect for government? Was Churchill right…that we can pass so many laws and regulations that eventually everything is illegal and people lose all respect for the law? Have we reached the juncture where we will lose all respect for the medical profession because it is invited incessantly to intercede in so many facets of our lives, and it simply cannot restrain itself from carrying the government’s water?

Within the next decade, a very large number of Americans will join gun owners in the view that the healthcare industry, now explicitly an agent of the federal government, simply cannot be trusted with any information beyond what is necessary to solve an immediate clinical problem. I will not blame gun owners one bit if they look back smugly on today’s debate and say, “I told you so.”

2014: A Banner Year For The Second Amendment,"My colleague Robert Tracinski recently re-instituted the Democratic Party Death Watch, an alert that signifies the donks are “betting everything on the far-left base while driving away their own blue-collar and middle class constituents.” The modern Democratic Party being a clumsy amalgamation of economic buffoons and social justice warriors, a death watch is an appropriate vigil to keep, although I wouldn’t bet against Elizabeth Warren making fiscal insanity and dimwitted neo-Marxist philosophy a mainstream policy platform. It has been done before.

Nevertheless, the Democratic death watch sounds fine with me, and while we’re at it we can celebrate one of the other victories of the past year, a triumph that is not-coincidentally contemporaneous with the imploding prospects of the Democrats: 2014 was a year in which gun control became more of a liability for the Left than an asset.

To be sure, there are still plenty of politicians out there who are interested in restricting and curtailing gun rights: they will always be there, constantly mumbling about background checks and “loopholes” and 30-clip military-style magazine-rifles. Ignore them. In the main, gun control has become a distasteful subject and a losing prospect for many who seek it. Early in December, Pew released a poll showing that, for the first time in more than two decades, a majority of Americans support gun rights over gun control. Across the board these numbers have risen from just a couple of years ago after the Newtown shootings: the share of Democrats who believe in protecting gun rights rose 6 percent, the same as Republicans generally; among “conservative/moderate Democrats” the jump was a startling 12 percent. Urban, suburban, and rural Americans all increased their support of gun rights over gun control; blacks did too, by a whopping 10 percent.

The Signs of Desperation Abound

This isn’t to say that everyone who sides with gun rights believes in no gun regulations at all, only that the gun controllers have suffered a decisive and, frankly, humiliating defeat: for all the fearmongering, all the nasty and deceitful scare tactics that the Left has used over the past few years to convince more Americans to give up their gun rights, a majority of Americans have largely ignored this advice and even turned against it.

The gun-control wing of the Left has grown more desperate and more angry as its influence has waned.

And what about that fearmongering? For all its bombast and high-soaring rhetoric, the gun control movement’s efforts over the last year have exposed a campaign that is deeply distressed and perhaps terminally irrelevant: unable for years to achieve their goal of widespread citizen disarmament, the gun-control wing of the Left has grown more desperate and more angry as its influence has waned. Earlier in the fall, the gun control group Moms Demand Action, along with a few liberal senators, mounted a campaign to get openly-carried weapons banned from Kroger. They provided zero evidence that guns openly carried in Kroger were a danger to shoppers; indeed, so flatly pointless was their campaign, they were reduced to counting shootings outside of Kroger by criminals as some sort of mark against weapons openly-carried by law-abiding citizens. Needless to say, Kroger has appropriately ignored this nonsense, preferring to base its business decisions in reality rather than gun-control fever dreams.

Signs of desperation abounded elsewhere. In my home state of Virginia—a state with so deeply-embedded a gun culture, it has a gun fashion named after it—newly-minted Gov. Terry McAuliffe has proposed a set of gun-control measures that are, to say the least, absurd: he wishes to re-enact the one-gun-a-month limit, a law that did nothing to prohibit violent crime in Virginia, he wants to revoke concealed carry permits for people who are behind on their child support payments, and he wants to close the “gun show loophole” in spite of gun shows’ tenuous link to gun violence. Given that these measures would arguably have no effect whatsoever on gun crime, it’s easy to conclude that McAuliffe is, like the rest of the anti-gun movement, desperate to gain at least some ground in the gun control battle. In the face of an indifferent and perhaps even hostile constituency, you can understand why the governor would resort to such pitiable measures.

Gun Control Advocates Become More Loose-Cannon

The list goes on. A recent anti-gun public service announcement was released on YouTube showing a young child stealing his parent’s gun, taking it to school, and handing it over to his teacher: “I don’t feel safe with a gun in my house,” he tells her. The child in the video violated virtually every gun safety measure we teach children: he steals a gun, brings it to a school with nobody’s knowledge, and lays it on the teacher’s desk with the barrel facing toward her. “Our children deserve a safe world,” the PSA announces. Of course they do—which is why responsible gun owners teach children how to be safe around firearms. The gun control movement knows this and is determined to hide it—hence the unserious and comical “public service announcement.”

As more and more Americans come to support a robust regime of gun rights in the United States, commentators like Schecter will probably grow more and more shrill.

Earlier this year, Georgia passed a bill that greatly expanded gun carry rights throughout the state; the response was predictable. Cliff Schecter at the Daily Beast announced that Georgia’s new law “flies in the face of all public health statistics, common sense, and modernity.” He provided no evidence whatsoever for these histrionic claims, but then again the gun control movement is not lately interested in facts or empirical evidence. As more and more Americans come to support a robust regime of gun rights in the United States, commentators like Schecter will probably grow more and more shrill, insisting that liberalized gun laws are dangerous and refusing to engage in any actual research.

2014, in other words, was a banner year for the Second Amendment, at least if we are to judge it by the collapse of the gun-control movement as a serious voice in political society. Gun rights enthusiasts may point to 2008, the year of D.C. v, Heller, or 2010, the year of McDonald v. Chicago, as the landmark years of the Second Amendment in the twenty-first century. Yet 2014 has, in its own way, provided a more satisfying and visceral rebuke of the gun-control movement: its relevance waning and its influence all but exhausted, the anti-gun crowd is flailing for pertinence in a country increasingly annoyed with and uninterested in its fraudulent message. We should all go into 2015 aware of, and grateful for, the robust state of the Second Amendment in America today. Happy New Year.

Hollywood Learns To Stop Worrying And Love The Gun,"Never mind all those celebrity-packed public service announcements about gun control, or the sight of mega-producers like Harvey Weinstein railing against the National Rifle Association. Hollywood has learned to stop worrying and love the gun.

The industry’s affection for gunplay goes back generations. Big-screen heroes have been winning the day one bullet at a time for decades, from John Wayne to John McClane of “Die Hard” fame. Lately, waving a gun on screen is the best job insurance outside of a superhero gig or Kevin Hart movie.

The recent success of “American Sniper” made it clear how audiences respond when they see heroes holding such a weapon and, more importantly, knowing how to use it. And plenty of Hollywood types are taking notice.

Guns: The Savior of Aging Actors

Blame Liam Neeson if you must. The Irish actor’s 2008 film, “Taken,” rebranded him as an action hero despite his 50-something age bracket. Now, we’re treated to at least one new Neeson film a year brimming with gunfire. When you’re an actor within a few years of a Social Security check, you’ll take all the career perks you can get.

Should the box office gods smile on the film we may see Penn, again, co-starring with those ‘cowardly killing machines.’

That might be what’s on the mind of Neeson’s peers. Last year, Sean Penn embraced a gun-free stance after canoodling with anti-gun advocate Charlize Theron. The actress inspired him to have an artist melt down his personal gun collection into a statue Penn sold for charity. Next month, movie goers will see Penn in … “The Gunman.” The trailer promises plenty of action, with Penn looking deadly with cold steel in hand. Should the box office gods smile on the film we may see Penn, again, co-starring with those “cowardly killing machines.”

The same holds true for Pierce Brosnan, an actor who seemed to leave action behind when he hung up his perfectly creased 007 tuxedo. Yet last year’s “The November Man” found him squatting on Neeson’s turf, firing away to save his skin. Talk of a sequel (“December Man?”) began weeks before the film reached theaters. Hollywood understands the lure of a gun-powered series.

Sequel chatter also greeted “The Equalizer,” Denzel Washington’s own bid for an aging action hero membership card. His character doesn’t rely solely on guns. He’s a one-man army with the mental ability to decode a fight in super slow-motion. Still, guns play a role in his handiwork. When the film managed to creep past the $100 million mark, the possibility of another “Equalizer” film seemed a lock.

Hollywood’s gun club isn’t an all-male affair. Salma Hayek’s bid for entry, “Everly,” hit VOD late last month. Hayek slings more lead than the Man with No Name in the trailer alone, all the while dressed in a series of provocative outfits. She could be the first actress with a gun-soaked franchise to call her own.

This Doesn’t Mean Hollywood Loves the NRA

None of those stars appeared in the 2013 “Demand a Plan” video for increased gun control measures. Beyonce, Jennifer Aniston, and Jamie Foxx, who personally questioned the role screen violence plays on society, put on their most serious faces to plead for more gun legislation.

Mere days after “American Sniper” shattered a flurry of box office records, Weinstein announced his company will produce a miniseries based on a famed U.S. military sniper.

The PSA may have backfired. A clever Web user quickly created a parody video that compared the stars in question with their ultra-violent screen appearances. Neeson himself invited similar critiques recently when he assailed the United States’s Second Amendment and the NRA while promoting “Taken 3.”

“I am totally for gun control in the U.S.,” said Neeson, who now is an American citizen. “I’ll give Britain its dues. When they had the Dunblane massacre in Scotland, within 24 hours the gun laws were changed so you could not have a handgun.”

Another NRA foe, Harvey Weinstein, once vowed to put his movies where his mouth is. Weinstein teased a new film early last year designed to slam the gun-rights group during a chat with Howard Stern on SiriusXM.

“They are going to wish they weren’t alive after I’m done with them,” he told the veteran radio host. Yet we haven’t heard much more about the project, purported to star Oscar-winner Meryl Streep, in the months that followed. Mere days after “American Sniper” shattered a flurry of box office records, Weinstein announced his company will produce a miniseries based on a famed U.S. military sniper.

This although Weinstein once vowed to hold a summit to study the impact screen violence has on society following the school shooting in Newtown, Conn. In its wake, the producer even suggested his days making ultra-violent movies had come and gone.

“I have to choose movies that aren’t violent or as violent as they used to be,” he said. “I know for me personally … I can’t continue to do that. The change starts here. It has already. For me, I can’t do it. I can’t make one movie and say this is what I want for my kids and then just go out and be a hypocrite.”

That was before Weinstein enthusiastically backed the sniper miniseries and reconnected with director Quentin Tarantino for the upcoming “The Hateful Eight.” That film isn’t in theaters yet, but those who sat through the film’s 2014 script reading found the usual Tarantino violence in the story.

The upcoming presidential election might see gun control roar back into the spotlight. Celebrities could cut some new PSAs to share their position on the matter. Just don’t expect to see an end to gun violence on screens big and small, no matter who wins in November 2016.

14 Things You Should Understand About Guns Before Writing About Them,"Guns can be dangerous in the wrong hands. But so are articles about guns written by people who don’t understand anything about them.

There’s sadly no excuse to be ignorant about firearms. They’ve been around for hundreds of years. They’re owned and operated safely by tens of millions of Americans each year. Our Constitution guarantees our individual right to possess guns so that we might be able to defend ourselves from those who would violently take away our freedom. Many gun controllers, however — some of whom have bylines for major media organizations — don’t actually know the first thing about firearms.

Here’s a good example of the kind of self-inflicted injury that can result from weaponizing an ill-informed opinion about guns and gun-related paraphernalia, courtesy of Ryan J. Reilly of Huffington Post:

I believe these are rubber bullets, can anyone confirm? #Fergurson pic.twitter.com/iCsFi6qoIa



Ryan J. Reilly (@ryanjreilly) August 17, 2014

Unfortunately, Reilly is hardly alone in his complete ignorance of how guns work. Our nation is facing an epidemic of gun-related misreporting. As a public service to those who have opinions about guns but don’t really want to spend much time learning anything about them, I’ve compiled a simple list of 14 basic things everyone should understand before writing or talking about guns.

1) Don’t Lecture Anyone On Gun Safety Until You Understand The Basic Rules

These are rules literally every person should understand, because you never know when you might be in a situation that requires you to handle a firearm. To seasoned gun owners, these basic gun safety rules are gospel. If faithfully followed, they will prevent the likelihood of you ever shooting someone who did not pose an immediate and mortal threat to an innocent person.

1. Treat all guns as though they are loaded.

2. Never point the muzzle at anything you don’t intend to destroy.

3. Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on target and you’re prepared to fire.

4. Always confirm your target, as well as what’s in front, behind, and around it.

Each rule is effectively a backup in case you ignore a previous rule. If you always assume a gun is loaded, then you’ll never have to say, “Your Honor, I didn’t know it was loaded.” If you screw up the first rule, the rule #2 will prevent you from shooting someone unintentionally, because your muzzle will always be pointed in a safe direction. If you screw up the first and second rules, rule #3 will ensure that the weapon is never actually discharged. And in the event that you believe your life is in mortal danger, rule #4 will prevent you from firing on an individual who’s a non-threat, or prevent you from firing through a threat into an innocent person.

These gun safety rules are to be practiced all the time, without exception. At the range. In your home. When you are carrying. When you’re not carrying. When a gun is loaded. When a gun is empty (remember: it’s never empty). The rules exist to protect you and everyone around you from harm. Memorize them. Practice them. And don’t lecture anyone on “gun control” or “gun safety,” the new gun-controller-approved euphemism for gun control, until you can effortlessly recite them and explain why they are so important.

It’s a simple test: if a gun controller wants to tell you what is or isn’t safe, ask them to tell you the four basic rules of gun safety. If they can’t or won’t, then you’ll know they’re more interested in demagoguery than they are in promoting safe gun handling.

2) Guns Are Inanimate Objects

“Guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” may be widely mocked by ignorant gun controllers, but it’s true (also true is the fact that guns don’t kill people, bullets do, if we want to be really pedantic). A gun cannot load a magazine by itself. A gun cannot secure a loaded magazine by itself. An empty gun cannot chamber a round or rack the slide by itself. A gun cannot pull a trigger by itself. Each of these actions requires agency by a human being.

These are all reasons why I personally dislike the term “accidental” shooting, because it suggests a lack of accountability and responsibility. A more appropriate term is “negligent” shooting, since human action is required to load a magazine, secure the loaded magazine, chamber a round, and pull the trigger. It’s why the basic gun safety rules are so important: if followed religiously, they reduce the probability of negligent shootings to 0%.

But what about intentional shootings where innocent people are targeted? Those don’t just require human agency, they require criminal intent. That’s why we try and punish criminals, rather than their weapons. It’s why gun criminals are sent to prison, while the criminals’ guns are often sent to the auction block. Criminal will is a far more dangerous and eternal thing than a simple firearm. It explains why so many criminals use illegally obtained weapons in their crimes. Why, it’s almost as though they don’t care about laws at all!

The mind that wishes to snuff out an innocent human life is far more terrifying than whatever inanimate object he or she decides to use. Don’t blame the tool; blame the individual who wishes to use it for evil.

3) Modern Guns Do Not Accidentally “Go Off”

As noted in the previous example, in order for a gun to go “BANG!” a specific sequence of events must occur, and each event requires human intervention. Modern handguns do not accidentally go “BANG!” That’s just not how guns work. Even a loaded gun, with a chambered round, with the safety off and the hammer/striker cocked will not just “go off” by itself. The trigger must still be pressed to release the firing pin or striker.

One thing that drives me nuts when I read it in the news is how a gun “went off.” Note the passive voice.

Whether intentional or not, this type of phrasing implies that the gun itself is the hazard, rather than the person handling it. Guns don’t “go off.” They’re fired by people. This is why the term “accidental shooting” is a misnomer. Unintentional, perhaps. Inadvertent, maybe. But guns don’t accidentally end up in a state that allows them to be fired, and they certainly don’t fire themselves.

A better term is “negligent shooting.” Negligence is the proper characterization because it accurately reflects the fact that an individual neglected to follow each of the basic gun safety rules. And for gun owners, the term negligence helps foster the proper mindset for gun handling: if this weapon is discharged, it is because of something you did. Therefore, don’t ever allow your weapon to be discharged unless it is to neutralize a mortal threat to you or another innocent individual.

4) “Semi-Automatic” And “Automatic” Are Not Synonyms

If you want people to understand that you have no clue what you’re talking about, by all means conflate “automatic” and “semi-automatic.”

An automatic firearm is one in which a single trigger pull can discharge multiple rounds. In the U.S., civilians are virtually banned from owning automatic weapons. If a truly automatic weapon is used in a crime, you can almost guarantee that it was obtained illegally.

In contrast to an automatic weapon, a semi-automatic weapon will at most discharge one round with a single trigger pull. What makes it semi-automatic rather than fully automatic is that the recoil generated from firing one round results in the weapon chambering another round, assuming the magazine is not empty, but without firing the second round (as opposed to a fully automatic, which both chambers and fires multiple rounds with one trigger pull). If we’re being really technical, a semi-automatic weapon is one in which a single trigger pull 1) discharges at most one round, 2) cocks the hammer or striker after the round is fired, and 3) chambers an additional round after the weapon discharges a round and extracts/ejects the shell casing, all without requiring any additional mechanical energy from the gun’s operator.

The second part of that definition is important because it is what differentiates a typical revolver from a semi-automatic pistol. Although a revolver is capable of chambering a round after a previous one is fired, the hammer must still be cocked by the user before another round can be fired (either via a double-action trigger or a manual cocking of the hammer).

5) “Clip” And “Magazine” Are Not Synonyms

If you watch the news or movies in which firearms are used, you’ll often hear the terms “clip” and “magazine” used interchangeably. They’re not synonyms, though. Here’s a helpful illustration of the difference:

A clip is exactly that: it clips rounds together so that they can more easily be fed into a magazine or directly into a weapon’s chamber. A clip has zero moving parts. All it does is clip ammunition together.

Magazines contain moving parts, most often springs. They are inserted directly into and remain in a firearm, unlike clips. The springs move another round into position so it can be chambered when necessary. In a traditional semi-automatic pistol, when a round is stripped from the top of a magazine and chambered by the rack sliding forward, the spring-powered magazine automatically pushes the next round into position to be chambered. When the round in the chamber is fired, the recoil propels the slide backwards and ejects the spent shell casing. Then, as the slide moves forward into battery, it strips the top round from the magazine and inserts it into the chamber.

This animation of the firing cycle of a 1911-style pistol clearly illustrates how a semi-automatic pistol generally works:





6) Gun Safeties Can And Will Fail

Although it’s become something of a cliche in firearm handling courses, it is absolutely true that “the only safety that matters is the one between your ears.” Like any inanimate object, no gun is foolproof. Mechanical devices can and will fail. If you rely on your gun’s external safety as a substitute for following the four basic gun safety rules, you’re going to get yourself into trouble. This doesn’t mean gun safeties are bad. They’re not at all. They’re incredibly valuable. But a mechanical safety in and of itself is not a guaranteed way to prevent a negligent discharge. Some manufacturers such as Glock do not even install external mechanical safeties on their firearms. The only way to prevent a negligent discharge from a firearm is to follow the four basic gun safety rules 100 percent of the time.

7) So-Called “Smart Gun” Technology Is Not Reliable

So-called “smart guns” are all the rage among gun controllers these days. What are “smart guns”? In theory, they’re guns outfitted with technology that renders the weapon inoperable if it is wielded by anyone other than its lawful owner. In theory, “smart gun” technology sounds like an interesting concept. But some gun controllers want to make it mandatory:

There has been renewed interest in smart guns since the Newtown school shooting, which reinvigorated the gun-control debate. However, there is immense pressure not to be the first to sell them. That’s because of a New Jersey law passed in 2002 known as the Childproof Handgun Law, which says that all guns sold in New Jersey must be state-approved smart guns within three years of a smart gun being sold anywhere in the country. The goal was to make smart guns mandatory as soon as the technology existed. Officially, no smart gun has been sold in the US yet — meaning if Raymond had sold one, it would have triggered the clause in New Jersey.

@johntabin @seanmdav Not so. Smart gun technology advances gun safety. Yet it encounters severe opposition by the gun lobby that wishes,



David Frum (@davidfrum) November 5, 2014

In practice, the unproven and unreliable technology demanded by gun controllers is a disaster waiting to happen. As noted in a previous example, mechanical safeties fail. So do electronic devices. Now imagine putting an electronic device subject to radio interference in charge of whether a gun can be fired. Heck, simple biometric gun safes are not even 100% reliable. Batteries fail. Software fails. Circuits short out. Fingerprint readers can quickly become unreliable. And what happens if your smart-gun triggering wristband is shot or otherwise damaged by a home invader? You and your family are completely out of luck.

There’s a reason there’s absolutely zero market for “smart guns” among people who actually understand how guns work: the technology is completely unreliable. The basic gun safety rules, though, are airtight. It shouldn’t surprise us that people who don’t even understand basic gun mechanics or safety rules want to mandate completely unreliable technology.

This isn’t to say the underlying technology isn’t useful. It can be. One police force is considering using the technology to alert the department whenever an officer’s gun is unholstered or discharged.

If individuals or organizations decide on their own to implement a new, untested technology, they’re free to do so. But mandating unreliable “smart gun” technology is a very dumb thing to do.

8) Handing Someone A Badge Doesn’t Make Him A Good Shooter

Accurately shooting a gun is not like using a camera. It’s not a simple “point and click.” Like any skill — yes, shooting is a skill — shooting a gun accurately requires constant practice and discipline. Firearm presentation, sight acquisition and alignment, trigger discipline, and follow-through are each skills that must be painstakingly developed before one can consider himself an accurate and reliable shooter. Shooters who can go from the holster to breaking multiple shots on target in less than a second didn’t get there by accident. It likely took hundreds of hours and thousands of rounds of practice.

The same is true for police. The badge does not confer magical shooting abilities. And contrary to much public opinion, the level of training received by most everyday patrolmen is not close to being enough to make an individual a highly reliable and accurate shooter. Moreover, the annual or semi-annual firearms qualifications required in most departments are hardly stringent. Here are the qualification standards for Wisconsin law enforcement officials:

Over 40 percent of rounds are fired within 3 yards. Over 85 percent are within 7 yards. Officers are required to fire only 12 shots at a distance of 15 yards or greater, and only ten of those must hit a target. Quite simply, you do not need to be a proficient shooter to pass a test like that.

In 2007, the New York Times wrote about systemic problems with police shooting accuracy:

New York City police statistics show that simply hitting a target, let alone hitting it in a specific spot, is a difficult challenge. In 2006, in cases where police officers intentionally fired a gun at a person, they discharged 364 bullets and hit their target 103 times, for a hit rate of 28.3 percent, according to the department’s Firearms Discharge Report. The police shot and killed 13 people last year.



In 2005, officers fired 472 times in the same circumstances, hitting their mark 82 times, for a 17.4 percent hit rate. They shot and killed nine people that year.



In all shootings — including those against people, animals and in suicides and other situations — New York City officers achieved a 34 percent accuracy rate (182 out of 540), and a 43 percent accuracy rate when the target ranged from zero to six feet away. Nearly half the shots they fired last year were within that distance.

Does this mean that all cops are terrible shots? Absolutely not. Cops who want to be good shooters, rather than cops who wear a gun only because they have to, are generally terrific shooters. The police officers that I’ve competed with in defensive pistol shooting competitions are incredible. Many enjoyed shooting to begin with and became cops because the job gave them the ability to practice and develop their skills as shooters more than any other line of work. But they didn’t become highly proficient shooters just because they chose to wear a uniform and a badge. It’s because they put in the time necessary to develop and maintain their shooting skills.

Unfortunately, police budget constraints make this type of training unfeasible for most departments.

9) The “AR” In “AR-15” Doesn’t Stand For “Assault Rifle”

That’s right. The “AR” in the name of the popular AR-15 doesn’t stand for “assault rifle.” It stands for ArmaLite, the company that developed the rifle platform back in the 1950’s. Today, the “AR-15” trademark is owned by Colt, which bought the rights to the AR-10 and AR-15 from ArmaLite in 1959. However, the term AR-15 has come to represent just about any type of conventional M4- or M16-variant rifle.

10) High Capacity Magazine Bans Are Completely Counterproductive

In the wake of the Aurora movie theater shooting in Colorado, lawmakers in the state swiftly enacted bans on high capacity ammunition magazines. Just as that state’s rush to close the inaccurately named “gunshow loophole” following the Columbine massacre failed to prevent the Aurora shooting, so to will the magazine ban fail to prevent future mass shootings.

Member of Congress pushing for a ban on high capacity magazines does not appear to understand what a magazine IS. http://t.co/15uDAh6REs



Scott McGrew (@ScottMcGrew) April 4, 2013

Why? For the same reason that gun bans don’t prevent criminals from possessing and using guns: they don’t care about gun laws. A psychopath intent on murdering a roomful of innocent people is not going to care if it’s illegal to possess a 16-round magazine. And there’s a good chance he’s going to bring with him an armory of high capacity magazines loaded to capacity.

That’s not the case for people who obey laws, though. The woman who lawfully carries a concealed weapon to protect herself from would-be rapists is going to follow the law, because she doesn’t want to put herself in jeopardy. Furthermore, the desire to legally carry a concealed weapon already puts a law-abiding citizen at a disadvantage against a murderer who’s armed to the teeth. How? Because the requirement of concealment almost by definition limits the amount of ammunition you can carry. In most cases, that means one magazine in the gun along with one spare magazine.

As the police statistics above showed, a few rounds may not be enough to neutralize multiple attackers. In some cases, you could empty a magazine against an assailant without neutralizing the threat (this is especially true against attackers who may be hopped up on drugs or wearing body armor). Contrary to the movies, merely shooting someone in the chest may not immediately incapacitate the threat. Only a direct shot to the central nervous system can instantly incapacitate an attacker (generally a shot inside the triangle formed by the eyes and nose), and those shots are incredibly difficult, especially against a target that may be moving.

Just like gun bans serve only to prevent law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves, high capacity magazine bans put lawful gun carriers at a distinct disadvantage against well-armed assailants. As a result, it’s really not all surprising that Colorado, which twice voted for Barack Obama, voted to oust the Democratic state Senate president who pushed through that state’s mag ban.

11) “Shoot To Wound” Is Absurd And Dangerous

Whenever you hear about a fatal police shooting, you’re almost guaranteed to see a commentator wonder aloud why police aren’t trained to “shoot to wound.” The simple answer is that it’s because the police aren’t idiots. “Shoot to wound” is a terrible idea that also happens to be incredibly unsafe.

Do police Ever Shoot “2 Wound?”Can Arms, Legs,Shoulders b Targets?The STRESS MUST B UNBEARABLE,but is there Enough “Judgement”Training?



Cher (@cher) November 27, 2014

To begin with, a gun is considered a deadly weapon for a reason. Merely firing a gun constitutes the discharge of deadly force, and the discharge of deadly force is only legal if the person discharging it reasonably believes that his or her life (or that of an another innocent individual) is in mortal danger.

Now, if you believe yourself to be in mortal danger, would you fire at someone’s foot, or hand, or knee? Of course not. Why? Because shots to those areas do not prevent an assailant from shooting back at you. Instead, you would shoot at center mass, and in the event that those shots failed to neutralize the threat, you would aim for the head and the individual’s central nervous system. The notion of “shooting to wound” flies in the face of only shooting to neutralize a mortal threat. If you believe a threat can be neutralized without the use of deadly force, then you just lost your legal justification for discharging deadly force — in this case, firing a gun.

Furthermore, shooting at a moving appendage like an arm or leg is incredibly difficult, thereby increasing the likelihood of a stray round that could injure an innocent bystander. Bullets that hit those body parts are also more likely to overpenetrate, rather than stopping inside the intended target’s body. This doesn’t mean that you should necessarily shoot to kill. You are not justified in killing a person who has been clearly neutralized and no longer poses a threat. Your goal in discharging a deadly weapon is not to end a life. Your goal is to neutralize a mortal threat.

Never discharge your weapon unless you believe your life or that of another innocent person is in imminent mortal danger. And then, if you choose to shoot, shoot to neutralize the threat.

12) Hollow Point Bullets Are Actually Safer Than Standard Full Metal Jacket Ammunition

Whenever a reporter, gun controller, screenwriter, or general ignoramus wants to make ammunition sound super dangerous and sketchy, they’ll talk about “hollow point bullets.” What these people don’t understand is that hollow points are actually far safer than standard full metal jacket (FMJ), or ball, ammunition. Why? Because they’re less likely to overpenetrate.

Because of their shape and the speed at which they’re traveling, standard bullets have a tendency to go through things like walls, cars, people, etc. The result is that while you might hit your intended target, that bullet could continue to travel through the target and into someone or something you didn’t intend to hit. This is why rule #4 of the basic safety gun rules exists.

Joe Palazzolo (@joe_palazzolo) March 25, 2014



So what does this have to do with hollow points? Because of how they’re designed — the hollow point opens upon impact, similar to how a flower blooms, thereby increasing drag and greatly reducing projectile speed — they greatly reduce the chance of overpenetration (for the same reason, hollow points are also not even close to being “armor-piercing”). How does that make them safer? The reduced bullet penetration reduces the likelihood of the bullet you fired on target hitting someone or something it wasn’t supposed to hit. Now, hollow points are definitely not safer for the person who’s hit by them. The opening of the bullet upon impact increases the effective diameter of the bullet, which leads to greater damage to the target.

That also makes it safer for all innocent bystanders, though. Why? Because you likely will not need to put as many shots on target in order to neutralize the threat. Fewer shots needed on target means fewer shots that need to be fired, which means a lower likelihood of an innocent person being hit. If you keep a gun in your home or on your body for personal protection, you absolutely should be using some type of hollow point ammunition, not FMJ ammunition, because FMJ ammunition is more likely to penetrate through walls and endanger whoever happens to be on the other side of them. FMJ ammunition should be reserved almost exclusively for the gun range.

13) Most Gun Owners Understand Gun Laws A Lot Better Than Gun Controllers Do

While I don’t doubt the desire of many gun controllers to reduce gun violence in the country, I do doubt their understanding of federal, state, and local gun laws in the U.S. A person who carries a weapon every day is far more likely to know the particulars of his or her state’s gun laws, because that person is in legal jeopardy in the event that he or she gets the law wrong. People who get paid to talk on TV for a living will not pay any real penalty if they completely screw up a state’s gun laws. An individual with a gun, however, can pay a very severe price if they don’t follow every gun law to the letter. Just ask this man, who faces a decade in prison for possessing an antique 18th-century flintlock pistol.

The controversy around the so-called “gun show loophole” is a perfect example of basic ignorance about the nation’s gun laws and their effects.

@scott_stephen 90% of Americans favor ending the gun show loophole but NRA owns enough Dems and GOPs to block even having a vote.



John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) December 27, 2014

There is no gun show loophole, period. The vast majority of gun show sales are conducted by federal firearms licensees, or FFLs, and FFL sales are strictly regulated by the federal government. Every FFL sale must be accompanied by a background check. No ifs, ands, or buts. Every sale of a firearm across state lines — for example, a resident of State A buying a gun in State B — must be processed by an FFL in the purchaser’s state. And what did we just learn about FFL sales? You can’t buy a gun from an FFL without undergoing a background check.

At the federal level (this is a key distinction), the only type of purchase that doesn’t require a background check is a private transaction between two individuals who reside in the same state. Gun shows have absolutely nothing to do with it. And if you think a federal universal background check is going to keep criminals from buying guns from each other, then I’d like to know why it hasn’t prevented them from buying drugs from each other.

14) “Universal Background Checks” Are Already The Law In Many States

What gun controllers won’t tell you is that “universal background checks” are the norm in a large number of states, notwithstanding the lack of a federal law requiring universal background checks. The gun controllers know this, but they’d rather force a one-size-fits-all federal policy one time than take the time and effort required to convince each state that it’s a good policy for that state.

Take Illinois, for example. Illinois requires universal background checks on all firearms purchases. Until recently, the city of Chicago virtually banned gun possession. Did those laws do anything to curb violent crime in the state? Of course not. Other states that require universal background checks on all firearms purchases include California and New York. How’s violent crime in those states, other than really high?

Some states require universal background checks only on handguns. North Carolina is one of those states. It requires either a concealed carry permit or a government-issued purchase permit, both of which require background checks, before an individual can purchase a handgun. In this case, two background checks are completed if you purchase a handgun from an FFL in North Carolina: once by the county that issues your purchase permit, and once by the FFL that sells you your handgun. Why do I single out North Carolina? Because it was in North Carolina that a crazed leftist armed with a handgun allegedly murdered three young Muslims over what appears to be a parking dispute. He passed his background check with flying colors.

The takeaway? No amount of gun laws or do-goodery is going to keep guns out of the hands of evil people. But those laws can keep guns out of the hands of careful, safe, law-abiding citizens who just want to protect themselves and their families. And that should be a crime.

The Obama Administration’s M855 Ammo Ban Is Blatantly Lawless,"Earlier this year, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) unexpectedly announced that it planned to characterize all M855/SS109 ammunition (5.56x45mm) as armor-piercing and ban its manufacture. The ATF claims that its authority comes from a 1986 federal statute that defines armor-piercing ammunition and gives ATF the authority to ban it.

Unfortunately, the ATF’s claim is nonsense. It has no such authority to ban a rifle round that is economical, popular (especially among those who own AR-15s), and far less lethal than many other types of common rifle ammunition on the market. The ATF does not have that authority now and did not have it back in 1986 when the law was first passed. At its core, this is a naked and lawless power grab meant to effectuate gun control that the administration is unable to obtain via the ballot box or the legislature.

Here is the precise statutory definition of “armor-piercing ammunition,” which can be found in 18 U.S.C §921(a)(17):

(17)

(A) The term ‘ammunition’ means ammunition or cartridge cases, primers, bullets, or propellent powder designed for use in any firearm.

(B) The term ‘armor piercing ammunition’ means—

(i) a projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or

(ii) a full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile.

(C) The term ‘armor piercing ammunition’ does not include shotgun shot required by Federal or State environmental or game regulations for hunting purposes, a frangible projectile designed for target shooting, a projectile which the Attorney General finds is primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes, or any other projectile or projectile core which the Attorney General finds is intended to be used for industrial purposes, including a charge used in an oil and gas well perforating device.

This definition is really, really important when comes to the issue of whether M855 ammunition is “armor-piercing” or not. Interestingly enough, the definition does not require that so-called armor-piercing ammunition actually be capable of piercing armor.

The definition includes two main parts, at least one of which must be satisfied before ammunition can be classified as being “armor-piercing” and therefore subject to prohibition. Furthermore, each of the two parts contains multiple conditions, all of which must be satisfied. You cannot mix and match requirements from the two distinct definitions (the supreme importance of this point will become clear later). We’ll look at each of the two major definitions separately.

The federal definition does not require that so-called armor-piercing ammunition actually be capable of piercing armor.

The first definition, from (B)(i) above, requires all of the following: a projectile (or bullet) must be 1) usable in a handgun, and 2) constructed entirely from “one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium.”

Is M855 ammunition usable in a handgun? Yes. Although it’s primarily a rifle round, some handgun manufacturers built handgun platforms around it. Is the M855 projectile constructed entirely from one or a combination of those materials listed in the statute? No. It’s made from a combination of steel and lead, and lead is not one of the materials listed in the statutory definition of “armor-piercing ammunition.”

What does this mean? It means that the first statutory definition for “armor-piercing ammunition” fails to apply to M855 ammunition, since both conditions were not satisfied.

But even if we grant for the sake of argument that those two conditions in the first definition appear to have been met, there’s one more problem for the ATF: the federal statute never actually defines “projectile.” Why is this important? It’s important because most ammunition is jacketed with gilding metal, usually a combination of copper and zinc. Plain copper and zinc are not included in the statutory list of restricted materials.

In its justification for banning M855, ATF states that while previous M855 cartridges had been exempt (a cartridge is the completed combination of a primer, propellant, projectile, and casing), the pre-cartridge projectile had not been exempted by ATF. If “projectile” is the material that’s inserted into a cartridge, then the the statutory definition is once again not met, because that projectile contains copper alloy in the jacket, and neither plain copper nor zinc appears in the law’s list of restricted materials. And why is it sensible to include the copper jacket in the definition of projectile? Because the jacket is projected from the gun and the shell casing when the gun is fired. It is part of the projectile.

Lest you think this represents an absurd reading of the statute, keep in mind that the law’s authors were aware of ammunition construction and the importance of a round’s jacket. How do we know? Because the second definition in the law specifically references projectile construction. It uses the term “full jacketed projectile” and then sets down clear guidelines about jacket size (full) and weight (less than 25 percent of the full weight of the projectile). The grammar of that phrase alone — full jacketed projectile — implies that a projectile can have a full jacket, partial jacket, or no jacket. The jacket and projectile are one. Furthermore, the weight guideline also mandates that the jacket and bullet be treated as a single unit for weight measurement purposes. But no matter how you slice it, the language suggests that the jacket is absolutely part of the projectile.

Overall, it is abundantly clear that the first part of the statutory definition of “armor-piercing ammunition” does not include M855 ammunition. But what about the second definition in the statute? Let’s take a look.

The second definition, from (B)(ii) above, requires all of the following: 1) a fully jacketed projectile, and 2) larger than .22 caliber, and 3) designed for use in a handgun, and 4) intended for use in a handgun, and 5) a jacket that weighs at least 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile. Let’s go item by item and see if each condition is satisfied.

Is the 5.56x45mm M855/SS109 projectile fully jacketed? While there seems to be a fair amount of debate about this, we’ll go with yes, since the steel tip of the projectile is generally covered by the copper jacket. Is it larger than .22 caliber? Again, even though there’s debate about this (.22 caliber is never defined, and the M855 round is actually smaller than other variants of .22 ammunition on the market; the lack of a third decimal point is also problematic), we’ll go with yes again. So far the first two conditions of this particular definition appear to have been satisfied. But here comes the most important: was the M855 round designed for use in a handgun?

The answer is no. Absolutely not. Not even close.

On no planet can it be possibly argued that it was developed for handgun use. How do we know? Because the 5.56x45mm round was designed and manufactured long before any handguns that could fire it even existed. It was developed in the late 1950s and 1960s for use in rifles and was finally standardized by the United States for use in 1963 for the ArmaLite M16. The M855 round, a variant of the 5.56x45mm, is the U.S. version of the Belgian SS109 round, which was developed by the Belgian company Fabrique Nationale, or FN, in the 1970’s. The FN SS109 was also designed and exclusively intended for use in a rifle. The United States first put the M855 to use in the M16A2 platform in the early 1980s. Handgun platforms capable of firing the round were not developed until long after the M855 round was designed, developed, manufactured, and sold. The ATF admitted as much when it wrote that handguns capable of firing the M855/SS109 “were not commercially available when the armor piercing ammunition exemption was granted in 1986.”

The 5.56x45mm round was designed and manufactured long before any handguns that could fire it even existed.

You read that correctly: the ATF plainly admits that the round could not possibly have been designed for a handgun, right before the agency wrongfully assumes the authority to mix and match conditions from the two different definitions in the statute.

This sleight of hand actually forms the entire foundation of the ATF’s power grab: since one condition in one part of one definition states that ammunition might be “armor-piercing” if it can be used in a handgun, the ATF claims it has the power to regulate and ban that ammunition. A plain reading of the statute clearly shows that ATF’s interpretation is nonsense.

We know that M855 fails to meet part three of the second definition of armor-piercing ammunition. But what about part four? Was this round intended by its manufacturer to be used as a handgun round? No, it wasn’t, for the same reasons it wasn’t designed to be a handgun round. And what about part five? Is the bullet jacket’s weight equal to or greater than 25 percent of the weight of the bullet itself? Yes. Although several posts floating around state that the jacket on a 62gr green tip bullet weighs only 10.8gr, which is less than 25 percent of the full 62gr weight, it appears that the actual weight is much closer to 20gr, or more than 30 percent of the total weight of the projectile.

However, because parts three (designed to be used in a handgun) and four (intended to be used in a handgun) of the definition do not apply to the M855 round, the fact that parts one, two, and five are satisfied is irrelevant. The statute clearly and deliberately uses the word “and,” which means each and every condition must be satisfied.

The first definition in the statute fails to apply to the M855 round, and the second definition in the statute fails as well. Therefore, it must mean that the ATF does not have the statutory authority to characterize the M855 round as armor-piercing and certainly does not have the authority to ban its manufacture. Because the M855 round is not composed entirely of the materials specified in the statute, it is irrelevant that it can be used in a handgun. And because the round was never designed or intended to be used in a handgun, it is irrelevant that it is fully jacketed, is larger than .22 caliber, and has a jacket weight that exceeds 25 percent of the projectile’s total weight.

Because the M855 round is not composed entirely of the materials specified in the statute, it is irrelevant that it can be used in a handgun.

Even though the ATF currently claims that the round was always covered under the 1986 law defining armor-piercing ammunition and that the agency only temporarily exempted it from regulation and prohibition, that is also false. ATF never had that authority. It was the clear language of the statute, not the ATF’s good graces, that excluded M885 ammo from its definition.

The ATF didn’t have the authority then, and the Obama administration doesn’t have the authority now, to ban this ammunition. It is a lawless power grab that should be treated as such by each court that is given an opportunity to review it.

The nonsense of the legal theory of the ATF — that a round that can be used in a handgun counts as “armor-piercing” and is therefore subject to prohibition — is especially problematic when you note that it can be extended to nearly ever single type of firearm ammunition on the market. Know what other types of popular ammunition can be fired in a handgun? 9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP. The list goes on and on. Even shotgun rounds could theoretically be banned since there are handgun platforms capable of firing buckshot, birdshot, or slugs. Furthermore, all the ATF would need to do to justify a ban on all rifle ammo would be to develop a handgun, any handgun, capable of firing each caliber of rifle ammunition. There is no limiting principle whatsoever to the tortured legal logic of the ATF’s rule on M855 ammunition.

Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery and later helped lead the abolitionist movement, once remarked, “A man’s rights rest in three boxes. The ballot box, jury box, and the cartridge box.” Unfortunately, Barack Obama’s administration apparently wants to ban the latter without ever putting it to the test at the former.

Surprise! The New York Times Is Lying About The NRA,"In a scathing editorial this morning, the New York Times editorial board excoriated the National Rifle Association (NRA) for banning all working weapons from its annual convention in Nashville this weekend:

Seventy-thousand people are expected to attend the National Rifle Association’s convention opening on Friday in Tennessee, and not one of them will be allowed to come armed with guns that can actually shoot. After all the N.R.A. propaganda about how “good guys with guns” are needed to be on guard across American life, from elementary schools to workplaces, the weekend’s gathering of disarmed conventioneers seems the ultimate in hypocrisy.

There’s only one problem: this claim is blatantly false. It is a complete lie. There is no ban, NRA-instituted or otherwise, on the carrying of working weapons at the NRA convention in Nashville this year.

Contrary to the claims of the New York Times editorial board, anyone who is licensed to carry in the state of Tennessee — including those with carry permits from states that have a reciprocity agreement with Tennessee — may carry working, loaded weapons at the convention in accordance with state and local laws. The removal of firing pins from display guns is a commonplace practice for most gun trade shows.

The NRA even explicitly states on its website that convention-goers may carry their weapons in accordance with state and local firearms laws:

During the 2015 NRA Annual Meeting & Exhibits, lawfully carried firearms will be permitted in the Music City Center with the proper license in accordance with Tennessee law. Bridgestone Arena prohibits the possession of firearms. When carrying your firearm, remember to follow all federal, state and local laws.

In the state of Tennessee, as in many states, owners or managers of private property have the discretion to ban weapons on their property. Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena, which will host several musical acts during the NRA convention, has decided that it doesn’t want weapons on its property. The Music City Center, where the bulk of convention activities will take place, has instituted no such ban. The result? Convention attendees with valid concealed carry permits may carry their loaded weapons, firing pins (or strikers) and all, in accordance with state and local laws.

The Tennesseean, a local paper managed by the same company that publishes USA Today, published an article three days ago explicitly stating that properly permitted convention attendees were welcome to carry their weapons at the convention:

Around the center workers were beginning to put up the first traffic blockades before the three-day convention starts Friday. More than 70,000 people are expected to attend.



Some probably will bring their own guns to the conference. So where can they take them?



The NRA and Music City Center confirmed that gun owners with the proper carry permits can bring their guns into the center this weekend.



Music City Center spokeswoman Mary Brette Clippard said its policy is to follow state law and to allow the organizations holding events there to decide whether they wish for people to carry their guns inside. She said Tuesday that NRA has no problem with gun owners with the proper gun permits bringing their weapons inside.

Even if you know nothing about guns or gun laws, a criticism which appears to apply to every member of the New York Times editorial board, these facts were available to anyone with a brain and access to Google three days ago. And yet the NYT couldn’t bring itself to acknowledge these facts. Instead, the willfully ignorant fools who run the paper’s opinion section felt comfortable following the completely dishonest lead of Shannon Watts, a career public relations staffer who’s currently serving as Michael Bloomberg’s go-to hack on gun issues:

Rather than doing basic research to confirm actual facts before publishing them, the NYT editorial board decided to just copy and paste the uninformed lunatic ravings of a paid PR hack.

Unfortunately, this kind of behavior isn’t new to Andrew Rosenthal, the man who runs the editorial page for the New York Times. Rosenthal has a long history of deliberately misstating facts in order to make his enemies — people who aren’t hardcore liberals — look bad. Rosenthal was the individual who falsely reported in 1992 that President George H. W. Bush had never before seen an everyday supermarket scanner. Rosenthal’s lie was so blatant that even his fellow reporters thought it was a “cheap shot.”

Then there’s the deceptive headline Rosenthal’s team added to a Mitt Romney op-ed about Detroit’s financial troubles: “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.” Romney never said that or anything close to it, but properly reporting facts has never really been Rosenthal’s forte. He is not a reporter; he is a liberal activist with a soapbox and a megaphone.

Sadly, today’s faceplant by Rosenthal and the New York Times editorial board should really come as no surprise. They don’t care about facts. They don’t care about accuracy. And they certainly don’t care if their lies about guns and the NRA have no basis in reality. The New York Times has an agenda, and that agenda has nothing to do with reporting the truth.

UPDATE: The New York Times has issued a two-sentence correction to its editorial, but has thus far refused to retract the piece, which depended entirely on the factual misrepresentation. Even more amusing is the fact that the second sentence of its two-sentence correction itself needs to be corrected.

The Bridgestone Arena, a privately owned and managed entity that has chosen to prohibit firearms on its property, is not a “main convention venue.” Of the more than three dozen events listed on the NRA convention schedule, only one–a Saturday night concert featuring Alan Jackson and Jeff Foxworthy–is scheduled to take place at Bridgestone Arena.

Vince Vaughn: ‘Banning Guns Is Like Banning Forks To Stop Making People Fat’,"In a new interview with GQ magazine that was published earlier today, actor Vince Vaughn went out of his way to offer unconditional support of the Second Amendment. The True Detective star said the Second Amendment isn’t about “duck hunting,” it’s about the right of individuals to “resist the supreme power of a corrupt and abusive government.”

Vaughn also added that there’s a reason so many mass shootings in the U.S. happen in so-called gun-free zones:

I support people having a gun in public full stop, not just in your home. We don’t have the right to bear arms because of burglars; we have the right to bear arms to resist the supreme power of a corrupt and abusive government. It’s not about duck hunting; it’s about the ability of the individual. It’s the same reason we have freedom of speech. It’s well known that the greatest defence against an intruder is the sound of a gun hammer being pulled back. All these gun shootings that have gone down in America since 1950, only one or maybe two have happened in non-gun-free zones. Take mass shootings. They’ve only happened in places that don’t allow guns. These people are sick in the head and are going to kill innocent people. They are looking to slaughter defenceless human beings. They do not want confrontation. In all of our schools it is illegal to have guns on campus, so again and again these guys go and shoot up these f***ing schools because they know there are no guns there. They are monsters killing six-year-olds.

How to stop monsters from waltzing into gun-free zones and shooting up innocent people? Easy, according to Vaughn: allow adults who work in schools to carry firearms. GQ specifically asked Vaughn if believed guns should be allowed in schools:

Of course. You think the politicians that run my country and your country don’t have guns in the schools their kids go to? They do. And we should be allowed the same rights. Banning guns is like banning forks in an attempt to stop making people fat. Taking away guns, taking away drugs, the booze, it won’t rid the world of criminality.

Recent polls show that most Americans agree with Vince Vaughn when it comes to gun rights and the Second Amendment. In a Pew Research poll that was released in December, 57 percent of adult respondents said guns “protect people from becoming crime victims,” compared to only 38 percent who said guns “put people’s safety at risk.”",https://thefederalist.com/2015/06/01/vince-vaughn-banning-guns-is-like-banning-forks-to-stop-making-people-fat/,2015-06-01
Lack Of Gun Control Didn't Cause The Charleston Shooting,"It’s like clockwork: any time there’s a tragedy or mass act of violence, you can count on someone using the event to push his or her political agenda.

Nine people were murdered at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in downtown Charleston, South Carolina, yesterday. It appears that most, if not all, of the victims in Charleston were black, while the shooter, who was apprehended by police earlier today in North Carolina, is white. While law enforcement officials are yet to comment on the shooter’s motive, it seems certain the shooting was racially motivated.

Evil knows no color. My grandmother Alberta King was shot down & killed by a crazed black man while playing the organ in Church #AMEShooting



Alveda King (@AlvedaCKing) June 18, 2015

Many have referred to the shooting as a tragedy, but that word is not adequate to capture the evil that was perpetrated on nine innocent men and women who wished only to worship in peace. It was a massacre, a slaughter, a blatant act of terrorism by an individual who deserves not to have his name and visage plastered all over the news, but to rot in obscurity.

Sadly, at least one prominent lawmaker decided that rather than honoring the helpless victims of the shooting, he would use the event to honor his own political agenda:

I do not know how much longer we can thwart the views of the American public on taking reasonable gun safety measures.



Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) June 18, 2015

With all due respect to the addled senior senator from Nevada, his “exercise bands” have victimized more people than my guns have.

In Reid’s defense, he didn’t develop the strategy of politicizing anything and everything and everything under the sun. The credit for that belongs to President Barack Obama’s first chief of staff, who famously announced that crises were a great opportunity to push your agenda on a populace that really wants nothing to do with it. Reid was just following orders:

“You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,” declared Rahm Emmanuel, who currently serves as mayor of one of the deadliest cities in America. “And what I mean by that it’s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.”

To politicians like Harry Reid, it doesn’t matter how many people are dead, so long as a crisis presents an opportunity to keep his political agenda alive. However, let’s set aside for the moment the crass and calculated behavior of the classless Democratic congressional leader and examine whether his point was valid. Was the Charleston shooting really caused by a lack of gun control in South Carolina?

In a word? No. Not at all. Not even close. In fact, South Carolina has some of the strictest gun control laws in the Southeastern U.S. Open carry, for example, is banned outright. South Carolina is one of only five states in the entire country that bans the open carry of legally owned firearms. The only other states that currently ban open carry outright are California, Illinois, New York, and Florida.

In order to legally carry any weapon in South Carolina, you are required by law to obtain a concealed carry permit.

And what are individuals required to undergo in order to obtain that permit that allows them to legally carry a weapon? State law requires all concealed carry permit applicants to undergo a criminal background check. They must submit two sets of fingerprints to state law enforcement agencies. After taking a state-approved course on gun laws and safe gun usage, applicants must then pass both a written and live fire test.

A ban on open carry? No possession without a concealed carry permit? Mandatory coursework? Mandatory background checks? Fingerprints on file with law enforcement? Gun-free zones?

South Carolina’s gun law regime sounds remarkably similar to the agenda gun controllers have been demanding for years.

But those requirements aren’t the main reason why Harry Reid’s ignorant politicization of the Charleston shooting is so absurd. The main reason is that South Carolina explicitly bans concealed carry in churches and houses of worship. On top of all the things the state requires individuals to do in order to legally carry firearms, South Carolina law also declares churches to be official gun-free zones.

Does this mean the massacre could have been prevented if South Carolina recognized the God-given right of individuals to defend themselves regardless of their location? I have no idea, and neither does anybody else. But what we do know is that nine innocent men and women were slaughtered in a mandatory gun-free zone by an evil madman wielding a gun.

More gun laws won’t prevent evil people from doing evil things. Human nature cannot be legislated away. No amount of laws can ever eliminate evil acts committed by evil men. But gun control laws like those in South Carolina certainly can eliminate the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves from those who intend to do evil. And that’s a tragedy.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/06/18/no-a-lack-of-gun-control-didnt-cause-the-charleston-shooting/,2015-06-18
So What Do Liberals Actually Want To Do About Guns?,"Do something about guns.

In his statement on the Charleston shooting, President Barack Obama called on congressional leaders to “come to grips” with their positions on guns, because “it is in our power to do something about it.” This is a refrain we hear after every gruesome mass shooting. Today, Eugene Robinson writes that “the one thing about which there can be no debate is that he had a gun.” The only way we can change things is to hold “presidential candidates of both parties accountable” to do something about them.

Ok. What?

Earlier this year, Dylann Roof was arrested and charged for felony possession of the prescription-only drug Suboxone. His case is still pending. Federal law prohibits people with pending felony charges from obtaining firearms. Yet, here’s how a glaringly misleading Washington Post headline characterizes this federal prohibition: “The legal loophole that allowed Dylann Roof to get a gun.”

The piece, you may not be surprised, doesn’t offer a single “legal loophole” that allowed Dylann Roof to obtain a gun. It only offers up examples of laws that Roof ignored. And, as my colleague Sean Davis has argued, lack of gun control laws didn’t cause the Charleston shooting.

Though we don’t know yet where the gun Rood used came from, it was almost surely illegally in his hands. There is zero evidence Roof had a concealed carry permit issued by the state, and such a permit is required in order to possess any time of firearm in public (open carry is banned in the state). South Carolina law also prohibits drug addicts from obtaining or possessing firearms, and numerous news reports suggest Roof was likely addicted to both prescription and illegal narcotics.

Some reports allege that Roof’s father gave him a .45-caliber pistol for his birthday earlier this year (in order for this type of purchase to be legal, Dylann Roof would have needed to undergo a background check via the dealer from whom the weapon was purchased before taking possession or ownership of it). This kind of gift is prohibited by law, and the father could face up to 10 years in jail and a $250,000 fine. Not to mention, as Charles Cooke points out at NRO:

Even if we presume that the problem was that the killer wasn’t picked up by the system (it wasn’t), Obama’s much-vaunted “universal background check” proposal would not have applied here, either. “Toomey-Manchin,” the failed bill that contained the measure, explicitly exempted all transfers between family members and close friends — not, you will note, because it contained a “loophole” or a “typo” or an “oversight,” but because such exemptions were deemed to be “common sense.”

One of Roof’s friends claims that he stole the gun from his mother. Also illegal. Going into a church with a gun without permission was also illegal. Roof didn’t care about the law. Violent criminals rarely do.

CNN is now reporting that Roof purchased the .45-caliber gun last April at a Charleston gun store. If this is true, it would mean that either someone gave it to him illegally (the owner could lose his store and face criminal sanction), or it could mean the very background check system demanded by gun controllers didn’t work.

Here is Obama’s gun control initiative. It consists of 23 executive actions and three presidential memoranda. But not a single one of these proposals would have stopped what happened in Charleston, or for that matter, most of the mass shootings we’ve seen in this country over the past few years.

What law could Congress pass to stop the next Roof? Just saying “Do something about guns” is a vacuous political assertion. It’s an old argument, but the fact is that these killers prove gun control laws rarely stop criminals (it’s noteworthy that Roof was apprehended not by pacifists with happy thoughts and outstretched arms, but by law enforcement officials with firearms at the ready). The only way to stop these kinds of shootings is to confiscate all guns—a nonstarter politically, unfeasible in reality, and, by the way, completely unconstitutional.

Considering the instances of mass violence in nations that do have strict gun laws, this seems to be a futile discussion anyway. None of the gun control discussion takes into account the countless alternative ways someone like Roof, a killer who clearly does not care about legal consequences, could have gotten his hands on a gun if he was motivated.

If your contention is that we have to do something, and that the something you propose does nothing to actually prevent mass shootings, then you’re just using a tragedy for a broader political agenda.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/06/19/so-what-do-liberals-want-to-do-about-guns/,2015-06-19
"The Second Amendment Isn't About Hunting, Josh Earnest","Following last week’s shooting in Charleston, White House press secretary Josh Earnest implied during his daily press briefing that Americans don’t need to own weapons that aren’t used for hunting.

“You don’t need an assault rifle to go hunting,” Earnest said. “It’s not part of your family heritage.”

“You don’t need an assault rifle to go hunting,” says Josh Earnest, it’s not ""part of your family heritage""



Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) June 22, 2015

Whether his mischaracterization of the Second Amendment and its defenders was intentional or merely based on ignorance of this country’s history and laws, we can’t say. But his statement was most certainly ignorant on multiple counts.

For starters, I’m not sure Earnest understands what an assault rifle is. The term “assault rifle” is not a catch-all to describe any gun you think is scary; it actually has a very specific meaning. The term “assault rifle” is almost always used to describe a selective fire weapon designed for military use: namely, a firearm that is capable of fully automatic fire (one trigger pull, multiple rounds fired) as well as semi-automatic fire (one trigger pull, one round fired and another one chambered so that the gun is capable of firing again with another pull of the trigger).

An AR-15, for example, is not an “assault rile” (The AR actually stands for ArmaLite, the weapon platform’s original manufacturer). True assault rifles — those that are capable of fully automatic fire — are heavily regulated and in incredibly short supply among civilians. You cannot simply walk into a gun store and buy one. You must navigate a lengthy maze of federal regulations, undergo a federal background check, pay a hefty tax, and provide a full set of all ten fingerprints.

Given the actual definition of “assault rifle,” as well as the context of Earnest’s statement, it seems rather clear that he was referring merely to scary-looking guns, not fully automatic rifles designed for military use. Unfortunately, his misuse of the term was not the most ignorant part of his statement.

The Second Amendment exists not to put a target on the backs of deer and rabbits, but to give notice to tyrants.

No, the most ignorant aspect of his statement was the implication that gun rights exist just to encourage hunting, which belies a total ignorance of both this nation’s history and its governing legal document. The Second Amendment exists not to put a target on the backs of deer and rabbits, but to give notice to tyrants, whether they hold government office or hold people up at ATMs, that violent consequences may await those who would deprive others of their rights.

Many gun controllers, like those who won’t even acknowledge hunting as a proper use of arms, attempt to point to the reference to a “well-regulated militia” in the Constitution as proof that firearms should be heavily regulated and only in the hands of those serving in the military. That interpretation, however, depends on a misunderstanding of what “well-regulated” and “militia” meant at the time the Bill of Rights was authored and ratified.

“Well-regulated” did not mean “controlled by the government.” It actually meant something in the neighborhood of capable or trained. Disciplined, perhaps. The term “militia” did not mean a standing federal army. It instead referred to the population of all able-bodied adult men. The population was itself the militia.

“[W]hat is the milita?” asked George Mason during debate about the ratification of the Constitution. “It is the whole people.”

And in order for the population to retain its ability to use firearms to preserve the “security of a free State,” they had to have ready access to firearms. In their wisdom, the Founders decided that such access included both ownership (keep) and personal possession (bear) of those firearms.

In 1788, Mason expounded on the intent of those who would disarm free citizens:

[W]hen the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man, who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually, by totally disusing and neglecting the militia.

It is not enough to merely own firearms or have them around. One must also be proficient in their use.

The Second Amendment, for good reason, makes no reference to hunting or sport. Yes, those are obviously fine uses of firearms (and they clearly allow hunters and competitive shooters to develop and maintain their skills), but they are not the reason our Constitution recognizes our God-given right to defend ourselves from those who would forcibly take our liberties from us. If you don’t believe me or George Mason, often referred to as the father of the Bill of Rights, you need only look to civil rights icons like Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, or Martin Luther King, Jr.

Douglass, an escaped slave and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment, knew full well what happened when an oppressive government removed from its citizenry the right to bear arms.

“[T]he liberties of the American people [are] dependent upon the ballot-box, the jury-box, and the cartridge-box,” Douglass wrote, referring to the right to vote, be tried by a fair and representative jury, and own and carry firearms (“cartridge” box was a reference to ammunition). “[W]ithout these no class of people could live and flourish in this country.”

An oppressor likes nothing more than for the oppressed to be defenseless.

After the U.S. passed the Fugitive Slave Act, an 1850 law that required all captured slaves to be returned to their masters, Douglass again referenced the power of the firearm to preserve one’s God-given rights. To Douglass, the only “true remedy” to the execrable fugitive slave law was “a good revolver, a steady hand, and a determination to shoot down any man attempting to kidnap” an escaped slave.

“Every slave hunter who meets a bloody death in his infernal business is an argument in favor of the manhood of our race,” he added.

Harriet Tubman, an escaped slave made famous for her utilization of the Underground Railroad network that helped slaves safely escape to freedom, was also a believer in the right to defend oneself with arms, if necessary. She carried a revolver on her person.

Martin Luther King, Jr., whose life was cut short by an assassin’s bullet, applied in 1956 for a concealed carry permit from the state of Alabama after his home was firebombed. His application was denied by local police, who at that time were loath to acknowledge a black man’s right to defend himself.

Gun control laws were liberally used during the Jim Crow era. An oppressor likes nothing more than for the oppressed to be defenseless. The three essential boxes of liberty cited by Douglass — the ballot box, the jury box, and ammo box — were each specifically targeted by Jim Crow proponents. Poll taxes were used to keep blacks from voting. All-white juries were used to keep blacks from having fair trials. And gun control laws were used to keep blacks from protecting themselves from violence, much of it race-based.

In 1941, a Florida Supreme Court justice even noted in an opinion that one of the state’s Jim Crow-era gun control laws, even though it was written in so-called “race neutral” language, was “never intended to be applied to the white population and in practice has never been so applied.” Sadly, many courts throughout the South agreed and regularly rubber-stamped laws intended to disarm law-abiding African-Americans.

Roof didn't use an ""assault rifle."" He used a handgun. Regardless, Founding Fathers didn't base the #2A on hunting. https://t.co/JjxOuH72Gr

Men and women whose liberties could be secured only at the barrel of the gun — individuals like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman — intimately understood the importance of the Second Amendment. Douglass and Tubman knew the right to own a gun wasn’t about hunting or competitive shooting. It was about survival and the ability to guarantee one’s liberty.

If Barack Obama’s press secretary won’t listen to us, or the Founders, or the Constitution, perhaps he should listen to them instead of going off half-cocked next time.

The Australia Gun Control Fallacy,"The massacre in Charleston, South Carolina of nine members of a Bible study at a historic African-American church has horrified the entire country. Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old avowed white supremacist, has confessed to the shooting. As news of this cold-blooded murder spread, attention turned, as it inevitably (and understandably) does after such incidents, to the subject of the presence of guns in American society.

Yet it quickly became apparent that America’s moribund gun control debate would remain moribund. President Obama’s declaration that the country “needs a change in attitude” had a rote quality to it, as did Hillary Clinton’s ringing endorsement of “common-sense gun reforms.” As for Rep. Carolyn Maloney’s (D-New York) exhortation to pass legislation she recently introduced to require gun owners to obtain liability insurance on the grounds that “[i]f you want to buy that Uzi, the thinking goes, you should also have to pay for the risk that gun poses to society as a result,” the less said the better.

Calls for stronger background checks on gun purchases or a new ban on “assault weapons” have become formulaic. They’re like winding a Victrola: the record resumes spinning but it plays the same old song. Another tune in the gun-control songbook, however, is worth listening to. Not as many sing it, but nonetheless it is instructive as it shows the chorus of the media and gun-control advocates at their laziest and most uncurious, and at their most disingenuous if not dishonest. What song do I mean? I forget its name, but it goes something like this.

What Australia Did After a 1996 Shooting

After any mass shooting someone will invoke the name “Australia” and raise the question, “Can Australia’s gun-control laws be a model for the United States?” This time the honor belonged to CNN’s Laura Smith-Spark, who recounts the circumstances that led to Australia’s current gun-control laws and outlines their provisions. The laws were passed after the Port Arthur massacre, a 1996 mass shooting in which one man killed 35 people. Australia outlawed semi-automatic rifles, certain categories of shotgun, and implemented strict licensing and registration requirements. The cornerstone of its new gun-control scheme, however, was a massive gun buyback program. The Australian government purchased 650,000 to one million guns with funds raised via a special tax.

The Australian government purchased 650,000 to one million guns with funds raised via a special tax.

The Australian paradigm became popular in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings in 2012. USA Today, ABC News, Slate, the Washington Post, and the Christian Science Monitor were among the outlets that published articles urging Americans to look closely at the actions their antipodean cousins took after a similar tragedy. Nor are Americans the only ones who think we should heed the Australian example. Numerous Australians have expressed pride in their country’s gun laws by penning columns beseeching Americans to transport America’s gun laws from Down Under.

These articles all point to the reduction in the rate of gun deaths in Australia after the new system was established as its main achievement. But it is the policy that allowed that system to be established which holds the writers’ and consequently the reader’s attention. That policy is the gun buyback program, which removed up to one million weapons from Australians’ hands and homes. This was, depending on the estimate, a fifth to a third of Australia’s gun stock. The statistic does not seem remarkable as a raw number, but it is quite so when expressed as a percentage. No wonder commentators fixate on it. The problem is the way most of them tell that tale: when they describe Australia’s gun buyback program, almost none of them tell the truth about it.

The Australian Law Banned and Confiscated Guns

The crucial fact they omit is that the buyback program was mandatory. Australia’s vaunted gun buyback program was in fact a sweeping program of gun confiscation. Only the articles from USA Today and the Washington Post cited above contain the crucial information that the buyback was compulsory. The article by Smith-Spark, the latest entry in the genre, assuredly does not. It’s the most important detail about the main provision of Australia’s gun laws, and pundits ignore it. That’s like writing an article about how Obamacare works without once mentioning the individual mandate.

Yet when American gun control advocates and politicians praise Australia’s gun laws, that’s just what they’re doing. Charles Cooke of the National Review shredded the rhetorical conceit of bellowing “Australia!” last year after President Obama expressed his admiration for gun control à la Oz:

You simply cannot praise Australia’s gun-laws without praising the country’s mass confiscation program. That is Australia’s law. When the Left says that we should respond to shootings as Australia did, they don’t mean that we should institute background checks on private sales; they mean that they we should ban and confiscate guns. No amount of wooly words can change this. Again, one doesn’t bring up countries that have confiscated firearms as a shining example unless one wishes to push the conversation toward confiscation.

Cooke, of course, is right. When gun control advocates say they want Australian gun control laws in the United States, what they are really saying is that they want gun confiscation in the United States.

Democrat Leaders Support Gun Confiscation

Not all gun control proponents prevaricate. Some are forthright about their intentions. After Sandy Hook, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) stated she was considering legislation to institute a mandatory national buyback program. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also expressed an interest in confiscation, at least for assault weapons. “Confiscation could be an option. Mandatory sale to the state could be an option. Permitting could be an option — keep your gun but permit it.” Ultimately, New York did not institute confiscation, but did require registration of existing assault weapons and banned all sales of new and existing ones within the state.

Voluntary buyback initiatives are a waste of time and money. So those hostile to gun rights continue to demand mandatory confiscation.

Gun buybacks remain a popular policy with the Left because it is the only way of achieving what the Left regards as the only acceptable gun-control solution: reducing the number of guns in America. Matt Miller of the Center for American Progress proposed such a program after Sandy Hook. Conceding that anything mandatory was unlikely to pass Congress, he pitched a gun buyback program as a form of economic stimulus: give people cash for guns, which they can then spend on other things. “Make gun owners an offer they can’t refuse. Instead of a measly $200 a gun, Uncle Sam might offer $500.” Why a gun owner would accept $500 for a gun that likely cost considerably more is a question Miller unsurprisingly does not ask, let alone answer. Posing it would puncture his balloon.

Voluntary buyback initiatives are a waste of time and money. So those hostile to gun rights continue to demand mandatory confiscation. Earlier this year, the advisory commission appointed by Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy after Sandy Hook recommended banning the sale and possession of “any rifle or handgun that accepts a detachable magazine.” Commission members shrugged off suggestions that this would entail an unconstitutional prohibition on most firearms Americans own, saying it was not their job to take such niceties into account. The editorial board of the Newark Star-Ledger displayed similar “magical thinking” last September when it called for mandatory confiscation in New Jersey. Predictably, the board cited the Australian example, pointing to the drop in gun violence there as all the necessary justification for inaugurating such a program here. The editorial board concluded by bemoaning America’s “hysteria over ‘gun confiscation,’” which would keep their fantasy just that.

How Would Government Get the Guns?

On this point at least they are correct. Gun confiscation is not happening in the United States any time soon. But let’s suppose it did. How would it work? Australia’s program netted, at the low end, 650,000 guns, and at the high end, a million. That was approximately a fifth to a third of Australian firearms. There are about as many guns in America as there are people: 310 million of both in 2009. A fifth to a third would be between 60 and 105 million guns. To achieve in America what was done in Australia, in other words, the government would have to confiscate as many as 105 million firearms.

To achieve in America what was done in Australia, the government would have to confiscate as many as 105 million firearms.

The 310 million guns in America are not owned by 310 million Americans. Just how many Americans own guns, though, is controversial. The General Social Survey shows gun ownership on a four-decade downward trajectory, to 32 percent of households in 2015. A 2011 Gallup poll, on the other hand, found gun ownership at a two-decade high, with 47 percent of Americans stating they possessed a firearm. As Harry Enten of The Guardian observed, the answer to the gun ownership question seems heavily dependent on wording and methodology: phone surveys consistently find higher rates. Moreover, and this is the key point, those rates, however the surveys are conducted, have been static for at least 15 years, while background checks have soared.

A third to a half of the U.S. population translates to 105 to 160 million people. A fifth to a third of guns is 60 to 105 million. Now that we see what is required for an American buyback scheme to work on an Australian scale, we can at last we confront the question gun-control advocates never ask, let alone answer: how do you take 60 to 105 million firearms from 105 to 160 million Americans? The answer to that question is the answer to the question of whether the Australian example really is valid for America after all. If the experience of “blue” states which introduced gun regulations that have nearly universal approval on the Left is any indication, liberals are likely to experience keen disappointment.

Americans Resist Gun Confiscation

Both New York and Connecticut imposed strict new rules on the possession and sale of guns after Sandy Hook. Among these were requirements for the registration of so-called assault rifles in both states and in New York a ban on “high-capacity” magazines regardless of when they were manufactured or purchased. Compliance with the registration requirement has been modest at best, as hundreds of thousands of gun owners in both states refused to register their weapons. So far, then, the laws have been most successful in creating hundreds of thousands of lawbreakers who feel obligated to break the law.

If New York and Connecticut won’t go along, what do Democrats expect would happen in “red” states?

New York and Connecticut are two of the “bluest” states in the Union, states with staunchly liberal Democratic governors and legislatures dominated by Democrats and Northeastern Republicans who vote for gun control. Yet the residents of these states have refused to go along with the kinds of laws that gun-control advocates view as a minimum for what they would like to see adopted at the federal level. If New York and Connecticut won’t go along, what do they expect would happen in “red” states?Progressives will not answer that question because they never ask it, not even to themselves, lest somehow they say it out loud. On guns, the Left is incoherent, even insincere. It won’t say what it wants because what it wants is “a nonstarter politically, unfeasible in reality, and, by the way, completely unconstitutional”—that is, confiscation on the Australian model.Liberals refuse to confront the implications of their Australian dream because doing so would force them to give that dream up. Those implications are easy to spell out, though. A national gun buyback law would turn a significant portion of the American people into criminals. Residents of New York and Connecticut snubbed their new laws. The other 48 states are not New York and Connecticut. Civil disobedience on a national scale would ensue.

The Australia Plan Would Require Coercion and Conflict

New York and Connecticut authorities so far have shown no inclination to enforce their laws by going door to door to round up unregistered guns and arrest their owners. But that’s what would be necessary to enforce the law. A federal law, therefore, would require sweeping, national police action involving thousands of lawmen and affecting tens of millions of people. If proponents of gun control are serious about getting guns out of Americans’ hands, someone will have to take those guns out of Americans’ hands.

If proponents of gun control are serious about getting guns out of Americans’ hands, someone will have to take those guns out of Americans’ hands.

Australian-style gun control, in other words, would require government force and coercion on a massive scale. Now, progressives don’t understand the nature of coercion, so maybe they would not see police action to enforce gun confiscation as coercion. Or, perhaps, they actually do understand that their ideal form of gun control requires it, which is why they keep speaking in code and talk about “Australia” and not “wholesale confiscation.”

Let there be no doubt. Gun confiscation would have to be administered by force of arms. I do not expect that those who dismissed their fellow citizens for clinging bitterly to their guns are so naive that they imagine these people will suddenly cease their bitter clinging when some nice young man knocks on their door and says, “Hello, I’m from the government and I’m here to take your guns.” As though somehow those who daily espouse their belief that the purpose of the Second Amendment is to allow citizens to resist government oppression and tyranny will not use the Second Amendment to resist what they see as government oppression and tyranny. Or maybe they are so naive.

Many on the Left—and for this they are to be commended—have voiced their opposition to the increasing militarization of America’s police. Yet only a militarized police could enforce an Australian gun-control scheme in the United States. To take arms from men requires men with arms. There’s no other way to do it.

Yet because of the numbers of guns and men with guns in this country, any policy to remove those guns will inevitably depend on some measure of coercion, quite possibly a heavy measure. Does anyone honestly believe this country has the will or resources to seize 60 to 105 million firearms from 105 to 160 million Americans? “Progressives believe it,” I hear you answer. Yes, but the ones who do, believe this dishonestly.

Modeling Australia Means Civil War

When someone says the United States ought to adopt Australia’s gun laws as its own, he is really saying the cause of gun control is so important that he is willing to impose these laws even at the cost of violent insurrection. Make no mistake, armed rebellion would be the consequence. Armed men would be dispatched to confiscate guns, they would be met by armed men, and blood would be shed. Australia is a valid example for America only if you are willing for that blood to be spilled in torrents and rivers. To choose Australia is to choose civil war.

In an op-ed for the New York Times written after Sandy Hook, John Howard, the prime minister who oversaw the passage of Australia’s current gun laws, implored Americans to consider his nation’s example. Yet Howard fully understood the fundamental irrelevance of his country’s laws to the United States, and undermined his case by highlighting the differences between the two countries.

Our challenges were different from America’s. Australia is an even more intensely urban society, with close to 60 percent of our people living in large cities. Our gun lobby isn’t as powerful or well-financed as the National Rifle Association in the United States. Australia, correctly in my view, does not have a Bill of Rights, so our legislatures have more say than America’s over many issues of individual rights, and our courts have less control. Also, we have no constitutional right to bear arms. (After all, the British granted us nationhood peacefully; the United States had to fight for it.)

Leave aside that Australia had—and has—far fewer guns and people than we do. Forget the bits about the gun lobby or Australia’s greater urbanization. The crucial point is the final one: Australia does not have a bill of rights, and that, ultimately, is the reason it was able to confiscate guns. Australians have no constitutional right to bear arms, so seizing their weapons did not violate their constitutional rights. Gun confiscation in the United States would require violating not only the Second Amendment, but the fourth and fifth as well, and possibly even the first. Progressives generally have no compunction about breaching the Second Amendment, but one wonders how many others they would be eager to violate in their quest to nullify the second. Civil war and a tattered Constitution: such are the consequences of invoking “Australia.” It is not a model; it is a mirage.

There is an essential mendacity, whether intentional or not, to all suggestions that Australia’s system of gun control is suitable for the United States. Conjuring Australia isn’t innocent. But this trick does serve one valuable purpose: when gun controllers perform it they reveal what they truly desire. An Australian-style gun-control regime, it must be abundantly clear by now, would not only be impractical in the United States, it would be immoral. We would all be better served if American gun-control advocates acknowledged this reality and left their fantasy Down Under where it belongs.

Charleston Shooter Didn't Get His Gun Because Of A 'Loophole',"The New York Times published a blockbuster report this afternoon claiming that a legal ‘loophole’ in firearm background check laws allowed the Charleston shooter to purchase a gun he wasn’t legally allowed to have. There’s only one problem with the story: it was government incompetence, not a loophole, that rendered the background check ineffective. Here’s how the NYT described what happened:

WASHINGTON — The man accused of killing nine people in an historically black South Carolina church last month should not have been able to buy a gun, the F.B.I. said Friday in what was the latest acknowledgment of flaws in the national background check system.



A loophole in the check system allowed the man, Dylann Roof, to buy the .45-caliber handgun despite his having previously admitted to drug possession, the bureau said. Those conducting the background check did not have access to that police report.

Uh, that’s neither a “loophole” nor a “flaw[] in the national background check system.” It’s human error, namely a failure to enter data into the system. Nonetheless, Internet partisans who struggle with basic logic and reading comprehension jumped on the news:

Wow. FBI said Dylann Roof wouldn't have gotten gun if not for background check loophole http://t.co/NFyD8yS83u



Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) July 10, 2015

To its credit, the Washington Post accurately noted that the real problem was not a non-existent loophole, but simple human failure to enter the disqualifying data into the system:

Roof’s ability to purchase the gun has been a focus for investigators since the killings. Roof had been arrested for possession of narcotics in February, a felony charge that should have surfaced on criminal databases and prevented him from buying a weapon at a gun store.



But Comey indicated that the data was not properly entered in federal criminal justice computer systems, or had been mishandled by an analyst with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.



The disclosure amounts to a heartbreaking admission by the FBI director that the attack on members of a Bible study group at Emanuel AME might have been averted.

Rather than supporting the policy agenda of gun controllers, this new tidbit fatally undermines their logic, which relies entirely on the assumption that laws are sufficient to keep guns out of the hands of bad guys. Rational people, however, understand that laws can’t be enforced unless individuals enforce them. And every time you introduce a human element, you introduce the probability of human error. Nowhere is this more true than government.

As usual, we already had laws to stop the Charleston shooter. What we lacked: an Executive Branch that enforces them http://t.co/YpjPdwJIwE



Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) July 10, 2015

""Loophole"" suggests the law or process is not sufficient. ""Data entry error"" is much more accurate, and does not carry false connotation.



Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) July 10, 2015

One reason so many Second Amendment supporters carry a firearm is that they don’t believe the government will be in a position to help them if and when they’re confronted with a violent person who wishes to do them harm. As the old saying goes: when seconds count, police are only minutes away. Imagine how differently the Charleston shooting might have gone down if just one person in that church carried a gun for self-defense. Imagine how differently the horrific D.C. Metro stabbing might have gone down if the city didn’t illegally prevent its citizens from carrying a gun for self-defense purposes.

We don’t chafe at the notion of new gun laws because we want bad people to have guns or because we enjoy gun violence. We chafe at them because time and time again, like in Charleston, they completely fail to prevent bad people from getting their hands on guns. And when push comes to shove, sometimes the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/07/10/no-the-charleston-shooter-didnt-get-his-gun-because-of-a-loophole/,2015-07-10
7 Ways To Overcome Being Gun Shy,"I’m all for the Second Amendment because I’m a conservative and that’s a thing for them. I actually do think it’s weird that our government has a bunch of emotionally stressed and extremely well-equipped gun nuts parked all over the world.

Realistically, though, the chances of one of them going rogue in a way that affects me are low, so when my husband came out to me as an emotionally stable gun nut, I wasn’t thrilled. The guy loves guns: he has a lot of them, he’s good at shooting them, and he wanted me to be a part of it. Having my Second Amendment adherence bluff called has been a rough, but worthwhile, experience. Here are some tips for anyone who has internalized anti-gun culture enough to need some help getting over it.

1. Face Your Fears

Seeing a gun in my house, looking at it lying on my bed while it was being cleaned (why was he cleaning it on our bed?), watching someone pick it up and handle it, and handling it myself all made my guts scream. I had a very emotional reaction to that hunk of metal, even though I knew it was unloaded.

Go ahead and unlearn that by getting comfortable handling a gun. Practice picking it up with your finger alongside the frame outside the trigger guard, loading and unloading it with dummy ammo, and aiming it properly when it’s unloaded. Read this article, too.

2. Do the Deed

After you’ve put in some time raining on your own “guns scare me” parade, have someone teach you to shoot your gun. You’ll learn good things from this, like how hard it is to hit a target, and that the trigger pull on many guns is hard enough that firing a gun by accident is a lot less likely than preachy TV shows make it look.

My stomach turns and my elbows go wobbly when I’m aiming a live weapon at a target. I also anticipate recoil and overcompensate for it, resulting in terrible shooting. Those are things I need to know about my shooting in order to make my own gun ownership worth the trouble.

3. Reassess

If you and your gun don’t get along, you might need a trade. I had to break up with my first gun, a mean little semi-automatic, and replace it with a chubbier revolver that didn’t bite so hard. If you don’t have a gun lover in your life to help you, a local Federal Firearms License holder is a good bet. These are guys who are licensed to purchase and sell guns, and they’re in it because they love it.

If you call a local FFL-holder looking for help, he will likely be more than happy to help you sell your old firearm and pick out one more suited to you. By the way, guns are like dogs. The cute little ones that fit in your purse snap, have bad tempers, and are hard to control. A big one is gentler because it’s strong. Most newcomers to guns will have a better time shooting a gun that isn’t as trim. Ladies, that big gun just makes you look skinnier.

4. Practice in Non-Scary Ways

A laser grip is a great way to work on your aim. Point the unloaded gun, then activate the laser to see how good your aim is. Try it from a ready position, then start from a relaxed stance, and then start the drill with the gun in its storage place or a holster to practice the whole motion. Dry-firing (pulling the trigger while the gun is unloaded, using snap caps) will help you get a feel for the trigger pull without the bang, stress, and cost of bullets. This all builds muscle memory and takes the edge off anxiety.

5. Don’t Let Gun Culture Get You Down

Gun culture is dominated by hunting people, military people, and law-enforcement people. I don’t run much with any of those crowds. I accompanied my kids to hunter safety, and hosted a concealed-carry class at my house. Both of those classes have state-mandated time requirements far in excess of the time needed to cover essential information, and both classes degenerated into gun nuts running their mouths about gun junk to fill the time.

It was pretty excruciating, but my kid harvested an eight-pointer we’ve been eating all year, and I got my carry license. Now I never have to take either of those classes again. Also, some ranges and National Rifle Association chapters offer classes or times for ladies that can make the whole experience less intimidating for female types.

6. If You Want to Carry, Find an Option You Like

Holsters are definitely a “you get what you pay for” item. You’ll just end up buying the expensive one, so save yourself the trouble of trying a bunch of cheap ones first. Finding a comfortable way to carry can be especially tricky for ladies. Curvy girls and straighter girls are going to find different options better; there’s the complication of dresses versus skirts or pants; and let’s just give pregnancy a polite shout-out and move on.

Your best bet is to think about where on your body you’ll find a holster least obtrusive, and shop from there. I think this is my chance to do a commercial: love you, CanCan garter belt! The gun-nut husband recommends Comp-Tac CC holsters and Crossbreed holsters.

7. Loosen Up

Forcing yourself to shoot at the range while you’re mentally trying to figure out if some loon is really going to murder you in your bed and make all this grief worthwhile can get taxing. You might find the International Defensive Pistol Association a more fun way to get into the gun universe. Locate a club here, and contact the club leader about helping you make friends with your gun. You’ll find a welcoming group of people of all backgrounds who will delight in showing you how to shoot straight and safely.

This might make me sound like a gun chick. I’m totally not. I still hate guns and wish I didn’t have to think about them, but do any of us need to be reminded that the world is full of really messed-up people with guns? If I ever ran into one of them, I’d rather be able to defend myself with more than moral outrage.

Gun Control: The Killer’s Best Friend,"Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez is suspected of murdering four unarmed Marines in Chattanooga and wounding others. As I write this, we still don’t know how Abdulazeez obtained his gun or what his motivations were—though, we can take an educated guess on the latter. What we do know is that Abdulazeez shot his victims in a “gun-free zone,” which is a useful illustration of the absurdity of gun-control laws: we constrain conscientious Americans but offer free rein to killers. In this case, even our best trained warriors were helpless.

Surely, we are in for a new round of emotional pleas for more gun-control laws. And, helpfully, in this week’s Newsweek cover story by Kurt Eichenwald we already have a compendium of muddled and misleading anti-Second Amendment talking points that dominate the Left these days.

The confusion begins with headline, which is based on an absurd premise, and bleeds into the lead:

Let’s start with an undeniable truth: In the United States, the people have the right to keep and bear arms. And let’s then acknowledge that the childish interpretation of that constitutional amendment—that Americans have the right to whatever accessory they can put on, in or over a gun for the sole purpose of making it more deadly—is a dangerous falsehood.

First off, can you imagine a pro-Second Amendment writer being offered space in a major publication to begin a piece (I’m not sure if this is a column, article, or a feature at Newsweek) like so:

Let’s start with an undeniable truth: In the United States, the people have the right to keep and bear arms. And let’s then acknowledge that this judicious interpretation of a constitutional amendment—that Americans have the right to individual freedom, to protect themselves and their family from bodily harm, and the right to stand up against abuse of tyrants, if necessary—is a beautiful truth.

But beyond the palpable bias, what’s he talking about? Eichenwald builds his entire bloodcurdling narrative around the notion that no limitations to the Second Amendment exist; which is, of course, absurd. What American anywhere has the freedom to put “whatever accessory” they want, in or over a gun, for the sole purpose of making it more deadly? Not one.

We limit other constitutional rights, he says. Newspapers, for instance, can stay in business “thanks to the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech,” but yet they cannot print child pornography. Which is true. Because in the United States has laws that protect children from coercion and physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, not ones that target the First Amendment. In the same way, we have federal and state law prohibiting people under 18 from possessing handguns or handgun ammunition or being sold handguns. As there will always be criminals who abuse children, there will always be irresponsible gun owners.

Interspersed throughout the piece, which has almost nothing to do with accessories, Eichenwald offers numerous well-worn laments about America’s overindulgence in these useless freedoms. He intermittently drops examples of scary activity (a twit at Wal-Mart walking around with a loaded shotgun, etc.), events that might aggravate his sensibilities and play on the urban fears, but have nothing to do with perpetuating violence.

For good measure, Eichenwald throws in rampages that no gun-control law would have prevented, short of confiscation.

We need more background checks because of Dylann Roof even if we already have background checks that should have stopped Dylann Roof, he argues. Until July 20, 2012, he writes, James Holmes was what “the NRA would describe as a responsible gun owner.” Well, then I guess Eichenwald every “responsible gun owner” should treated as a budding homicidal maniac. And every American who seeks psychiatric help in his life must now beg a judge to give him back his constitutional rights.

If you worry about this sort of thing, Eichenwald informs us you’re paranoid about the intentions of people like him. When I say people like him, I mean people who write pieces titled, “Let’s Repeal the Second Amendment.”

But, then again, Eichenwald argues—and he does it all the time on this issue—in bad faith. “Unfortunately,” he writes, “the NRA has been working for years to make sure lunatics and felons can obtain guns as easily as possible.”

Yo u can believe the NRA is misguided. You can believe the NRA’s positions manifest in terrible realities. But does anyone other than the most zealous gun-grabbing activist believe that the National Rifle Association intentionally wants lunatics to have guns so that they can kill people? Seems pretty obvious that, at the very least, such outcomes hurt the organization and its cause.

Oh, the accessories. Well, Eichenwald is concerned about high-capacity magazines and silencers. “There is no reason anyone outside of law enforcement or the military needs one except to kill people without attracting attention,” he says about silencers. Who decides what gun owners “need” and don’t? Eichenwald? Ten states already ban silencers and, for those that don’t, buying one requires a photo and fingerprints, and a $200 “tax.”

According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, civilian sales of silencers spiked 37 percent in 2013— to 500,000 from 360,000 in 2012 and 285,000 in 2011. Yet, in this world of unfettered world of gun ownership, there is a 30-year mandatory sentence for the use of a silencer in the act of a violent crime. Do you know how many silencers were used in the commission of a violent crime in 2013? I don’t. No one is keeping track, as far as I can tell. Probably because there are too few to care.

On the issue of high-capacity magazines, here my colleague Sean Davis not long ago:

Just like gun bans serve only to prevent law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves, high capacity magazine bans put lawful gun carriers at a distinct disadvantage against well-armed assailants. As a result, it’s really not all surprising that Colorado, which twice voted for Barack Obama, voted to oust the Democratic state Senate president who pushed through that state’s mag ban.

If Americans adhere to magazine limits, they’ll have to pray that criminals do, as well.

What gun-control advocates fail to explain are two things: How their proposed laws would stop rampages? Why there are more guns but less gun crime? Despite the proliferation of guns, firearm crime has fallen precipitously over the past few decades—49 percent, according to Pew. And though permits for concealed-carry handguns have risen by 178 percent in the last eight years, murder rates have dropped, according to Crime Prevention Research Center.

Yet, every time there is a shooting, we act like gun violence is soaring, rather than focusing on the problem of mental illness, or domestic terrorism, or whatever it is that drives these people to murder. Instead, we have pundits who have an aversion to the Second Amendment plunge us into a pointless political squabble over ideas that would do nothing more than restrict access to guns for law-abiding citizens.

The Total Failure Of Gun Control Captured In One Photo,"If you want to know why gun control doesn’t work, you only need to look at one photo to see why.

The picture below, taken after the terrorist attack on a military career center in Chattanooga, captures the complete failure of the logic underlying demands for greater gun control in the U.S.:

“Federal Installation,” the top of the sign reads in black letters atop a yellow background. “Firearms Are Prohibited In This Facility.” The bullets that shattered the glass in more than a dozen places around the gun-free zone sign did not heed its commands.

In addition to ignoring the sign designating the area as a gun-free zone, the terrorist shooter also appears to have illegally obtained his firearms:

BREAKING: FBI: Man who attacked military sites in Tennessee purchased some of his guns illegally.



The Associated Press (@AP) July 17, 2015

In other words, the gun control regime not only failed to prevent the terrorist from obtaining his firearms, it also failed to prevent him from possessing them in a gun-free zone. The gun ban did, however, dissuade law-abiding Marines from carrying firearms that they could’ve used to protect themselves.

As David Harsanyi noted, gun control and gun-free zones don’t hamper violent madmen. Instead, they only encourage them. Gun-free zones are the softest of soft targets, and there’s nothing more a violent terrorist desires more than the ability to inflict the greatest amount of harm with the least amount of resistance:

Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez is suspected of murdering four unarmed Marines in Chattanooga and wounding others. As I write this, we still don’t know how Abdulazeez obtained his gun or what his motivations were—though, we can take an educated guess on the latter. What we do know is that Abdulazeez shot his victims in a “gun-free zone,” which is a useful illustration of the absurdity of gun-control laws: we constrain conscientious Americans but offer free rein to killers. In this case, even our best trained warriors were helpless.

The gun-free zone sign didn’t prevent the shooter from firing a gun at completely innocent individuals within the zone. It did, however, prevent them from defending themselves. The key to stopping gun violence isn’t gun control, because this episode (along with many others) proves that gun control just doesn’t work. The key is acknowledging the God-given right of free people to defend themselves. Especially when they put their lives on the line to defend us.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/07/17/the-total-failure-of-gun-control-captured-in-one-photo/,2015-07-17
Surprise! Another Mass Shooting In A Gun-Free Zone,"A mentally ill gunman killed two and injured at least seven more people before taking his own life at a crowded movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana, late Thursday night. As seems to always happen within minutes of these types of shootings being reported, the gun control crowd immediately moved to politicize the incident:

Don't pray. Push for gun control.



Rachel Zarrell (@rachelzarrell) July 24, 2015

Rachel Zarrell, the author of the “don’t pray” tweet above, is a news editor for BuzzFeed. Luke O’Neil, who displayed his anti-gun violence bona fides by pining for the mass murder of all gun owners, is a Boston-based journalist who’s written for publications such as Slate, the Boston Globe, and Esquire.

Interestingly enough, the mass shooting happened in precisely the type of environment demanded by journalist gun controllers like Zarrell and O’Neil: a gun-free zone. That’s right. The Grand 16 Theater in Lafayette is a gun-free zone that explicitly bans the possession of any and all firearms, concealed or otherwise, on its premises:

According to the conduct policy on the movie theater’s website, the theater prohibits “[p]ossession of firearms or weapons of any kind regardless of whether openly or concealed, with or without a permit[.]”

While some states do not treat “no guns” or “gun-free zones” as having the force of law, Louisiana does. If a property owner in Louisiana places a sign on the property stating that firearms are prohibited, then they are prohibited. (In many states, a gun-free zone sign is not sufficient to prohibit firearms on private property. Instead, the owner of the manager of the premises must ask an individual lawfully carrying a gun on the property to leave; the individual is only considered to be in violation of the law if he or she refuses that request.)

It is no accident that mass murderers time and time again choose gun-free zones as their killing fields. Violent psychopaths don’t want resistance. They don’t want to be shot and killed before they can wreak havoc. These killers want to make sure their targets are as soft and defenseless as possible. So of course they target gun-free zones.

The solution to gun violence is not gun control. Why? Because guns are mere tools, and the evil mind hell-bent on violence will use any tool at his disposal to effect it. You cannot change the human condition with a new law or two. In the face of evil, however, you can give innocent men and women the right to protect themselves. That, of course, is the rationale for the Second Amendment: we have a God-given right to protect ourselves, our families, and our neighbors.

Mandated gun-free zones nullify that right. They tell the individuals within their boundaries that they have a right to be victims, and nothing more. The continual mass shootings in gun-free zones don’t send the message that we need more gun control. They show the exact opposite: that gun control simply doesn’t work.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/07/24/surprise-theres-been-another-mass-shooting-in-a-gun-free-zone/,2015-07-24
"TNR: They’re Not Baby Parts, They’re ‘Products Of Conception’","After the release of two undercover videos by the Center for Medical Progress showing Planned Parenthood executives haggling over selling organs from aborted babies, OB/GYN Jen Gunter is complaining about the term “baby parts.” Writing for The New Republic, she says it’s better to use the term “products of conception.” While she thinks that’s just an accurate medical term, it’s really just dehumanizing babies to prop up the abortion industry.

“These are not ‘baby parts,’” Gunter says. “Whether a woman has a miscarriage or an abortion, the tissue specimen is called ‘products of conception.’ In utero, i.e. during pregnancy, we use the term ‘embryo’ from fertilization to 10 weeks gestation and ‘fetus’ from 10 weeks to birth. The term baby is medically incorrect as it doesn’t apply until birth. Calling the tissue ‘baby parts’ is a calculated attempt to anthropomorphize an embryo or fetus. It is a false image—a 10-12 week fetus looks nothing like a term baby—and is medically incorrect.”

In response, The Federalist cofounder Sean Davis sent Gunter a tweet asking the logical question, “Are you not also a ‘product of conception,” Dr. Gunter? If so, why is your liver a ‘body part’ but a younger person’s isn’t?” His question got him blocked.

Gunter, ironically the author of “The Preemie Primer, a guide for parents of premature babies,” doesn’t want to have a dialogue. Why would she? She’s a medical doctor who—as she describes it—is used to cutting skin, sawing bones, and lifting the uterus out of the abdominal cavity and then putting it back in. No big deal. Doctors do that kind of thing all the time. They’re desensitized to things other people find upsetting.

So when it comes to abortion and harvesting organs, it’s nothing to get excited about. Just a blob of tissue. Just products of conception. She doesn’t mention crushing above and below, or using any crunching techniques, but she probably wouldn’t have a problem with that because, well, she’s a “medical professional,” and they’re used to that sort of thing.

Products of Conception Are Babies

Despite Gunter’s arrogant scolding, the fact of the matter is you can call something by any name you like, but it doesn’t change the fact of what it is. A human liver is a human liver. A human brain is a human brain. It doesn’t matter if it’s inside the uterus one minute (call it a fetus) or outside the next (presto, it’s a preemie baby); it’s still human.

If they were ever honest about the humanity they’re crushing, crunching, grinding, and dissecting, they’d be monsters.

But Gunter and the butchers at Planned Parenthood don’t want to use that term or any designation that will prick their darkened consciences. They don’t want to “anthropomorphize the fetus.” Of course, that makes perfect sense. If they were ever honest about the humanity they’re crushing, crunching, grinding, and dissecting, they’d be monsters. They’d be psychopaths. But they’re not psychopaths. They’re stable, normal human beings. To remain that way, they have to use terms like “products of conception.” They have to, in a word, dehumanize.

Other doctors have done the same. Physicians and scientists in Germany called the Jews by another name, stripping them of their humanity. They were labeled Untermenschen—subhumans. By dehumanizing the Jews, the German doctors could carry out all forms of atrocities with the same calm Gunter describes.

Dehumanization Is Necessary for Atrocities

The lead prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials began with this chilling statement that brings to mind the abortion industry today: “The defendants in this case are charged with murders, tortures, and other atrocities committed in the name of medical science. The victims of these crimes are numbered in the hundreds of thousands. . . . To their murderers, the wretched people were not individuals at all. They came in wholesale lots and were treated worse than animals.”

It goes against our nature to kill a person like ourselves, so we have to dehumanize others to overcome the normal human aversion to murder.

I’m sure the Nuremberg doctors would have approved of the term “products of conception.” In the name of science and research, they deprived the subhuman Jews of oxygen, infested them with malaria, exposed them to mustard gas, and made incisions in their subhuman flesh to simulate wounds. They even inserted pieces of broken glass or wood shavings into them, tying off blood vessels, and introducing bacteria to produce gangrene. All for the love of science.

The road to atrocity is paved with dehumanization. It’s necessary. It’s a normal part of all genocide, and it’s exploited and propagated by propaganda, by the use of seemingly harmless terms like products of conception. ­“All political and nationalist propaganda aims at only one thing,” Aldous Huxley wrote, “to persuade one set of people that another set of people are not really human and that it is therefore legitimate to rob, swindle, bully, and even murder them.”

It goes against our nature to kill a person like ourselves, so we have to dehumanize others to overcome the normal human aversion to murder. “Most people would hesitate to torture or kill a human being like themselves,” Huxley wrote. “But when that human being is spoken of as though he were not a human being . . . we lose our scruples.”

Babies Need Development, But It Doesn’t Mean They’re Not People

Gunter might want to stand behind the shield of science and say Planned Parenthood isn’t harvesting baby parts, but her words ring hollow. That’s because they’re mere words. The reality of what they represent is what matters. And what they represent is human life.

I know what it’s like to feel my baby inside of me, to see through an ultrasound the tiny hands, the eyes, the soft curve of her head, the twitches of her mouth.

Don’t tell me that the life growing inside a woman is a mere product to be crushed, cut up, and sold to the highest bidder. I know what it’s like to feel my baby inside of me, to see through an ultrasound the tiny hands, the eyes, the soft curve of her head, the twitches of her mouth. My children were as much babies inside me as they were when they breathed their first breath of air. That’s because they’re human beings, from the moment of conception.

When I was about 12 weeks pregnant with my first child, I was walking down the aisle of a grocery store when blood began to flow, hot and fast down my legs. I hurried to the hospital, fearing the worst, and the doctor examined me. I was having a miscarriage. He said I’d have to have a D&C to remove the tissue. As I lay there with my hand on my abdomen, praying for my child to be alive, the doctor’s words sounded so calm, so cold. I didn’t even know how to respond.

“We should do an ultrasound first, just to be sure,” the doctor said as I stared at him, my chest tight with suffocating sadness. I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t even cry.

Slowly, they rolled me into the examining room and turned on the machines. They spread jelly on my stomach, and the ultrasound screen lit up with its grainy gray tones. I closed my eyes, not wanting to see. I’d been there before. Lost another child earlier that year. I’d seen my baby’s tiny body not moving, the heartbeat that had once been fast and steady, silent and still.

“I can’t believe it,” the nurse said. My eyes snapped open. There on the screen was my baby. His hands tucked under his chin, his head bent, his legs pulled up to his chest, and his little feet swishing back and forth. The sound of his heartbeat filled the room. A strong, steady swoosh. I grabbed my husband’s hand and wept, the grief giving way to joy. Together, we peered through that window into my baby’s gentle, quiet world, our hearts full of gratitude and humility. He was alive. No miscarriage. No loss. Only life. Human life. The memory of the love that filled me in that moment is a constant reminder of what it means to be human.

No doctor is going to tell me that my baby was just a product of conception, a non-human mass that can be chopped up simply because a majority of people in this country have chosen to dehumanize children in the name of science or convenience. Gunter and others at Planned Parenthood can play word games in their dehumanization scheme to avoid being monsters. But despite their self-deluded lies, they are monsters. In the end, the people they have dehumanized the most are themselves.

"Former Felons Deserve Second Amendment Rights, Too","On July 16, Mohammed Abdulazeez killed five people at a Tennessee military recruitment center and a Navy operations center. It feels like it’s been a busy summer for shootings in America. This is tragic, personal for the victims and their loved ones, and unfortunately also fodder for many a thinkpiece about guns.

Now, Abdulazeez’s massacre, Dylann Roof’s alleged one in South Carolina, and a subsequent shooting in a Louisiana movie theater often provoke a foolish debate on how lone-wolf attacks and senseless massacres can be preemptively stopped. This is a foolish optimism.

Nobody outside of an Asimov novel has the ability to predict which white racist or which radical (Muslim or otherwise) will actually commit violence in service of their views. Not even if someone already has a criminal record can we predict their actions. There is usually someone jumping in after a shooting to remind hysterical people that a radical, a religious person, or even a racist is not an inherently violent person. Criminals have fewer people in their corners.

Yet we live in a country that has 2.3 million people in prison. We need to accept that people with a record deserve a second chance, especially if we want them to turn their lives around.

Earlier this month, President Obama made the wise and constitutionally-sound decision to commute the sentence of 46 people who had been behind bars for an excessive length of time, mostly for drug and related offenses. That very day, vaguely conservative pundit S.E. Cupp wrote a retro-terrible New York Daily News piece about a scary felon the president also freed, back in March. Hopefully the attitude Cupp expressed is dying, because it is responsible for a substantial loss of life and an incalculable number of lost years for people who have been excessively punished.

Owning Guns Doesn’t Make You Violent

According to Cupp, pardoned felon Harold Kenneth Herring, 76, is not the nonviolent offender and victim of draconian drug laws that he was made out to be. Nobody commented on this in March, but it turns out Herring was sentenced not just for possession with intent to distribute crack, but for being a felon in possession of a gun!

If she is arguing that simply having a gun makes you violent, she should be filed away with the most timid of liberals.

Are you still waiting to panic? Cupp writes that she is a staunch Second Amendment supporter, but every fear-soaked word and needless reference to Roof suggests otherwise. (Roof committed a drug offense that some people report as misdemeanor possession. Should he have been locked up and denied a weapon because of that? No. More importantly, nor should the thousands of people who have no intention of committing a violent massacre.)

It doesn’t matter that Cupp agrees that Chicago is violent because of strict gun laws (or at least regardless of them). If she is arguing that simply having a gun makes you violent, she should be filed away with the most timid of liberals. In fact, she reminds me of nothing so much as the Smith College student who argued in the Huffington Post that speaking a slur during a free-speech debate counts as “an explicit act of racial violence.”

But that young woman is a straw liberal who—let’s be mean and assume—is probably not a fan of guns. If Cupp is truly opposed to gun control, she and the people opposed to America’s full-to-bursting prisons must come together and accept the fact that all felonies are not equal. And that having a gun, even when you weren’t supposed to, does not count as being violent.

America’s Overbearing Criminal Statutes

As tempting as it is to flail towards gun-control measures after yet another shooting—yes, even conservatives do so in just this sort of a “sensible” fashion—all this will accomplish is feeling good while more people like Herring suffer.

The man may not be your grandpappy of choice, but selling a substance and possessing and owning a gun doesn’t make him more dangerous than a child rapist, a murderer, or even a bank robber.

Consider his background. In 1998, Herring was sentenced to life in prison for the aforementioned charges because he had two previous drug convictions (possession).The man may not be your grandpappy of choice, but selling a substance and possessing and owning a gun doesn’t make him more dangerous than a child rapist, a murderer, or even a bank robber (all of whom could get out of prison at some point). This kind of excessive punishment is pure lunacy. There are thousands of federal statutes, and something like 300,000 ways to be convicted of a felony. The recent bipartisan realization of the need for systematic reform is heartening (albeit criminally late).

But along with celebration of the slow-moving, but still burgeoning push against mandatory minimums, it must be said that these are not just about drug laws, though they were heavily fueled by anti-drug panic. Narcotics minimums often team up with firearm minimums to bring about more disproportionate punishments for even folks who never committed a violent act in their lives.

This isn’t even about having some black-market AR-15 and waving it at a fellow weed dealer. Someone who sells drugs can have a firearm enhancement even if they own a legal weapon. They can be punished if the piece was an antique, or if it was at home while they sold their product elsewhere. They can be hit with additional decades behind bars just for having a gun on their person during a sale, even if they never shot, threatened, or flashed it at someone.

You sold pot with your legal piece strapped to your ankle, or meth while your gun was safely at home, and that makes you deserve an extra decade or two in prison? How is that a conservative mentality? Or a compassionate liberal one?

It’s Insane to Punish People for Legal Posession

Cupp wrote that Herring might be okay now that he’s old and gray, but “at one point in his life he was a very dangerous man” because after all, “[c]an we properly define criminals with guns as ‘nonviolent’?” We can. We must. Shaneen Allen made headlines last year when she was threatened with a seven-plus-years prison sentence after she was pulled over in New Jersey while in possession of her legally-purchased (in Pennsylvania) weapon. Brian Aitken lived under a similar sword of Damocles and was actually convicted before Gov. Chris Christie commuted his sentence. But these horror stories, like any drug war casualty tale, are not unique to New Jersey or its dangerously rigid law.

Shaneen Allen was threatened with a seven-plus-years prison sentence after she was pulled over in New Jersey while in possession of her legally-purchased weapon.

Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM) is a nonprofit that advocates against this prepacked-style of punishment. They focus a great deal on drug punishments, but they also have worked with prisoners who suffer under federal gun minimums. According to their website, these slap “5-, 7-, 10-, and 30-year mandatory minimum sentences [onto offenders] for possessing, brandishing, or discharging a gun in the course of a drug trafficking crime or a crime of violence.” (Strange how the drug war lead to us placing narcotics and violent offenses into the same category, no matter how inaccurate that is.)

From a cleaned-up meth addict who got a longer prison sentence than her dealer, a firearm-owning boyfriend to a gun-owning pot dealer serving a staggering 55-year-sentence, FAMM highlights people who may not always be blameless, but whose crimes pale in comparison to their punishment. (In the latter case, the man suffered from “stacking” which mandates sentences be served consecutively.)

“Categorizing all felons as violent people who shouldn’t have guns is an oversimplification,” Molly Gill, the government affairs counsel for FAMM, said in an email. “Giving them all mandatory minimum prison sentences is inevitably going to produce some unjust results.”

If we want to fix this prison problem—if we want to understand that people who made a few (sometimes arguable) mistakes should not have had their lives destroyed—we need to stop being as terrified as Cupp sounds in her article. A Second-Amendment supporter in particular should be able to understand the world of difference between committing violence and owning a gun.

Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Gov. Chris Christie had pardoned Brian Aitken. Christie commuted Aitken’s sentence.

Gun Control Advocates Need To Find Some Better Arguments,"After the horrifying slaying of two journalists on live television, there was the predictable shouting about guns. One thing’s for sure: there’s always minimal time spent considering why individuals are capable of such evil and much time spent trying to pin that evil on some easily digestible political target: video games, maybe unfettered racism, but more probably, the NRA, which facilitates carnage, we’re told, for profit and fun.

.@NRA Was that on-air double homicide by handgun sponsored content? — rob delaney (@robdelaney) August 26, 2015

But mostly it’s about the guns themselves—as if they possessed the ability to induce otherwise peaceful people to engage in vile and wicked acts. And whenever there is a tragic shooting, rather than simply arguing for the one proposal that could plausibly stop shootings, the mass confiscation of guns, we have to game out exactly what left is talking about.

“What we know is that the number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism,” said President Obama yesterday. It is true. Utterly irrelevant, but true. We are blessed not to have rampant terrorism in this nation, but in places where terrorists do roam, innocent people without guns submissively kneel to be beheaded. So I suppose the president, inadvertently, makes a pretty good argument in favor of the Second Amendment.

But Obama is right, there are a lot of things more people die from than gun-related incidents. Like vehicular deaths. And in The New York Times, Nicholas Kristof, after laying out three scary out-of-context “data” points to soften up his targets, takes this on. “Gun proponents often say things to me like: “What about cars? They kill, too, but we don’t try to ban them!”

So Kristof says we should treat guns like cars. Vehicular deaths have fallen 95 percent (he goes all the way back to 1921 to offer his reader full impact). He writes that America should aim to reduce gun homicides by a third of that decline.

Now, deaths due to cars have fallen so precipitously due to technological advances and education, not the regulations he cites—but that’s a story for another day. What Kristof fails to point out is that gun deaths have similarly fallen—by 50 percent since 1993. So his “aim” is lower than the actual drop in gun deaths over the past thirty years. This, despite the fact that there are millions of more guns in the hands of Americans.

If your answer to this is, well, all crime has fallen, then you’re conceding it’s not the guns but some broader trends in society that are causing violent crime.

Others point out that most gun deaths are suicides, so it’s the guns that are the problem, even if firearm violence floats with crime trends. Yes, the gun suicide rate has been higher than the gun homicide rate since at least 1981, according to Pew. If this is the problem, then you’re admitting that the nation has to improve its mental-health care, not tighten its gun laws. Unless the argument is that suicidal people have only one way to end their lives.

Kristof, then, as most gun control advocates do, offers the preposterous notion that guns are unregulated.

The lesson from the ongoing carnage is not that we need a modern prohibition (that would raise constitutional issues and be impossible politically), but that we should address gun deaths as a public health crisis. To protect the public, we regulate toys and mutual funds, ladders and swimming pools. Shouldn’t we regulate guns as seriously as we regulate toys?

The most significant point to be extracted from the above paragraph is that we have far too many regulation on toys, mutual funds, ladders and swimming pools. But also, that none of those items have a special protection in the Constitution. None of them are necessary to facilitate freedom. But mostly, that the proposition that guns are unregulated is preposterous.

We have federal licenses for gun dealers. We have mandated background checks, for all purchases from all gun dealers. For all purchases across state lines. Yet, Kristof says we need so-called universal background checks with more rigorous screening, even though such regulations would not have stopped any of the recent shootings. He says he wants limits on gun purchases to one a month so that we can reduce trafficking, but that would not have stopped any of the recent horrifying crimes, either. He says he wants safe storage requirements and longer waiting periods and he lays out a bunch of restriction that either criminals would not follow or have nothing to do with the recent shootings in the country.

What he means to say is that he believes we need a modern prohibition. Because, in the end, like almost everyone who wants to pass a slew of gun laws, he lands on the Australian buyback program as the model. A buyback program that was a mandatory confiscation program. If that’s what you want, why didn’t you say so at the start?",https://thefederalist.com/2015/08/27/gun-control-advocates-need-to-find-some-better-arguments/,2015-08-27
The Australian Gun Ban Conceit,"As they’re wont to do, in the immediate aftermath of the brutal and calculated murders of two Virginia reporters many gun-control advocates pointed to Australia’s gun ban and confiscation as a successful model America should adopt.

The idea wasn’t just limited to the fringe Left, either. It was put forth in places like the The New Republic and Vox. The Gray Lady herself published a column advocating Australian-style gun confiscation less than 24 hours after the killings.

Now, the practical problems of instituting an Australian-style gun ban and mandatory buyback program have been well flushed out. But I think it’s important to examine the main claim about Australia’s gun control. Namely, that it worked. The argument, as Vox’s headline puts it, is “Australia confiscated 650,000 guns. Murders and suicides plummeted.”

Murders and Suicides Didn’t ‘Plummet’

The piece, along with many gun control advocates, cites a Harvard University study whose conclusion begins with this line: “It does not appear that the Australian experience with gun buybacks is fully replicable in the United States.” Not a great start for Vox’s angle, but I digress.

America was more than doubling how many firearms it manufactured and seeing a nearly identical drop in gun homicides.

The study doesn’t conclude that “murders and suicides plummeted” in Australia after the 1996 gun ban, as Vox claims in its headline. Instead, it focuses solely on firearm-related murders and suicides. In that category they found a marked decline (although, interestingly, it still makes up nearly 20 percent of all homicides nearly two decades after most guns were banned by the island nation).

But at the same time Australia was banning guns and experiencing a decline in gun homicides, America was more than doubling how many firearms it manufactured and seeing a nearly identical drop in gun homicides. That throws a bit of a wrench into the idea that Australia’s gun ban must be the reason for its decline in gun crime.

However, what’s more important is the fact that overall suicides and murder have not “plummeted” in the years after the gun ban. Yes, as with the gun-happy United States, the murder rate is down in Australia. It’s dropped 31 percent from a rate of 1.6 per 100,000 people in 1994 to 1.1 per 100,000 in 2012.But it’s the only serious crime that saw a consistent decline post-ban.

In fact, according to the Australian government’s own statistics, a number of serious crimes peaked in the years after the ban. Manslaughter, sexual assault, kidnapping, armed robbery, and unarmed robbery all saw peaks in the years following the ban, and most remain near or above pre-ban rates. The effects of the 1996 ban on violent crime are, frankly, unimpressive at best.

Violence Declined Stateside Without A Gun Ban

It’s even less impressive when again compared to America’s decrease in violent crime over the same period. According to data from the U.S. Justice Department, violent crime fell nearly 72 percent between 1993 and 2011. Again, this happened as guns were being manufactured and purchased at an ever-increasing rate.

While Australians kill themselves with firearms less often, it seems they don’t actually take their own lives any less often.

The Australian gun ban’s effect on suicide in the country isn’t any better. While Vox repeats the Harvard study’s claim that firearm-related suicides are down 57 percent in the aftermath of the ban, Lifeline Australia reports that overall suicides are at a ten-year high. The Australian suicide prevention organization claims suicide is the leading cause of death for Australians 15 to 44 years old. So, while Australians kill themselves with firearms less often, it seems they don’t actually take their own lives any less often than before the ban.

Whatever you think of the merits of Australia’s gun ban or the practicality of using it as a model for American gun control, it most certainly has not caused suicide or murder rates to plummet. Furthermore, Australia has seen violent crimes peak in the years following its ban while the United States experienced the exact opposite phenomenon.

Australia isn’t much of a model for Australia, let alone for America.

Kaine's Gun Control Bill Is A Backdoor Ban On Private Sales,"A new gun control bill from Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia appears to be nothing more than a backdoor ban on all private firearm sales in the U.S.

Kaine’s proposed law, entitled the “Responsible Transfer of Firearms Act,” places a criminal federal liability on anyone who transfers a firearm to an individual prohibited from possessing one by federal law, according to a fact sheet provided by Kaine’s office. Under current law, federal firearms licensees (FFLs), by virtue of being required to conduct background checks, are assumed to know whether potential buyers are prohibited from possessing firearms based on the results of the required background checks. Kaine’s law would extend that assumption, and the criminal liability attached to it, to private individuals as well.

Sounds simple and uncontroversial, right?

Not really. The reason FFLs currently face criminal liability for unlawful transfers is that they’re mandated by law to conduct or confirm background checks on all firearms sales (even sales at gun shows). All interstate sales between private residents must also be processed through an FFL in the buyer’s home state, and that process must include a federal background check. Sales between two private, non-FFL individuals who reside in the same state are the only major category of firearms transfers that are exempt from federal background checks (the reason for that exemption is obvious: there’s no federal or interstate commerce nexus).

In order to conduct those federal background checks, and to prevent themselves from being held criminally liable for selling guns to criminals, FFLs are granted access to the FBI’s NICS database. Before completing a sale, FFLs will contact the FBI, give them the information provided by the buyer on ATF form 4473, and the FBI will tell the FFL whether the buyer is cleared to purchase a gun.

While current federal gun law imposes a criminal liability only on those institutions with authority to conduct criminal background checks, Kaine’s bill does no such thing.

Instead, Kaine’s proposal criminalizes a private individual’s failure to conduct a federal background check while refusing to give that individual the right to conduct the federal background check in the first place. Kaine’s office confirmed that his bill does not give private individuals the authority or ability to conduct federal background checks in order to avoid the federal criminal liability imposed by his proposal. Federal law currently restricts NICS access to FFLs or state law enforcement agencies.

“[I]t does not give non-FFLs access to the [NICS] database,” Amy Dudley, Kaine’s communications director, told The Federalist via e-mail.

The legislative text of the proposed bill releases the criminal liability only if the seller “has taken reasonable steps to determine that the recipient is not legally barred from possessing firearms.” However, the most reasonable step available — conducting a background check via the same system used by FFLs — is not available to any private individuals.

Kaine’s gun control proposal is akin to an anti-speeding law which for some reason prohibits drivers from using speedometers to gauge their speeds.

Aside from virtually eliminating the private sales market in the U.S., Kaine’s gun control bill will also likely drive up profits for FFLs. If private individuals remain banned from conducting federal criminal background checks, they will be forced to process their transfers through FFLs, most of which charge hefty fees to process external sales.

The latest gun control effort from the junior senator from Virginia comes on the heels of the gun control movement’s failure in 2013 to enact so-called universal background checks. Rather than working to convince states to require background checks on all purchases, Kaine is doubling down on the gun control movement’s repeated failure to enact federal universal background checks.

Given that the 2013 gun control effort failed to garner the 60 votes necessary to end debate, it seems highly unlikely that a far more drastic proposal — a de facto ban on private, intrastate gun sales — would come anywhere close to passage.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/09/08/tim-kaines-gun-control-bill-is-a-backdoor-ban-on-all-private-gun-sales/,2015-09-08
Oregon Shooting Occurred In A Gun-Free Zone,"The White House moved quickly to politicize a mass shooting today at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College, which already bans guns on campus property.

According to multiple White House reporters, Obama press secretary Josh Earnest reacted to the news not by offering federal assistance to local law enforcement agencies still struggling to get the situation under control, but by noting that President Barack Obama still supports “common sense” gun control regulations.

Josh Earnest reacts to shooting news – Common sense gun control still supported by the administration

Josh Earnest: Vast majority of Americans share the President’s view in wondering why Congress won’t take commons sense steps on gun control.



Fred Lucas (@FredLucasWH) October 1, 2015

Although reports are highly fluid, it appears that at least 15 people are dead as a result of the massacre, with at least 20 individuals injured. The identities and motivations of those responsible for the mass shooting in Oregon are not yet known.

White House demands for increased gun control ring hollow, however, given that Umpqua Community College, the site of the mass shooting, is a gun-free zone. School policy bans the possession of firearms on campus property. A cached web page of the school’s safety and security policy, pictured below, states that “[p]ossession, use, or threatened use of firearms…on college property…is prohibited.”

Directly below the school’s notice of its gun ban is a section entitled, “Don’t Be a Victim,” which includes advice such as “[w]alk in groups when possible” and “don’t look like a victim[.]”

I'm not big on the ""arm everyone"" responses, so I say this neutrally: School just confirmed to Fox that it's a ""weapons free campus.""



Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) October 1, 2015

As a condition of enrollment, Umpqua Community College requires students to adhere to a strict code of conduct. The school specifically lists possession of a firearm as a violation of the student code of conduct. The document specifically lists 40 specific behaviors which the school says would constitute a violation of its conduct rules. Possession of a firearm anywhere on campus, or at any event sponsored or supervised by the school, regardless of location, without the express written authorization of school administrators is listed at number 19:

721.3 STUDENT MISCONDUCT



The following actions and/or behaviors are the types of misconduct for which students may be subject to disciplinary action. These prohibitions are not designed to define misconduct in all-inclusive terms and in no way should this be considered an exhaustive list:



19. Possession or use, without written authorization, of firearms, explosives, dangerous chemicals, substances, or any other weapons or destructive devices that are designed to or readily capable of causing physical injury, on College premises, at College-sponsored or supervised functions or at functions sponsored or participated in by the College.

Students who violate the code of conduct can be suspended, expelled, or even referred to law enforcement authorities for criminal prosecution.

"The More You Politicize Guns, The Weaker Your Case Becomes","After the horrific mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, President Obama made an impassioned case that gun violence is “something we should politicize”—and why should this be any different:

This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.

Everything in that statement is wrong. What happened in Oregon is tragic, and the nation should comfort families and look for reasonable and practical ways to stem violence, but there is only one murderer. Now, if government somehow bolstered, endorsed, or “allowed” the actions of Chris Harper-Mercer—as they might, say, the death of 10,000-plus viable babies each year or the civilian deaths that occur during an American drone action—a person could plausibly argue that we are collectively answerable as a nation.

Then again, when the president asserts Americans are collectively answerable, what he really suggests—according to his own broader argument—is that conservatives who’ve blocked his gun-control legislation are wholly responsible. The problem with that contention, outside of the obvious fact that Republicans never condone the use of guns for illegal violence (in fact, these rampages hurt their cause more than anything) is that Democrats haven’t offered a single bill or idea (short of confiscation) that would impede any of the mass shootings, or overall gun violence. This is not a political choice, because it’s likely there is no available political answer.

For the liberal, every societal problem has a state-issued remedy waiting to be administered over the objections of a reactionary Republican. But just because you have a tremendous amount of emotion and frustration built up around a certain cause doesn’t make your favored legislation any more practical, effective or realistic. It doesn’t change the fact that owning a gun is a civil right, that the preponderance of owners are not criminals, or that there are 300 million guns out there.

And if it’s a political argument you’re offering—and when hasn’t it been?—you’ll need more than the vacuousness of the “this is bad and so we have to do something.” That’s because anti-gun types are never able to answer a simple question: what law would you pass that could stop these shootings?

Many liberals see the Second Amendment as tragically misinterpreted or useless and guns as abhorrent, so they do not believe any legislative imposition is a tradeoff—even an ineffective law. Many conservatives view guns as a civil right, so this an unacceptable tradeoff. Some don’t even view mass shooting as primarily a gun problem. Now, that doesn’t mean guns have nothing to do with it, as Ramesh Ponnuru puts it well responding to a Slate piece:

… one can simultaneously believe that the high volume of firearms contributes to our high homicide rate and that these laws aren’t good ideas. It’s actually pretty easy to believe both of these things at once, since none of the regulations at issue would do much at all to reduce our high volume of firearms.

But despite all the administration’s fearmongering, and as horrifying as any shooting is, gun violence has precipitously declined over the decades without any meaningful federal law being enacted. This likely tells us there are a number of other social currents driving this kind violence. The Left believes the number of guns is at fault, rather than social ills—since no person can be evil, only a victim. So the debate takes on the same old contours, and we focus on firearms and nothing else. That kind of political debate only makes it less likely that anything good will happen.

When we politicize a tragedy, it is immediately sucked into a broader ideological conflict. Then the conservative (at least when out of power) will see (I believe, rightfully) an intrusive agenda that is a perpetual slippery slope. (Can you blame them when they hear: No, we don’t want confiscation, but look at Australia did! We don’t want confiscation, but isn’t that Second Amendment interpretation so stupid!?) Trust me, it’s not unreasonable to treat liberal policies as if they have a tendency for mission creep and unwieldy expansion.

Hillary Clinton: Politicizing American Deaths Is Only OK When I Do It,"In an interview with “The Today Show” on Monday morning, Hillary Clinton lambasted Republicans for politicizing the deaths of four Americans during the Benghazi hearings. During the same interview, Clinton herself used the Charleston and Oregon tragedies to further her talking points on increased gun control.

“This committee was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans,” Clinton said on the congressional hearing probing her actions as secretary of State during the attack on a U.S. embassy in Benghazi. “I would have never done that.”

In response to a question about the slaying of nine people at Umpqua Community College last week, Clinton was quick to bring up her desire to require all future gun owners to complete background checks before they are allowed to purchase a gun. She also name-dropped the Charleston tragedy when speaking about strengthening background check requirements for gun purchases.

If it’s wrong for Republicans to use the deaths of Americans to scrutinize her actions as secretary of State, why is it then okay for Clinton to use tragedies as a narrative device to push for tougher gun control?

This hypocrisy isn’t the only odd remark she made about guns. She claimed that Charleston shooter Dylann Roof was able to buy his gun because of a legal loophole, and that his violent actions prove the country needs tougher restrictions. But in reality, there is no such loophole. A more accurate description would be that a data entry error allowed Roof to purchase a firearm when he shouldn’t have been able to.

Clinton also decried gun shows as being equivalent to people basically selling guns out of the back of their cars. Her strange description suggests she has never been to a gun show herself, making her recommendations for regulating them seem out-of-touch at best. Clinton can huff and puff about how it’s wrong to use a tragedy to further a political point, but when she does it herself in the same interview, her criticisms just don’t have cachet.

Hillary’s ‘Gun Show Loophole’ Proposal Is A Joke,"In the wake of a mass shooting at an Oregon community college last week, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced today that she would close the so-called “gun show loophole” with an executive order if she were elected president. The only problem with her gun show loophole proposal is that it would accomplish exactly nothing, because current law already covers her proposal.

Here’s how Slate described Hillary Clinton’s proposal:

What makes Clinton’s plan particularly noteworthy, though, is her suggestion that she’d be able to go it alone on at least one of the proposals if elected president: the gun show loophole.



And just how would she do that? According to her campaign, even if Congress were unwilling to act, Clinton would be able to use her executive authority to tweak the existing rules to reclassify anyone who sells a “significant number of guns” as someone “in the business of selling firearms”—a distinction that would make those high-volume private vendors who sell guns at gun shows and over the Internet subject to the same rules as larger, licensed brick-and-mortar retailers. Clinton doesn’t appear to have settled on an answer to the question of just how many guns constitutes a “significant” number, but even if her chosen definition didn’t close the loophole completely, it would at least shrink it.



Such an effort could face legal challenges in the courts and, at the very least, a guaranteed NRA-led political freakout in Washington. And, even if the effort survived both, it wouldn’t come close to ending gun violence in the United States. But for gun safety advocates and like-minded voters who are desperate for action on a problem that can feel politically impossible, Clinton’s outside-the-box plan will be a welcome start.

Slate’s Josh Voorhees characterized Clinton’s plan as “clever,” which leads me to the inescapable conclusion that neither Voorhees nor Hillary Clinton is even remotely familiar with existing federal gun laws.

For starters, the federal government already has the statutory authority to define who does and does not qualify as an individual “in the business of selling firearms.” It derives that authority from 18 U.S. Code § 921. Here’s how the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) specifically defines whether an individual is engaged in the business of selling firearms and should therefore be subject to federal firearms licensee (FFL) requirements:

Dealer in firearms — a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms (18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(21)(C));

Here’s the federal statute from which the ATF derives its existing authority to define who is and isn’t engaged in the business of selling guns:

(21) The term “engaged in the business” means—

(A) as applied to a manufacturer of firearms, a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to manufacturing firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the sale or distribution of the firearms manufactured;

(B) as applied to a manufacturer of ammunition, a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to manufacturing ammunition as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the sale or distribution of the ammunition manufactured;

(C) as applied to a dealer in firearms, as defined in section 921(a)(11)(A), a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms;

(D) as applied to a dealer in firearms, as defined in section 921(a)(11)(B), a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to engaging in such activity as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional repairs of firearms, or who occasionally fits special barrels, stocks, or trigger mechanisms to firearms;

(E) as applied to an importer of firearms, a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to importing firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the sale or distribution of the firearms imported; and

(F) as applied to an importer of ammunition, a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to importing ammunition as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the sale or distribution of the ammunition imported.

Contra Hillary Clinton’s campaign, “high-volume private vendors” cannot legally exist under current law. Under the ATF’s existing definition, it is impossible to sell high volumes of firearms without triggering the definition of a dealer in firearms. The “repetitive purchase and resale of firearms” makes you a dealer, not a private individual. Anything other than “occasional sales” makes you a dealer, not a private individual. Unlicensed dealing is against the law. Refusing to conduct background checks as a dealer (licensed or not) is against the law.

Now, if you read through the ATF regulations or the statutes from which they derive their authority, you’ll notice something missing: any mention of gun shows or the Internet. Does that mean gun shows are unregulated, as Clinton and her allies dishonestly imply? Does it mean that Internet sales are unregulated? Not at all. In fact, it shows the exact opposite.

There is zero protection enshrined in law for transactions that happen to occur at a gun show or over the Internet. Zip. Zilch. Nada. The so-called “gun show loophole” simply does not exist. Nor does any sort of Internet gun sale loophole. Federal gun laws are directed at the entities engaging in the manufacture or distribution of firearms, not the mere venues where those activities happen to take place. If you are an FFL who sells guns at a gun show, you are required by law to either process a background check prior to the sale of a gun, or you must confirm, usually by examining a concealed carry permit or a purchase permit (both of which require background checks), that a buyer is not legally prohibited from purchasing or possessing a gun.

In the same vein, there’s no Internet gun sale loophole, either. You can’t legally buy a gun off the Internet from some random guy ten states away and have it show up on your doorstep the next morning. It’s against the law for a private individual to ship a gun across state lines to a non-FFL. Any firearm purchased from another state must be processed through an FFL in the state in which the buyer resides. That FFL is required to process a background check before providing the gun to you.

The only federal background check exemption that exists is for transactions between private, non-FFL individuals who reside in the same state. That’s it. There’s no Internet exemption. There’s no gun show exemption. The only exemption is for transactions with zero federal nexus: no federal firearms license, and no purchase or sale across state lines.

Now, if Hillary thinks Congress should pass a law regulating private transactions between private individuals who reside in the same state, that’s her prerogative. But she should at least be honest about what she’s doing and about what authority the president has to do it. The president cannot by fiat eliminate the existing exemption. It can be done only by Congress. Obama tried to do so in 2013, but failed. Rather than making up gun control fairy tales to comfort her supporters, perhaps Hillary Clinton should explain to them how she’ll get a majority of the U.S. House and 60 U.S. senators to sign on to her gun control plan.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/10/05/hillarys-gun-show-loophole-proposal-is-a-joke/,2015-10-05
7 Gun Control Myths That Just Won’t Die,"After every shooting, politicians and activists rush to the cameras or their keyboards to tell people exactly what should be done to stop mass shootings in the future. Gun control proponents demand more gun control. Gun rights advocates dig in their heels and explain why new laws won’t stop evil people from doing evil things, especially when current laws aren’t adequately enforced.

Unfortunately, the debate between the two sides is rarely illuminating, as it usually devolves into tired recitations of worn-out talking points about the issue. These talking points are invariably littered with myths and factual inaccuracies. Here are 7 myths about gun control that just won’t die.



1) The ‘Gun Show Loophole’ Allows Anyone, Even Criminals, To Get Guns

In reality, the so-called “gun show loophole” is a myth. It does not exist. There is no loophole in federal law that specifically exempts gun show transactions from any other laws normally applied to gun sales. Not one.

If you purchase a firearm from a federal firearms licensee (FFL) regardless of the location of the transaction — a gun store, a gun show, a gun dealer’s car trunk, etc. — that FFL must confirm that you are legally allowed to purchase that gun. That means the FFL must either run a background check on you via the federal NICS database, or confirm that you have passed a background check by examining your state-issued concealed carry permit or your government-issued purchase permit. There are zero exceptions to this federal requirement.

If an individual purchases a gun across state lines — from an individual or FFL which resides in a different state than the buyer — the buyer must undergo a background check, and the sale must be processed by an FFL in the buyer’s home state.

What does exist, however, is a federal exemption for sales between two private, non-FFL residents of the same state, regardless of whether that transaction happens at a gun show or not. The identity of the parties involved in the transaction, not the venue of the sale, is what matters under federal law. This federal exemption makes perfect sense: there’s no federal nexus for a purely private transaction between two private individuals who reside in the same state. Many states, including Oregon, Colorado, and Illinois, have enacted universal background checks in order to eliminate the exemption for same-state private firearms transactions.

Federal universal background checks may or may not be a wise idea — the U.S. Senate in 2013 explicitly refused to enact them — but referring to the federal exemption for private, same-state sales as a “gun show loophole” is misleading and factually inaccurate.



2) Nobody’s Demanding Gun Confiscation

We’ve all seen how this one plays out. In the wake of a shooting, a politician demands “common sense gun regulations.” Gun rights supporters then respond with something along the lines of, “He just wants to take our guns!” That criticism is then followed by mockery from various corners of progressive blogdom that no, you stupid hick, nobody wants to take your guns.

In 1996, Australia confiscated guns. It didn't work there and it wouldn't work in America. http://t.co/ks4wjml3Ch



National Review (@NRO) October 5, 2015

But that’s not true. A number of progressives do actually want to take your guns.

TPM’s Josh Marshall finally admitted earlier this week that progressives care a whole lot more about gun confiscation than they do about nibbling around the edges of existing gun laws.

“In other words, yes, we really do want to take your guns,” he wrote. “Maybe not all of them. But a lot of them.”

He’s not the only one. There’s also E.J. Dionne at the Washington Post, who scolded Republicans for refusing to endorse a nationwide gun confiscation program similar to one instituted in Australia in the mid-1990’s.

It’s not just leftist bloggers pushing for gun confiscation, though.

Take the president of the United States, for example. After the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, President Barack Obama made a statement that “we should politicize” shootings. He then cited radical gun confiscation laws in Australia and Great Britain as examples that the U.S. should follow:

We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours — Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it.

The intent of Obama’s reference to Australia’s nationwide gun confiscation law, its ineffectiveness notwithstanding, couldn’t have been more clear. Yes, they really do want to take your guns.



3) Buying A Gun Is As Easy As Buying Groceries

Last March, President Barack Obama was asked about guns during a press conference, and he responded by saying, “It’s easier for you to buy a handgun and clips than it is for you to buy a fresh vegetable.” Ignoring for the moment that the president does not understand the difference between a clip and a magazine, his claim is not true.

It is not easier to buy a gun than it is to buy a fresh vegetable, or any canned vegetable for that matter. Never in my life have I been required to fill out federal form 4473 and have the cashier run a background check on me before being allowed to buy an onion.

There are no federal laws requiring onion dealers to register with the federal government prior to selling onions. There are no state laws requiring that you apply for and receive an onion purchase permit, complete with background check, prior to purchasing an onion. There are no onion waiting periods or limits on how many onions you can purchase within a certain period of time. Nor are there, to my knowledge, any state or local laws prohibiting the possession of onions in schools or government buildings.

Firearm manufacturing and sales are highly regulated by the federal government. Numerous complicated laws govern virtually every aspect of the process. Anyone who has purchased a gun before can you tell you in great detail that it is not as easy as buying a vegetable at a grocery store. It is an expensive and time-consuming process.

Some people may think gun control is a great idea and that it should be harder to buy a gun than it currently is, but they should refrain from suggesting that legally purchasing a firearm is easier, cheaper, and less time-consuming than buying a carrot. Because it’s not.



4) Concealed Carriers Don’t Prevent Mass Shootings

“Do armed civilians stop mass shooters?” the liberal magazine Mother Jones asked in 2012. “Actually, no.”

Mother Jones justified its assertion by citing its own analysis that of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012, not one was stopped by a civilian with a gun. Shocking, right? Not really, once you consider the logical fallacy underlying the Mother Jones claim.

The fact of the matter is that shootings that happen in an area where concealed carriers can immediately respond don’t generally become mass shootings. It’s a bit like saying locked doors and alarms don’t prevent burglaries by only citing burglaries that happened in buildings with no locked doors or alarms as proof of your thesis. It’s no coincidence that so many mass shootings happen in areas declared to be “gun-free zones” by authorities.

Instances of concealed carriers stopping shooters in their tracks are too numerous to count. Here are just a few examples found from a few seconds of Googling.

July 27, 2015:

A 62-year-old man with a gun in each hand fired at four people – including a 1-year-old boy – before a civilian with a concealed carry permit returned fire and wounded the shooter, cops told FOX19.

April 20, 2015:

Authorities say no charges will be filed against an Uber driver who shot and wounded a gunman who opened fire on a crowd of people in Logan Square over the weekend.



The driver had a concealed-carry permit and acted in the defense of himself and others, Assistant State’s Attorney Barry Quinn said in court Sunday.



A group of people had been walking in front of the driver around 11:50 p.m. Friday in the 2900 block of North Milwaukee Avenue when Everardo Custodio, 22, began firing into the crowd, Quinn said.



The driver pulled out a handgun and fired six shots at Custodio, hitting him several times, according to court records. Responding officers found Custodio lying on the ground, bleeding, Quinn said. No other injuries were reported.

September 22, 2015:

A 63-year-old autoworker with a concealed weapons license shot a gunman who was robbing a Warren, Michigan, bank, according to Fox 2 Detroit.

Concealed carriers can’t be expected to stop every shooting, just as police can’t be expected to prevent all crime. It is a fact, though, that concealed carriers regularly put an end to violent shootings.



5) The Second Amendment Only Applies To Muskets

This trope is a popular one among gun control advocates who imagine themselves as strict constructionists when it comes to Constitutional interpretation. Piers Morgan, the failed CNN host and British tabloid editor accused of hacking into celebrity voicemails in search of tabloid gossip, is the foremost advocate of the notion that the Second Amendment protects only the rights of Americans to carry muskets:

Friends don't let friends follow in Piers Morgan's footsteps. pic.twitter.com/eMyzlowSYC



Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 4, 2015

As Carol Roth noted, the refusal of the Founding Fathers to precisely name the types of arms which citizens have a right to keep and bear was intentional. The same can be said of their refusal to constrain our right of free expression to quill pens and bulky printing presses. The Second Amendment protects our right to own handguns just like the First Amendment protects our right to criticize the government using the Internet.

Both the text of the Second Amendment and the intent behind it are clear: the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Law-abiding citizens have the right not only to own weapons, but to carry them as well. The Second Amendment isn’t about muskets or bayonets. It’s about the right of a free people to defend themselves with arms if necessary.



6) Gun Violence Is Skyrocketing

If you’ve spent any time on social media, you’ve seen the lamentations: gun violence is skyrocketing. It is an epidemic. Constant TV coverage of shootings can certainly make it seem that way. But the truth of the matter is that gun violence is actually way down. It hasn’t skyrocketed; it’s plummeted.

A 2013 study from the Pew Research Center found that gun violence had fallen by nearly 50 percent since its 1993 peak:

Compared with 1993, the peak of U.S. gun homicides, the firearm homicide rate was 49% lower in 2010, and there were fewer deaths, even though the nation’s population grew. The victimization rate for other violent crimes with a firearm—assaults, robberies and sex crimes—was 75% lower in 2011 than in 1993. Violent non-fatal crime victimization overall (with or without a firearm) also is down markedly (72%) over two decades.

A 2014 analysis from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) showed a significant decline in violent crime over the last five years:

In 2013, the latest year for which complete data are available, the number of homicides in which a firearm was involved totaled 8,454, representing a 12 percent drop compared to the number of gun homicides in 2003. And the 2003 figure represented a 41 percent drop from the gun homicide total in 1994, the earliest year for which data are readily accessible on the FBI’s website.

All told, the number of gun homicides in the U.S. has fallen by nearly 50 percent over the last two decades. Any amount of violent crime is too much, but it’s wrong to assert in the face of all evidence that gun violence in the U.S. is skyrocketing.



7) Gun-Free Zones Prevent Gun Violence

Nothing represents wishful thinking in the face of evidence like the proliferation of so-called gun-free zones. These are areas in which guns have been explicitly banned by law, or banned by property owners or local authorities. They are almost always accompanied by a sign notifying passersby that guns are banned on the premises. The intent behind the idea of gun-free zones is simple and noble: what better way to prevent gun violence than by banning guns?

Unfortunately, the reality of human nature tends to stomp all over those good intentions. Time and again, deadly mass shootings occur in gun-free zones. Why? Because the evil mind intent on wreaking havoc wants nothing more than the ability to do so without getting shot back. What better place to go than a gun-free zone?

The sad fact of the matter is that gun-free zones are anything but.

The Oregon shooting happened in a gun-free zone. The Lafayette movie theater shooting happened in a gun-free zone. The Chattanooga shootings happened in gun-free zones. The Ft. Hood massacre even happened in a gun-free zone, believe it or not.

Gun-free zones may be backed by pure intentions, but the reality is that they just end up being soft targets for evil killers hellbent on destruction.

Gun Control And The Unconstitutioned,"The latest attempt to politicize a shooting has Hillary Clinton promising to impose new gun control provisions by unilateral executive action.

If Congress refuses to act to end this epidemic of gun violence, I’ll take administrative action to do so. -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 5, 2015

This echoes President Obama’s vow, in the previous go-around on gun control, to do the same, which made no difference. Nor will it make a difference this time. The specific executive action proposed by Clinton—an attempt to redefine who qualifies as a “gun dealer” for regulatory purposes—is either an executive rewrite of existing law or a meaningless duplication of existing law—depending on how far she were to take it.

But it’s clear that this is not meant as a serious proposal. It is meant to position Hillary Clinton to the left of Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries. It’s boob bait for the opposite of Bubba.

This is boob bait for the opposite of Bubba.

There’s no rational reason to believe that she can remotely deliver on this promise. But the repeated use of this technique by Hillary, and by President Obama, is a sign that it is a calculated appeal to a certain kind of people: those who are willfully ignorant, or at least willing to suspend disbelief, about the limits imposed on politicians by the Constitution.

This is not just ignorance of a specific constitutional clause or principle, though there’s plenty of that. When Adam Gopnick takes to the New Yorker to argue that “regulating guns in individual hands was one of the purposes for which the [Second Amendment] was offered,” for example, he didn’t bother to ask what the Founding Fathers thought. Or to consider how many state constitutions at the time contained guarantees explicitly naming the individual right to bear arms, in the words of the standard formulation of the day, “for the defense of themselves and the State.” (Sanders take note: that’s from the constitution of Vermont, written in 1777.) Or that the Second Amendment was written by people who had just made a revolution started by volunteers who kept muskets in their homes. Then there is the popular claim that gun rights were an institution of the racist South—which ignores the fact that most of the early history of gun control in America consisted of racist attempts to disarm free blacks.

This is denial of the entire idea of a constitution.

But this is about more than denial of the Second Amendment. It’s denial of the entire idea of a constitution, of a government with set procedures and limited powers. The people to whom these kinds of promises are meant to appeal are the unconstitutioned. It’s a term I coined in a similar context a few years back, as an analogy to the term “unchurched,” which describes people cut off from any form of organized religion. The “unconstitutioned” are cut off from any concept of organized government. It’s not just that they have not been educated about the provisions of the Constitution. It’s that they don’t grasp constitutionalism. They don’t see government as a specific set of institutions with limited powers proscribed by law. They see government as magic box that gives you good things.

The Trump phenomenon has demonstrated that there is a certain audience for this on the right—the temptation to believe that we could Make America Great Again if we just elected a savvy deal-maker who doesn’t care about offending people. But the more natural constituency for a magical view of government is on the left, which is more broadly and deeply committed to the idea that government can provide us, somehow, with everything we want. So it’s natural for them to adopt the attitude that anything we can imagine might be good—for example, the fantasy that the entire nation would be peaceable if we just confiscated everyone’s guns—can just be done, and all it would really require would be a single presidential decree. And if it isn’t being done, it must be because the people in charge are too mean-spirited or timid to do it. It can’t be because of any practical or constitutional limits.

Hence the spectacle of Matthew Yglesias in Vox praising Hillary Clinton because she is “clearly more comfortable than the average person with violating norms and operating in legal gray areas,” and in “a reality in which any policy gains [Democrats] achieve are going to come through the profligate use of executive authority…, she knows where the levers of power lie, and she is comfortable pulling them, procedural niceties be damned.” He calls this “America’s moment of permanent constitutional crisis.” But when you say that, you’re supposed to be trying to resolve the crisis, not make it worse by hailing a politician’s “willingness to push harder than the typical public figure against existing norms.”

Unfortunately, this outlook is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If enough people are ignorant of or hostile to the Constitution—and to the entire idea of constitutionalism, of a fundamental law that limits the executive—then at some point it really will become irrelevant.

This is about gun control, just not in the way the left thinks.

Ultimately, this is about gun control, just not in the way the left thinks. It’s not about controlling guns used by individuals for self-defense. It’s about controlling the guns arrayed against us by our own government. Because without constitutionalism, those guns go unregulated and uncontrolled.

All the more imperative to preach the gospel of a government of laws and induct more of the unconstitutioned back into the American creed.

Why Trevor Noah Is Wrong About Guns And Being Pro-Life,"So I guess we can forget about hearing any fresh or unique angles on The Daily Show. New host Trevor Noah recently argued that if pro-lifers truly cared about life, they could become superheroes for the cause by advocating for gun control. It’s an argument as worn out as it is misguided, exposing more about his progressive biases than his comedic prowess.

During the show, Noah offered this sentiment:

If pro-lifers would just redirect their powers toward gun violence, the amount of lives they would save would reach superhero levels. They just need to have a superhero’s total dedication to life. Because right now, they’re more like comic book collectors. Human life only holds value until you take it out of the package.

This tired liberal talking point demonstrates a false dichotomy between two main conservative ideals: saving the unborn and favoring the Second Amendment. “Imagine if we could bring some of that pro-life passion into being more, well, pro-life,” Noah said with a smirk.

The thing is, we don’t have to imagine — because pro-lifers are passionate about life—all life. They’re opposed to women killing their unborn infants because they believe in protecting innocent life. Certainly they don’t support the criminal actions of mass shooters. They’re in favor of legal gun possession because they believe in protecting innocent life. These two scenarios aren’t at odds. In fact, they are quite consistent.

Guns Save Lives

Vox weighed in on Noah’s comments, contending that while “Noah’s pro-life argument is unfair to pro-gun conservatives […] the facts on gun violence are, broadly speaking, on Noah’s side: More restrictions on guns would save lives.” This might come as a surprise to Noah—and sorry to disappoint, Vox—but guns save more lives than they take.

Vox goes on to say, “The fault of Noah’s critique of pro-life conservatives who oppose gun control lies in the fact that they don’t believe gun control can save lives. In fact, many gun rights advocates genuinely believe that gun control can get people killed–since without guns, they won’t be able to, for instance, defend themselves from home invaders.”

Essentially, Vox says Noah’s observation is flawed… but only because he doesn’t get that conservatives (erroneously) think gun control endangers lives.

Data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics show us that guns are the safest and most effective means of self-defense. Their use results in fewer injuries to the defender and is safer than not resisting at all. Gun Owners of America calculated that every year firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of innocent citizens than to take lives.

Of the millions of citizens who have guns, most don’t even fire the weapon at their attacker. They merely brandish the gun or fire a warning shot.

Of the millions of citizens who have guns, most don’t even fire the weapon at their attacker. They merely brandish the gun or fire a warning shot. Less than 8 percent of the time does a gun owner kill or wound an attacker when confronted. Armed citizens kill more criminals in the act of protecting themselves and their loved ones than do the police (1,527 to 606). According to Newsweek, only two percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person, compared to the police error rate, which is five times as high.

According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California, a state with some of the strongest gun-control laws, had the highest number of gun murders in 2011. Compare that to Texas, which had nearly half the number of gun murders as California. Washington DC, which has strict gun-control laws, also has a high gun murder rate and finished first in gun-related robberies per 100,000 people.

Politico recently ran a long piece written by two gun-control advocates arguing that defensive gun ownership was a myth. But Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University, offered a strong retort, most importantly pointing out that data consistently indicates that Americans underreport crime victimization experiences, gun ownership and their own criminal activity. We probably don’t even know the full extent guns help us defend life.

Guns Save Unborn Babies’ Lives, Too

Noah said that if pro-lifers cared about saving even one life they’d favor gun control—but obviously he doesn’t understand how lives are saved, both inside and outside the womb. When two men broke into her home, a Tennessee woman who was pregnant at the time grabbed a 12-gauge shotgun and pointed it at the men. They immediately ran, and she didn’t even have to fire a shot. That’s what being pro-life and pro legal gun possession looks like.

In Mobile, Alabama, a woman who was six months pregnant held an armed home invader at shotgun-point until the police arrived. Another life was saved in Roswell, New Mexico, when an 87-year-old man used his gun to stop a violent attacker from attempting to sexually assault a pregnant woman. In Indiana last year, intruders attempted to invade a pregnant woman’s home, but her life and her unborn child’s life was saved when her boyfriend shot and killed one of the intruders, before that intruder could join the other in fleeing.

Being pro-life and pro legal gun possession are not mutually exclusive nor are they at odds with one another.

Another example of a gun saving lives is the mother who defended herself and her two children when a man broke into their home in Loganville, Georgia. She and her nine-year-old twins hid in a crawlspace, which the intruder eventually located. When he opened the door, he found himself staring at a .38 revolver. The woman fired all six rounds and fled with the kids. Amazingly, the man fled the house and survived. It turned out he was a serial criminal and had been arrested six times.

This Oklahoma mother had just lost her husband to cancer when she shot and killed an intruder to protect her three-month-old baby. What would have happened to those mothers and children had they not had guns to defend themselves? Does Noah even care? (Oh, and here are some more examples of how guns save lives, if Noah needs more evidence.)

Being pro-life and pro legal gun possession are not mutually exclusive nor are they at odds with one another. In fact, they are morally, legally, and ideologically intertwined, working in tandem to protect innocent lives, in different ways, both offensively and defensively.

Without the right to defend oneself with force, law-abiding Americans would be as defenseless as a newborn—incapable of defending themselves, looking only to the state to prevent harm. That’s the world Trevor Noah wants us to live in. It’s not the world most of America wants.

Ben Carson Is Right About Nazi Gun Control,"There has been a great deal of ridiculous outrage over some perfectly defensible comments Ben Carson made last week. During an interview with Wolf Blitzer, Carson was asked to clarify something he’d written in his book, “A More Perfect Union”:

German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s, and by the mid-1940s Hitler’s regime had mercilessly slaughtered six million Jews and numerous others whom they considered inferior … Through a combination of removing guns and disseminating deceitful propaganda, the Nazis were able to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance.

With Blitzer, Carson added: “[T]he likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed.”

For even the most amateur of historians, Carson’s statements are obviously, objectively true: Germany in the late 1930s did indeed have a strict gun-control regime, and by the mid-1940s the German death camp machine had vaporized millions upon millions of defenseless victims, all with very little resistance from the civilian population.

History Is Even Stronger Than Ben Carson’s Telling

But Carson is only telling half of the anti-Semitic Nazi gun-control story. In addition to the disarmament that took place in the late 1930s, for about five years in the early-to-mid-1930s the Nazi Party had engaged in a massive nationwide seizure of weapons from political opponents. The Jews were predictably among the targeted groups.

‘The most foolish mistake we could possibly make,’ Hitler said, ‘would be to allow the subject races to possess arms.’

In Breslau in 1933, Jews were ordered to “surrender [their] weapons forthwith to the police authorities” on the basis that “Jewish citizens have allegedly used their weapons for unlawful attacks on members of the Nazi organization and the police.” This was a regular occurrence all over Germany until the Waffengesetz of 1938, which effectively banned Jewish firearm ownership in all of Germany (though this had been something of a reality for a while, as in 1935 the Gestapo had ordered no weapons permits to be issued to Jews without the approval of the Gestapo itself).

The Nazis were also happy to exploit actual instances of Jewish quasi-insurrection. In early November of 1938, after a young Jewish man attempted to assassinate the German ambassador in Paris, a general campaign was launched to disarm the Jewry of Berlin. As the Berliner BörsenZeitung reported, Jews in Berlin found still in possession of a weapon without a “valid weapon permit” would be treated with “the greatest severity.”

So it went. The disarmament of the Jews was a political and social fact in Nazi Germany. It is uncontestable and inarguable. It was one of the many harsh realities of German Jewish life in the 1930s: if you were a Jew and you had a gun, the Nazis wanted to take it. Adolph Hitler himself knew it: “The most foolish mistake we could possibly make,” he said, “would be to allow the subject races to possess arms.” The Nazi Party was ruthlessly methodical. It knew that disarmament was a pretext to annihilation. You could not easily kill a Jew if he could easily kill you back.

F*** Off, History, We Hate Guns

So, both historically and practically, Carson is right and his clueless, hysterical critics are completely wrong. The Nazi government was a zealous disarmer of Jews, and this disarmament made it easier to eventually ship the Jews to death camps in boxcars. This is patently obvious.

It is unlikely that a fully armed German Jewry could have stopped the merciless onslaught of the Final Solution.

Yet the general reaction has been one of almost comical obtuseness. Rabbi David Wolpe accused Carson of “blaming the victims.” Both the fashion magazine GQ and pot-smoking fartsmith Seth Rogen told Carson to “fuck off.” At The Guardian, Nigel Jones called Carson’s remarks “ignorant, offensive, and downright stupid.” The Twitterverse exploded with indignation. All of this was spectacularly witless and uninformed.

Carson’s detractors do at least have this on their side: it is unlikely that a fully armed German Jewry could have stopped the merciless onslaught of the Final Solution. The program was backed by the full might of the Nazi government, and even a tightly coordinated attack by all the able-bodied Jews in Germany would have likely been futile.

But given the realities of the Wehrmacht, the issue should not be one of, “Could a civilian militia have defeated the German army and prevented the Holocaust?” Rather, the question is this: “If the German government hadn’t stripped the German Jewish population of arms, would it have been easier for the Jews to fight back, and would more lives have been saved?”

The answer is obviously yes. The Holocaust might not have been “greatly diminished,” as Carson claimed, but there would have been a better-than-average chance that many people could have been saved, and it assuredly would have been better than nothing.

If Facts Won’t Persuade You, Try This

By the time of the Wannsee Conference, it was probably too late for anyone outside of an invading army to do anything to stop the sure march of extermination. But prior to the full implementation of the Final Solution, an armed Jewish population would almost certainly have had a positive effect on the Jewish casualty rate.

An armed Jewish population could have had a lot of success pushing back against certain elements of anti-Semitic hostility in Nazi Germany.

The forced-labor camps, the einsatzgruppen, some of the pogroms and ghettos, Kristallnacht—an armed Jewish population could have had a lot of success pushing back against certain elements of anti-Semitic hostility in Nazi Germany. Armed civilians might have saved a decent number of lives from the clutches of the Nazi Party. This is a fact.

But it’s a fact the Left cannot treat with: to acknowledge that Hitler disarmed the Jews in order to make them weaker opponents, and to acknowledge that the Jews, with guns, could have had moderate success fighting against the Nazis would offer legitimacy to one of the Left’s most hated boogeymen: an armed civilian populace.

Progressives refuse to believe civilian armament has any utility whatsoever. Indeed, they claim gun ownership is actually a threat to civil society and should be tightly regulated, if not banned altogether. So when Carson points out what even Hitler himself acknowledged—that Jews in Nazi Germany would have been better off with firearms instead of without them—they cannot acknowledge the sheer obviousness of his position. Their response: “Fuck you, Ben Carson.”

You cannot reach these people with logical, well-reasoned historical arguments. So instead, to all of those people who think Carson is both wrong and crazy, we can pose a simple, easy to answer question: if you could be transported back in time and assume the role of a Jew in late-1930s, German-occupied Poland, would you rather be disarmed—or would you rather have a gun?

She's Glad She Had No Gun After Her Boyfriend Raped Her,"They already had sex earlier that day, but he wanted more. She didn’t want to do it again. The evening had been a disaster. Out drinking with friends—his friends. Bar hopping. Dancing. Tequila shots. He was in one of his moods, and the pot didn’t help. It all started with some guy flirting with her. He blamed her. He always blamed her. Now he wanted to mark his territory. She was his, and he had to prove it.

“Take off your clothes,” he said, sitting on the edge of the bed, sweat glinting on his forehead, his pupils dilated. He didn’t even look like himself.

She shook her head. “I’m tired, and I really don’t feel like it.”

“Come over here,” he said. “I’ll make you feel like it.”

She turned away and shoved some clothes into a drawer. “You should just go back to your dorm. I don’t want to fight.”

She wasn’t prepared for what came next. He lunged across the room and grabbed her, pulling her onto the bed and crawling on top of her.

“Get off!” she said. “I told you I didn’t want to.”

“But I do,” he breathed in her ear, ripping off her underwear. His elbow dug into her breast, and she cried out in pain. He didn’t care.

She struggled, kicking her legs. He held her down. She couldn’t believe how weak she was compared to him. Never had she felt so helpless, and it terrified her. He was too strong, too heavy, too in control. She was so angry—at herself for being weak, at him for being cruel.

“Get off me!” she cried, the tears streaming from the corners of her eyes into her hair. She remembered how it felt cool against her skin. Strange that she would remember such a tiny detail.

“You’re hurting me!” she sobbed. “Please stop!”

He had betrayed her, and there was nothing she could do about it. Nothing.

“I know you want it,” he said, and he pressed harder, holding her wrists together with one hand while spreading her legs with the other, his nails digging into her thigh.

“I said stop!” she yelled, hoping someone in the hall would hear. He clamped his hand over her mouth, leaving her to beat him with her fists. It didn’t faze him.

“Feel that,” he whispered. “He could never make you feel like this.”

She couldn’t speak. She couldn’t move. All she felt was him, as if she didn’t even exist. Over and over again. She thought it would never end.

When it did, he passed out, snoring as if nothing had happened. She slipped out from under him, pulling on her clothes, shaking, forcing her legs to move, rage ripping through her. That’s what she would always remember so clearly—the rage she felt. He had betrayed her, and there was nothing she could do about it. Nothing.

In that moment, as she looked at him lying on the bed, she wanted him to pay for what he’d done. She glanced over at the phone. Should she call the police? No, she didn’t want to get them involved. This was personal.

He groaned and turned over, still snoring. She ran to the bathroom and shut the door. She wiped herself off and slumped to the floor, rubbing the tears from her eyes. Anger and shame pounded in her temples. She imagined, for a moment, hurting him like he had hurt her. She pictured him bleeding, his eyes open, staring at her face—the last image he would ever see as he slipped from this world. She hated him for making her feel this way, for thinking such hateful thoughts—becoming, in a way, like him.

Most College Victims Know Their Rapists

That’s what many rapes look like on college campuses. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), college-age female victims know their offender 80 percent of the time. It’s not surprising, then, that the same percentage of victimizations among students goes unreported to police. That doesn’t mean it’s always a boyfriend. It could be just a friend or acquaintance (50 percent). Contrary to the erroneous claims of researchers, most campus sexual assaults aren’t committed by serial predators.

Student victims were more likely than non-student victims to state that the incident was not important enough to report.

From 1995 to 2013, more than 90 percent of rapes and sexual victimizations of female students were committed by a single offender, rather than a group of offenders. Student victims were more likely than non-student victims to state that the incident was not important enough to report. Like the girl in the account above, they considered it personal.

The problem of sexual assault on campus has been an issue of heated political debate. Hillary Clinton recently said more needs to be done to protect women on campus: “There needs to be a decision in our country and on every college campus that any woman who reports an assault should be heard and believed, and there should be a process that is in place — not made up every time that something like this happens — to examine what she is saying, to begin to hear from people to make some kind of decision that is viewed as fair to everybody, because it does need to be fair to everybody. But many women like her feel that they are basically being asked to remain silent. That nobody wants to hear from them, that nobody wants to believe them, and nobody wants to have the comprehensive services that they need.”

Clinton didn’t go into detail about what “comprehensive services” should be put in place, but she is missing one important element to this debate. Most women don’t report sexual assault, not because they’re ashamed or because there isn’t help or counseling to be had, but because they know the person who did it. It’s a friend, an acquaintance, a boyfriend, and they just don’t want to get the police involved.

Beware Adding Guns to Volatile Relationships

Some gun advocates have suggested that the solution to sexual assault on campus is to put a gun into the hands of female students. S.E. Cupp writes that denying women the right to defend themselves with guns is “madness,” and she wonders when it will end. “When will feminists demand that women on college campuses be allowed to protect and defend themselves against sexual assault?”

Rape and sexual assault actually don’t happen as much on college campuses as many have assumed.

Michele Fiore, a Nevada legislator who is pushing a campus-carry bill, said, “If these young, hot little girls on campus have a firearm, I wonder how many men will want to assault them.”

Jade Reindl and Jean Cocco think such a statement is ridiculous and argue that “the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the woman’s risk of dying by homicide by 500%. That means we need to keep guns away from domestic abusers and off campus to begin with.”

While Reindl and Cocco have a valid concern, the option to ban guns completely flies in the face of our right to bear arms in order to protect ourselves. But the reference to domestic violence in this context is noteworthy as we consider how to apply the law at colleges, because most sexual violence on campus is more like domestic violence cases, and a complexity of circumstances involving abuse, anger, dysfunctional relationships, drinking, and drug use.

It’s also important to point out that rape and sexual assault actually don’t happen as much on college campuses as many have assumed. While it has been reported that 1 in 5 female college students are victims of sexual assault, the actual rate, according to BJS, is 6.1 per 1,000 students, making the real number 0.03 in 5.

Of those incidents, 80 percent of the assaults involve someone known to the victim. To arm women in these instances—and considering that drugs and alcohol are often a part of the mix—could create more violence and tragedy, not less. Given these realities, when we debate this issue, it’s best not to use sexual assault on campus as a reason to push for less gun restrictions.

Easy Sexual Access Is the Root Problem

When asked years later whether she wished she’d had a gun the night her boyfriend raped her, the woman in the story above said no. “I probably wouldn’t have been able to get my gun anyway—it happened so fast—so it wouldn’t have stopped him from raping me. Even if I could have gotten to it, what would have happened? Would he have wrestled the gun from me and killed me? Would I have shot him? Did he deserve to die for what he did? I don’t think so—at least that’s how I think now.

The fact is we have an environment on college campuses where sex is common, with students failing to exercise self-control.

“But what scares me most is what I would have done afterward—if I’d had a gun. Would I have shot him? I can’t tell you how angry I was—it has stayed with me for years. A deep rage that resurfaces at times for no apparent reason. It’s like a monster was born that night, a monster that’s haunted me ever since, turning inward. But, no, I’m glad I didn’t have a gun. If I did, I might have killed him. Imagine what the monster would have looked like then. The man I once loved wouldn’t have gone on to graduate, to live a wonderful life, to marry another woman, and to be the good husband and father he came to be. His life would have ended because he was foolish. Cruel, yes, but foolish. And so was I.”

We have an environment on college campuses where sex is common, with students failing to exercise self-control. When dealing with the fallout of this irresponsible behavior, administrators act like hovering parents instead of school officials, debating about disciplinary procedures in response to rape instead of calling the police. All the while, nothing is done about alcohol and drug abuse on campus, and too often men are targeted and not given due process.

Trivialization and Hype Doesn’t Help

Add to the mix the heightened rhetoric surrounding sexual assault and rape on college campuses, creating a distorted view of what’s really happening. We have wishy-washy standards recommended by the U.S. Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights on what constitutes rape—that institutions should consider sexual assault allegations under the “more likely than not” standard of evidence, rather than the current and more stringent “clear and convincing” standard.

All of this stirs the pot and makes it seem like every guy (especially if he’s a frat boy or an athlete) is a rapist.

Then there are Hollywood documentaries adding fuel to the fire by saying most of these victimizations are the result of a predator at work, plying women with alcohol; lies about rape on campus, detracting from the plight of real victims; women’s studies classes teaching that men are guilty until proven innocent; and students carrying mattresses across campus because college administrators are indifferent to the “rape epidemic.” And don’t forget the “It’s On Us” initiative from the White House, creating a panic about sexual assault on campus, and the U.S. Department of Justice including “attempted forced kissing” in its statistics, even though the DOJ admits this isn’t classified as criminal behavior.

All of this stirs the pot and makes it seem like every guy (especially if he’s a frat boy or an athlete) is a rapist. Then, in the midst of this mayhem, we have pro-gun lawmakers wanting to get guns into the hands of students so they can protect themselves from the rapist hiding behind every bush. This combination could have tragic consequences unless some sobriety is brought to the discussion.

What Can We Change?

What we need to do as a society is stop the rhetoric about a rape epidemic and call it what it is: a hook-up culture, composed of anything from foolish physical advances to date rape. If we’re going to allow (and even encourage, as some do) sexual freedom on college campuses, we need to let kids endure the harsh and painful consequences of that freedom—and take personal responsibility for their actions. When it comes to lifting gun restrictions, we need to talk in terms of serious violent crime, and not incidents where a girl is going to end up killing her boyfriend in her dorm room.

If only she had a gun in her purse, maybe her life would have been saved.

When we consider lifting gun restrictions on college campuses so people can protect themselves from criminal behavior, we shouldn’t think of that girl in the story above, as harsh as that might sound. We should think of women like Eve Carson, a Morehead Scholar at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, community service volunteer, and student body president, who was shot and killed by two local men in 2008.

They abducted her as she was getting into her car. Later, after she pleaded with them not to kill her and begged for them to pray with her instead, they shot her repeatedly in the middle of a Chapel Hill street. One blast was to the head, making her unrecognizable.

If only she had a gun in her purse, maybe her life would have been saved. This beautiful young woman who had so much to offer might still be with us today, becoming the physician she’d always dreamed of, if only she’d had the ability to protect herself. My alma mater still grieves over her loss.

Whether it’s the death of Carson, the kidnapping of Hannah Graham, the mass shooting at Virginia Tech, or the murder of nine people at an Oregon Community College, these are the kinds of crimes people should be thinking about when they advocate for guns on college campuses—not date rape or the hook-up culture.

Ben Carson's Progressive Critics Should Answer This Question,"Last week, famed pediatric neurosurgeon and Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson was asked by CNN about claims in his book about the Nazi policy of disarming Jews. Both in his book and during the CNN interview, Carson claimed that had the Jews not been forcibly disarmed by Hitler, the Nazi regime would not have so easily been able to implement its genocide of millions of Jews.

As Daniel Payne explains, Carson’s claim was objectively and incontestably true. An armed foe is far more dangerous and difficult to subdue than an unarmed one.

Carson’s anodyne statement, though, was not nearly as fascinating as the hysterical progressive response to it. Rather than even attempting to make an argument that Carson was wrong, they went straight to the political version of gaslighting: instead of engaging an individual or argument, just mount a deliberately dishonest campaign to convince everyone, including the subject, that he’s a crazy person with no grasp on reality. After all, there’s no need to refute arguments made by insane people. So instead of engaging Carson’s argument, they gaslighted him and anyone who might defend him (language warning):

Hey yo fuck Ben Carson http://t.co/fIHd18IFhG



Drew Magary (@drewmagary) October 8, 2015

Wow, great arguments, guys. You sure showed that pediatric neurosurgeon what was what. On one hand, Carson–a world-renowned pediatric surgeon–made a completely uncontroversial remark about the nature of the Nazi gun control regime: its entire purpose was to make it easier for Nazis to kill Jews. On the other hand, you used the F-word repeatedly. I don’t know who I can trust!

The progressive response to Carson is illustrative: deep down they know that Nazi gun confiscation during the Holocaust poses something of a problem for those who wish to institute gun confiscation regimes today. Defending forced gun confiscations in theory (“fewer guns means less violence!”) is a lot easier than defending forced gun confiscations in practice. So instead of being faced with either defending Hitler’s gun confiscation regime or acknowledging that Carson’s underlying point was correct, they chose to gaslight him.

They should not get off that easy, though. If they’re going to attack Carson for accurately describing the intent behind Nazi disarmament of Jews, then they need to answer a few questions about that disarmament regime. Question one: was Hitler wrong to disarm the Jews? Why or why not? (Or if you’re a Godwin’s law adherent: was the South wrong to forcibly disarm blacks?) And question two, should they deign to answer the first one: why did Hitler disarm the Jews?

Those two questions pose some serious problems for anyone wishing to argue that gun confiscation in principle is perfectly acceptable. There are only a few answers to the first question of whether Hitler was wrong to disarm the Jews: 1) no, because the Jews deserved it, 2) yes, because gun confiscation is wrong in principle, or 3) yes, but only because everyone’s guns should’ve been confiscated. No decent person on earth could possible offer the first answer. No gun controller could possibly offer the second answer, because they believe that gun confiscation is a worthy policy. Which leaves the third answer. And that third answer boils down to, “Yes, Hitler’s gun confiscation regime was wrong, but only because Hitler didn’t go far enough to disarm everybody.” That answer is untenable for obvious reasons.

Here’s how Politico‘s Glenn Thrush approached the question after his own attempt to gaslight anyone with the audacity to defend Carson:

Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) October 12, 2015

@GlennThrush Yes or no question, Glenn: was Hitler wrong to disarm the Jews?

Yes or no question: who the f–k made you the asker of yes or no questions? https://t.co/k8fZOZqqnt



Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) October 12, 2015

Setting aside for the moment the fact that Thrush seems to not understand how yes-or-no questions work (hint: they never begin with the word “who”), you can plainly see how uncomfortable the question makes him. This kind of back and forth–me asking Thrush a simple question, Thrush hopelessly flailing about in an attempt to avoid it–went on and on until he finally blocked me, which is a perfect illustration of how unwilling some pro-gun control progressives are to engage in any activity even remotely resembling actual debate.

I'm honestly a bit horrified that you've now refused three separate times, @GlennThrush, to say whether Hitler was wrong to disarm the Jews.



Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 12, 2015

I can't believe I have to explain this, @GlennThrush, but the answer to every ""Was Hitler wrong to ____?"" question is yes, Hitler was wrong.



Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 12, 2015

If your politics prevent you from saying ""Hitler was wrong to do _____,"" @GlennThrush, it might be time to rethink your politics.



Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 12, 2015

All you had to do was say, ""Yes, OF COURSE Hitler was wrong to disarm the Jews,"" @GlennThrush. But you couldn't do it. Remarkable.



Sean Davis (@seanmdav) October 12, 2015

To his credit MSNBC political reporter Benjy Sarlin unhesitatingly answered the first question about whether Hitler was wrong to disarm the Jews:

@seanmdav OF COURSE HE WAS, who is this Nazi straw man you are arguing against who says this was good?



Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) October 12, 2015

Unfortunately, he balked at answering the second question, the one that gets to the foundation of Ben Carson’s point: why did Hitler disarm the Jews?

@seanmdav Sean, you're embarrassing yourself. I'm not going to promote this crap by arguing with you further.



Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) October 12, 2015

The reason pro-gun control progressives really, really, really do not want to answer those questions is because the answers are obvious. Hitler disarmed the Jews because it made the whole process of murdering them easier on the Nazis. The Nazis didn’t want to get shot, so they disarmed anyone and everyone who might shoot at them. Like most evil tyrants, Hitler preferred to commit genocide without running the risk of being slowed down by those he intended to oppress and murder. His reason for gun confiscation was no different than the rationale used to disarm blacks in the American South.

Frederick Douglass, the escaped American slave, knew quite well why slaveowners didn’t want their slaves to have access to firearms:

“[T]he liberties of the American people [are] dependent upon the ballot-box, the jury-box, and the cartridge-box,” Douglass wrote, referring to the right to vote, be tried by a fair and representative jury, and own and carry firearms (“cartridge” box was a reference to ammunition). “[W]ithout these no class of people could live and flourish in this country.”



After the U.S. passed the Fugitive Slave Act, an 1850 law that required all captured slaves to be returned to their masters, Douglass again referenced the power of the firearm to preserve one’s God-given rights. To Douglass, the only “true remedy” to the execrable fugitive slave law was “a good revolver, a steady hand, and a determination to shoot down any man attempting to kidnap” an escaped slave.

It’s no coincidence that black gun ownership helped put an end to the racist Jim Crow laws throughout the South.

An unarmed victim is much easier to kill than an armed one. The oppressor wishes for nothing more than for the oppressed to have no ability to fight back. Vile, violent megalomaniacs like Hitler understood this. The American Founding Fathers understood it, too, as did the Brits who sought to ambush the colonists’ ammunition stores. It’s why the Founders insisted on explicitly stating that the right of Americans to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. The Founders knew that something more than flowery language would be required to uphold the God-given rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was neither authored nor ratified by accident.

Progressives can try to gaslight people like Ben Carson all they want, but if they’re going to play that game, they’re going to be forced to answer some uncomfortable questions themselves. If they’re going to attack Ben Carson for accurately stating that an unarmed populace is in a poor position to fight back against someone wishing to wipe them off the face of the earth, then they’re going to need to explain why, exactly, people like Hitler and those who oppressed blacks in the South were so eager to prevent their prey from fighting back.

"If You Want To Protect Yourself, A Gun Works A Lot Better Than A Plastic Phallus","A student named Jessica Jin at the University of Texas in Austin is apparently so against campus carry – recently passed in Texas by Governor Greg Abbott – that Jessica has decided to protest it by putting a giant dildo on her backpack…for some reason. #CocksNotGlocks she calls the movement.

“‘You’re carrying a gun to class? Yeah well I’m carrying a HUGE DILDO,'” says Jin on the #CocksNotGlocks Facebook page, which has almost 5,000 participants at the time of this writing. “Just about as effective at protecting us from sociopathic shooters, but much safer for recreational play.”

I’m not sure how effective a dildo would be against an armed madman, and I doubt Jin has enough knowledge in the way of self defense to make an accurate assessment as to the defensive power of plastic cocks. Unless she is trained in the lost ancient whore art of Dong-fu, there’s not much you can do to wield the faux phallus effectively for self defense.

Yes, I realize the this tantalizing tool was designed for penetration, but only in certain avenues that allow such penetration into the body. Have you ever attempted to penetrate something with a dildo like a chest, or spinal column? Try it. I imagine the person you’re attempting to stab with the plastic penis won’t find themselves so much harmed as highly annoyed, and probably a little grossed out.

Furthermore, I don’t think larger dildos are capable of achieving the necessary velocity needed to penetrate the epidermal layer of the body. At high speeds it would likely bounce off the person. You would need something smaller and more aerodynamic, as this pioneer of science has already discovered using a specific caliber of dildo, the 28mm Damaging Inflicting Longitudinal Destruction Object.

Even then, this man has created a gun, which you’ve established you are against.

It also should be noted that a big wobbly wiener is an extreme close range weapon, capable of only CQC (close quarters combat) or in this case, CQDC. Unless you can close the gap between you and your gun wielding opponent before the time it takes for him to pull the trigger, and engage in expert wang wielding, then your odds of survival are very slim.

Realistically, bringing a dildo to a gun fight will cause the shooter to laugh, momentarily throwing off his aim slightly before he shot you anyway, where you would then die holding a dildo.

Here’s how the scenario will likely play out for you. Imagine you are the Arabian fellow wielding the sword, but instead of a sword you’re twirling a tallywacker, and imagine Indiana Jones with the gun is Indiana Jones with a gun.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/10/13/if-you-want-to-protect-yourself-a-gun-works-a-lot-better-than-a-plastic-phallus/,2015-10-13
Why Do Democrats Get Away With Lying About Guns?,"When Carly Fiorina offered some imprecise words about videos that uncovered the harvesting of body parts, she was subjected to weeks of semantic, nitpicky fact-checking that allowed Democrats and the media to portray her accurate characterization of Planned Parenthood’s practices as an outright “lie.”

Now, it would be a waste of time to expect comparable scrutiny aimed at Democrats who make unequivocally false statements about guns—a topic that elicits similarly emotional responses. But, for credibility’s sake, it’d be nice if once in a while someone would call out the president, or leading Democratic Party candidates, or the countless others who lie about firearms.

President Obama, who not long ago made the ludicrous claim that in certain neighborhoods it was “easier for you to buy a handgun and clips than it is for you to buy a fresh vegetable,” now says, “It’s not just mass shootings. It is the daily shootings that take place in cities across America. It is easier to buy a gun than buy a book.”

Does anyone in the media believe it’s easier to purchase a Glock than it is a carrot or a book? Probably. I mean, why isn’t there a slew of concerned CNN panels parsing this fantastical statement—or the many others Obama makes about guns?

The president is supposedly referring to the lack of bookstores in low-income areas, but surely it isn’t the case there, either. Books can be purchased or borrowed through schools, libraries, community centers, bookstores, Wal-Marts, Targets, many supermarkets, and, most importantly, through something called the Internet—that not only allows you to download books almost instantaneously, but also allows you to buy used copies at very low prices. Let’s put it this way: even if you can’t afford books, they are surely far cheaper than any gun you could buy—even if guns were, as so many liberals incorrectly claim, something that can be picked off the shelf without any ID and walked home.

Yet folks like Virginia Gov. Terry McCauliffe regularly assert, as he did at a DC rally a couple of weeks ago, that it’s easier to buy a gun than beer in Virginia, because you have to provide ID to purchase alcoholic beverages. McAuliffe also claimed that gun shows have booths with signs that say “no background checks.” As my colleague Sean Davis has pointed out, the federal government has the statutory authority to define who does and does not qualify as an individual “in the business of selling firearms.” Since 1938, every gun dealer in the U.S. has been required to obtain a federal firearm license—whether they sell it in a gun shop, or a gun show, or from a shack in somebody’s backyard. (In some states, a private party firearm transfer between two residents of the same state is permissible without having to process the transaction through a federally licensed dealer.)

When this kind of thing goes uncorrected by media, it begins filtering into the ether and millions of Americans begin to believe it. Take CNN, which was hoping to pump up ratings for the Democratic Party debate yesterday by having celebrities ask the candidates questions.

Here is actress and comedian Judy Gold’s entry:

A few months ago, I sent my 13-year-old son out to pick me up some Mucinex and Nyquil. The pharmacist wouldn’t give them to him because he’s under 16. Why is it easier for him to get a gun than to pick up medicine for his sick mom?

Maybe nanny-state, regulation-happy politicians should stop intruding into every aspect of American life, and kids would be able to buy medicine for their mommies without worry. But in California, and I’m just guessing that’s where Gold lives (if we’re talking about New York City, the process for buying a gun is even more difficult) a person must be at least 18 years of age to purchase a rifle or shotgun and 21 years of age to purchase a handgun. A 13-year-old would never be able to buy a gun legally.

An adult would have to submit a Personal Firearms Eligibility Check application, along with a copy of her California driver’s license or a similar ID card to make sure they are eligible. That already makes it a lot trickier to buy a gun than to purchase Nyquil. The application needs to be notarized and must include an impression of your right thumbprint—which makes getting a gun, a right explicitly guaranteed by the Constitution, more difficult than it is to vote (one that is not). It can take up to 120 days for the state to get back to you. If you are eligible, there is the background check and a 10-day waiting period.

When this kind of thing goes uncorrected by media, it begins filtering into the ether and millions of Americans begin to believe it.

You might not ever know this if you listened to the Democratic debate on Tuesday or any of the commentary afterwards. When the candidates weren’t advocating that gun manufacturers be held accountable for every crazy person who uses a firearm for nefarious purposes, or blaming the National Rifle Association rather than the millions of people who support the Second Amendment, nearly every candidate repeated some egregious falsehood about guns. Most of the candidates spoke about “common sense” gun regulations.

Perhaps the Democrats were confused. There is no gun show loophole. There are straw purchases, which have been federal felonies since 1968. I understand that perpetuating these myths is necessary for liberals to create the impression that we need more laws, but the Fourth Estate—which, it’s probably safe to say, generally views the presence of guns as an unholy part of American life—has a responsibility to correct these wild exaggerations and untruths. Yet they rarely do.

I Want My Husband To Have A Gun On Campus,"A university campus isn’t one of the world’s most dangerous places. As a college professor’s wife, I’ve got nothing on army wives, police wives, or fishermen’s wives. Still, when I watch my husband head off to work, a dark thought occasionally flits through my mind. Is it possible his university will be the next to furnish a stage for some psychopathic loner’s macabre suicide fantasy? One never knows.

Clearly, the school shooting is becoming a preferred exit strategy for the criminally insane. Some speculate on how we might stem this tide, with liberals demanding gun control and conservatives more reasonably speculating on the possible upsides of media prudence (for instance, in not printing a shooter’s name) and better facilities for mental health. I doubt whether any of these strategies will do much good.

Fixing the problem through gun control would be unrealistic, even if we were willing to shrug off the Constitution. America is already filled with guns, and there’s no feasible way to reclaim them. I have no objection to exploring the other solutions, but doubt they’ll have much efficacy, and I’m even inclined to ask: if it weren’t campus shootings, wouldn’t it just be something else?

Glorifying Victimhood Doesn’t Help

We live in a world that glorifies aberration and celebrates victimhood. Meanwhile, family and community breakdown, along with a burgeoning welfare state, have left us with hordes of angry, bitter loners who spend hours of their day consoling themselves for their undeveloped manhood by consuming violent media in industrial quantities.

I should say this sotto voce, but there are much more effective ways to kill people en masse. The school shooting is horrific, especially when it involves the slaughter of children. Even so, I’m somewhat grateful that our homicidal maniacs haven’t settled on something more destructive.

In short, I don’t think it’s possible, or even necessarily advisable, to stop the problem before it starts. “This should never have happened!” we cry, when reading the wrenching stories of lives ended and families destroyed.

Of course, all else being equal, we would certainly prefer to live in a world where such things didn’t happen. But the social conditions that precipitate these shootings are as broad as they are deep. Some (gun ownership) should not be changed. Others (massive victim complexes) most emphatically should be changed, if anyone can figure out a way to do it. But we’re not going to fix those problems overnight, and given the gravity of the spiritual sickness, we should probably be grateful that the death toll hasn’t been larger.

Let Would-Be Victims Shoot Back

It’s one thing to accept that my husband’s mostly-safe job has a slightly increased risk of death by psychopath. It’s quite another to accept that he can’t do anything about it. Granted, it isn’t likely that someone would try to murder him and his students in cold blood. We now have to agree, though, that the risk is no longer entirely negligible. If news rooms were being shot up at the same rate, I’m guessing we’d be seeing major movement on the protect journalists front.

We see communities of healthy, intelligent people choosing to be sitting ducks for murderous psychopaths.

As it is, the Students for Concealed Campus initiative has helped bring campus-carry legislation to 13 states, but only one (Texas, of course!) has actually passed major legislation to permit concealed carry on campus. The great majority of university faculty and staff are still stuck hoping “campus security” can get on top of the situation before they and their students all die.

Academics aren’t underprivileged, of course. They’re just extremely squeamish about guns. That’s why we see communities of healthy, intelligent people choosing to be sitting ducks for murderous psychopaths. It’s infuriating; aren’t universities supposed to be gathering places for smart people? So how do they conclude that it’s a good idea to permit (nay, insist!) the guy with the murder-and-death wish the cozy security of knowing he’ll be the only one around with a firearm? I hate that our young people are coming of age in such an environment.

How About Some Compromise?

Not every state can be Texas. Overt state pressure is probably necessary to persuade universities to allow students to carry. Most of my liberal friends are horrified by the very notion. Students are irresponsible! They drink and get high on campus! And do we really want to drop guns into their soap-opera sex lives? Stock up on crime-scene tape now!

If the very idea of touching a gun terrifies you, don’t volunteer.

Might we consider a compromise? Don’t start by allowing everyone to carry. Universities can exercise more control by issuing campus-carry permits, probably to eligible faculty and staff. The program would be strictly voluntary. If the very idea of touching a gun terrifies you, don’t volunteer.

The university could retain sole discretion over the application process, and draw up whatever certification requirements they think appropriate. Wading through a university-devised training program would be irksome for experienced shooters, but I suspect campus liberals would be somewhat reassured by the university’s declaration that, “Don’t worry! We trained them all ourselves!” Progressives are pretty sure that any “firearms safety course” offered by, say, the National Rifle Association must resemble a live-action outtake from “Grand Theft Auto.”

Many people, of course, will be outraged by any arrangement short of no guns anywhere. When I propose this very limited, tightly-controlled campus-carry policy, they scoff. Why not just issue guns to everyone at freshman orientation? Why not send teams of armed soldiers prowling the campus with their AK-47s? (You have to mention the AK-47 for maximum impact. “Assault rifle” is an acceptable substitute.)

My plan is entirely affordable and incurs no serious risks.

These questions are obviously silly. Furnishing security at that level would be extremely expensive. It would also put a real dent in the luxurious and toney atmosphere that most campuses try to cultivate. By contrast, my plan is entirely affordable and incurs no serious risks. The university needn’t even buy any actual guns, and the danger associated with arming a small number of established, educated professionals is surely tiny.

What about “the campus atmosphere”? I’m confident there would no discernable change. Once the protests died down, most progressive faculty would likely forget that a handful of their colleagues might possibly be surreptitiously armed. Progressives rarely have any notion of how often they’re in proximity to concealed carriers precisely because most of them are responsible people who would only draw in a true emergency. (But if they wanted to establish a policy of banning firearms in faculty meetings, I might support that. It’s hard to exaggerate the pettiness of faculty meetings.)

In the end, that’s really the question we have to ask. In a real emergency, do you want the psychopath to be the only one with a gun? Or would you rather take the terrible chance that people like my husband (a legal gun owner and married father of four) can handle carrying a weapon responsibly, knowing he might then be in a position to save your life if a deranged gunman chooses our university community for his next rampage?

I know what I would prefer. I think all university families should ask themselves why they aren’t demanding the same.

It Makes No Sense For Gun Banners To Support Abortion,"Two weeks ago, an OB-GYN in West Bloomfield, Michigan, struck a special-needs child with his car. When police obtained his vehicle’s “black box” to examine recorded data from the accident, they discovered that Michael Arthur Roth was hoarding human tissue, likely from dead babies, in 14 plastic containers in his trunk. Law enforcement are now investigating whether Roth was performing illegal abortions in the homes of his patients and at his own residence.

Liberals have long argued that keeping the practice legal would prevent women from terminating their pregnancies in unsafe conditions. But, as this case in Michigan shows, there are still abortionists willing to perform the procedure illegally, even if that means having to ride around with dead babies in the trunk of their cars to hide them from the authorities.

These so-called “women’s health” warriors would likely claim that if more abortion facilities were available, fewer women would seek Roth’s services. But West Bloomfield already has an abortion clinic, and the township is located less than 30 miles away from Detroit, which also features numerous abortion providers, including a Planned Parenthood facility.

Atrocities Are Isolated Incidents When It’s Abortion

As stories like Roth’s emerge, it is becoming increasingly clear that this is a practice rooted not in women’s health, but instead, in murder. Abortion advocates would likely contend, as they have so many times before, that this case is but an outlier among the sterling, professional facilities that are typical of the industry, but their position is becoming increasingly untenable.

The media and abortion rights advocates cry that each disgusting example doesn’t reflect the industry as a whole.

What about Kermit Gosnell’s abortion factory, where babies were left flailing half-alive and women were fighting for their lives? We were told it would be illogical to assign the horrors of his practice to the outstanding providers of “women’s health” around the country.

Or what about the videos showing Planned Parenthood executives bragging about buying luxury cars by selling the tissue of aborted babies? Planned Parenthood responded by first attacking the video producer, then proudly proclaiming they were offering a needed service, and then asserting this behavior was not the norm at their organization (and, after several months, ultimately promising to stop making a profit off selling baby parts).

The media and abortion rights advocates cry that each disgusting example doesn’t reflect the industry as a whole. They insist these cases prove why we need more abortion clinics and more abortion providers who can safely offer these services that many women so obviously want.

Not So With Guns

There are 270 million guns in America today. With each infrequent instance of gun violence, gun-control zealots demand we outlaw firearms or at least significantly restrict the rights of lawful gun owners. Despite the fact that shootings have declined over the past two decades, activists need little motivation to call for regulations they claim are reasonable efforts to save lives. They argue that mass shootings, no matter how rare they might be within the larger context of gun ownership, define the use of guns in the United States.

With each abortion case, Americans are told that, unlike gun ownership, these atrocities should be viewed as exceptions to the rule.

By comparison, there are fewer than 1,800 abortion providers in America, but there are countless examples of this murderous enterprise subverting the law or ignoring medical ethics. This includes, but is not limited to: neglecting patients; failing to provide adequate care for babies surviving botched abortions; refusing to obtain parental consent for minor children seeking procedures; failing to report known cases of rape, incest, and pedophilia; and selling baby parts for profit. With each case, Americans are told that, unlike gun ownership, these atrocities should be viewed as exceptions to the rule.

But what should cause more societal concern: something that happens at an alarming frequency among a small population (abortion providers) or something that happens at an ever-decreasing, infrequent rate among a massive population (gun owners)?

Those calling for gun control are likely ideological siblings of those who resist any restrictions on abortion. While they whine that the country must “do something” about gun violence, they don’t want to “do something” about murderous events that happen at a much higher frequency with the practice of abortion.

Fine, Let’s Do Something About Violence

When pro-life Americans ask for reasonable regulations—clean facilities, doctors maintaining admitting privileges at local hospitals to protect the mother or baby if an abortion goes wrong, parental consent for minor children seeking abortion, limits that would be on par with the rest of the civilized world (outlawing abortions after the first trimester)—liberals accuse them of trying to restrict women’s rights and sending females back to the pre-suffrage era.

These are the same people who mock gun-rights supporters who see any violation of their Second Amendment rights as a step toward taking away their guns.

That’s because abortion advocates believe that even the most modest regulations of this industry would lead to lawmakers ultimately outlawing the practice. Funny enough, these are the same people who mock gun-rights supporters who see any violation of their Second Amendment rights as a step toward taking away their guns altogether.

While gun control proponents perpetuate the erroneous notion that mass shootings characterize lawful gun ownership, abortion advocates willfully fail to acknowledge the statistical reality of atrocities actually defining their industry. The repeated call of progressives to “do something” about violence caused by individuals using firearms is simply not extended to thwarting the violence caused by individuals robbing human beings of their right to life through abortion.

Before those on the Left start hurling rocks through their glass abattoirs at lawful gun owners, maybe they should consider “doing something” about those purported outliers who so clearly define their slavish and unquestioning devotion to the unbridled practice of abortion.

"Poll: NRA Is More Popular Than Clinton, Obama","A new poll released by Gallup today shows that the National Rifle Association, or NRA, is more popular than Hillary Clinton or President Barack Obama.

According to the poll, 58 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the gun rights organization, while only 35 percent have an unfavorable opinion of the group.

In contrast, Obama’s most recent presidential approval rating is 46 percent. A majority of Americans, 50 percent, disapproves of the job he’s doing as president. A NBC/WSJ poll released earlier this week shows similar numbers for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That poll found that 39 percent of voters have a positive view of Clinton, while 48 percent view her negatively.

The continued vilification of the NRA by Democratic politicians seems to have had little impact on the gun group’s reputation, as the public’s opinion of the NRA remains relatively unchanged over the past decade. In 2005, Gallup found that 60 percent of the public had a favorable view of the NRA:

In a year plagued with mass shootings, including a recent tragedy at a community college in Oregon, there has been a national debate as to whether the NRA, with its ardent support for gun rights, is somehow complicit in these shootings. For example, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has blamed the NRA for stifling the movement toward gun control. More broadly, some commentators in the news media and on social media have criticized the NRA for its theory that “a good guy with a gun” may stop “a bad guy with a gun” in mass shootings.



Yet in a Gallup poll from Oct. 7-11, a solid majority of Americans (58%) say they have an overall favorable impression of the NRA. This includes the highest recording of “very favorable” opinions (26%) since Gallup began asking this question in 1989. In December 2012, soon after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, 54% of Americans had a favorable impression of the NRA. The highest percentage in Gallup’s 26-year trend was in 2005, when 60% of Americans viewed the organization favorably.

The NRA enjoys majority support from both conservatives and moderates. Liberals are the only ideological group to have an unfavorable view of the organization. Even a plurality of non-gun owners has a positive opinion of the NRA. According to Gallup, 78 percent of gun owners have a positive opinion about the NRA. Among non-gun owners, 49 percent have a favorable view of the NRA, while 42 percent have an unfavorable opinion.

The oldest civil rights organization in America, the NRA was formed by former Union soldiers in New York in 1871 to help improve marksmanship among the general public. As it grew, the NRA set up local charters throughout the South in order to train African-Americans to better protect themselves from racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/10/22/poll-the-nra-is-more-popular-than-clinton-obama/,2015-10-22
Ken Starr Says Students Can’t Be Trusted With Guns,"Monday, during a symposium on education reform hosted by The Waco Tribune, Baylor University President Ken Starr again said his Texas campus should remain free of guns.

“Baylor University is a private institution, and by that virtue should be given the right to opt out,” he said on stage, speaking about Texas’s campus carry legislation, recently signed into law by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.

“You believe your campus would be made less safe by the presence of guns on it?” asked the host. “I do,” responded Starr. Starr has already made his position on the campus carry law clear by visiting the state capitol to assist efforts to defeat the bill.

Baylor does not allow campus carry, though students have challenged this rule. In 2013, a petition to allow concealed carry, bearing the signatures of more than 600 students , was submitted to state Sen. Brian Birdwell, after the Baylor faculty had submitted a petition to forbid concealed carry, signed with 120 signatures.

In 2014, the Baylor student board passed a motion to allow concealed guns on campus that would have gone to campus administration for consideration, but was vetoed by student-body President Dominic Edwards.

Students Aren’t Mature Enough for Guns

“What exactly is it about the presence of guns on campus in those conditions—of age, licensed, and all that, that makes you feel like this is wrong for Baylor?” asked the host.

Starr responded by offering the opinion of Baylor’s public safety chief, who agrees that firearms should not allowed on the grounds. Starr explained that it boils down to not trusting students’ ability to make wise decisions about guns: “Considering judgement, such as maturity, these are, as you said, 19- to 24-year-olds, and I’m not sure it would be right for 30-year-olds…but they’re developing, trying to discover who they are.”

It’s hard to argue that removing guns from capable and licensed students would do anything to make Baylor safer.

While Starr is welcome to his opinion, the fact that concealed carry has been proven to save lives cannot be denied, and it’s hard to argue that removing guns from capable and licensed students would do anything to make Baylor safer.

Campus atrocities such as the recent Oregon shooting could have been avoided or their carnage limited if any students—such as Chris Mintz, the hero who charged the shooter—had been armed. Weigh that with the fact that 92 percent of mass shootings since 2009 have taken place in gun-free zones, and Starr’s stance that a campus free of guns would make for a safer school seems rather short-sighted.

Furthermore, while the campus itself is relatively safe, the city that Baylor is in, Waco, has a checkered reputation for crime. CollegeFactual.com rated the Baylor campus B- in safety but gave Waco an F+, with aggravated assault ranking as the greatest-frequency crime committed, at 57.4 percent. Even students who live on campus would do well to own some form of protection in that kind of environment.

In an age where the numbers agree that more guns equal less crime, Baylor’s stance is behind the times. When even some Texas public schools are adopting measures that bring guns into the capable hands of those who can and should wield them, perhaps it’s time for the university to reconsider its stance on the matter and allow its students the power to protect themselves.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/17/ken-starr-says-students-cant-be-trusted-with-guns/,2015-11-17
"The Left Prays After San Bernardino Shooting, To Its God Of Government","At least 14 people were killed and 17 others injured in San Bernardino, California, by Syed Farook and Tafsheen Malik, a couple who later died in a shootout with police. As with the tragic rampage in Colorado just a few days prior, there’s a frustrating lack of details. Many in the media at first focused, as they tend to do during mass shootings, on their anger with the National Rifle Association, a large gun rights and gun safety organization. Some focused on the fact that the shooting took place about a 25-minute walk from a Planned Parenthood facility. Really.

Progressive and liberal politicians called for gun control. And other politicians prayed for the victims and their families while waiting for more information.

That’s when things got super weird. For some reason, much of the media began mocking the efficacy of prayer. This was happening while victims of the shooting were actually asking people to pray. I mean, the critiques were everywhere. An editor at ThinkProgress said, and I quote, “Stop thinking. Stop praying.” There’s a bumper sticker for you!

Here’s how The Huffington Post put it:

Stunning. “Public officials are the people society trusts to solve society’s ills?” Their “useless” thoughts and prayers?

Twitter highlighted in its “Moments” section another progressive journalist’s campaign to shame politicians who prayed for victims. And a senator from Connecticut tweeted about the attack, without understanding the perpetrators, their motive, or their relationship to any proposed or imagined gun restriction:

A well-regarded, progressive Washington Post journalist wrote this:

Nailed it, Mr. Weingarten. The people who are the problem are the people who are praying. Airtight logic! Most blasphemously, the New York Daily News attempted to get page clicks with this cover, seemingly stolen straight from the progressive echo chamber but amped up a notch:

Ballsiest newspaper front page of the day. pic.twitter.com/K58FFtoVmg



— Michael Moran (@TheMichaelMoran) December 3, 2015

I’m honestly not sure what possessed all of these media types to choose “people who pray” as the target of their anger. It was really weird and revealing. Almost more of a temper tantrum than anything else, particularly since progressives immediately turn to prayer of a different kind in the aftermath of tragedy. I wrote about this a few months ago when an Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia, killing five people and injuring many others. Before anyone knew anything about the cause of the crash (it was later suggested to be a speeding train operator), journalists began blaming future potential budget cuts to the corporation that receives more than $1 billion in federal subsidies each year. It’s natural to feel helpless in the face of tragedy, and the desire to have someone to blame is understandable. That the people the media blame so frequently are “Republicans” is perhaps telling, but let’s set that aside.

Theodicy

Theodicy attempts to defend God’s goodness and omnipotence in light of the existence of evil. “Why do bad things happen to good people?” the question goes. (To which a Lutheran might reply, “Trick question! There are no good people!”) There are various schools of thought and debate, rekindled with every hurricane, tsunami, earthquake, act of terror, and mass shooting. Progressives seem to begin their response to tragedy with the question, “Why do bad things happen to good governments?”

The god of good government would have been able to take care of us if only we’d given it sufficient power.

The theodicy of federal government seeks to defend the goodness of government in the face of tragedy. So just as some religious groups might blame a weather event on insufficient fealty to the relevant god, some progressives blame — before we actually know what is even going on in a given tragedy — insufficient fealty, sacrifice, and offerings to the relevant god of federal government. And so they explain that the god of good government would have been able to take care of us if only we’d given it sufficient power to do so. In this case, that power is gun control. Progressives tend to believe that government — if made to have sufficient size, scope, and proper management over the affairs of man — will fix or at least seriously mitigate the problem of evil in the world. Conservatives tend to believe that human nature is flawed and inclined toward bad things. Conservatives believe that government, being made up of humans, will also be inclined toward bad things, and therefore it must be restrained and not given a dangerous amount of power. They tend to see greater success for fixing problems in society with voluntary associations and institutions, such as families and community and organizations. Progressives tend to believe that man can be perfected, and perfected through government action. These almost cartoonish denunciations of prayer we saw yesterday, combined with the implicit praises of government action, are best understood as a sort of primitive religious reaction to the problem that growth of the state still hasn’t fixed the problem of evil in the world.

“Something must be done!” is a prayer.

The Scandalous DJT (@AceofSpadesHQ) December 3, 2015

And these calls for the big government god to shine upon them with mercy are frequently more ritual than anything else. The people who find hope in big government don’t seem to be terribly interested in more than the ritual of proclaiming their piety, announcing how happy they are to not be like the “other men,” and half-hearted proposals of unworkable legislation that (surprise!) never solves the problem of man’s fallen condition.

On Prayer

The Huffington Post piece began, “Public officials are the people society trusts to solve society’s ills.” In fact, the Psalmist put it well a long time ago as “Put not your trust in princes.” This is wisdom understood by Jew, Christian, and secular libertarian alike.

It’s not just that believers don’t put their trust in earthly government officials, it’s also where they do put their trust.

It’s not just that believers don’t put their trust in earthly government officials, it’s also where they do put their trust.

The phrase “thoughts and prayers” can be grating, but not because prayer is not efficacious. Rather, the “thoughts” portion can seem somewhat meaningless. Combining it with prayer makes it seem like prayer is nothing more than “thoughts.” But prayer is at the heart of the Christian faith. Jesus spoke about it extensively, explaining to those of us who follow him how to pray to our father in heaven. Perhaps you have heard of the “Our Father,” which provides the model of prayer for the Christian.

Prayer is described throughout the entirety of Scriptures, from Moses’ telling of discussions with God all the way through St. John’s glorious vision of the consummation of prayers in the restored heavens and earth, described in Revelation. And the Gospel of Luke describes how Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane on the eve of his crucifixion — “being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.”

Jesus tells us to call God our Father. He tells us that God wants us to ask him for things like a father wants his children to ask of him, so he can answer and give them what they ask for to show his love. If you are genuinely interested in why Christians pray, this introduction to the Lord’s Prayer is a great primer. For the Christian, we pray because God commands it, and that means it’s extremely important but also that you don’t need to feel unworthy about doing it. We know God wants to hear our prayers and will use our prayers to help us in our sanctification. And perhaps someone can explain to the theological giants over at the New York Daily News that answers to prayers aren’t like some divine soda machine where you put the money in and out pops a Fresca or whatever.

We pray also because of our needs; the community’s needs, which, in love, we should take on; and the burdens of all of our neighbors and even our entire country and world. Here’s a sample that came across my Twitter feed yesterday, from the great memoirist Mary Karr:

A reader–Ellen Ward–asks for prayers to erase her brain tumor. If yr so inclined, take a knee with me. pic.twitter.com/rUv1FvdKuY



Mary Karr, Author (@marykarrlit) December 2, 2015

These burdens are so great that we should be in constant prayer. And as we reflect on all the abundance in our midst, we should be in praise and thanksgiving. For the Christian, all prayer is centered in Christ Jesus and what he has obtained for us — a rescue from the darkness of sin and death. These are fairly large concepts, and sadly they are mostly beyond the capacity of far too many journalists.

But prayer isn’t just “thoughts” and perhaps people could really drop the “thoughts” portion of the phrase. Kudos to Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan for their more theologically precise public statements in that regard.

Prayers And/Or “Action”

Now, many gun control advocates said they weren’t disparaging prayer — however much that was exactly what was going on — so much as calling for other action. It’s good to remember that prayer is action. But whether your God is God or the FBI (or whatever agency you hope will seize up to 300 million guns in the country), it’s also true that there is no conflict between praying to God, who, as the Founders put it, creates us and endows us with certain inalienable rights, and other action. That could be working within a community to change people’s hearts and minds from violent ideology. It could be working with your neighbors to help them avoid choices that lead to dangerous social isolation. It could be teaching Sunday School or otherwise inculcating children in the faith. It could be managing your family well. It could be gun control or efforts to help families with adult members with mental illness. It could really be any number of things.

There is no conflict between praying to God and other action.

What’s wise is to understand that there are many options for working to improve society. If, like so many journalists, your particular religious denomination is the one that’s fundamentalist on gun control, fine. But understand that not everyone is part of your religious sect or shares your assumptions.

The bizarre outpouring from journalists of anti-Christian sentiment yesterday was not becoming. And some of it was downright alarming. But consider that many journalists didn’t really understand what they were doing. They are bad at understanding the religious practices of much of the country, of course. But they’re not particularly good at understanding their own theodicy and its attendant rites and rituals either.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/12/03/the-left-prays-after-san-bernardino-shooting-to-its-god-of-government/,2015-12-03
Obama’s Push For Gun Control Won’t Defeat ISIS,"President Obama’s push for increased gun control in the wake of the San Bernardino attack won’t defeat ISIS, The Federalist publisher Ben Domenech said on CBS’ “Face The Nation” on Sunday.

“There’s a real gap between what the president is saying and what people understand is reality of the situation,” Domenech said. “You’re not going to defeat these elements of radicalized Islam in this country with gun control measures.”

Gun control wouldn’t have prevented the San Bernardino attack any more than the climate change summit in Paris could defeat ISIS, Domenech said. Last week, Obama remarked that the climate change talks would serve as a “powerful rebuke” to the radicalized group that took credit for the Paris attacks.

“The president in his address tonight is probably going to speak to these issues further,” Domenech said. “But Republicans, actually, I think have the wind at their backs when they’re running this criticism that, basically, the president is out of touch with reality and this gun-control measure — any gun-control measure — is not the real solution.”

Gun Manufacturer Stock Prices Are Booming Under Obama,"If the performance of these gunmaker stocks is any indication, President Barack Obama might be the greatest gun salesman in American history.

Since Obama took office in January of 2009, stock prices for publicly traded American gun manufacturers are booming. There are two publicly traded gun manufacturers based in the U.S., and their stock prices have gone through the roof since Obama became president.

Smith & Wesson’s stock price has increased nearly 700 percent since January 20, 2009, according to a list of historical daily prices provided by Yahoo! Finance. Over that same period of time, the overall stock market, as measured by the S&P 500, increased by approximately 150 percent. When Obama took office, the price of one share of Smith & Wesson stock was $2.57. As of Monday morning, that same share was worth nearly $20.

The stock price for Ruger, which is based in Southport, Connecticut, increased even more than the price of Smith & Wesson shares. Since January 20, 2009, Ruger’s share price has increased by an eye-popping 800 percent. Monday’s share price of nearly $57 is more than nine times higher than Ruger’s opening share price of $6.25 on the day of Obama’s 2009 inauguration.

A weekend editorial by the New York Times calling for widespread gun confiscation, as well as a nationwide address on gun control by Obama on Sunday night, appeared to accomplish little more than boosting the values of the two American gun manufacturers. As of Monday morning, Ruger’s share price was up 4 percent compared to Friday’s closing price, while Smith & Wesson’s share price increased by more than 5 percent since Friday.

Both gun manufacturers are now valued at roughly one billion dollars. The Massachusetts-based Smith & Wesson has more than 1,700 full-time employees. Ruger employs nearly 1,900 people, according to Forbes.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/12/07/gun-manufacturer-stock-prices-are-booming-under-obama/,2015-12-07
President Obama’s Gun Speech Proclaims His Impotence,"Saturday afternoon I began to write a response to The New York Times’s page-one editorial, “End the Gun Epidemic in America.” It had many of us worried.

None fear, or should fear, the NYT’s editorial persuasive power. The last time the NYT put an editorial on its front page, it was to lament the nomination of Warren G. Harding, who went on to one of the top five landslide victories in U.S. history. And this current offering is so rhetorically loaded with shame at its opponents and complete ignorance about what motivates them that it will not change minds, at least not in the way the editorial board hopes. The first linkable reaction I saw on this effect came from Roger Simon. He was not an outlier.

It is not effectiveness but what the editorial signals about elite and current government viewpoints that has people concerned. The government and Manhattan intelligentsia look set to act against the right to keep and bear arms, a very ominous development in already trying times.

A U.S. Gun Grab Is Impossible

That was how my planned piece began. I then laid out how the Obama administration might go about reducing gun ownership. I looked at voluntary surrender and registry options. Assuming for the sake of argument that Congress would pass any such legislation (Sen. Dianne Feinstein tried in 2013, if you recall) I could not conceive of a plan that would be more “successful” than the Canadian or Australian programs. Too few citizens would comply.

I looked at coercion options, such as a sin tax on ownership or a hefty tax for any owners refusing to register or turn over certain weapons. All of this would be challenged as an unconstitutional tax on an inherent right, especially coming right after the Internal Revenue Service audit moratorium while it was investigated for targeting organizations for their political views. Furthermore, the agency would need a huge chunk of money to hire enough auditors to make the plan look less like a failure than say, Cash for Clunkers. (Remember that bit of governmental brilliance?)

I could not conceive of a plan that would be more ‘successful’ than the Canadian or Australian programs.

Finally, I looked at search and seizure options using federal enforcement agencies, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the U.S. Marshal Service, the Secret Service, a federalized National Guard, and the Department of Homeland Security. Even if Obama saw everything break the government’s way on executive order challenges and cooperative state and local officials—all highly improbable—these agencies combined do not have enough people to do the job. We are simply too many, too spread out, and too motivated to defend our right to keep and bear arms.

In short, a gun grab in the United States is impossible. And based on Obama’s Oval Office speech last night, he seems to have finally figured that out.

The Speech Was an Utter Failure

Obama’s speech was a collapse. It had no teeth. It offered no comfort. It was full of policy blunders. And his delivery was soft—not comforting, but resigned.

We will ‘continue to’ do the things we’ve been doing. Because those things have been so effective?

On terrorism, Obama didn’t really say anything other than—finally—admitting that many of the shootings during his tenure were not tragedies, but terrorist attacks. The rest was vague phrases about how we’ve been working tirelessly to combat terrorist organizations.

We will “continue to” do the things we’ve been doing. Because those things have been so effective? Recent events and the resurgence of Russian influence suggest otherwise. We will defeat terrorism by being “smart and strong, resilient and relentless.” Besides the lack of specifics, is it not odd to claim relentlessness given things like the Iraqi pullout and our refusal to aid France and NATO? We will “draw upon every aspect of American power,” yet Obama foreclosed the option of anything beyond air bombing a few minutes later. (Yes, in a public address, he told our enemies what his limits were. If they can weather our bombs, which they are managing quite well now, then they’ll be fine.)

In a flourish of hypocrisy, he also asked Congress to authorize these bombing actions. They’ve not done so yet. The Nobel-winning president that the world once loved dropped bombs on his own authority. Now that the world knows exactly how effective those raids have been, he wants congressional cover.

On life here at home, he lectured us. He lectured us about religion. He lectured us about defense. He lectured us about discrimination. He basically admonished us to stay still and trust him, even though his record has given us no reason to do so and his speech offered no tangible new hope.

We Can’t Protect You, and You Shouldn’t Protect Yourself

The world and our nation are far more dangerous and angry places than they were when he first took office. His message: stay the course and worry about our own behavior. That is a lesson I often tell my children. But it is a message about enduring things we cannot change. It is not what I would tell them to do in the face of a violent bully in the school yard, yet it is the message Obama gave to the American people after a terrorist attack on our own soil.

The world and our nation are far more dangerous and angry places than they were when Obama first took office.

Despite all the despair above, the collapse was most obvious with gun control. Most political journalists and news outlets expected a longer speech. They suspect that he cut a significant portion, most likely about gun control. Even with a perfect storm of elite passion on the issue—the NYT editorial, the New York Daily News screed, and the New Yorker cover—somebody must have made him finally realize the danger and futility of a gun grab of any sort. As I had planned on publishing, there is simply no winning scenario for the federal executive branch versus the Second Amendment. Long before it is the defense against tyranny, it is a most effective deterrent.

Obama dropped all but a bit of control rhetoric and a single, terrible idea. He introduced the call for gun limits by lamenting that the government could not root out every lone terrorist. So government admits that it cannot protect us from lurking, individual evil—again not a comforting speech—and he asks us to lower our personal defenses? Why? So we might be reduced to waiting for a terrorist to reload while we helplessly cower?

Regardless, it was just words. The only specific gun control plan they left in the speech was a supposedly common-sense gun purchase ban for the no-fly list. In the one spark of passion in the speech, Obama said he could think of no reason why we don’t curtail the rights of people on the no-fly list.

Obama Is Out of Ideas

Well, for one, the Senate already rejected the idea on Thursday, so I’m baffled as to what he thinks he options are. Executive orders die in challenges when the legislature has spoken on the issue. More significantly, however, the Senate rejected the ban probably because they, like the American Civil Liberties Union, can think of a bunch of reasons not to use the no-fly list.

The speech reaffirmed to our enemies Obama’s lack of resolve.

The no-fly list is not a just a list of strongly suspected terrorists. It is just billed that way to the public. The criteria are not published, but the most famous lister was the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. He had sufficient pull in the government that he got removed relatively quickly—three weeks. The rest of us are not notified if we are added or removed. We are not informed about why we make the list. We can write a letter to get removed, but there is no guarantee of timely consideration. (Doug Mataconis has a great summary of abuses and usurpations with the no-fly list.)

The speech accomplished nothing. It did not reassure U.S. citizens of their safety here at home. It offered no new ideas for combating terrorists abroad. It reaffirmed to our enemies Obama’s lack of resolve. And the one new, specific proposal for “keeping America safe” will more likely see the no-fly list struck down than allowed as an obstacle for gun purchases.

It seems President Obama has become a lame duck a year early.

Why The New York Times’s Gun Ban Is Utter Fantasy,"The New York Times published an editorial on its front page for the first time since 1920. Entitled “End the Gun Epidemic in America,” its placement and strong language reflect the editors’ outrage over the recent mass shootings and their sense of urgency that something needs to be done.

But “doing something” for the sake of “doing something” is not a sound reason to enact any policy proposal. Moral outrage does not turn a bad idea into a good one. And a careful reading of the editorial reveals a vague and unrealistic policy suggestion that, if enacted, would come with high costs while barely doing anything to prevent gun violence or gun deaths generally.

Beyond the heated rhetoric (“moral outrage,” “national disgrace,” “weapons of war”), the Times suggests “eliminating some large categories of weapons and ammunition” by outlawing them. It states that “[c]ertain kinds of weapons, like the slightly modified combat rifles used in California, and certain kinds of ammunition, must be outlawed for civilian ownership.”

Gun Ban Logistics Are Staggering

Setting aside the political impracticalities of the Times’ proposal, it faces serious practical and logistical problems. First, there is no easily defined category of long rifle called a “combat rifle” or “assault weapon” that can be banned. These weapons are semi-automatic rifles that fire one bullet with one pull of a trigger, like countless other rifles. Fully automatic weapons are already heavily regulated and almost never used to commit a crime. Legislation banning assault rifles generally focuses on style (pistol grips, detachable magazines, and other features deemed military-like) rather than substance (the semi-automatic rifle itself).

As James Jacobs, director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law, argues in a recent article, “banning assault weapons is pointless” because they are “functionally equivalent to other semi-automatics and . . . figure hardly at all in violent crime.” In 2013, of the 8,454 gun homicides the Federal Bureau of Investigation tracked, only 285 were traced to rifles of all kinds, as opposed to 5,782 that were tied to handguns.

Every rifle would need to be registered, and additional costs would derive from the coercive measures needed to force people to register.

Perhaps one could solve the definitional problem by outlawing the sale of all semi-automatic rifles. Ignoring the political realities of this, it would still probably not stop the use of these weapons because so many U.S. households already own at least one of them. And any actual movement towards such a ban would lead to an incredible surge in sales, considering the sales spikes that have occurred when talk of much less restrictive gun control measures occurred after previous mass shootings.

There would also be the logistical problem in the form of huge administrative costs for citizens and the government. The costs would be large because every rifle would need to be registered, and additional costs would derive from the coercive measures, such as fines or jail time, needed to force people to register. Those who accidentally or intentionally failed to register properly would face criminal penalties.

Additionally, all private-party sales, gifts, or other transfers, including loans, would have to be tracked. This would generate an incredible amount of paperwork for law-abiding citizens and for the government, which would have to both set up and manage this system.

Inflating Bureaucracy Won’t Stop Violence

Even if we pretend all of this could be done in a reasonably cost-effective manner, someone willing to commit mass murder can just break a few laws to obtain the guns, so these policies would actually stop few shootings. Surveys of inmates show that most criminals obtain guns on the black or grey market, and they could still do so after such policies are passed. A potential mass murderer is not likely to fill out a form if it would stop him. If they can legally purchase the gun, then commit mass murder, they will.

A potential mass murderer is not likely to fill out a form if it would stop him.

The Times does have a solution to the already purchased weapons problem: “Yes, [our proposal] would require Americans who own these kinds of weapons to give them up for the good of their fellow citizens.” This solution would cost billions of dollars, but would be unlikely to save many lives.

In a world of perfect compliance, just the cost of buying back the semi-automatic rifles will be large. A few years ago, Slate tried to estimate the cost of buying back certain types of firearms. Using some numbers from the article, such as there being 110 million rifles in the United States, and my estimate that 10 percent of them, or 11 million, would be of the banned types, and estimating an average cost of $700 per rifle (which is conservative), the price tag just for the buyback portion would be $7.7 billion.

Even if officials ignored the takings clause of the Constitution along with the Second Amendment, which carries its own intangible costs, the loss of wealth would be real. It would just be borne by a class of citizens instead of all taxpayers.

One could only imagine the far-right backlash and potential violence.

This excludes costs associated with running the program, enforcing compliance, and disposing of the weapons. It also ignores the lost utility from gun owners who can no longer derive pleasure from owning the weapon. Additionally, the cost of coercion would not only involve fining or imprisoning those who fail to comply intentionally or accidently, but it would likely involve heavily armed government agents having to seize these weapons from holdouts.

Considering the scope of the backlash to far less-intrusive government actions, such as the Cliven Bundy incident, one could only imagine the far-right backlash and potential violence. While this type of behavior is deplorable, the reality that it would occur and create additional costs cannot be ignored.

Stop Making Impossible Demands

Attempts to narrow the ban and confiscation to assault weapons would leave millions of semi-automatic rifles in circulation that could easily be turned into assault rifles, while still costing billions and imposing many of the other costs listed above. For example, the Slate article calculated there are more than 3 million of just AR-15-style rifles in the United States.

The cost in money, violations of civil liberties, and the related political realities of making any version of the Times’ program work are not justified.

Either a narrow assault-weapon ban and confiscation or a broader semi-automatic rifle ban and confiscation miserably fail any serious cost-benefit analysis. The cost in money, violations of civil liberties, and the related political realities of making any version of the Times’ program work, when weighed against the meager benefits, are not justified.

Additionally, a total ban would not even stop many of these attacks. Despite extremely stringent gun control laws, the French terrorists just purchased illegal weapons smuggled in from another country. Attackers could switch to handguns—a recent Times article about how 15 recent mass shooters obtained their weapons shows that more shooters used handguns than rifles.

One might now wonder what the United States can do to reduce mass shootings, or gun violence in general. Steps can be taken, but there are no easy, costless answers. Potential policy choices include more gun control, different law enforcement strategies, and changes in the American mental health system.

Gun-control measures could be anything from restrictions on magazine sizes to broader bans on those with mental illnesses from possessing guns. But they have some of the same issues as discussed above. More aggressive law enforcement against potential terrorists (Islamic and right-wing) and those most likely to commit gun crimes, such as those with a violent crime record, would probably be more effective—but that also involves monetary and civil liberty costs. Ditto for changes in the mental health system. However, policy proposals from all three of these areas exist that would be much more effective than the Times’ proposal, since few could be worse.

"Yes, They Do Want To Take Your Guns","I have no idea what an editorial board meeting of The New York Times looks like, but I sometimes picture it as a gathering of the titular Dead Poets Society from the rather overrated 1989 Robin Williams movie: a bunch of mostly confused people discussing things they don’t really understand, all the while believing that they are doing something subversive.

That’s the impression one got last week, anyway, after reading the Times’s bombshell front-page editorial—the first one in almost 100 years—that demanded in no uncertain terms we “end the gun epidemic in America.” The Times declared we need to “reduce…drastically” the number of firearms in this country, “eliminating some large categories of weapons and ammunition,” claiming it is a “moral outrage and a national disgrace” that American individuals can buy firearms “designed specifically to kill people with brutal speed and efficiency.”

The Times’ Proposal Won’t Reduce Violence

There is a rich and tragic irony underneath this rather shameless screed, namely that the two rifles used in the recent San Bernardino shooting—rifles the Times explicitly flagged—were modified in such a way that they were already illegal under California law. This made no difference to the shooters who carried out the act, which is an archetypal example of criminal behavior. It turns out that murderers aren’t interested in following the law, and that they will violate gun regulations if it suits their murderous intent.

Missed points aside, it is reasonable to assume the Times’s proposed bans will not stop at the kinds of rifles used in San Bernardino. The paper lists five other shootings in order to bolster the editorial board’s case—shootings that took place in Colorado, Oregon, South Carolina, Virginia, and Connecticut.

The Times’s proposed bans will not stop at the kinds of rifles used in San Bernardino.

But these incidents involved a great many different weapons: Charleston’s killer used a .45-caliber handgun, Virginia Tech’s shooter used both a 9mm and a .22-caliber pistol, the Colorado movie theater shooting involved a Remington shotgun and a .40-caliber handgun in addition to the shooter’s rifle, and the Oregon shooter was armed with five different handguns. The Navy Yard shooting two years ago—which killed almost as many as the shooting in San Bernardino—was carried out largely with the same Remington shotgun used in Aurora. If someone is both trained and determined, in other words, virtually any kind of firearm can “kill people with brutal speed and efficiency.”

Does the Times wish to confiscate and ban these types of extremely common firearms? One assumes the answer is yes—which is to say, the newspaper is demanding not simply a ban on a few classes of guns, but rather the wholesale prohibition of essentially every practical firearm in America.

Seizing Guns Will Ignite a Civil War

All of this is somewhat subordinate to the larger and more pressing problem, one National Review’s Charles Cooke is wont to point out: a confiscatory gun regime in the United States would almost assuredly lead to another civil war—different and more righteous in its intentions than the first one, to be sure, but just as threatening to the Union, and likely more deadly than the astonishingly fatal conflict that ended in 1865.

What the Times is proposing is distinctly, inherently dangerous.

I know of no Second Amendment enthusiast—myself included—who desires such a war. The prospect itself is uniquely horrifying from about every possible angle, not the least of which would be the existential threat it would pose to these United States. Indeed, all but the most blustery and irrational gun owner obviously prefers not to raise his weapon against his fellow countrymen and his government.

But plainly the prospect nonetheless lies. This country is not Australia, it is not England—it is the United States of America, and consequently what the Times is proposing is distinctly, inherently dangerous. They are not calling for some crummy, expensive health insurance law or another hike on the top marginal tax rate, after all; the realities of gun ownership and gun culture in the United States are much more significant and much more potentially catastrophic than the average progressive political endeavor.

If this has become the established tenor of the gun control movement, so be it. At least we can be done with the shallow euphemisms and preposterous rhetoric that has defined the gun control agenda for years. But if the anti-gun crowd is going to be honest about its intentions, then it should at least be honest about the potential devastation its agenda may wreak upon the country.

Prior to last week, the gun control movement consistently assured everyone: “Nobody wants to take your guns.” That veneer has apparently been cast aside, and has been replaced with an outright call for confiscation. So be it. But let us hope this ridiculous and dangerous idea goes no further than the front page of The New York Times.

Democrats Are Lying About Their Gun Sales Ban,"Gun deaths are down. Gun crimes are down. And progressives still want to take your guns. To aid that purpose, and also because they think it will give Democrats a boost during election season, they are pushing legislation that would allow the Justice Department to forbid the sale or transfer of firearms to, they say, terrorists. Or maybe just to suspected terrorists. Or maybe to people on the federal no-fly list. Or maybe to all of these people. The Democrats have not been clear about just who would be prevented from purchasing firearms under the proposed law.

We’ll Decide Who Gets Guns, on a Rolling Basis

President Barack Obama said in his weekly address, “Right now, people on the no-fly list can walk into a store and buy a gun. That is insane. If you’re too dangerous to board a plane, you’re too dangerous, by definition, to buy a gun. And so I’m calling on Congress to close this loophole, now.” Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also refers to the no-fly list when advocating for the gun sales ban.

On the other hand, the legislation itself, introduced most recently by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California), is entitled the “Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015.” Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nevada) said it must be passed to keep individuals on the terrorist watch list from buying firearms. But Feinstein herself has referred to both the no-fly list and the terrorist watch list when talking about the bill.

So which watch list does the Democrats’ gun ban rely on, and why the obfuscation? The Democrats aren’t going to give anyone a straight answer, but we can go straight to the bill’s text (Senate version, House version). It turns out that the gun sales ban is not tied to the no-fly list, as falsely stated by the president and Clinton and numerous other people, including journalists who have baked this false assumption into their writing. But neither is it directly tied to the terrorist watch list.

We’re Keeping a Private List

Instead, the relevant statutory text links the gun sales ban to individuals who are ”known (or appropriately suspected) to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism, or providing material support thereof.” That language is cribbed from Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-6, which is what created the terrorist watch list (PDF). Thus, the bill gives the U.S. attorney general the discretion to decide whether a person meeting the terrorist watch list criteria should be prevented from purchasing a firearm.

The only way you might find out that you are a suspected terrorist is if you apply for a background check to purchase a gun and are denied.

The Democrats’ lie matters for four reasons. First, the terrorist watch list is much larger than the no-fly list. It varies over time, but there are approximately 1,000,000 people listed in the former, and somewhere around 47,000 people on the no-fly list. Feinstein defends using the criteria that creates a larger list by saying only a fraction of the million-or-so people on the terrorist watch list are U.S. citizens, but whether that’s a large or small fraction is classified.

That’s the second thing. We don’t have precise numbers because these lists are secret. At present, the government has no obligation to inform you that you have been placed on the terrorist watch list, and there are no statutory means to get off of the list. All of that is left in the hands of unknown and unknowable bureaucrats. Under this bill, the only way you might find out that you are a suspected terrorist is if you apply for a background check to purchase a gun and are denied. Even then, the legislation gives the government the discretionary authority to withhold its reasoning for why you were denied.

We’re Playing Loose With the Facts

Third, this will shock the president and Clinton, but people forbidden from buying a gun under this legislation will still be allowed to travel by air. This is because people on the terrorist watch list are not forbidden from flying. They get extra scrutiny at airports, but can come and go as they please, making the president’s pitch even more nonsensical. The terrorist watch list was never designed as a vehicle for adjudicating an individual’s rights or benefits in relation to the government.

The terrorist watch list was never designed as a vehicle for adjudicating an individual’s rights or benefits in relation to the government.

Fourth, the terrorist watch list already gets pinged when an individual applies for a background check for a firearm purchase. Matches are passed to the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division, which may then investigate and block the purchase if it is illegal. Individuals on the terrorist watch list routinely pass this extra screening because the government usually lacks evidence to forbid the purchase. After all, that’s why these individuals are on a watch list, and not in a jail cell.

Thus, when Democrats say the no-fly list should be a no-gun list, they are misleading the public about the bill before Congress. Even Feinstein, who introduced the legislation, gets this wrong some of the time, willfully, according to one of her aides.

The fact that they are pushing for this law now is also pure opportunism. Feinstein introduced this particular legislation in February 2015. It didn’t go anywhere. Nor did it get any traction when it was introduced back in 2009, 2011, and 2013. That’s because, as discussed here previously, the law as written would violate both the Second and Fifth Amendments. Democrats obviously think the time is ripe.

"America, Get Your Guns","Every time there is a shooting, liberals react defensively and push more gun control. Without fail, their misleading, dramatic rhetoric has the opposite effect in real life: More people purchase firearms.

If history repeats itself, the two shootings last week—but especially San Bernardino—will again produce a surge in National Rifle Association (NRA) memberships and gun purchases. This time, the extraordinary efforts of liberal media to discourage gun ownership could mainly serve to make guns seem even more necessary to several distinct groups of people.

If liberal gun control rhetoric is foreplay, consider the likely forthcoming response of many to stop hesitating and become intimate with their right to bear arms.

Second Amendment Zealots

In the wake of the Sandy Hook (Newtown, Connecticut) shooting that killed 26 people, including 20 children, NRA membership surged by 100,000 in just eight weeks. In the six months following that and the Boston bombing, gun ownership skyrocketed. One-tenth of the NRA’s members joined in that time period, making 5 million members total, a record at the time.

The Washington Post reported in July, “Gun control is still going nowhere in Congress. And in fact, with every major mass shooting in America, gun-rights supporters seem to be digging in even further — and bringing the rest of America along with them.”

In his speech Sunday night, President Obama called for a gun purchase ban on people the no-fly list. The first group his rhetoric will motivate is far-right conservatives who are zealous for their Second Amendment rights. Many of them already own guns, possess concealed-carry permits, and have taken classes on gun safety. Case in point:



(Molon Labe is, roughly, a Greek phrase that translates “come and take.” It’s widely used among Second Amendment diehards.)

Friends, colleagues, and folks on Twitter this week have been either considering purchasing a second gun, or doing what we did. I read The New York Times editorial calling for a gun ban, looked at my husband and said, “It’s time.” We both grew up with guns in our homes, are experienced in using them, and are simply concerned about home security. It’s just a matter of making an informed purchase; we are already lifetime members of the NRA.

Second Amendment Believers

These people generally believe in their Second Amendment rights, but don’t own a gun and aren’t seen as “fanatical.” This is a really important sect of people whom heated gun-control rhetoric will lead to gravitate more towards their right to bear arms. They are the most crucial crowd for conservatives and libertarians to pressure to embrace their Second Amendment rights more fully.

They are the most crucial crowd for conservatives and libertarians to pressure to embrace their Second Amendment rights more fully.

Conversely, liberals will continue to press these people to reconsider gun control. Not because it’s dangerous for people to own guns, mind you, but because liberals know that the more people own guns, the more would no sooner rather see their right to bear arms stripped than they would their cell phone taken from them.

This demographic exists. According to a 2014 Pew Research study on guns, from January 2013 to December 2014, the percentage of Republicans who want to protect the right to own guns increased from 70 percent to 77 percent, and the percentage who wanted to control ownership decreased from 27 percent to 22 percent.

For example, this weekend, a friend went to a gun shop and noticed an older woman shopping who clearly did not know anything about guns. She told the gun store employee that she was buying the gun because the current political situation made her nervous, and Obama’s rhetoric even more so. The employee warned her that handguns are extremely dangerous if you don’t know how to use them properly, and advised her not to buy one, but to take classes and go to the range before getting one of her own.

This is wise advice. It’s also wise this elderly woman decided to take the next step in self-protection. I hope she attends classes.

Second Amendment Wafflers

As loudly as this current debate is raging, it’ll likely reach the ear of people who understand the Second Amendment but don’t necessarily embrace it as their own. They are literally and metaphorically gun-shy.

They think the state will protect them. But over the last few years, they have noticed a different reality.

They hope the state will protect them. They think the state will protect them. But over the last few years, they have noticed a different reality. (Your state can’t even facilitate a smooth process at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Why would you leave your family’s protection solely up to them?)

In the same Pew poll, the percentage of Independents who thought the right to own guns should be protected went from 49 percent to 56 percent, and the percentage who thought gun control was a good idea decreased from 47 percent to 42 percent. The biggest jump was actually among moderate Democrats, favoring gun rights increasing from 25 percent to 37 percent and wanting to diminish them decreasing from 70 percent to 61 percent.

A friend of mine who lives in Montana teaches an NRA basic pistol course. His class is required for a concealed carry permit. Ever since the attacks in Paris, he said, “Lifelong Democrats with no gun experience want me to help them out. [They are] all in a rush for a concealed permit. I’ve never seen anything like it. Men, women, democrat students, conservatives, ‘old blue dog Democrats.’” What’s the most encouraging is they don’t just want to purchase a gun, they want to know how to use it.

‘[They are] all in a rush for a concealed permit. I’ve never seen anything like it.’

These people will see something on the news, Twitter, or during coffee with a friend that will help them realize: Guns aren’t the problem. People are the problem. Guns aren’t the problem. Hateful ideology is the problem.

Guns are a tool for protection; guns are a right; guns are a gift to use wisely and responsibly when necessary to protect the ones you love. Many women fit in this group: 45 percent want to protect the right to own guns and 54 percent support gun ownership. I hope they, and the rest of this group—especially those who like to buck the mainstream narrative—will be more open to guns, because they finally realize the right to bear arms is so essential. Sometimes it takes a threat of losing a right to really appreciate and embrace it.

More Guns, Less Crime

Why do gun sales increase after a crisis, especially when the media and progressives are arguing for the opposite? According to Pew, “nearly six-in-ten Americans (57%) say gun ownership does more to protect people from becoming victims of crime, while 38% say it does more to endanger personal safety.”

Americans should embrace this right not just in the wake of tragedy but all the time.

Three out of five felons polled say they won’t mess with a person whom they believe to be armed. From a global perspective, we have some of the highest gun ownership rates and the lowest homicide rates, when compared to other countries.

The Second Amendment is a fundamental, unique, and essential right Americans have and should embrace, not just in the wake of tragedy but all the time. Especially women. Become acquainted with your local range, take classes, inform yourself about gun safety, and then take responsibility for your family’s safety.

That’s sexy; that’s inspirational; that’s an American right. Don’t let liberal rhetoric about gun control sway you against the facts and against your right: Join your comrades in arms.

Stop Trying To ‘End Gun Violence.’ It’s Not Going To Happen,"I’m not one to make light of mass shootings, and I shouldn’t have to say that I deplore violence. But that’s undoubtedly the charge that will be hurled at me when I say that I can’t stand the latest PSA from Everytown for Gun Safety.

Stop me if you’ve heard this before — some advocacy group rounds up a bunch of celebrities and does a quick-cut video of them all repeating the same mantra. In this case, it’s “WE. CAN. END. GUN. VIOLENCE.” Now forget for a moment the utter hypocrisy of Hollywood-types who make their living glorifying violence having a convenient attack of conscience. Even if it is utterly sincere, at this point my tolerance for this clichéd and futile dreck is such that I recommend having an airsickness bag handy before you watch this:

Okay, now that you’ve been subjected to that (I’m sorry), as a palate cleanser you should go ahead and watch this pitch perfect “Portlandia” parody and note how closely it tracks with the Everytown PSA. Finally, repeat after me: Stop trying to make ending gun violence happen. It’s not going to happen.

Willing To Listen

For the record, I am fairly confident that given their druthers, Everytown for Gun Safety would implement ideas about restricting gun ownership that are unconstitutional and would abridge rights clearly spelled out by the Second Amendment. But just because I think they’re wrong about guns — and even suspect of their motives — that doesn’t mean I’m unwilling to listen to gun control advocates and try to find compromise. After all, I think there are some issues around the margins that could be fruitful places to begin a discussion, such as better enforcement of existing gun laws, or areas related to mental health and gun ownership.

If you think a YouTube video can make us all join hands and actualize some cheap I’d-Like-To-Buy-The-World-A-Coke optimism about agreeing to not kill each other, you’re delusional.

But I can’t even begin to have a discussion with anyone who is committed to expressing end goals with this slouching-toward-utopia rhetorical horsecrap. If you told me that the comms department of every liberal nonprofit consisted of a bunch of people in Birkenstocks rearranging the refrigerator poetry magnet set in the breakroom until they stumbled on something sufficiently vapid, I’d say, “sounds right.”

From a practical standpoint, we’re not ending gun violence. As long as we have guns, we’re going to have gun violence. It always astounds me that most liberals (correctly) understand that enforcing prohibitions against something as common as, say, marijuana results in untold horrors perpetrated by the state on the undeserving and innocent. Yet, somehow this same logic doesn’t apply to the fact we’re stuck with 350 million guns. Getting rid of this many guns is about as close to a literal political impossibility as there is.

While you can sputter “But Australia!” all you want, America is a very large and culturally complicated country. Even the easy five-point plan for ridding America of guns involves going door-to-door invading homes. This would, ironically, probably set off 1,000 Ruby Ridges, if not spark an all out civil war. Never mind that even if you take someone’s guns, you can now download plans off of the Internet and 3-D print them, to say nothing of how quickly an efficient black market for guns would ramp up in an era of globalization.

And from a philosophical standpoint, we’re not ending gun violence. People have been killing other people since Cain, and as much as you might revel in the label “progressive,” the only real historical progress here is defined by the increased efficiency with which we’re able to kill each other. Proclaiming that gun violence is on the wrong side of history is frankly nonsensical when you realize that human nature is a constant.

In historical terms, we’re extremely fortunate that economic and technological factors have ameliorated the West’s capacity for death dealing in the last 50 years. But in a world where ISIS is on the march, if you think that the right YouTube video can make us all join hands and actualize some cheap I’d-Like-To-Buy-The-World-A-Coke optimism about agreeing to not kill each other, you’re delusional. Do us all a favor and shut up.

The Language Of What’s Possible

As of late, this Pollyannaish attitude is amped up more than usual because it’s been paired with angry self-righteousness over the fact that evil Rethuglicans are skeptical of banning guns. I wish that were hyperbole, but it isn’t. “It’s Time to Ban Guns. Yes, All of Them” is but one recent headline at a very well known liberal publication.

Accepting the notion that we’re all personally and incurably flawed makes it harder to demonize the opposition.

We spend a lot of time wringing our hands over how liberals and conservatives speak past each other on issues, making it hard to find common ground. Certainly conservatives commit their own rhetorical sins, and liberals are not shy about pointing them out. In turn, I would urge liberals, if they want to actually persuade conservatives, to speak the language of what’s possible. And that means not pretending you can end violence, inequality, poverty, racism, and any other tragic aspect of the human condition. Accepting the notion that we’re all personally and incurably flawed makes it harder to demonize the opposition and, I humbly submit, perhaps more inclined to look within ourselves to find solutions.

Instead, I worry that this kind of sloganeering isn’t actually designed to persuade. Rather something as practically absurd as “We Can End Gun Violence” bridges the rhetorical divide between a zen koan and a giant strawman. By mindlessly adopting an impossible standard, it will only harden the resolve of frustrated liberals when the next horrible event once again makes it evident we can’t will ourselves to transcend our violent nature.

Of course, there are tangible things that can be done to prevent some violence, even if it can’t ever be completely eliminated. We can all agree we can and should do more to stop it. But it’s hard to concoct an effective, let alone agreeable, plan to address violence without acknowledging on some level it’s an inescapable fact of life. Too often, the liberal response to rejecting its utopian premises is to claim that describing the world as it is amounts to cynicism. Then again, some cynicism may even be healthy — this Kumbaya claptrap actually warrants it.

The NYT Has No Clue How The Assault Weapons Ban Worked,"Another day, another series of embarrassing errors and obfuscations by gun controllers who are ignorant of how guns, and the laws that seek to control them, actually work.

In its quest to drive up gun sales even further and make gun control even less popular, the New York Times published yet another overwrought editorial on Friday demanding more gun control. Here’s how the editorial, given the very measured and objective title of “Gunmakers’ War Profiteering on the Homefront,” began:

As each new mass shooting leaves dead and wounded Americans strewn like casualties on a battlefield — a butcher’s toll that has now intersected with the international terrorist threat — the gun industry’s culpability amounts to war profiteering through the reckless sale of military weapons tailored for the civilian homefront.

It only got more hysterical from there. Notably missing from the editorial? Any basic understanding of guns or gun control laws. In this paragraph, the New York Times claims that .50-caliber sniper rifles are now flooding the streets due to the expiration of the 1994 federal assault weapons ban:

Assault weapons were banned for 10 years until Congress, in bipartisan obeisance to the gun lobby, let the law lapse in 2004. As a result, gun manufacturers have been allowed to sell all manner of war weaponry to civilians, including the super destructive .50-caliber sniper rifle, which an 18-year-old can easily buy in many places even where he or she must be 21 to buy a simpler handgun. Why any civilian would need this weapon, designed to pierce concrete bunkers and armored personnel carriers, is a question that should be put to the gun makers who profit from them and the politicians who shamelessly do their bidding.

Those icky guns aren’t just destructive, they’re super destructive. There’s just one teeny, tiny problem with that paragraph: bolt-action .50-caliber rifles were never covered by the federal assault weapons ban. There’s no possible way the expiration of the assault weapons ban could have led to the proliferation of a weapon that was never actually banned by the law, but editorial page editor Andy Rosenthal has never been one to let simple facts get in the way of an unhinged screed.

The 1994 assault weapons law banned semi-automatic rifles only if they had any two of the following five features: a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor, or a grenade launcher. I am unable to see how a collapsible stock or a pistol grip or a mere bayonet mount (not the bayonet itself) is capable of turning a regular weapon into a deadly assault weapon, but your mileage may vary. A bolt-action rifle, even a super destructive .50-caliber bolt-action rifle, that contained all of those features still would not have been covered by the 1994 ban. And to get a .50-caliber semi-automatic rifle around the 1994 restrictions, you would just need to pin the stock and switch out the pistol grip.

And then there’s the fact that a .50-caliber rifle has never been used in a mass shooting in the U.S. Never. That’s probably because those guns are hugely expensive (potentially costing $10,000 or more, not to mention the cost of ammunition) and difficult to lug around given their size and weight (the gun is nearly four feet long and weighs 24 pounds with a loaded magazine). But this is the gun-confiscating New York Times we’re talking about. Expecting its editorialists to understand the objects about which they are editorializing would be a bridge too far.

Which brings us to my next favorite selection in Friday’s editorial: the insinuation that lax control laws allowed the San Bernardino terrorists to build their deadly arsenal with “ease”:

Across recent decades, gun manufacturers, facing a decline in general gun ownership as demographics shifted and sports hunting faded, have cynically created a domestic market for barely altered rifles and pistols developed for the military. These are weapons designed for the rapid spray-shooting of multiple enemy soldiers in wartime, not homeland civilians living in peace.



Yet the latest casualty count of 14 killed and 21 wounded last week in the gun carnage at San Bernardino, Calif., is another horrendous confirmation of how these easily available weapons — marketed as macho tools for a kind of paramilitary self-defense — are being used again and again for rapid-fire attacks on innocent people. The fact that the California killers were self-proclaimed Islamic warriors makes the ease with which their arsenal was assembled all the more outrageous.

What the New York Times predictably fails to tell its readers is that the rifles used by the San Bernardino terrorists were, in fact, illegal. What made them illegal? California has its own version of the expired federal assault weapons ban, which for some reason failed to prevent terrorists from obtaining the weapons and using them to kill people. You read that correctly. Terrorists hell-bent on death and destruction were somehow still able to get their hands on illegal weapons. Imagine that. Criminals with no regard for laws against murder weren’t dissuaded by laws against the possession of certain weapons. It’s almost like gun laws, like drug laws and early-20th century alcohol laws, don’t do a very good job of keeping banned items out of the hands of criminals who wish to possess them. Weird, right?

And don’t get me started on the New York Times‘ silly assertion that a semi-automatic weapon is just a “barely altered” version of a military grade automatic weapon. For years, gun controllers deliberately obscured the difference between the two, regularly referring to semi-automatic guns (one trigger pull, one bang) as automatic weapons (one trigger pull, lots of bangs until you run out of ammunition). In fact, the New York Times did that very thing when it suggested that “rapid spray-shooting” weapons are available to “homeland civilians living in peace” (the families of the 14 victims of the San Bernardino terrorist attack might reject the characterization of the Inland Regional Center as peaceful). But just in case the New York Times was unable to get away with its blatantly dishonest conflation of automatic and semi-automatic, its writers decided to parrot the notion that there’s no real difference between the two types.

It’s almost enough to make one pity these poor, ignorant simpletons, especially when you consider the latest results from the New York Times’ very own poll: support for the assault weapons ban is now at record lows:

For first time in 20 yrs of @nytimes poll, a majority of Americans opposes ban on assault weapons pic.twitter.com/xosjHoDNTi



Patrick J. Egan (@Patrick_J_Egan) December 11, 2015

Here’s how the New York Times described the results of its poll in the 24th paragraph of a 25-paragraph story on the survey:

What has shifted notably are attitudes on gun control. Only 44 percent of Americans favor a ban on assault weapons, 19 percentage points lower than after the mass shooting in Tucson in 2011. And while 51 percent favor stricter gun control in general, that is down from 58 percent in October.

The truth of the matter is that gun control is less popular than ever, thanks in large part to the fears of Americans that their government is either unwilling or incapable of keeping them safe from domestic terrorist attacks. You’d never read this in the New York Times, but the National Rifle Association (NRA) is far more popular than either President Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. That’s no accident.

What gun controllers either don’t realize or refuse to accept is that their radical agenda is not supported by most Americans. The more gun controllers talk, the more popular gun rights become. Most people understand that they have a God-given right, acknowledged and protected by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, to defend themselves and their families from anyone who would harm them. Unhinged demands for gun control by ideologues like Andy Rosenthal and Barack Obama have the exact opposite intended effect. Whenever they lecture, gun sales go up, and gun rights become more popular.

As a result, silly and uninformed rants like those published in the New York Times on Friday don’t bother me. They amuse me to no end. Keep it up, gun controllers! Your rhetoric just might be the most effective advertisement for guns ever devised.

Why Congress Cut The CDC’s Gun Research Budget,"Not long ago, after the mass shooting in Sandy Hook, President Obama issued an executive order that lifted the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) ban on researching gun violence. Despite this, some say the CDC has still not touched gun violence because Congress has blocked funding for this.

Congress removed the CDC’s $2.6 million budget for research into this subject in 1997, after the National Rifle Association (NRA) asked for congressional intervention. But why?

If you were to ask mainstream media outlets that have weighed in, they would tell you the NRA and gun-rights advocates are afraid of what the studies would find, and that the ban came after a damning study concluded guns do cause violence. For this reason gun-rights advocates lobbied to effectively ban the CDC from conducting research on firearm violence altogether.

Firstly, CDC was not banned from doing the research. In fact, CDC articles pertaining to firearms have held steady since the defunding, and even increased to 121 in 2013.

CDC very recently released a 16-page report that was commissioned by the city council of Wilmington, Delaware, on factors contributing to its abnormally high gun crime, and methods of prevention. The study weighed factors such as where the guns were coming from, the sex of the offenders, likeliness of committing a gun crime, and how unemployment plays a factor. In other words it studied, the environment surrounding the crime.

This did not go over well with some in the media, who were disappointed it didn’t implicate firearms as a cause and not an effect. Kate Masters of VICE.com wrote, “If the CDC wasn’t going to consider the role of firearms in Wilmington’s gun crimes, why do the study at all?” That sounds an awful lot like, “If you have nothing bad to say about guns, then don’t say anything.”

Regardless, the narrative here is that gun lobbyists are injecting politics into a serious health issue for the American public. The truth is something a bit less clandestine, at least coming from NRA and Congress.

CDC Leaders Admit They Want to Ban Guns

In the late ’80s and early ’90s, the CDC was openly biased in opposing gun rights. CDC official and research head Patrick O’Carroll stated in a 1989 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, “We’re going to systematically build a case that owning firearms causes deaths.” This sounds more like activist rhetoric than it does scientific research, as O’Carroll effectively set out with the goal of confirmation bias, saying “We will prove it,” and not the scientific objectiveness of asking “Does it?”

‘It used to be that smoking was a glamour symbol — cool, sexy, macho. Now it is dirty, deadly — and banned.’

O’Carroll went on to deny he had said this, claiming he was misquoted. However, his successor and director of the CDC National Center of Injury Prevention branch Mark Rosenberg told Rolling Stone in 1993 that he “envisions a long term campaign, similar to tobacco use and auto safety, to convince Americans that guns are, first and foremost, a public health menace.” He went on to tell the Washington Post in 1994 “We need to revolutionize the way we look at guns, like what we did with cigarettes. It used to be that smoking was a glamour symbol — cool, sexy, macho. Now it is dirty, deadly — and banned.”

CDC leaders were not shy about their intentions of banning guns from the public. Sure enough, they acted on their desires. In October 1993, The New England Journal of Medicine released a study funded by the CDC to the tune of $1.7 million, entitled “Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor for Homicide in the Home.” The leader author was Dr. Arthur Kellermann, an epidemiologist, physician, and outspoken advocate of gun control.

In the study, Kellerman concluded that people who kept guns in their homes were 2.7 times more likely to be homicide victims as people who don’t. Major media outlets, such as the New York Times, still cite these statistics.

Unreliable Gun Research

However, the research was beyond flawed. For one, Kellermann used epidemiological methods in an attempt to investigate an issue dealing with criminology. In effect, this means he was treating gun violence the same as, say, the spread of West Nile, or bird flu.

It provided no proof or examples that the murder weapon used in these crimes belonged to the homeowner or had been kept in that home.

Furthermore, the gun victims he studied were anomalies. They were selected from homicide victims living in metropolitan areas with high gun-crime statistics, which completely discounted the statistical goliath of areas where gun owners engage in little to no crime.

Other factors that lent to the study’s unreliability were: It is based entirely on people murdered in their homes, with 50 percent admitting this was the result of a “quarrel or romantic triangle,” and 30 percent said it was during a drug deal or other felonies such as rape or burglary; it made no consideration for guns used in self-defense; it provided no proof or examples that the murder weapon used in these crimes belonged to the homeowner or had been kept in that home.

These problems prompted objections and questions from leading scientists in the field of criminology, such as Yale University professor John Lott, Florida State’s Gary Kleck, and University of Massachusetts sociology professors James D. Wright and Peter H. Rossi. Their research had come to vastly different conclusions, and they found the methodology unsound.

As Lott says of Kellermann’s study in his book, “More Guns, Less Crime”:

To demonstrate this, suppose that we use the same statistical method—with a matching control group—to do a study on the efficacy of hospital care. Assume that we collect data just as these authors did, compiling a list of all the people who died in a particular county over the period of a year. Then we ask their relatives whether they had been admitted to the hospital during the previous year. We also put together a control sample consisting of neighbors who are part of the same sex, race, and age group. Then we ask these men and women whether they have been in a hospital during the past year. My bet is that those who spent time in hospitals are much more likely to have died — quite probably a stronger relationship than that between homicides and gun ownership in Kellerman’s study. If so, would we take that as evidence that hospitals kill people?

He summarized, “it’s like comparing 100 people who went to a hospital in a given year with 100 similar people who did not, finding that more of the hospital patients died, and then announcing that hospitals increase the risk of death.”

The final nail in the coffin came in 1995 when the Injury Prevention Network Newsletter told its readers to “organize a picket at gun manufacturing sites” and to “work for campaign finance reform to weaken the gun lobby’s political clout.” Appearing on the same page as the article pointing the finger at gun owners for the Oklahoma City bombing were the words, “This newsletter was supported in part by Grant #R49/CCR903697-06 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”

Tax Dollars Shouldn’t Aim to Influence Politics

After these blatant attempts at gun control, the NRA blew the whistle on the CDC and prompted Congress to take action. They did, stripping CDC’s funding for research into firearm crime.

Political bias was already present, and the NRA and Congress acted to remove it.

Those who accuse the NRA, Republicans, and gun advocates of attempting to inject their political bias into federal research on gun crime are not telling the whole story. With the picture complete, we can see that political bias was already present, and the NRA and Congress had acted to remove it.

In effect, the CDC was using taxpayer money to inject a biased and false narrative into the American discussion on firearms. It wasn’t doing research, it was creating propaganda.

CDC was being used as a political tool to become the Center for Gun Control, and while there are firearm-related elements the CDC’s expertise would be well-suited for (take the Wilmington report, for instance), the subject of gun crime should not be turned into an epidemiological issue.

A gun will not give you cancer, nor cause you to contract AIDS. Guns do not carry viruses like mosquitos. Gun crime should be dealt with as the thing that it is: crime.

Tamir Rice’s Family Should Sue Cleveland,"Based on the facts about the Tamir Rice shooting in Cleveland, here is how the incident appears to this retired, 30-year police lieutenant from near San Antonio who has trained more than a thousand police officers: An individual is waving a gun at people in the park. The police drive up to within feet of the individual and park their car.

The man with the gun reaches into his waistband for the gun, despite police orders not to do so. The whole incident is over in moments, and we all know the outcome now that a Cleveland grand jury has decided not to indict the officer who shot Rice.

I have concluded that the officers’ fear was justified and their response was reasonable, at that moment. Yet I have a problem with the officers’ approach to the event. Before officers can hope to control a situation, they must first control themselves. That didn’t happen here.

Any minor change in the overall dynamic might have led to a different outcome. Time and distance should have given the officers an advantage, but because they drove to within feet of Rice they lost that advantage. Events leading to the shooting, meaning the way the officers approached the situation, virtually guaranteed a fatal result if anything went wrong—as it did.

Sue Cleveland and Its Negligent Officers

I now urge the family to sue the hell out of the City of Cleveland and the individual officers for causing Rice’s death. Yeah, I know I sound like a liberal, holding two mutually exclusive views simultaneously.

From where I stand they would need an extension ladder to climb out of the hole they dug just to reach gross negligence.

However, there are two standards to be considered in this case. One: did the officers violate Rice’s civil rights under U.S. Code Title 42 1983? They did not. The second is: did the officers violate an ordinary standard of care, and exhibit gross negligence in the performance of their duties, in the way they responded to the call? From where I stand they would need an extension ladder to climb out of the hole they dug just to reach gross negligence.

I am not an attorney, so I have no idea where Ohio law is on tort actions. In a similar Texas case, the district judge found for the plaintiff because the officer put himself in a situation where shooting was his only option.

What I am advocating is akin to a medical malpractice-style suit after a patient went in for a vasectomy and came out with a sex change. The two might have started in the same ball park, but the results are in no way comparable.

These had to be the two stupidest cops ever to shit between police shoes to respond to this call in the manner that they chose. The only way the passenger officer could have redeemed himself is if he immediately turned and shot the driver officer for putting him in that position. These idiots need to be fired, because they are too stupid to be allowed access to anything more lethal than a rubber ball.

Here’s What Those Officers Should Have Done

I have put the cart before the horse and offered my conclusions without demonstrating my work. Okay, let me back up.

What does a ‘reasonable police officer’ versus these brain-dead clowns know?

The officers were dispatched to a man with a gun call at a city park. The caller indicated the belief that the gun may not have been real, but that was not relayed to the officers. Doesn’t matter. What does a “reasonable police officer” versus these brain-dead clowns know? (1) Approaching a guy with a gun in and of itself is not your happy place. (2) Given distance, a handgun has limited potential for accuracy. (3) The more separation between officers, the greater the chance that a rational gunman will decline the confrontation. (4) Time equals the ability to gain information. (5) Information is power. (6) Information flows both ways.

Accepting the preceding statements as reasonable, what does a reasonable police officer do? (1) Create distance between the suspected gunman and the officers. (2) Distance creates time to assess: Is this a man with a gun, or a child? (3) Distance allows officers to gain cover and concealment, which lessens the threat level and creates time. (4) Commands by police clarify to everybody involved the intent of the actors. (5) First impressions are either confirmed or denied. (6) If denied, a new round of assessment can begin.

Let’s Consider a Similar Occurrence

I found myself in a similar situation once on a Saturday night. I was flagged down and informed that a man was staggering down the street wielding a shotgun at 1:30 in the morning. The block was a location where we had arrested a man on two consecutive Saturdays as a drunk causing a disturbance.

The suspect stepped out of the shadows, ten feet from the patrol car. He did indeed have a shotgun.

The radio was so busy that I was unable to inform dispatch of the situation. I pulled into the block, still unable to inform dispatch. This is not the way to answer a “man with a gun” call, but it was the 1970s and my balls were made of brass and clanked when I walked. I popped my 870 shotgun out of the rack and started making my way to the house. As I did so, dispatch put out the man with a gun call.

When I tried to “buy the call,” my sergeant, who was riding in a two-man car, broadcast over my transmission and pulled up in front of the house. As he did so, the suspect stepped out of the shadows, ten feet from the patrol car. He did indeed have a shotgun. Fortunately, it was pointed skyward.

I racked my 870. For those who are uninitiated, there is no louder, more distinctive sound that can occur in the nighttime than the working of a Remington 870 pump-action shotgun. Once heard, that distinctive noise can never be anything but an 870. I yelled at him to “Drop the gun,” then to “Drop the fucking gun,” and he did not comply. Had I been concerned for my safety, I would have fired at that point, but since it was my sergeant I gave him a little extra time. My sergeant yelled at him to put the gun down and he did so.

There is no louder, more distinctive sound that can occur in the nighttime than the working of a Remington 870 pump-action shotgun.

This guy meant no harm to anybody. He had purchased a piece-of-shit J.C. Higgens single-shot shotgun in a bar for $35 and wanted to show it off to his cousins inside the house. He didn’t drop it because he didn’t want to mess up his new gun. The sergeant later said the only thing that kept him from coming out of the car shooting was the knowledge that I was there and had the guy covered.

In this instance, everybody screwed up to a certain degree. Nobody knew that I had responded to the call. Therefore, there was no opportunity to coordinate our response. The sergeant and his driver thought they were a block away when they parked in front of the house. On the plus side, I wasn’t threatened by the drunk with the shotgun. Had he lowered the gun in a threatening manner, I had more than enough time to shoot, and at that distance I wasn’t likely to miss. The drunk got his time. Time and permission to put the gun down was all he needed.

Well-Trained Officers Reduce the Need to Shoot

I have taught “officer survival” to thousands of police officers. One of the questions I put to officers who have shot at suspects is: “Take an inventory between those times when you have fired at suspects and those times when you could have fired at suspects and didn’t. What was different?”

You could almost see the light bulb pop on. Most officers who had been involved in shootings could recount a dozen instances where a shooting would have been justified, but they did not shoot. The answer was almost always the same: “I ran out of options,” “I had no choice,” “There was nothing else I could do.”

Applying proper tactics, personal discipline, and a basic knowledge of policing do not lead to a Tamir Rice confrontation. I would challenge any police officer with a lick of pride or integrity to contact the Cleveland Police Department and tell them that, in this instance, their officers have violated a standard of care and trust that is unacceptable to the profession. Make no mistake: This isn’t about toy guns, it is not about white cops shooting black suspects, and it isn’t even about justification.

Paul Battaglia is a retired police officer who lives near in San Antonio, Texas. As a police officer, he spent 15 years assigned to narcotics, with an additional three years as a police academy coordinator. He developed and delivered training in officer survival, tactical operations for narcotics enforcement, SWAT, and a variety of search and seizure and investigative topics. After that, he spent 12 years in patrol.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/12/30/tamir-rices-family-should-sue-the-police-officers-who-shot-him/,2015-12-30
Obama’s Legacy Will Be Executive Overreach,"Over the winter break I finally got around to binge-watching “Parks and Recreation.” In case you missed the show’s seven-year run, it’s about a fascistic, small-town councilwoman who believes it’s a politician’s job to impose her notions of morality, safety, and decency on everyone, no matter what voters want or what the system dictates. She is justifiably recalled by the people of her town after attempting to regulate portion sizes at fast food restaurants, but ends up running a federal office where she can do big things without the consent of the people.

Now, I realize that most of the show’s fans see the narrative in a vastly different light and the protagonist, Leslie Knope, as the sort of idealist, compassionate, and principled politician Americans should love. “Parks and Rec” can be fantastically funny (and it has a big heart), but as I watched I was often reminded that many people glorify ideas like “public service” — a preposterous term that treats politics as if it were a sacrifice without pay, power, or prestige — and “doing something” as a moral imperative no matter how politicians get it done.

When I got back from my winter vacation, America was still being run by a two-term president who believes it’s his job to impose his notions of morality, safety, and decency on everyone, often trying to work around the limits the system places on him. This week Barack Obama is going to institute new restrictions on Americans unilaterally — expanding background checks, closing supposed “loopholes,” and tightening the process for law-abiding gun owners — because Congress “won’t act” and also because he believes it’s the right thing to do. Neither of them are compelling reasons to legislate from the White House.

No post-World War II president has justified his executive overreach by openly contending he was working around the law-making branch of government.

Perhaps no post-World War II president (and maybe none before) has justified his executive overreach by openly contending he was working around the law-making branch of government because it has refused to do what he desired. Whether a court finds his actions constitutional or not, it’s an argument that stands, at the very least, against the spirit American governance. Today, many liberals call this “leadership.”

The most likely result of his new gun push will be that hundreds of thousands of Americans who understandably fear the mission creep of government will end up buying a whole bunch of guns (Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co. stocks rose against the dipping market on Monday). The flow of donations to Second Amendment advocacy groups will almost certainly rise, and gun violence — which has fallen considerably over the past 20 years of gun ownership expansion — will not be addressed.

But more consequentially — and this may be the most destructive legacy of the Obama presidency — is the mainstreaming of the idea that if Congress “fails to act” it’s okay for the president to figure out a way to make law himself. Hillary’s already applauded Obama’s actions because, as she put it, “Congress won’t act; we have to do something.” This idea is repeated perpetually by the Left, in effect arguing that we live in direct democracy run by the president (until a Republican is in office, of course). On immigration, on global warming, on Iran, on whatever crusade liberals are on, the president has a moral obligation to act if Congress doesn’t do what he wants.

Perhaps Obama’s most destructive legacy is the mainstreaming of the idea that if Congress ‘fails to act’ it’s okay for the president to make law himself.

To believe this, you’d have to accept two things: 1) That Congress has a responsibility to pass laws on the issues that the president desires or else they would be abdicating their responsibility, and 2) That Congress has not already acted.

In 2013, the Senate rejected legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and to ban certain weapons and ammunition, and they would almost certainly oppose nearly every idea Obama has to curb gun ownership today. Congress has acted, just not in the manner Obama desires.

“Change, as always, is going to take all of us,” Obama theorized the other day. “The gun lobby is loud and well organized in its defense of effortlessly available guns for anyone. The rest of us are going to have to be just as passionate and well organized in our defense of our kids. That’s the work of citizenship — to stand up and fight for the change that we seek.”

Get it? You can be with the loud and reprehensible gun lobby who supports allowing criminals to obtain guns “effortlessly,” or you can stand with the kids. Your choice!

Well, not exactly your choice. As a reactionary, I wonder is it really the duty of “citizenship” to cheer on a president who single-handedly constrains Americans from practicing one of their constitutional rights? If President Bush had instituted a series of restrictions on the abortion industry — since it has a loud, well-organized, and well-funded lobby that wants to make abortions “effortlessly” available — without congressional input, would that have been procedurally okay with liberals? You know, for the children? I don’t imagine so.

Is it really is the work of ‘citizenship’ to cheer on a president who single-handedly constrains Americans from practicing one of their constitutional rights?

Or is it okay this time because the president claims (and many in the media ape) that his initiatives will “combat gun violence in the U.S.?” Is the threat of violence enough to empower the executive branch to place strictures on rights clearly laid out in the Constitution without any debate? Does the same go for fighting terrorism when a Republican becomes president?

The truth is, Obama has attempted to govern without Congress ever since Democrats rammed the Affordable Care Act through. It was the first time any consequential reform was instituted by a single political party, poisoning any chance of building consensus on major legislation in the foreseeable future. Since then, Republicans have frustrated Democrats, and on nearly every issue that matters to Obama. Obama has gone as far as he can, and sometimes farther, to administer law through our loudest, largest, most powerful, and well-funded bureaucracies.

A lot of people justify this behavior for the most obvious reason: they don’t care about process; they only care about issues. It’s true that the upside of executive orders and actions is that they can be easily undone when a new president is elected. But with the intractability of both parties only becoming more pronounced, the temptation to use the Obama model of legislating through the executive branch will become increasingly attractive to politicians and their supporters.

Obama's Claims About Internet Gun Sales Are False,"Yesterday President Obama dramatically announced a handful of executive branch actions related to the sale of guns. The media event was comprehensively staged and included a social media push. Using the hash tag #StopGunViolence, the White House tweeted several dozen quotes and claims about guns. One in particular stood out:

“A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the internet with no background check, no questions asked.” —@POTUS #StopGunViolence



The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 5, 2016

This is so plainly not true that I tweeted:

Can’t wait for “fact” “checkers” to go to town on this one! https://t.co/CErTynLsb4



Mollie (@MZHemingway) January 5, 2016

In fact, it is illegal for violent felons to purchase guns. And no one can just order guns off the Internet without going through a background check. Far from it. Internet gun purchases are relatively rare, but when they happen, the purchased items aren’t sent directly to the buyer but first must be sent to a dealer holding a federal firearms license. Such gun transactions processed by a federal firearms license holder must include a background check, regardless of whether the sale is across state lines or not. Gun transactions across state lines must be processed in the home state of the recipient. So if you purchase a gun off the Internet from a different state, it will be sent to a federal firearms license holder in your state, and you would not be allowed to take possession of it until a background check is done on you.

The only exemption to the federal requirement for background checks applies to non-federal purchases: transactions between two private individuals who reside in the same state. It is against the law for anyone, regardless of whether they hold a federal firearms license, to sell or give a firearm to anyone who is reasonably believed to be a “prohibited person” (a full statutory list of prohibited persons can be found in 18 USC 922(d)). If an individual ran a gun commerce site, they would not be considered private but, rather, in the business of selling guns. As such, they’d need to have a federal firearms license. And even if there were an online shopping site that processed sales between private individuals, they would still need to be shipped. In order to ship guns to private individuals, you need to be licensed to do that. And this process is highly restricted as well.

No one can can just order guns off the Internet without going through a background check.

For starters, the U.S. Postal Service will not mail handguns. Only contract or common carriers (UPS or FedEx) are by law authorized to ship handguns. UPS will not ship a gun from a non-licensed individual to another non-licensed individual. They require shipments of guns to either originate or terminate with a holder of a federal firearms license. You must disclose to UPS that you are shipping a gun. FedEx will also not ship a gun from a non-licensed individual to another non-licensed individual. Just as with UPS, the firearm shipment, at a bare minimum, must either originate or terminate with an FFL. You must disclose to FedEx that you are shipping a firearm.

So no, it’s illegal for violent felons to purchase guns, and online sales and shipping require the involvement of a federal firearm license holder and the use of background checks.

Along the lines of my sardonic tweet about fact checking, another Twitter user was prescient:

Prediction: Fact check article will find some hilarious semantic explanation for why this isn’t completely false. https://t.co/QpiIYBAUIv



neontaster (@neontaster) January 5, 2016

Sure enough, PolitiFact did just that. What’s more, they said it was true!

Even by the standards of PolitiFact, which is just hilariously awful at pretending to be authoritative, this fact checker, who graduated from college in 2014, stands out. Lauren Carroll once rated Martin O’Malley’s claim that 97% of Planned Parenthood’s services are preventive care and mammograms as “half true.” (Planned Parenthood doesn’t do a single mammogram and never has.) When Obama said that ISIS wasn’t gaining strength on the eve of the Paris attacks, she gave that one an unqualified “true.” It’s actually funny, in a way.

This particular fact check is of about the same quality as the rest of them. To begin with, it admits that felons buying guns is illegal but then brushes it away as no biggie. She writes,

(The grammarians at PolitiFact would note that Obama said ‘can,’ not ‘may.’)

I mean, anyone “can” do anything illegal at any point in time, so I’m pretty sure that was the important point President Obama was trying to put in people’s minds — not that violent felons can fill up their Amazon carts with AR-15s and have them shipped straight to the scene of the crime. Also true: A violent felon can go rob a bank at any point in time he desires. (By the way, I hope you also get a kick out of watching how fact checkers go from hyper-literal to relaxed and figurative depending on the political views statement being checked. )

The fact check, under the heading “a big loophole” then goes on to describe how private gun sellers (e.g., a widow selling her husband’s firearm after his death) can place classified ads on the Internet for all to see and how that means Obama’s statement is true.

Except Obama didn’t say that the Internet exists, and people communicate on it via email and the like. Of course people use this new-fangled Internet and its series of tubes to collect all sorts of information about guns. Just a few weeks ago, I myself used the interweb to research where I could take gun safety courses and find gun sellers. But had I “bought the gun over the Internet,” in the words of President Obama, it would have had to involve a federal firearms license holder. (Much more on this point from Mike Morrison here.)

PolitiFact happened to use the same item in its fact check that the White House pushed out — a New York Times report about online classified ads placed at Armslist.com. Except that Armslist.com specifically says it does not process sales, which would be a key step in “buying over the Internet.” PolitiFact provides no evidence of any place on the Internet that will process gun sales without a background check, to violent felons or anyone else.

Private sellers are forbidden by federal law from running NICS background checks, whether or not they want to.

PolitiFact’s discussion of non-online (read: in-person) sales neglects to even consider shipping restrictions. It fails to show any evidence of online purchases of guns between private sellers, such as the names of sites that process such sales or the names of shipping companies that deliver such transactions. It also fails to note that private sellers are forbidden by federal law from running NICS background checks, whether or not they want to.

President Obama’s executive actions mostly reiterate what the law already says. And his own press secretary said that the executive actions (“legally meaningless” in the words of one legal analyst, helpful to “low-volume firearms dealers” from another analyst) were about political positioning. Fine, if that’s what he wants to do.

But this should have been an easy statement to check. The president said violent felons can buy guns online without a background check. That is unequivocally false. Online sales are processed through federal firearms license holders, which require background checks. And if a transaction doesn’t happen online, it’s not an online transaction. Even for PolitiFact, rating this statement “mostly true” is embarrassing.

Is it too much to ask journalists, much less young fact checkers, to have the slightest idea about how gun sales work in the real world? They could still push their politics, but they wouldn’t seem quite so ignorant while doing it.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/01/06/obamas-claims-about-internet-gun-sales-are-completely-false/,2016-01-06
How The Right Can Get Liberal Support For Gun Rights,"As the new year begins, the Obama administration is taking a new run at imposing unilateral gun control measures. It is likely that the president will take some action related to his proposal, issued in November, that anyone on the terror watch list be barred from purchasing a gun. In doing so, he may inadvertently reveal a sharp divide in his own coalition, and may even create an opportunity for conservatives.

The president’s plan has many flaws and, as Gabriel Malor pointed out when the idea first emerged, Democrats have not even been completely honest about what they are proposing. But the biggest problem is that the president proposes to deprive people of constitutional rights by the simple expedient of placing their names on a list. No hearing, no trial, and no explanation necessary: just the simple typing of a person’s name renders him a second-class citizen.

This proposal has laid bare the divide between liberals and leftists. There is considerable overlap between the two groups, which is why they both have found a home in the Democratic Party. Both generally want to solve society’s ills by using the power of government to grind out the baser parts of our human nature, defining those base parts according to the progressive conventional wisdom of the moment. Both also profess an attachment to civil rights, although, as with their idea of human nature, their ideas on natural rights are prone to fluctuation.

The Daylight Between Liberals and Leftists

The difference between liberals and leftists is a matter of emphasis. One way to look at it is to say that liberals are concerned about means, while leftists are concerned about ends. Liberals are typically interested in process and structures. They care, to some extent, about checks and balances and fundamental ideas of fairness. Although they typically trust government as a whole and believe it is a force for good, they may distrust various parts of government, and will work to ensure there is oversight to provide that everyone is being treated fairly. They even, although less so than was once the case, have some good feelings for natural rights, especially those found in the Bill of Rights (with the exception of the Second Amendment, in recent years).

The problem for liberals is that it obviously violates the due process guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.

Leftists, on the other hand, care only about results. These are the central planners. They may give lip service to civil rights, but only when it helps their own efforts of the moment, or when it is necessary to placate liberals in their own coalition. What they really want is equality, as determined and administered by the state, which they would control. They speak in the language of rights, but shift the meaning to serve their own purposes. A typical formulation is “What good is the right to [X] if we don’t provide [someone else’s] money to buy [a product somewhat related to X].” They would like the right to be enforced, but what they really want is the money.

There is usually no daylight between liberals and leftists. They both talk of the same rights, trends, and groups, and vote the same way in Congress. The rare issue to divide them is one, like Obama’s proposal, that aims to accomplish a leftist end by illiberal means. The plan is perfectly satisfying to the leftists, taking away a right they find strange and abhorrent. The problem for liberals is not that it violates the Second Amendment (they have long given up on that section of the Bill of Rights,) nor that it goes after guns at all (they find civilian gun culture as alien as leftists do), but that it seeks to do these things by means that obviously violate the due process guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.

If You’re Depriving Rights, Do It Properly

To their credit, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), that flagship of liberal activism, has expressed misgivings about using the terror watch list to restrict the right to purchase a gun, saying in a press release that “the standards for inclusion on the No Fly List are unconstitutionally vague, and innocent people are blacklisted without a fair process to correct government error.” They are happy to restrict gun rights, and they still maintain the administration’s fiction that the no-fly list, rather than the much larger watch list, is the basis for the power grab. But the ACLU and its liberal members cannot stomach the idea of depriving someone of his rights by the flawed and arbitrary process by which the watch list is created.

The ACLU and its liberal members cannot stomach the idea of depriving someone of his rights by the flawed and arbitrary process by which the watch list is created.

This presents a problem for the president and an opportunity for Republicans. Obama has accidentally triangulated himself, but most Democrats in Congress and their allies in the media have joined him in choosing the leftist faction in their party’s divide. Unfortunately, the remaining liberals are few, and mostly without power. Only one Democratic senator, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, joined Republicans in voting down the proposal in the Senate.

All of the opposition has been on the Right, especially among the Republican Party’s libertarian wing. But, as small as the liberals’ numbers apparently are in the corridors of Congress, they are larger out there in the country. By embracing the rights at issue here—the Fifth Amendment, as well as the Second—Republicans have a chance to peel away liberal voters, if only a few, and show the country that their professed admiration for the Constitution and the rule of law is not merely fodder for fundraising letters. The leftists have dropped the mask and shown the world their illiberal face. We on the Right should make the most of it.

"No, Goldie Taylor, Gun Control Won’t Reduce Suicide","Several years ago, I walked into my garage, closed the door, climbed into my car, and turned on the engine. I sat in the front seat listening to Pink Floyd as gas filled up the car. I wanted to die.

I wrote about this shortly after Robin Williams committed suicide in 2014. I was overcome with despair, the difficulties and failures of life, broken promises, broken lives—much of it caused by me. I didn’t think I was good for anyone. I had convinced myself that it would be better for everyone—my husband, my children, my parents—if I just ceased to exist.

Tears burned my eyes, but they refused to fall. Pain spread out from my chest in waves, sending tingles through my fingers. I rubbed them, but the pinpricks remained. I longed to feel numb, but all I felt was an ache that scraped from within. Despair had grabbed hold of me and wouldn’t let go. It was as if I was locked in that strained moment between sudden grief and the cleansing release of tears. I bent over the steering wheel and wailed. I wished I could vomit up every dark feeling, the hopelessness, the loneliness, the fear. But they wouldn’t come. The pain remained, crushing me, driving me to the only place I thought to find release. Only the grave would give me peace. Only death would set me free. Then I would be numb. Then I would feel nothing.

That was my state of mind—despair. I just wanted to close my eyes, breathe in the fumes, and disappear.

I know what it’s like to become overwhelmed with depression and feel like even death would be better than the daily drudgery of living. That’s why when I read Goldie Taylor’s post at The Daily Beast about suicide, “The Guns We Don’t Talk About,” I could relate so well to her story. I could sympathize with her pain.

With great sensitivity, she writes about how she couldn’t face the hardships of her life any longer. Death was her only choice, or so it seemed in the moment.

I sat in the dimly lit room—for minutes or hours, I do not know—surrounded by the remains of my life, haunted by a broken marriage that was nearly 10 years gone, a failed business, a pile of overdue utility bills, and a string of eviction notices. We were living, if you could call it that, on $150 a week in child support and a few hundred dollars each month in food stamps. What was left of our furniture was in storage, paid for by our church benevolent fund. There had been two flat tires, but no job interviews that week. The weekly motel rent was due again and there wasn’t a dime left on my credit card to cover it.



I placed my gun on the bed and kneeled down on the carpet to pray. I listed my complaints and my failings. ‘Father, help me.’

I know that dark place so well, even the cry to God for help, the pressing weight of life’s failures, and the need to be set free.

Yes, Suicide and Depression Are Big Problems

Taylor and I aren’t alone. Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and suicide is the third leading cause of death in the world for those aged 15-44 years old. According to the Centers for Disease Control, suicide rates in the United States have been increasing in the last decade. Every day, nearly 105 Americans die by suicide.

Even though we’ve heard a lot about gun violence lately, guns are not the leading cause of death in America, not even close. The top causes of death are heart disease, cancer, and other health problems. Suicide ranks tenth, and homicide is far below, at 17. The most commonly used suicide method among males (51 percent) is a gun, and more men commit suicide than women. For women, the most common method is poisoning.

In light of the high suicide rates, Taylor makes an impassioned plea for readers to support President Obama’s gun control measures, because more needs to be done about stopping suicide in America.

We should not forget that when an individual owns a gun they are more likely to kill themselves and/or someone they love. Survival rates among those who attempt suicide by other means, such as a pill overdose or hanging, are higher than for those who use a gun. It is no accident that states where guns are most prevalent also report higher suicide rates. According to the Annals of Internal Medicine, people who live in homes with firearms are two to three times more likely to be murder victims or commit suicide….



If we are to truly host a national conversation about gun violence and commit ourselves to real solutions, we cannot forget the people who die alone in the dark.

While Taylor makes a compelling argument, it doesn’t hold up to the facts. Most of what she cites, including disputed studies about people being more likely to be victims of murder or commit suicide if they have a gun in their home, is correlation, not causation.

But Guns Don’t Cause Suicide

This is a point made in a National Academies’ Firearms and Violence report, which thoroughly examines studies such as those Taylor cites in light of direct causality. From all the evidence gathered, the committee came to the following conclusions:

States, regions, and countries with higher rates of household gun ownership have higher rates of gun suicide. There is also cross-sectional, ecological association between gun ownership and overall risk of suicide, but this association is more modest than the association between gun ownership and gun suicide; it is less consistently observed across time, place, and persons; and the causal relation remains unclear.



The risk of suicide is highest immediately after the purchase of a handgun, suggesting that some firearms are specifically purchased for the purpose of committing suicide.



Some gun control policies may reduce the number of gun suicides, but they have not yet been shown to reduce the overall risk of suicide in any population.

An important point the report makes—and one Taylor glosses over—is that even if you remove guns from a home, a person who wants to commit suicide will still find other means. As previously mentioned, women mostly kill themselves with poison. Removing guns will do nothing to help most women who struggle with depression that leads to suicide. And while it is true that guns are more lethal, and men use guns more than any other method, suicide statistics in countries that have tight gun control laws don’t support the argument that removing guns will reduce suicide rates on the whole.

Mark Antonio Wright makes this point in “Ezra Klein is Wrong: Gun Control Doesn’t Reduce Suicide Rates.” Like Taylor, Klein argues that reducing gun availability would decrease the suicide rate. But when you look at countries with the world’s strictest gun laws, this argument doesn’t hold up.

Even if you remove guns from a home, a person who wants to commit suicide will still find other means.

Wright first takes us to Australia, where there seems to be a relationship between its buy-back gun program and a drop in the suicide rate. But “the reduction occurred at the same time as an overall reduction in the Australian suicide rate. What’s more, firearm-related suicides had been declining in Australia for nearly ten years before the 1996 restrictions on gun ownership.”

Next, we go to Japan, which has the world’s most restrictive gun-control laws. While the country does have low homicide rates, it has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, nearly twice the U.S. rate! The same is true in South Korea, where handguns are practically nonexistent, but the country has the highest suicide rate in the developed world. The reason for the high rates of suicide are social and cultural factors, not the availability of guns.

“Guns are certainly not a factor in the suicide rate,” Wright says. “Along with hanging, drowning, and jumping off of buildings, ingesting pesticides was the method of choice for nearly 25 percent of South Korean suicides between 2006 and 2010. In 2012, more than 14,000 South Koreans took their own lives.”

The same is true for other nations, such as Hungary, Poland, France, Cuba, Belgium, and Austria. They all have higher suicide rates than the United States but have stricter gun control policies. Granted, there are countries with strict gun laws that have slightly lower suicide rates than America (e.g., New Zealand, Canada, Sweden, and Ireland), but given that this is not the case across the board, cultural variations, and not gun laws, must be taken into account.

Civil Society Helps Suicidal People Better than Laws

There is simply no solid evidence that more gun control will significantly reduce suicide. People will find a way to kill themselves if that’s what they want to do. Not only that, it’s not the government’s job to protect people from themselves. Being free means letting people make choices about their own lives—even if that means ending them.

Help has to come from individuals and communities, from the civil society, from local associations working together to show love and support to those who are hurting.

This is something the Left seems to understand regarding assisted suicide—something they wholeheartedly support. Their inconsistency is glaring. Not so for those of us who believe people have a right to do what they want with their own lives without government intrusion (the difference with assisted suicide is that another person—a physician—is involved).

Does this mean there’s nothing to be done to help people who are struggling with despair and thoughts of suicide? There certainly is, but that help can’t come from the federal government. It has to come from individuals and communities, from the civil society, from local associations working together to show love and support to those who are hurting.

It also means looking to the real causes of suicide—a gun is simply the tool (and one of many); it is not the cause. The underlying causes are manifold, including physiological issues, isolation, loneliness, broken relationships, employment pressures, and the constant expectation to have it all. The driving need to have the “perfect life” is often the root of despair in so many people. It generates a sense of worthlessness that drives us to take that gun out of the compartment or go into a garage and turn on the car.

Such fundamental psychological, social, and spiritual issues are the real problems plaguing our society. The starting point to dealing with these problems is not gun control—it’s not taking away or infringing on people’s constitutional rights. It’s seeing people as human beings who have deep needs that aren’t being met.

Laws Can’t Help Us Feel Loved

For both Taylor and me, our suicides never happened because of one thing—love. For her, it was a message from her daughter. For me, it was a poetic verse whispering in my mind of God’s abundant love. That’s what gave me hope.

The tears fell, and I turned off the engine to the car. The music stopped, and I sat in silence. In my mind, I heard a constant refrain: ‘The eyes of the Lord are on those whose hope is in his unfailing love.’ Love. And just any love—unfailing love. God’s love. He created us out of love, to love. That is our hope, that is the fuel of our faith, that is our purpose, that is what gives life meaning—to be in a loving relationship with our Creator, our Source of Life, and to share that love with others.

Guns aren’t the root problem. The root problem is that a person would see a gun or any other instrument as a means to a horrific end. Many people have allowed themselves to slip into mental patterns that tell them they aren’t valuable, aren’t loved.

This is why depressed and suicidal people need assistance that only other individuals can give, in a personal way. For some people, that’s therapy, or a condition brought about by chemical imbalances that medication can help address. Others can recover when those around them reach out, or when their internal suffering drives them to seek spiritual truths that bring healing.

Ultimately, government would have to ban everything to prevent suicide—cars, cliffs, water, you name it. Instead, we must realize that the means to kill ourselves are not really the problem—the grief that causes us to think suicide an appealing option is.

Mike Rowe Explains Why Gun Control Won't Stop Bad Guys,"Mike Rowe took to Facebook on Friday to vent his frustration at President Obama’s recent push for stricter gun control laws.

The “Dirty Jobs” show host began his humorous rant by sarcastically suggesting that the White House had recruited him—as well as other public figures—into spouting out gun control talking points via Twitter. Rowe clarified that he was “just kidding” and offered three guesses as to why the president didn’t ask for his help, the most obvious one being that he doesn’t support the president’s agenda.

He explained that Obama’s push for more background checks wouldn’t keep guns out of the hands of criminals because the preventative measures already in place aren’t being enforced.

“I’m just skeptical that expanding a broken system is the best way to keep guns away from bad guys and lunatics,” he said. “Seems to me, our current system is only as good as the records in it, and right now, those records are laughably incomplete.”

Rowe said that the first step should be to enforce the laws already on the books before pushing for additional ones.

“If we don’t have the resources or the commitment to administer and enforce the system we have, why in the world would we want to make it bigger?” he asked.

Hollywood’s Hypocritical Love-Hate Relationship With Guns,"This being Hollywood awards season, one thing we can count on is one thing we have become inured to: the celebrity activist display. From cause-ribbon-wearing to red-carpet pontificating, it is not enough for us to fawn over luminaries—we also have to get preached at by our beloved betters. Hosts delivering political barbs and presenters who use their camera time to tout pet causes pepper awards ceremonies. Producers always grant these grandstanders their allotment, then moments later chase the winners off-stage during a truncated acceptance speech.

The recent Golden Globes delivered an unintentionally hilarious counterpoint to the proselytizing. During a segment to announce the Best Picture nominee, Jennifer Lawrence walked out to present with her newest best friend, (alleged) joke larcenist Amy Schumer. Schumer has quickly risen to the entertainment A-list, and has parlayed that into joining the Societal Harridan List. Along with her relative in DC, Sen. Chuck Schumer, Amy has become a voice of opposition to guns in this country.

Cue the irony. After some scripted spontaneous banter, Lawrence and Schumer introduced J-Law’s nominated film, “Joy.” Next, a minute-long video montage played, culminating with the scene where Lawrence brandishes a firearm, delivers some dialogue, then fires the weapon—nearly into the camera lens. Amazing to note: This jarring imagery during a tranquil awards celebration was shown to the audience without a trigger warning!



To those who endured Amy’s recent anti-gun lectures, her introducing a clip of her new best buddy shooting off a firearm is prime for ridicule. But this hypocrisy probably never occurred to Schumer. Hollywood serves as a paradox of weapons morality. Its participants are free to condemn and lecture us on the depravity of individuals and organizations affiliated with guns, with a glaring exemption granted to themselves and their industry.

The Lesser of Two Demagogues

The Acela Set is no less occupied with rewarding themselves. One thing about the current Democratic Party election season: It clearly brings out the anti-constitutionalists. Sure, they couch their document-lacerating platforms with palatable euphemisms, such as “common-sense regulations” or “reasonable safety laws.” These fluffy terms do little to veil the reality that they intend to encroach directly upon the rights our supreme law has commanded shall not be infringed.

One thing about the current Democratic Party election season: It clearly brings out the anti-constitutionalists.

Hillary Clinton’s platform includes stricter gun regulations. She uses this stance as a cudgel against Bernie Sanders, who once backed a law protecting gun manufacturers from wrongful-death lawsuits. Not be outflanked on the left wing, Sanders now says that law needs to be repealed, paving the way for people to sue gun makers out of existence.

In their quest to make us a less-armed populace, these proponents share a common enemy: The National Rifle Association. It is a testament to the effectiveness and accuracy of that organization that not a single firearm outrage can be uttered without an automatic connection to the group. School shootings, highway snipers, and homegrown terrorist attacks consistently are laid at the feet of the NRA. (Some may say, “What about Chicago’s high gun-death rates?” but note I said firearm outrage. The gun-snatchers always bypass that city’s victims.)

Little evidence supports these accusations. The NRA supports background checks, educated handling, firearm safety, comprehensive training, and legal usage. Accusations against it tend to ring hollow since the organization does not promote activities that lead to “mass shootings.” Every gun tragedy involves breaking numerous laws and contradicting the NRA’s recommended use—such as funneling rifles to Mexican cartel members, for just one random example.

As gun opponents place the NRA in their cross-hairs (not apologizing for that macro-aggression) they expose the impotency of their outrage. Yet another industry guilty of the same charges manages to elude being called complicit.

All The Blame, None of the Proof

Indulge me in a small exercise. Take a look at the following phrases that you undoubtedly have either heard before, or a variation thereof:

The NRA romanticizes a pro-gun agenda

The NRA creates a culture of violence

The NRA profits from glorifying guns

These have become the tropes politicians and activist groups like Moms Demand, Everytown, et al. employ for demonization. These accusations are used interchangeably, based on the particular details of a gun event. Did someone use a stolen gun, taking the background checks argument off the table? Then blame the NRA for fostering a violent atmosphere. Homegrown terrorists shoot up San Bernardino? They wouldn’t be armed if NRA didn’t ensure it’s “easy” to buy guns.

Its entire product defines culture, and we all have instant recollection of a movie or TV show with heavy firearm visuals.

But here is a stark reality. The proof behind these accusations is always ethereal. Nothing tangible is ever offered to bolster the charges. The mere suggestion is enough, because the accusation has been bandied so frequently.

Now for the interactive portion of this article. Go back and look at those three comments, but apply a simple alteration. Replace “The NRA” with one word: Hollywood. Not only do all of the phrases become more accurate, but you are greeted with recall imagery.

Does Hollywood create a culture of violence? Its entire product defines culture, and we all have instant recollection of a movie or TV show with heavy firearm visuals. Hollywood romanticizes a pro-gun agenda? The studios sure have not curtailed titles with plotlines wrapped around heroic firearm use. Does Hollywood profit from glorifying guns? Not only is this an obvious “Yes,” there is no shortage of guns on the very posters used to sell their films.

Despite this, no one hurls vitriolic charges at Hollywood on par with the regular NRA taunts. The profit accusation is especially stark in the juxtaposition. The NRA is not in business; it derives funds from membership fees, paid willingly by people who want the organization to continue its practices.

Hollywood Makes Billions by Glorifying Guns

Hollywood studios are instead profit-driven, and they create a cultural product of gun-steeped content for the direct purpose of generating revenues. The industry touts guns, lovingly displays firearms, and glorifies the violence the weaponry can deliver. All of this for the singular purpose of turning a profit. Each of us can instantly conjure specific visuals supporting this reality.

The industry touts guns, lovingly displays firearms, and glorifies the violence the weaponry can deliver.

Despite the voluminous catalogue of blatant evidence that studios are culpable of the very charges foisted by the rifle-nabbers, they rarely endure the insults and blame. This goes beyond mere hypocrisy. It’s a blind spot, as if all gun-control groups and politicians have suffered the same stroke.

Activists wishing to blunt a gun culture would do better than to attack a constitutional protection lobby and instead try to curtail the industry that relies on guns for corporate earnings. It takes very little to prove this out. Let us look at just one prime example.

At the same time political candidates and anti-Second Amerndment groups were blaming the NRA for glorifying guns, Universal Studios was running commercials for “Ride Along 2” during the NFL playoffs. In those spots, Kevin Hart is shot on-screen, entirely for laughs.



Well, not “entirely”; it was a commercial, after all, to lure people into theaters. So generating revenue was also in play, even though we have been told profiting from gunplay is evil. Quixotically, nobody anticipates a vicious backlash of outrage hurled towards the studios for the venality of their greed, fueled by cultivating violence and promoting guns.

Loud Words, Contradictory Actions

“The NRA is a disaster area,” declared film mogul Harvey Weinstein to Howard Stern two years ago, “And they’re going to wish they weren’t alive after I’m done with them.” Harvey was referring to a supposedly anti-gun film he said was set to star in with Meryl Streep, tentatively titled “The Senator’s Wife.”

During this rant, Stern asked if Weinstein owned a gun. “I don’t think we need guns in this country. And I hate it,” he replied. This may seem to display a lack of hypocrisy, but only if you don’t apply the fact that Weinstein employs armed guards for personal security. During this same period, Harvey doubled down on his firearms opinions during a visit with fellow gun opponent Pierce Morgan.

I have to choose movies that aren’t violent or as violent as they used to be. I know for me personally, you know, I can’t continue to do that. The change starts here. It has already. For me, I can’t do it. I can’t make one movie and say this is what I want for my kids and then just go out and be a hypocrite.

Well, it turns out Weinstein can be a hypocrite, like most of Hollywood’s loudest Second Amendment opponents. There is no shortage of celebrities who have touted gun control after starring in movies brandishing guns, but a growing number are starring in such movies after their rants. Beyond a double standard, this displays abject self-awareness. Those who love to look at themselves in a mirror are horrible at introspection, and about gun control they exhibit zero self-control.

This year, Liam Neeson leapt at the chance to declare his position that the Second Amendment should be repealed. One niggling detail lost on the star: to express these views he was using the forum of the press junket for his career-rejuvenating gun-porn franchise entry “Taken 3.” In fact, he seems completely incapable of starring in a film lately without wielding a weapon—not only on-screen, but also on the poster.



Sean Penn made a bold announcement last January that, at the behest of his beau Charlize Theron, he would be melting down his gun collection to make a statue to auction for charity. He proudly described the act: “How liberating of bullshit and ugliness it would be not only to get rid of the guns I have…but also to destroy them.”

Neeson seems completely incapable of starring in a film lately without wielding a weapon.

This is just fine, an individual ridding himself of “cowardly killing machines,” as he described them. But it became more than confusing when he followed that by starring in a film cowardly entitled “The Gunman.” Doubly confusing: after this gesture, his disarming muse Theron appeared with cowardly killing-weapons in the movies “A Million Ways To Die In The West” and “Mad Max: Fury Road.”

As for Weinstein’s sweeping takedown of the NRA and his pledge to stop his studio from releasing further violent, gun-toting titles—yeah, both became completely impotent announcements. “The Senator’s Wife” has not progressed beyond his bombastic talk show pitches. Meanwhile, his promise of a pacifist release schedule has also become simple balloon juice. This past Christmas, Weinstein Co. gave us Quentin Tarantino’s violent fantasy “The Hateful 8,” followed by the January 29 release “Jane Got A Gun.”

Hypocrites, Schmypocrites

All of this could be dismissed simply as hypocrisy. However, in yet one more area Hollywood is guilty of the charges they assign. Weinstein was a massive campaign bundler for President Obama’s reelection bid, and numerous celebrities have backed Hillary’s bid this year, as well as more slowly coming out in favor of Sanders.

They tell pols it is evil that a lobby tells pols what to do.

Stars and studios frequently bend the ear of DC politicians, and one of the issues they wail about is the lobbying power of The NRA. While telling pols it is evil that a lobby tells pols what to do, these entertainers are too oblivious to the irony to even entertain the contradiction.

While the NRA is routinely excoriated as being a hardcore gun lobby in Washington, how is the Hollywood set excused for worse? Considering celebrities have an absolute love affair with Obama/Hillary/Sanders, how do they reconcile their staunch anti-gun stance while becoming recidivists who can’t stop themselves from profiting off gun violence? Easy answer: they don’t.

The NRA is evil. Just take the word of the gun-loving Hollywood industry.

Watch Hillary Clinton Endorse A Massive 25% Tax On Guns,"In a U.S. Senate Finance Committee meeting in 1993, Hillary Clinton was asked if she would endorse a nationwide 25 percent sales tax on guns.

“I am all for that,” Clinton said in response to a question from then-Senator Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), “I just don’t know what else we’re going to do to try and figure out how to get some handle on this violence.”

The plan would have also slapped a $2,500 license fee on all gun dealers, whom Bradley called “purveyors of violence.”

As NewsBusters explained, a 25 percent tax on guns would be a massive burden for consumers.

The 25-percent tax on gun sales would be no trivial matter, it would have real effects on people and the economy. In 2013, more than 21 million guns were sold in the United States. A 25-percent tax would turn a $400 gun into a $500 gun and a $1,000 gun into a $1,250 gun for a consumer.

Clinton hasn’t changed her gun-hating tune very much in 23 years, either. During last night’s Democratic debate hosted by CNN, Clinton said she would want to punish gun sellers if the guns they sold were used in a crime.

“Most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state,” she said. “They come from the states that don’t have the kind of serious efforts to control guns we do in New York.”

Amy Schumer Commits A Violent Crime Against Comedy,"Amy Schumer received a ton of favorable media attention for the most recent episode of her Comedy Central show “Inside Amy Schumer.” That’s because she devoted most of it to gun control. Unfortunately, she devoted nearly none of it to comedy.

Seriously, it was awful.

Factless Gun Control Sketch

The show began with a send-up of a QVC-type program. Schumer and a sidekick finish selling Steve Irwin commemorative coins and then offer a gun for $39.95 They fail to practice any gun safety while showing the gun and say things like, “pretty much anyone can purchase this.” They tell a caller — claiming to have committed several violent felonies — that he can purchase a gun (it’s illegal to sell to someone you even suspect of being a felon). Schumer says she’s an unlicensed seller who can sell guns no-questions-asked because she’s running a “gun show” (except that her character is selling thousands of guns, meaning she’s the very definition of a “high-volume seller” covered by federal regulations) and could also do it if she were on the internet. Nope, nope, and nope.

There are some faux-sexist, faux-anti-gay, and anti-blind lines that smell like jokes. Then a man with a Middle Eastern accent calls in and says he’s a suspected terrorist on the No-Fly List, and could he buy a gun. And since that list — which had 900,000 names on it in 2013, including Weekly Standard writer Stephen Hayes and various other law-abiding citizens — has precisely zero criteria as to who gets placed on it, it’s a civil liberties trainwreck that should not be used to deny the constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms.

And then the sketch somehow gets worse. One of the hosts shoots himself in the foot while Schumer lists politicians who support the Second Amendment to the Constitution.

Are you laughing?

No, because it’s not funny. It’s also complete horse crap, but that’s not the problem. The problem is it isn’t funny.

There are many ways to speak on the very complicated issue of violence other than Schumer’s lazy approach.

Schumer then explains that she has turned this episode into advocacy for gun control because of the horrible event that happened last summer when a man killed two women at a screening of her movie “Trainwreck.” She admits that nobody likes when celebrities get involved in politics but says the parents of the girls asked her to speak on the issue.

Fine! Good! Absolutely! And there are probably many ways to speak on the very complicated issue of violence other than the lazy approach she took.

Lazy Anti-Twitter Sketch

The next sketch featured someone pretending to be a VP of Communications for Twitter introducing a new button for Twitter users. Right now Twitter users can click a button to indicate they like a tweet. The new button would allow them to say, “I’m going to rape and kill you.”

The reasoning, the VP explains, is that “over 120 percent of tweets directed at women refer to raping and/or killing them.”

As a Twitter user, I can attest to having received threats and being called names. All such threats and harassment are wrong, but it’s an enduring myth that women suffer more abuse on social media than men. In fact, the opposite is true. As this Pew study shows, men are more likely to be harassed online:

Overall, men are somewhat more likely than women to experience at least one of the elements of online harassment, 44% vs. 37%. In terms of specific experiences, men are more likely than women to encounter name-calling, embarrassment, and physical threats.

Sometimes, to take a random example I came across this past weekend, this abuse is done by well-respected writers from Harper’s, The New York Times Magazine, Foreign Policy, and various other publications.

So yes, we need to encourage civility toward women on Twitter. Also men. And we need to stop perpetuating the false stat that women are uniquely harmed by online abuse.

Or if we’re going to perpetuate that falsehood, could we at least be funny while doing it?

A Sketch About ‘Game of Thrones’ Forgets to Be Funny

Then there was an unending and shockingly unfunny sketch about how Schumer doesn’t want to get on a horse.

Followed by, granted, a funny sketch about Liam Neeson running a mortuary. It’s called Don Cheadle’s I Don’t Bury Cowards Funeral Home. And he buries only those people who die bravely. Nicely absurd.

Going Shallow on Everytown

Each show ends with a chat. Usually Schumer talks to someone about his or her sex life. This time she talked to someone from Everytown for Gun Safety. The puffball interview has the spokeswoman saying that the biggest misconception about the group is that they’re trying to take guns away. “Why would anyone think that?” Schumer asks. Yes, after The New York Times was a Pulitzer finalist for a front-page editorial advocating gun confiscation, why in the world would anyone think that the gun control movement wants to grab guns? Oh wait.

In any case, Schumer then asks if the gun control advocate is turned off by NRA members. She says something to the effect of “most NRA members are reasonable but the leadership is crazytown.” To which Schumer responds, “crazy bat**** nuts.”

Then the gun control advocate agrees and says they’re “totally crazy — there’s this great myth that they’re untouchable and unbeatable, but they’re way too extremist for the American public.”

I mean, really. Not only has the current executive of the NRA been in that position for something like 25 years, the idea that there is a notable mismatch between the five million members and the leadership — much less that the mismatch would go in the direction described by the gun control advocate — is hi-freaking-larious.

The show ends with a number to text to get involved in gun control.

I tweeted out my dislike of the episode, for which Amy Schumer blocked me on Twitter.

Which is fine. I doubt I can endure another episode of her show as is. I never need to agree with the politics of comedians (or else I would never watch them), but I do require them to be funny. Schumer’s crime isn’t that she put forth a hackneyed call for gun control, as unfortunate as that is. It’s that she wasn’t funny. Not at all.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/05/03/amy-schumer-commits-a-violent-crime-against-comedy/,2016-05-03
12 Reasons Pinterest Has Become My Online Man Cave,"As the world of social media grows more grim, some people are giving up on Twitter. A few people are leaving against their will, and others, like Adam Baldwin, are withdrawing from an increasingly hostile medium. Twitter is indeed about as much fun as trench warfare lately, and the Huns that run it have started using mustard gas to clear the conservative, libertarian, and hilarious foxholes I have enjoyed for years. Now the news is out that Facebook has also been censoring conservative content.

Many have asked: If we leave Twitter or Facebook, where can we go? I’ve got a suggestion: Pinterest.

I suspect many of you who identify as human males will have the same initial reaction to Pinterest that I had when my wife suggested it over a year ago. I thought Pinterest was for hausfraus who wanted to post scrapbooking nonsense and ideas for curtains. Maybe I’m getting soft, but after buying a great wallet on Etsy, I started to give some of these other social sites a chance.

Look again, friends, and listen. Pinterest is like a tranquil lake after the stormy, treacherous seas of Twitter. It’s glorious.

So here we go: just like you’ve come to expect from Buzzfeed The Federalist, an informative listicle that definitely did not take 20 minutes to write. It’s a bunch of stuff I like on Pinterest.

1. Guns

There are a ton of guns on Pinterest. People post links to guns they own, guns they want to own, custom designs, historical and antique guns, and lots of articles about shooting in general. By following guns, and pinning a few guns you like, Pinterest will send you more pictures of similar guns.

Each of these pins links back to the website where the picture was posted, so it even works as a nice way of referencing back to where you saw that gun. It’s like 3×5 notecards for the Internet. Try following just “Antique” and “Pistol” if that’s what you like, or “Concealed” and “Carry” for nice little guns. Ammunition, shooting techniques, and reviews of other shooting related stuff can all be found, organized, and stored easily.

2. Booze

I like craft beer and cocktails, and I like to learn more about those things. As it turns out, there are a bunch of shiftless drinkers on Pinterest who post links to cocktail recopies, new beers, and brands of liquor that may be new to you. Some of the links are to graphics with recipes, notes, and recommendations on barware. If you like rum and not whiskey, you can follow just “rum,” and you are an animal.

3. Clothes

Just when you thought this was drifting down a dark path, I’ll hit you with a little civilization. Like a lot of people who don’t live, eat, and breathe clothes, I can find it difficult to describe what I would like to wear. “Pants? Again?” is a familiar refrain at my house, but Pinterest makes it easy. I can find links to suits, ties, cuff links, spectacles, or shoes and stash them away for future reference. The next time I need to think about a new pair of shoes, I can check back and remind myself of what I thought looked appropriate.

4. Gear

I like toys and tools as much as anyone else, and Pinterest makes that appear rational and appropriate for a person in his fortieth year. I can follow “Every Day Carry” or “EDC” for links for watches, knives, pens, wallets, phone cases, as well as a healthy dose of more pistols and holsters. Feel free to refine your searches, topics you “follow,” for your personal needs. If you are looking for stuff for the gym, golf, or ultimate Frisbee, just search and pin a few things you like. Pinterest’s hive-brain algorithms will keep sending you suggestions.

5. Prepper Stuff

Nothing is more old-school, don’t-bother-dad-while-he’s-in-the-garage manly like prepper tips. There is, of course, a fine line between learning how to store some extra water and food in case the power goes out and digging a bunker in your backyard to protect you from the zombies. While the threat of nuclear war with the Russians is lower now than it might have been in the past, the occasional hurricane, riot, or snowstorm is a great reminder that you really should plan for how to feed and protect your family if you need to stay put for a few days or evacuate in a hurry.

You can check the link on something that looks interesting before you save it, just in case it links back to Stormfront or a scam site that is trying to sell you gold to bury. Remember, Pinterest doesn’t really filter the links, it just keeps them organized, and you are getting suggestions based on other people with similar interests, some of whom might be nuts.

6. Slow Cooker Recipes

If there’s anything I love more than a cocktail, it’s piling a bunch of food in a slow cooker, turning it on, and coming back in eight hours to feast on my cleverness. This is where the more domestic origins of Pinterest come in handy. It’s full of food. Slow-cooker stuff was only the beginning. Barbeque and smoker ideas abound, as do grilling ideas, wings, tacos, pizzas, and game recipes.

What do you want to make this weekend when friends are coming over? Make a Pinterest board with dinner ideas, and fill it with things that sound good. Last Christmas, I made mac and cheese from scratch for the first time, and I learned how to do it on Pinterest. You can turn your nose up at me, tough guy, but I’ll be making delicious mac and cheese with green chilies in it.

7. Home Office

I don’t have a huge area in my home that I can devote to the business of life, so I need that space to be efficient. Leave it to Pinterest to find ideas on how to keep your books, files, PC games, important tax documents, bills, and other stuff in order. There’s also sturdy laptop cases, home budget ideas, and other handy tricks. The genius of social media has always been very free-market: Good ideas will be successful, so let other rubes try things out and let you know what works.

8. Organization

This is only partially related to the home office, but good organization wherever you store things— basements, garages, attics, sheds, barns, etc.—is crucial to maximizing the space you have. Americans are spoiled by too much room, and we love insanely large houses. I don’t love large houses. I like a small house in a neighborhood where I can walk to a bar.

Pinterest has a bunch of ideas on shelves, closets, and storage spaces that look sharp, and can keep your living space under control. You can set up specific searches for whatever you need, such as kitchen, guest rooms, kids rooms, or whatever. For cheaper solutions, add the search term “DIY” for “Do it yourself.”

9. Fun Stuff

While I like food, guns, drinks, and efficiency, I’m not all business. Any hobby you may enjoy is well represented by your fellow Pinterestrians, or Pinteresters (depending on which of these terms I just made up that you prefer). I follow chess and card games, but you may prefer some other game, sport, or collectable. I don’t like to pass judgement on how people waste time. I’m on Pinterest, for the love of Pete.

10. Insanity and Weirdness

So far, I have not really delved deeply into the dark underbelly of Pinterest. I can’t be sure that it’s there, but it’s still the Internet, so I’ll bet $3 it’s there.

This brings me to a fair note of caution, however. Pinterest is pretty tame, but you can occasionally find things that might not be ideal for your children. Occasionally I come across a post that makes me think “That young lady should know better than to forget her shirt when she goes to a shooting range,” or “I guess that woman’s shirt got dirty while she was working on her Vespa and it had to be put in the laundry immediately.” You can report images that go too far, but you can also just block things that are not to your taste.

11. Less Politics

There are certainly political posts on Pinterest, but they are very easy to avoid by not following “politics” or a candidate name or an issue name. I really find this useful because Twitter has taught me that I no longer care what anyone thinks about politics.

12. Cars and Bikes

Just like with guns, if you like specific types of cars, motorcycles, scooters, or bicycles, plenty of other people enjoy those things as well. Pin away, and you will be rewarded with other interesting finds from around the endless virtual landscape of the Internet.

"Katie Couric Decried 'Edited' Footage, Doctored Gun Interview","A new Katie Couric documentary advocating gun control was deceptively edited to make Second Amendment supporters look foolish, audio released by the supporters shows.

In “Under the Gun,” Couric asks a group of gun rights supporters, “If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?” The documentary filmmakers spliced in footage of the activists sitting silently for nine seconds. One man looks down, seemingly uncomfortable, during the awkward silence. The documentary then moves on to the next scene of a cylinder on a revolver being closed.

Couric documentarians fabricated this moment, using footage from a session that was unrelated to the question asked. In fact, according to audio of Couric’s interview provided by the gun rights activists, they all rushed to respond to Couric, providing answers based on principle and practical concerns. “Well, one — if you’re not in jail, you should still have your basic rights,” said one of the gun owners. Others responded as well.

You can watch the offending section — and hear the actual audio that was spliced out — here. It’s a stunning betrayal of journalistic ethics.

This willful and malicious doctoring of evidence to support an agenda is so unconscionable that even CNN, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and other media outlets made note of it.

Couric should have disclaimed the documentary and publicly acknowledge her error. Instead, the film’s director Stephanie Soechtig indirectly admitted she spliced in false footage when she issued the following statement:

My intention was to provide a pause for the viewer to have a moment to consider this important question before presenting the facts on Americans’ opinions on background checks. I never intended to make anyone look bad and I apologize if anyone felt that way.

This mealy mouthed mush was described as an apology at CNN while The Washington Post openly mocked the “apologize if” construction of the response. Erik Wemple of the Post added that he’d never seen a “thinner, more weaselly excuse” than the one proffered by Soechtig. For her part, Couric said “I support Stephanie’s statement and am very proud of the film.”

Wemple says that’s nowhere near good enough and concludes, “An apology, retraction, re-editing, whatever it is that filmmakers do to make amends — all of it needs to happen here.”

Of course, this type of cut-and-splice “journalism” is common these days. Journalists have been praising “The Daily Show’s” use of deceptively edited interviews for as long as “The Daily Show” has deceptively edited them. Pretty much every time we hear that some cable comedian has “destroyed” some outgroup or the views the outgroup holds, that’s thanks to deceptive editing.

A few other things are worth noting here. One is how media outlets praised this faux-documentary prior to this particularly egregious example of manipulation. The AP’s story by Lynn Elber was headlined, “Gun violence gets more nuanced, probing coverage.” I’d hate to see something non-nuanced or non-probing! The article goes on to say the documentary “examines why those on opposite sides of stricter gun laws can’t find common ground.”

On Media Treatment of ‘Edited’ Videos

You know where this is going. Beginning last July, the Center for Medical Progress began releasing videos showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing the trafficking of human body parts obtained from abortions performed in clinics. The videos were shocking. Planned Parenthood began robotically issuing talking points calling the videos “edited” or “deceptively edited,” in an attempt to protect its organization from a public relations nightmare.

That Planned Parenthood would respond to these videos in such a way is not surprising. But our entire media industrial complex attempted to circumvent the findings of the Center for Medical Progress’ videos by calling them “edited” or “deceptively edited” as well. If they said it once, they said it eleventy billion times.

It is true that all video journalism is edited. One hundred-freaking-percent of it. Every single video package you watch on the nightly news is edited. None of these videos are called “edited,” of course, but they are. In the same way that all other video journalism is edited, yes, the Center for Medical Progress’ was, too.

But unlike every other documentary team, the Center for Medical Progress did something telling. They released, along with their mini-documentaries, the full unedited footage they obtained in their undercover journalistic efforts.

Planned Parenthood paid for an audit of the videos from a left-wing Democratic opposition research firm called Fusion — an audit that the media were happy to accept and spread — to support the talking point that the videos were edited. Even so, that audit admitted “no widespread evidence of substantive video manipulation.”

An independent audit and forensic analysis of the videos likewise said that they were “authentic and show no evidence of manipulation.” As I wrote on Twitter:

Indeed, when Katie Couric ran interference for Cecile Richards, doing a lengthy sit-down puffball interview and a tour of an abortion clinic where she didn’t once mention, uh, abortion, she twice decried the videos as “edited.” Couric is a long-time pro-abortion activist, not just using the mainstream media to advocate it, but having marched in support of the right to end unborn human lives. Last week on David Axelrod’s podcast, she said that her parents were major influences on her, specifically citing her mother’s volunteer work for Planned Parenthood and the fact that her mother invested in Trojan condoms when she learned about the AIDS crisis. Classy!

An accompanying write-up of the Cecile Richards interview falsely stated:

The videos, some of which were edited together in a way to depict Planned Parenthood employees talking about selling fetal tissue, which is illegal, rocked the organization.

The media have straight-up adopted Planned Parenthood’s false “deceptively edited” talking points and carried the water for Planned Parenthood’s campaign against the Center for Medical Progress. Here, one of their perky own in the mainstream media is caught red-handed actually deceptively editing in the service of gun control, and the most outrage The New York Times can muster is the headline, “Audio of Katie Couric interview shows editing slant in documentary, site claims.” What a joke our mainstream media are.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/05/26/katie-couric-decried-edited-planned-parenthood-footage-then-doctored-a-gun-owner-interview/,2016-05-26
‘Real Sports’ Trolls Public About America’s Most Popular Rifle,"Coming on the heels of former “Today” show host Katie Couric’s now-debunked “documentary” on criminal gun violence in America, HBO’s “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel” contributed a one-two punch, taking aim at the most popular rifle in America, the AR-15.

The segment, titled “AR15: Modern Sporting Rifle,” which airs this week, takes a sharp — and perplexing — departure from the series’ typical mix of hard-hitting reportage on corruption in the major sports leagues, inspiring stories of adversity, and profiles of sports celebrities, and instead focuses on the development of a specific firearm and its alleged unique lethality.

“I’m talking about a gun now known as the AR-15, a weapon designed for wartime, but one that has somehow morphed into one of the most popular pieces of so-called sports equipment,” Gumbel says in his intro with clear disdain. “Under that guise, millions of AR-15s have been sold in recent years, primarily for people who claim to want them to hunt or compete in target shooting. But AR-15s have also played an ugly role in the mass shootings that have become all too commonplace throughout this country.”

The report, he says, will expose “how America’s gun industry has marketed its deadliest product.”

AR-15 Ammo Is Not Super-Lethal

To argue that the “Real Sports” report on the AR-15 is a broadcast version of anti-gun trolling would be an understatement. In the 20-minute segment, reporter David Scott resurrects tired arguments against the AR and the companies that manufacture it, painting it as a weapon somehow outside the norm of common firearms and one that’s been the focus of a diabolical industry scheme to “normalize” it with faux sporting events and deceptive marketing.

It’s not surprising that Gumbel, who’s had a long and public anti-gun track record, would focus on these arguments, as they are the same ones being raised in a civil lawsuit against Remington Outdoor Company by some parents of the shooting victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School who allege the gunmaker illegally marketed a military weapon to civilians.

The “Real Sports “segment buttresses its claims in an interview with Jim Sullivan, one of the original designers of the M-16 (which fires in both semi-automatic and full-auto modes) and its civilian counterpart, the AR-15 (which fires in semi-automatic only). Sullivan claims in his interview that the bullet the AR-15 fires is somehow uniquely deadly — that it causes such catastrophic wounds that hits “almost anywhere” were fatal.

“It’s more lethal than any cartridge that was fired by any army in history,” Sullivan says. Clearly the non-shooting public — or even casual shooters who might own an AR but not know that much about it — would be shocked to hear that from one of the original designers of the rifle. But Sullivan’s claim is perplexing, even to many of his fans, because it’s just so demonstrably false.

The AR-15 fires a 5.56mm round — a comparatively small bullet for almost any rifle made today. It fires the bullet at a very high velocity, which generally makes it accurate out to 300 yards, but the small bullet and velocity comes at a cost. The round typically shoots straight through its target.

In fact, most states bar hunters from shooting “big game” like deer with a rifle chambered in 5.56 because of its lack of lethality. Also, as recently as the war in Afghanistan, soldiers who use the M-4 rifle — a more modern version of the M-16 — complain that the 5.56 round simply passes through the enemy, forcing them to fire more shots at bad guys who keep fighting.

There are literally a dozen calibers that fire from a host of different rifle designs that do far more damage than the AR-15. The AR-10, which Sullivan played a large role in developing as well, fires a .308 rifle round that can penetrate a brick wall and still kill someone standing behind it — something an AR-15 could never do.

The False Military Versus Civilian Distinction

Another claim highlighted in the “Real Sports” segment — and one that parrots the arguments made in the Sandy Hook family’s lawsuit against Remington Outdoor Company — is that the AR-15 is a rifle designed specifically for the military and is therefore unsuited to civilian use.

“This is really about where we as a society choose to draw the line between civilian arms and military arms,” Scott says in his after-segment walkoff with Gumbel.

Sure, the original design of the AR-15 became the military M-16, but so did a vast majority of America’s most popular firearms. The ubiquitous Glock 17 pistol was designed to replace the Austrian government’s military handgun, the popular Mini-14 (which Sullivan also designed) is a civilian adaptation of the M-14, not to mention that the Remington 700 bolt-action rifle has been for decades the top choice of U.S. military snipers (and hunters). All of these common firearms were designed for military use but are also uncontroversially popular with civilian shooters.

In fact, it’s hard to trace any firearm’s development without seeing at least some influence from military requirements simply because the need for durability, ease of use, and reliability for a wide range of troops also applies to civilian shooters.

Yes, Competitive Shooting Is a Real Sport

Diving into the mud, the “Real Sports” segment takes a swipe at the growing popularity of shooting sports like three-gun, two-gun, and other multi-gun sports that favor the AR-15 and its variants, by dismissing them as a fringe outliers concocted by a gun industry to justify its lethal wares. Gumbel’s intro, laced with condescension toward the “so-called” shooting sports and AR owners “who claim to want them to compete,” is a pretty fair indication that we’re being lectured to, not informed.

The growing popularity of shooting sports of all kinds has mostly been fueled by a public who wants to put their $1,200 AR-15 to some use other than a little plinking at a range.

While he dismisses competitive shooting as a “guise” to sell more guns, although the firearms industry plays a helpful role in sponsoring major matches and promoting athletes, the growing popularity of shooting sports of all kinds has mostly been fueled by a public who wants to put their $1,200 AR-15 to some use other than a little plinking at a range. We’re talking about a sport where competitive shooters can make a living doing well at matches, and it’s as much about grassroots appeal as it is a creature of industry.

In a shallow swipe, the show uses the growth of competitive shooting sports as a pivot to the argument that gun companies are “marketing these AR-15s to children,” using cigarette company logic to create an image of kids walking into gun stores with a fake IDs to buy semi-automatic rifles colored in pink and zombie green.

Splashing images of young competitive shooters holding AR-15s in magazine ads and cover spreads, Scott asks the National Shooting Sports Foundation’s Larry Keane whether it’s “appropriate” to market the AR to kids.

“I wouldn’t say it’s being marketed to children. I see it as marketing to the parents,” Keane says.

Sure, the NSSF, whose duty is to promote the firearms industry, is trying to get more youths into the market. But “that’s a decision for the parent, to decide whether they want to have their child participate in adult-supervised recreational target shooting, which is as all-American as apple pie,” Keane adds.

There’s more that’s wrong with the “Real Sports” hit job on the AR-15, for sure. But by now most of the public should be used to this kind of overt anti-gun campaigning.

It may scare Gumbel that an estimated 12 million ARs were sold in the last decade, yet despite that number only 2 percent of firearms crime is committed with a rifle of any kind — much less an AR-15. Notwithstanding the relentless campaigning from shows like “Real Sports” and Couric’s “Under The Gun,” most recent polls show a majority of Americans aren’t buying into “assault rifle” bans anyway.

"No, We Haven’t Discovered ‘Gun Control That Actually Works’","Over at The New York Times, Alan Berlow thinks he has discovered “gun control that actually works.” He hasn’t, and it’s a pitiable liberal tendency to search desperately for successful gun control laws, year after year and ban after ban. It is the policy equivalent of Sasquatch: it’s out there, somewhere, even though there’s no real demonstrable proof of it. You just have to keep looking.

Barlow thinks he has finally found it, the Surgeon’s Photograph of gun control. “For more than 80 years,” he writes, “the United States has enforced a tough and effective gun control law that most Americans have never heard of:” “It’s a 1934 measure called the National Firearms Act, and it stands as a stark rebuke to the most sacred precepts of the gun lobby and provides a model we should build on.”

The National Firearms Act of 1934 does no such thing: it rebukes no “sacred precept,” and the “model” it “provides” is meaningless in relation to broader gun policy.

The NFA mandates that owners register various types of firearms and firearm accessories: machine guns, silencers, sawed-off shotguns, short-barreled rifles, and other concealable weapons. Registration involves a background check, an added tax, approval by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and a stolen gun reporting requirement.

One of These Things Does Not Undermine the Other

In Berlow’s reckoning, the NFA “makes a good case against the N.R.A.,” because it requires a firearm database the likes of which the National Rifle Association vehemently opposes for broader gun ownership. “[T]o today’s N.R.A.,” he writes, “such measures are an existential threat to the Second Amendment.” As Berlow puts it, the NFA’s success “forcefully undermines the N.R.A.’s nonsensical claims that reasonable limits on gun ownership are a serious burden to law-abiding gun owners.”

This is profoundly silly for a number of important reasons, chief among them that Berlow seems not to grasp the animating principle of the NRA itself. The NRA has one purpose through which it serves the American body politic: broadly safeguarding the American right to keep and bear arms. The firearms covered by the NFA, on the other hand, are niche items—certain carbines and fully-automatic M4s and handguns with shoulder-stocks.

It is simply nonsense to claim that heavily regulating these types guns represents “reasonable limits” that can be applied to broader categories of firearms. One style of regulation covering a few specific types of guns does not mean that every gun must be likewise covered, any more than the specific regulations covering certain types of cheeses means you must similarly regulate a raw-milk cheese and a slice of American.

As for Berlow’s broader argument, that gun registration promises “tremendous success” in reducing gun violence: this is a dubious proposition at best and a willfully ignorant one at worst. One only need look at Washington DC’s gun registration law compared to the decades of the District’s astronomical gun violence to see that gun registration hardly correlates with a drop in gun crime. (Additionally, the expensive and esoteric types of weapons covered by the NFA are by their nature less practical for committing crimes than cheap, easily concealable handguns and revolvers.)

Gun Registries Do Have Historical Precedent

Berlow’s final contention is a rhetorical one: if registration is so threatening, he asks, then “why hasn’t the government used the N.F.A database to confiscate weapons? Why has it failed to move against the holders of hunting licenses and concealed carry permits who readily submit to milder forms of gun licensing and registration?”

This is, by way of rhetorical device, a true statement. It is also a meaningless and stupid one. Supporters of American gun rights do not oppose gun registries because we are worried that senators Mitch McConnell or Patrick Leahy are going to order their personal aides to snatch our guns away. We are concerned, rather, that a gun registry could—years down the line—become a powerful and dangerous tool in the hands of a government bent on subduing the civilian population under an authoritarian regime.

There is also the fear that an activist Supreme Court could re-litigate the Second Amendment out of existence, something Hillary Clinton has effectively promised to do. In either case, a registry would be a dangerous road map that would tell the government exactly where every gun in the country is.

This type of scenario is not mere fantasy. It has happened before, well within living memory. The Nazis used the Weimar Republic’s gun registry to confiscate firearms from the German Jewry. This disarmament doubtlessly contributed to the forced extermination of millions of Jews. Disarming the civilian populace invariably precedes the ascendancy of every tyrannical government.

Gun registries let the powers-that-be know where firearms are kept. Registries are inimical to the Second Amendment, which is meant to ensure a defensively armed population, something a registry by its nature preempts. Berlow is, in either case, wrong: about the relative merits of a broader gun registry, and about the safety and prudency of such a registry.

Those of us who take gun rights seriously have heard these arguments before, and dismissed them. “Gun control that works” continues, as always, to not actually work. Like Sasquatch, it’s always out there somewhere—but you never find it.

Gun Rights Activist: NYT Distorted My Views On Gun Registration,"First it was Katie Couric, who blatantly doctored a video in order to smear gun owners in a new documentary. Then came HBO’s Bryant Gumbel, Couric’s former sidekick, who twisted the words of AR-15 inventor Jim Sullivan to make it look like he thought the AR-15 was too dangerous for civilians.

Now the New York Times apparently wants in on the act. According to yet another Second Amendment activist, a writer for the New York Times op-ed page distorted the words of the gun rights activist to make it appear as though he favors national gun registration.

According to Jeff Folloder, the executive director for the National Firearms Act Trade and Collectors Association (NFATCA), New York Times op-ed author Alan Berlow took Folloder’s quotes out of context to give the impression that Folloder agreed with certain gun control measures.

“The primary issue is that Berlow’s selective editing gave the impression that I/we support gun registration,” Folloder told The Federalist via e-mail. “We don’t.”

Here’s how Berlow characterized his conversation with Folloder in his New York Times piece published earlier this week:

Jeff Folloder, the executive director of the N.F.A. Trade and Collectors Association, says his members have learned to live with gun registration and lose no sleep worrying about confiscation. “There are still an enormous number of people who think if they register and purchase an N.F.A. weapon, they’re giving A.T.F. permission to come knock on their door at any time, and that’s just not true,” Mr. Folloder told me. “You’re not giving up any rights.”

Folloder takes great issue with Berlow’s characterization of their conversation.

“Many of my quotes/attributions from that past interview were taken out of context,” Folloder told The Federalist. “I detailed to the author that one of the rumors that we have to constantly dispel is the fiction that registering an NFA weapons gives ATF permission to come inspect or kick in your door without cause or warrant.”

“I specifically said that registering an NFA weapon does not mean that you give up any search and seizure rights,” Folloder continued. “Of course, that morphed into ‘not giving up any rights.'”

“Berlow, through manipulation and editing, implied that I/we think that a gun registration scheme is effective,” Folloder concluded. “It’s not.”

In addition to ripping Folloder’s words out of context, Berlow also badly botched the history behind the regulation of certain items by the National Firearms Act, or NFA. Here’s what Berlow wrote about the NFA:

But the longstanding National Firearms Act not only already mandated the registration of all owners of machine guns, short-barreled rifles, silencers and other weapons deemed highly dangerous at the time, it created a national database of those gun owners with their mug shots and fingerprints, and a detailed description of each weapon purchased, including its serial number.

The characterization of a silencer–the accurate name of which is actually a “suppressor,” since it doesn’t silence a gun’s report at all–as a “weapon[] deemed highly dangerous at the time,” is laughable to anyone who’s used a suppressor or taken the time to understand the device’s purpose and history.

First developed and sold by Hiram Maxim in 1902, a suppressor is nothing more than a hollow metallic cylinder with internal baffles to help slow the diffusion of gas as a round is fired from a gun. Unlike in the movies, where a suppressor magically turns the BANG! of a gun into nothing more than a pew-pew whisper, suppressors in real life merely reduce, rather than eliminate, the noise created by the firing of a weapon.

And when the suppressor was officially added to the list of controlled devices within the 1934 gun law, it wasn’t added because it made a gun more deadly or more dangerous. It was added to help reduce out-of-season hunting and poaching on private lands by making illicit hunters easier to identify and apprehend. The reduced volume of the gun report from the suppressor made it more difficult to catch poachers.

It’s no wonder that suppressors are so rarely used in crimes in the U.S. Not only do they not eliminate the loud noises associated with firing a gun, they’re also incredibly expensive, with most suppressors costing far more than the guns they’ll be attached to. On top of that, they make weapons extremely difficult, if not impossible, to conceal. According to data analyzed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, suppressors are used in an infinitesimal crimes not because of gun control, but because they’re just not very practical for most criminals:

Less than 0.1% of homicides in federal court, an infinitesimally low 0.00006% of felonies in California and a mere 0.1% of armed robberies involve a suppressor. Suppressed firearms are clearly not the choice for criminals. This is likely due to the fact that they do not silence firearms like in the movies, they are ineffective on revolvers, they prevent the proper function of most semiautomatic handguns without the addition of a special piston system and they make firearms longer and heavier, which makes them more difficult to conceal.

Many countries in Europe have taken a decidedly different stance when it comes to the use of suppressors. In Norway, they are completely unregulated. In Poland, they are legal and require no permit or registration whatsoever. In Sweden, all you need is a hunting license. That’s because these countries recognize that rather than making murders and assassinations easy peasy like you see in the movies, suppressors really just protect the hearing health of those who regularly use rifles. In a home defense situation, for example, the use of an unsuppressed rifle in a hallway or small, enclosed area would likely result in permanent hearing damage or total hearing loss for those nearby. But when combined with subsonic ammunition, suppressors can go a long way towards preventing permanent hearing damage. And yet suppressors remain heavily regulated in the U.S. not because they make weapons more deadly or dangerous, but because people who know nothing about them think they look scary in movies.

Berlow’s distortions and misstatements of fact weren’t the New York Times‘ first foray into shoddy anti-gun propagandizing, though. In December of 2015, the New York Times editorial page claimed that the expiration of the 1994 assault weapons ban resulted in .50 caliber sniper rifles flooding the streets because “18-year-olds” can “easily buy” them.

It would be a shocking claim, if it were true. However, the so-called assault weapons ban didn’t ban .50 caliber rifles, so it’s hard to see how the law’s expiration magically resulted in the firearm’s proliferation. And then there’s the whole easy to buy charge: a .50 caliber sniper rifle and its accessories could cost you upwards of $10,000. And on top of all that, there’s one more inconvenient fact: a .50 caliber rifle has never, not once, ever been used in a mass shooting in the U.S.

According to Folloder, the gun rights activist whose words were grossly taken out of context by Berlow, the New York Times author, the New York Times never bothered to fact-check the conversation to determine if Folloder’s words were being accurately characterized.

“For what it’s worth, the New York Times never fact checked Berlow’s quotes and attributions,” Folloder told The Federalist. “I am not surprised that I was not given an opportunity to correct the false implications.”

Which brings us back to the willful distortions from anti-gun hacks like Katie Couric, Bryant Gumbel, Alan Berlow, and the New York Times editorial page. If gun owners are so dumb and so evil, and if some gun rights activists are so on board with federal gun control schemes, then anti-gun propagandists should have no problem demonstrating those facts without having to doctor videos, distort quotes, mangle laws, misstate historical facts, and deliberately omit key context.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/02/gun-rights-activist-the-new-york-times-deliberately-distorted-my-views-on-gun-registration/,2016-06-02
Katie Couric's Producers Repeatedly Broke Federal Gun Laws,"Katie, get your gun lawyer.

By now you’ve probably heard about Katie Couric’s new anti-gun documentary “Under The Gun,” and how her producer doctored video of interviews with gun owners in order to make them look stupid and heartless. Couric’s producer and director, Stephanie Soechtig, admitted to doctoring the video, and Couric herself kinda sorta apologized for it.

But that’s not the worst thing that happened with the making of this documentary. It turns out that Couric’s production team deliberately conspired to violate federal gun laws. According to video obtained by Ammoland, a shooting sports news website, one of Couric’s producers deliberately committed at least four separate felonies by purchasing four separate firearms across state lines without a background check.

In the video, Soechtig openly admits that she directed one of her employees to purchase guns across state lines, and that he absolutely followed her orders:

SOECHTIG: We sent a producer out and he was from Colorado. He went to Arizona, and he was able to buy a Bushmaster and then three other pistols without a background check in a matter of four hours. And that’s perfectly legal. He wasn’t doing some sort of underground market.



[..]



And he just met someone in the parking lot of Wendy’s and bought a Bushmaster. Legally. Like, this is legal.

Except it’s not legal. Like, it’s illegal. Super duper illegal. Quadruple illegal in the case of the Soechtig employee who purchased four firearms across state lines without processing the sale through a federal firearms licensee (FFL) in his home state of Colorado.

Federal law is abundantly clear on what types of transactions require federal background checks. Gun owners tend to understand these laws incredibly well. Gun controllers like Soechtig do not. Under federal law, all gun purchases from an FFL must be accompanied by a federal background check. It doesn’t matter if the FFL sells a gun at a retail location, at a gun show, or out of the back of a car in a Wendy’s parking lot. All FFL transactions require a federal background check. It doesn’t matter who you are or where you’re from: if you buy a gun from an FFL, the FFL must confirm that you have passed a federal background check.

Next we have interstate purchases, all of which must be conducted through an FFL in the buyer’s home state. It is illegal to purchase a gun across state lines unless the transaction is processed through an FFL in the buyer’s home state. And what did we just learn about all FFL purchases? That they require federal background checks. Ergo, all interstate purchases must be accompanied by federal background checks.

What does that mean? It means that a producer who resides in Colorado cannot legally buy a gun in Arizona unless that gun is shipped to an FFL in Colorado, whereby that FFL confirms that the Colorado resident can legally own that firearm. The Colorado resident who bought the gun from someone in Arizona cannot take possession of that gun until the Colorado FFL receives the gun from Arizona and confirms that the Colorado buyer can legally own that weapon. Once that happens, the Colorado FFL would transfer possession of the gun to the Colorado buyer.

The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives even has a handy FAQ on its website which directly answers the question of whether you can buy a gun across state lines:

How may an unlicensed person receive a firearm in his or her State that he or she purchased from an out–of–State source?



An unlicensed person who is not prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms may purchase a firearm from an out–of–State source, provided the transfer takes place through a Federal firearms licensee in his or her State of residence.



[18 U.S.C 922(a)(3) and 922(b)(3); 27 CFR 478.29]

But that’s not what happened according to Soechtig’s very own testimony. According to Soechtig, she gave direct orders to an employee of hers who lives in Colorado to buy some guns in Arizona without undergoing a federal background check. He then acted on those orders, and, according to Soechtig’s own admission, proceeded to illegally purchase four separate firearms from a seller in Arizona. And if he was purchasing the guns for Soechtig rather than himself, you can add illegal straw purchases to the list of federal crimes.

Soechtig’s employee, acting on her orders, repeatedly violated federal gun laws. And he did so not just because of his own monumental ignorance, but because of the aggressive ignorance of Stephanie Soechtig, Katie Couric’s hand-picked producer, director, and writer of the anti-gun documentary.

Soechtig’s chest-thumping ignorance and arrogance on display in that interview–“Legally. Like, this is legal.”–are a perfect example of why so many gun owners care so little about the opinions of sanctimonious gun controllers. Because they have absolutely no clue what they’re talking about. They don’t understand how guns work. They don’t understand crime statistics. They don’t know the difference between semi-automatic and automatic. And they can’t even deign to spend 5 minutes researching actual gun laws before declaring that those laws just aren’t sufficient.

The one thing gun controllers all agree on, however, is that strong enforcement of commonsense gun laws is key to preventing senseless gun violence. Katie Couric, Stephanie Soechtig, and their entire anti-gun documentary team now have a chance to put their money where their mouths are. If enforcement of federal gun laws is essential to preventing gun violence, then Soechtig and her team must pay the price for their willful and admitted violations of federal gun laws.

When Soechtig and her team plea to federal charges for violating the nation’s commonsense gun laws, we’ll know they’re serious about cutting down on gun crime. Until then, we’ll know they’re just a bunch of ignorant, gun-trafficking profiteers who want to take away our rights while they violate with absolute impunity the very laws they demand.

Katie Couric’s Producer Confirms Her Team Skirted Federal Gun Laws,"Stephanie Soechtig, the director, producer, and writer for Katie Couric’s scandal-plagued anti-gun documentary “Under The Gun,” confirmed in a statement to The Federalist today that her production team skirted federal gun laws governing interstate gun purchases.

During an interview with The Lip TV, Soechtig stated that one of her producers, a male from Colorado, purchased three handguns and a rifle from a private, non-licensed individual in Arizona and that a background check was never required. Federal law states that all interstate gun purchases must be processed by a federal firearms licensee (FFL). Under federal law, FFLs must confirm that prospective buyers have passed federal background checks prior to transferring ownership of guns to those buyers.

In response to a series of detailed questions about the incident posed by The Federalist, Soechtig simultaneously confirmed that she and her team skirted federal gun laws and declared that they did absolutely nothing wrong:

“While it may seem hard to believe that one could buy these types of guns this easily, all purchases in the film were made completely legally. Arizona law allows out-of-state residents to buy long guns (i.e. rifles, shotguns, military style assault rifles) from a private seller without a background check. It also allows Arizona residents to buy handguns from a private seller without a background check.



“We demonstrated both versions of this dangerous loophole in the film on a hidden camera, in full compliance with both state and federal laws. The rifles – including a Smith and Wesson M&P 15, the gun used in the Aurora massacre – were purchased by an out of state resident. The handgun was purchased by an Arizona resident.



“These guns were then turned over to law enforcement and destroyed. They never left the state of Arizona.”

When combined with her statements during her interview with The Lip TV, Soechtig’s latest statement provides clear evidence that she and her team did not follow all applicable gun laws.

In the videotaped interview, Soechtig stated that all of the weapons, including the rifles, were purchased without the buyer having to undergo a federal background check.

“We sent a producer out and he was from Colorado. He went to Arizona, and he was able to buy a Bushmaster and then three other pistols without a background check in a matter of four hours,” Soechtig declared. “And that’s perfectly legal.”

And in her statement provided to The Federalist, Soechtig admitted that multiple rifles were purchased by a non-Arizona resident.

Federal and state gun law experts contacted by The Federalist vehemently disagreed with Soechtig’s declaration that out-of-state residents can legally purchase guns from private Arizona residents without processing the sales through a licensed federal gun dealer.

The Federalist spoke to a large FFL in the Phoenix area and asked about Soechtig’s interpretation of state and federal laws. Is it legal for an out-of-state resident to buy a gun in Arizona without involving an FFL in the transaction?

“Absolutely not!” the licensed gun dealer said during a phone conversation on Monday afternoon. “We’re talking about federal law here. If you are not an Arizona resident, you cannot legally buy a gun here without going through an FFL.”

“An Arizona FFL can process a long gun purchase and the background check for an out of state buyer,” he said. “Otherwise, an FFL in the buyer’s home state has to process the transaction.”

“Interstate sales between private individuals are a big no-no,” he concluded.

Alan Korwin, a nationally recognized expert on firearms law and author of “Gun Laws Of America,” the unabridged guide to the nation’s gun laws, told The Federalist that the transactions engineered by Couric’s production team appear to violate multiple federal gun laws.

“It appears that Katie Couric and her producer arranged to have firearms transferred to themselves outside their home state from an otherwise innocent person,” Korwin said. “That clearly is an illegal transfer under federal law, each transfer of which is a federal felony.”

Korwin’s interpretation also matches that of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). According to the ATF’s own website, the interstate firearms transactions described by Soechtig likely violated federal gun trafficking laws:

May an unlicensed person acquire a firearm under the GCA in any State?



Generally, a person may only acquire a firearm within the person’s own State. Exceptions include the acquisition pursuant to a lawful bequest, or an over–the–counter acquisition of a rifle or shotgun from a licensee where the transaction is allowed by the purchaser’s State of residence and the licensee’s State of business. A person may borrow or rent a firearm in any State for temporary use for lawful sporting purposes.



[18 U.S.C 922(a)(3); 27 CFR 478.29]

According to Soechtig’s own admission, her producer acquired multiple rifles in another state without doing an “over-the-counter acquisition…from a [federal firearms licensee]” and without undergoing a federal background check, which is required by law. But that may not be the only law violated by Katie Couric’s production team.

If they gave the seller reason to believe that their buyer was not a resident of Arizona, then they induced the seller to commit a federal crime. Under 18 U.S.C. 922(a)(5), it is unlawful for any non-FFL to transfer ownership of a firearm to anyone he knows or reasonably suspects resides in a state other than the one in which the seller resides. The Federalist asked Soechtig to provide the name of the seller as well as the original online gun listing for the sale but received no information prior to publication of this article. She also declined to provide the identity of the out-of-state resident who purchased the rifles or to state whether he acquired the firearms across state lines at her direction.

Last Friday, the ATF told the Washington Free Beacon, a widely respected investigative news website, that it was “unclear” if Soechtig and her team broke any laws.

“ATF is aware of the allegations, however, the outcome of the private sale in question is unclear and it is not evident if a violation occurred,” ATF spokesman Dillon McConnell said.

But Soechtig’s latest statement, in which she admits that she and her team deliberately purchased multiple rifles across state lines without processing the transaction through an FFL, makes the outcome of the private sale in question abundantly clear: her team deliberately set up a transaction in which an out-of-state resident acquired a firearm from an individual in another state without processing the purchase through a licensed gun dealer.

One key portion of Soechtig’s new statement, however, directly contradicts key portions of her previous interview with The Lip TV. In that interview, Soechtig said her out-of-state producer purchased three handguns in Arizona without going through an FFL. In the most recent statement, Soechtig states that only one handgun was purchased and that it was purchased by an Arizona resident, not a Colorado resident. Under federal law, all interstate handgun purchases must be processed by an FFL in the buyer’s home state. If Soechtig’s latest statement is an accurate representation of what happened, then it is unclear why she originally claimed that three handguns were legally purchased by an out-of-state resident without going through an FFL.

The Federalist contacted multiple state and local law enforcement agencies in Arizona to ask about Soechtig’s interpretation of state and federal gun trafficking laws, and none of them said that the purchases described by Soechtig were legal under state and federal law.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/06/katie-courics-producer-confirms-her-team-skirted-federal-gun-laws/,2016-06-06
Obama Tries To Pretend The Second Amendment Doesn’t Exist,"Speaking at a PBS NewsHour town hall last week in Indiana, President Obama was asked a thoughtful, nuanced question by a man in the audience about gun control.

His question is worth quoting in full because Obama not only artfully dodges the substance of the question but ignores the salient example the questioner gives about why gun control laws don’t seem to work in places with the strictest measures:

Why do you and Hillary want to control and restrict gun manufacturers, gun owners, and the responsible use of guns and ammunition to the rest of us, the good guys, instead of holding the bad guys accountable for their actions? And Mr. President if I may, I’d like to use Chicago, your home town, a city that has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, a city that for decades, and still is, under Democratic control, a city that has an outrageous an even embarrassing murder rate, as my first example. Why can’t we round up these thugs, these drugs dealers and gang members and hold them accountable for their actions, or allow the good people in Chicago access to firearms to protect themselves?

Obama’s answer is both defensive and dissembling. He begins by imputing an argument to the questioner that was never made, that Obama simply wants to confiscate guns. “At no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners,” the president says.

That’s not to say one couldn’t make an argument that in fact Obama and Hillary Clinton have both proposed gun confiscation. After the Charleston church massacre last summer, Obama cited Australia’s gun control reforms of the 1990s as an example that America should follow. He did so again after the Oregon community college shooting last fall.

What were those Australian gun control measures? A ban on semi-automatic and automatic rifles and shotguns, and a mandatory buy-back program for the newly banned weapons. What was the penalty in Australia for not handing over your previously legal firearms to the government? Arrest and criminal conviction with up to 12 months in prison. By any reasonable measure, that’s a confiscatory gun control regime, and Obama has publically called for it in the United States.

Obama Shrugs Off The Second Amendment

But that’s not what the man was asking about. He was asking why Obama supports gun control measures that haven’t curtailed gun violence in places like Chicago. He never got an answer. Instead, Obama rambled on about how we require people to get a driver’s license before they can drive a car, and how regulating auto manufacturers—requiring seat belts, air bags, etc.—have reduced auto fatalities. The president mused, “Why don’t we treat this like every other thing that we use?”

Because, Mr. President, every other thing we use isn’t protected by an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

On this point Obama is either confused or he just doesn’t believe the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, which was affirmed in 2008 by the U.S. Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. It’s unlikely Obama would ever repudiate Heller outright, since the vast majority of Americans agree that the 2nd Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to own a gun. But it’s a reasonable assumption given the kinds of gun control measures he has called for. (The same goes for Clinton. Yesterday, she couldn’t bring herself to say that an individual’s right to bear arms was a constitutional right during an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos.)

At the very least, Obama thinks we should regulate guns like automobiles. He then sets up a straw man, saying, “We are not allowed to do any of that when it comes to guns because if you propose anything, it is suggested that we’re trying to wipe away gun rights and impose tyranny and martial law.”

Setting aside the president’s hyperbole here, it’s not hard to see how regulating guns like automobiles would necessarily lead to a repudiation of the Second Amendment, or how a mandatory buy-back program on the Australian model would impose a kind of tyranny insofar as it would turn otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals.

The NRA Doesn’t Protect Gun Rights, The Constitution Does

But Obama’s true opinion of the Second Amendment came out when he explained how American citizens who are known to have visited ISIS websites—“ISIL sympathizers”—can be placed on a no-fly list: “But because of the National Rifle Association, I cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun.”

No, Mr. President, you can’t prohibit American citizens who haven’t been convicted of a crime from buying a gun because of the Second Amendment, not the NRA.

Not once does Obama breathe a word about Chicago, where the murder rate has increased by 72 percent compared with last year. In the first three months of 2016, shootings there were up 88 percent compared to the previous year.

Chicago only begrudgingly allowed conceal and carry permits after the Illinois Legislature passed a concealed carry law in 2013, and that happened only after the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state’s previous ban on carrying a weapon in public was unconstitutional. Even with that law, however, as of November 2015 only 136,920 Illinoisans have a concealed carry license, in part because of byzantine rules restricting who can obtain a license and where they can carry. Of course, all those rules are ignored by the Chicago gangs responsible for most of the gun violence in that city.

But don’t bother asking the president about it.

Were Katie Couric’s Shady Guns Actually Destroyed By Police?,"The new claim by Katie Couric’s documentary producer Stephanie Soechtig that guns she arranged to purchase in Arizona have been destroyed is in conflict with Arizona law that protects such public property once it is turned over to police.

In a frantic effort to cover her tracks and “make good” on a failed attempt to paint gun owners in an ignorant light, Couric and her producer Stephanie Soechtig and team have apparently committed conspiracy and multiple federal felonies. Buying firearms privately without paperwork or background checks across state lines violates federal statute (18 USC §922 et seq.). Private sales among law-abiding resident adults within a state such as Arizona are perfectly legal under most conditions since no criminal activity is involved. Couric’s team reportedly came from outside the state to commit the acts. Some observers believe the laws Couric could be charged under are unjust and should be repealed.

Couric’s team has now claimed the firearms they bought, with videotape evidence of the purchase (the exact number of guns purchased is now disputed by the team’s own changing accounts), have been destroyed by police. The generic term “police” could refer to numerous state and federal agencies, which have not been clearly identified. But it would appear impossible for these firearms to have been destroyed, as Couric’s team claims.

For one thing, no agency in Arizona operates that swiftly. This appears to be simply a fantasy of left-wing gun hatred—instantaneous destruction of things they don’t like, as if pestilence is upon the land and authorities can somehow step in and simply eradicate it. Police don’t track and notify anyone of such actions.

As a practical matter, Arizona authorities gather firearms they receive, hold them in a property office, and through a long, deliberate court-involved process decide what the proper disposition of the goods should be. When firearms are in useable condition, they are very often recycled and used by the agency that received them. The Bushmaster rifle Couric’s team obtained, highly prized by police (though vilified in Couric’s report) is a candidate for salvation.

In this case, however, the relinquished guns are evidence in possible felony offenses, so it defies credulity and common sense to assume they were simply destroyed because Couric or her producer would like them to be, as they have claimed they are.

But it gets worse than speculation for the beleaguered filmmakers, whose falsified “documentary” has besmirched their reputations and hurt journalistic credibility in general following the original story broken by the AmmoLand.com website with evidence from the Virginia Citizens Defense League.

Objecting to the wanton destruction of expensive public property, which firearms become once they fall into officials’ hands, Arizona enacted legislation in 2013 to prevent exactly this sort of counterproductive behavior and loss of assets.

In the law commonly referred to as the Protection of Firearms in Official Custody act, property was redefined to include any guns that might come into officials’ possession for any reason. According to The Arizona Gun Owner’s Guide (26th Edition), they must be safely kept, honestly valued, and handled only as defined by law. If officials take a gun from you, they must give you a detailed receipt, including how to retrieve it. Couric and her team would have gotten such receipts and instructions, or something is amiss, including their statements about destruction. This calls for further investigation of both the receiving agency and Couric’s team.

If a gun that is legal to own and worth more than $150 is found and the owner is not known, a description of it must be publicly posted or published. It’s not clear if these firearms—contraband if they were indeed bought illegally—would be classified as “found” by police. If a found gun is unclaimed after 30 days, the gun can be sold to a licensed firearm dealer for resale to the public, or a law-enforcement agency can trade it to a licensed dealer for anything it needs for its own work.

In a sale, the money goes to the general fund. In a trade, the police get the goods. Either way, the firearms become available to the public through FBI background-checked sales, not melted down or ground into dust. See Arizona Revised Statutes §12-940 et seq. and §13-3108 for the statutes.

Firearms acquired by various agencies, a public asset in the hands of our government servants, can no longer be destroyed, under this law carefully amended to prevent ongoing abuse of constitutionally protected property.

As a result, Couric’s and Soechtig’s troubles may have only just begun.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/07/were-katie-courics-shady-guns-actually-destroyed-by-police/,2016-06-07
Assault Weapons Ban: A Dumb Idea Pushed By Dumb People,"It happens like clock work: as soon as there’s a mere whisper of a terrorist attack or a mass shooting, the usual suspects kick in to high gear. Their destination is always the same: a faraway land where a so-called assault weapons ban magically eliminates not only guns but also prevents guns from walking of their own volition, without need of human agency, into crowded places and killing people.

The reaction after the terrorist attack in Orlando, in which a radical Islamist who pledged allegiance to ISIS murdered at least 49 people in a packed night club, was as predictable as it was pathetic.

These shootings are a regular occurrence. You don't get to be ""shocked"" anymore unless you take action to stop them. Ban automatic weapons.



Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016

Prayers are not enough. Time for a ban on automatic weapons. There is only one reason they exist and that is to kill our fellow man.



Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) June 12, 2016

BBC just said the gun used in the shooting can ""fire 700 rounds per minute.""



Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) June 12, 2016

Set aside for the moment the fact that no automatic weapons were used in the Orlando terrorist attack (an automatic weapon is one for which a single trigger pull will fire multiple bullets), and that it is literally impossible for a semi-automatic weapon to fire 700 rounds per minute. Nor, to my knowledge, have automatic weapons ever been used in a mass shooting in the modern era.

When silly people like Seth MacFarlane and Susan Sarandon say they want to ban “automatic weapons,” what they mean is that they want to ban guns that look scary. They don’t understand that you can’t walk into a gun store and walk out with a military-style assault weapon (one that can fire multiple rounds with a single trigger pull). That’s because 1) most gun dealers don’t carry the military version of the scary looking gun, 2) you have to jump through an obscene number of hoops with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to even obtain a tax stamp that says you may purchase such a weapon (a process that takes months, if not years), and 3) the actual versions of rifles used by the military are really expensive and unaffordable for the vast majority of prospective gun owners.

What you can buy from your local gun dealer, after that licensed gun dealer has confirmed that you passed a federal background check (yep, that’s required by existing law), is a semi-automatic rifle. And now, a bunch of gun controllers who don’t understand the slightest thing about guns have decided that rifle needs to be banned. Not because it’s more deadly than a typical hunting rifle (it’s absolutely not), but because it looks scarier.

Repeat after me: Owning a deadly assault weapon is not a second amendment right.

Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) June 13, 2016

But before we dive into whether the assault weapons ban was merely dumb, or if it was monumentally stupid and counterproductive, it’s important to define what the previous federal ban covered and how it defined an “assault weapon.” The 1994 assault weapons law banned semi-automatic rifles only if they had any two of the following five features in addition to a detachable magazine: a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor, or a grenade launcher.

That’s it. Not one of those cosmetic features has anything whatsoever to do with how or what a gun fires. Note that under the 1994 law, the mere existence of a bayonet lug, not even the bayonet itself, somehow turned a garden-variety rifle into a bloodthirsty killing machine. Guns with fixed stocks? Very safe. But guns where a stock has more than one position? Obviously they’re murder factories. A rifle with both a bayonet lug and a collapsible stock? Perish the thought.

A collapsible stock does not make a rifle more deadly. Nor does a pistol grip. Nor does a bayonet mount. Nor does a flash suppressor. And for heaven’s sake, good luck finding, let alone purchasing, 40mm explosive grenades for your rifle-mounted grenade launcher (and remember: the grenade launcher itself is fine, just as long as you don’t put the ultra-deadly bayonet lug anywhere near it).

The complete unfamiliarity with guns and how they work that led to the inept definitions in the 1994 law was on full display in a now-infamous television interview with Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a New York congresswoman who backed the so-called assault weapons ban. In the interview, Tucker Carlson asked McCarthy to define “barrel shroud,” a firearm feature regulated by the law. Here’s how she answered:

CARLSON: I read the legislation and it said that it would regulate “barrel shrouds.” What’s a barrel shroud and why should we regulate that?



MCCARTHY:The guns that were chosen back in those days were basically the guns that most gangs and criminals were using to kill our police officers. I’m not saying it was the best bill, but that was they could get out at that particular time.



CARLSON: Ok. Do you know what a barrel shroud is?



MCCARTHY: I actually don’t know what a barrel shroud is. I think it’s the shoulder thing that goes up.”

“The shoulder thing that goes up.” It’s not the “shoulder thing that goes up.” There is no “shoulder thing that goes up.” The “barrel shroud” (a term nobody uses) is simply a hand guard that goes around a barrel. That embarrassing spectacle happened over seven years ago, and yet over that period of time, McCarthy’s fellow gun banners still haven’t seen fit to learn the slightest thing about the objects they wish to regulate.

If the cosmetic features used to define an “assault weapon” in the 1994 law strike you as really stupid ways to define an “assault weapon,” it’s because the 1994 law was a stupid law with stupid definitions written by stupid people. And not only was it a stupid law, it was a stupid law that didn’t even accomplish its stated goal. How do we know? Because today, more than a decade after the law’s expiration, the number of people murdered by rifles is 36 percent lower than it was during the last full year the assault weapons ban was in effect.

The law expired in September of 2004, making 2003 the last full calendar year in which the law was in effect. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) crime statistics, 390 people were murdered with rifles in 2003, making rifles the weapon of choice in 2.7 percent of murders that year. But in 2014, more than a decade after these vile weapons of war flooded American streets, the number of rifle murders surely skyrocketed, right?

Not so much. Quite the opposite. In 2014, the most recent year for which detailed FBI data are available, rifles were used in 248 murders. And not only are rifles used in far fewer murders over a decade following the expiration of the 1994 gun ban, they’re also used in a smaller percentage of homicides. In 2003, when the gun ban was in full effect, rifles were used in nearly 3 percent of murders. In 2014, they were used in barely 2 percent.

That’s the exact opposite of what gun banners said should happen. After the assault weapons ban, guns were supposed to flood the streets and just start killing people. Crime was supposed to skyrocket. But that’s not what happened. Yes, Americans bought a ton of rifles after the law expired, but rather than going up, the number of homicides in which rifles were used drastically fell. There were way more guns, but way less crime.

Are you ready for a mind-blowing statistic? In 2014, you were six times more likely to be murdered with a knife than you were with a rifle. Knives were the weapon of choice in 1,567 murders in 2014, according to the FBI. It gets crazier. You were also nearly three times more likely to be killed by someone’s fists or feet than you were to be murdered with a rifle. In 2014, 660 people were murdered with what the FBI calls “personal weapons”–hands, fists, feet–compared to 248 with rifles.

In the United States, knives are more deadly than rifles. So are fists. And feet. This is not my opinion. It is an incontrovertible fact. And it’s a fact that highlights a point that far too many people refuse to acknowledge: the human desire to kill is far more deadly than any weapon. Weapons do not of their own volition and agency decide to kill people. That requires human intervention. Humans hell-bent on death and destruction will get their hands on whatever tools they need to wreak their desired havoc. Restricting the use of those tools by innocent people who only want to protect themselves and their families is delusional madness.

Yet here we are. Rather than blaming individuals and ideologies, the leading lights of American society have decided to demonize inanimate objects. Despite the fact that the terrorist in Orlando was a radical jihadi who pledged allegiance to ISIS, progressives have decided to blame the NRA for what happened. Even though the terrorist was registered to vote as a Democrat, his fellow Democrats have decided that Republicans are the true culprits.

This is apparently how 2016 is going to go. If a boy tells you he’s a girl, then he’s a girl. If an Islamic terrorist who pledges allegiance to ISIS tells you he’s killing for Allah, then he’s probably a Republican with a lifetime NRA membership. After all, Islamic terrorists don’t kill people; peaceful, law-abiding citizens who believe the Second Amendment means what it says kill people.

Collective leftist denial about the existential, radical Islamic threat facing America is not going to prevent Islamic terrorism. Gun bans that ban guns based on nothing more than scary-looking cosmetic features are not going to prevent radical jihadis from murdering innocent people. Pretending that Republicans and the NRA are the real villains is not going to prevent ISIS from killing more Americans. Ignoring the fact that these attacks seem to only happen in gun-free zones won’t prevent violent psychopaths from waltzing into those gun-free zones and gunning down the unarmed civilians who congregate there.

But all those things will make progressives feel better about themselves, and who are you to deny them that right?

Gay People Respond To Gun Controllers,"In the wake of the Orlando terrorist attack, the worst strike on U.S. soil since 9/11, gay activists are speaking out about why gun control prevents LGBTQ people from protecting themselves.

The Pink Pistols, a gay-friendly shooting club with dozens of chapters nationwide, released a statement on Sunday condemning the knee-jerk gun control efforts many public figures pushed for in the aftermath of the attack at a gay nightclub.

The Pink Pistols gives condolences to all family and friends of those killed and injured at Pulse. This is exactly the kind of heinous act that justifies our existence. At such a time of tragedy, let us not reach for the low-hanging fruit of blaming the killer’s guns. Let us stay focused on the fact that someone hated gay people so much they were ready to kill or injure so many. A human being did this. The human being’s tools are unimportant when compared to the bleakness of that person’s soul. I say again, GUNS did not do this.

The Pink Pistols helps LGBTQ people arm themselves.

“We teach queers to shoot. Then we teach others that we have done so,” their website states.

Armed queers don’t get bashed. We change the public perception of the sexual minorities, such that those who have in the past perceived them as safe targets for violence and hateful acts — beatings, assaults, rapes, murders — will realize that that now, a segment of the sexual minority population is now armed and effective with those arms. Those arms are also concealed, so they do not know which ones are safe to attack, and which are not…which they can harm as they have in the past, and which may draw a weapon and fight back.

As The Federalist reported, openly gay individuals have been on the forefront of the gun-rights cause in Washington DC. The last three major gun-rights victories in the nation’s capitol have been fought and won by gay people.

A gay man who carries a gun for protection penned an editorial for the New York Daily News urging other gay people to arm themselves.

“Legally designated gun-free zones are invitations to killers,” wrote Tom G. Palmer, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, in the editorial published on Monday. “They get to rack up kills among defenseless victims without any effective opposition. There is a reason that they seek out such places: Everyone has been disarmed and rendered defenseless by the gun-control movement.”

Palmer was also the plaintiff in the Heller case and the Palmer case, both of which affirmed the Second Amendment right to bear arms.

“If there had been armed people with concealed carry permits inside the Pulse nightclub, the zealot who had pledged allegiance to ISIS could have been stopped. Dozens of lives could have been saved,” he wrote.

6 Things To Know About Tying Gun Sales To A Watch List,"Americans must resist calls from the Left and the Right to curtail individual freedoms in reaction to the atrocity at Orlando gay nightclub Pulse. Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton is urging us to “get back to the spirit of 9/12.” Democrats on Capitol Hill are reviving their defeated gun sales watch list, and they’ve got an enthusiastic ally in Republican Party candidate Donald Trump.

Here’s what you need to know to stand up to this attack on our civil liberties.

1. Neither the no-fly list nor the terrorist watch list were meant to adjudicate individual rights.

The no-fly list and the terrorist watch list are tools to evaluate and monitor security threats at the investigative stage. They are not good vehicles for adjudicating individual rights, as they utterly lack the procedural safeguards Americans are owed from their government.

In due process terms, these lists and their administration lack notice, an opportunity to respond, and finality. The government is not obligated to inform you that you’ve been put on these lists and consequently stripped of some of your rights. Your ability to challenge your inclusion—should you even find out, of course—is also limited. Further, there are no rules in place to prevent a nameless and unknowable government bureaucrat from putting you back on either list even if you do successfully challenge them.

2. The Democrats are still falsely conflating the no-fly list with the terrorist watch list.

We’ve been over this before. The no-fly list is not the same thing as the terrorist watch list. The no-fly has roughly 40,000 names on it and many of them are not the names of U.S. citizens. By contrast, the terrorist watch list has more than a million names on it (we can’t know the actual number). The legislation Democrats are pushing relies on a definition similar, but not identical, to the one used to create the terrorist watch list on a rolling basis. It has nothing to do with the no-fly list. That won’t stop Democrats from conflating the two intentionally (as an aide to Sen. Diane Feinstein admitted she does), nor will it stop ignorant journalists from confusing them accidentally (as several have conceded to me they have).

3. The Democrat’s proposed gun sales ban list has all of the infirmities of the no-fly and terrorist watch lists.

The Democrats are pushing legislation to create a secret anti-gun list run by bureaucrats whose job has nothing to do with looking out for your interests. The government does not have to tell you that you’re on the list, even if you are denied authorization to purchase a firearm. The opportunity to challenge inclusion is sharply limited. You can be added to the list at the whim of hundreds of faceless bureaucrats without judicial oversight. And the legislation intentionally avoids finality.

In the name of national security, naturally, these same bureaucrats may add or remove you from the list as they please. This is an obvious violation of due process as protected by the Fifth Amendment, something even the compromised American Civil Liberties Union admits.

4. Even if the Democrats’ proposed gun sales ban list had been made law, it would not have stopped the Orlando attack.

As frequently seems to be the case, political reaction to terrorism does not seem tailored to prevent terrorism. Pulse shooter Omar Mateen was placed on the terrorist watch list in 2013 and 2014. The FBI investigated him and, after determining that he did not have ties to terrorism, took him off the list. The terrorist watch list uses almost the same definition as the Democrats’ proposed gun sales ban list. So even if the Democrats’ proposed solution been enacted, it would not have stopped Mateen from purchasing the firearms that he used to kill at least 49 people and radically alter the lives of hundreds more.

5. Hillary Clinton’s ‘Spirit of 9/12’ is the specter of pervasive government surveillance.

It is true that in the shocked days after 9/11, the two major sides of American politics came together for a brief moment. But their response went too far. During this period of unity, Congress authorized an indefinite military action in Southwest Asia that almost 15 years later stretches across the Middle East and into Africa with no end in sight.

During this period of unity, Clinton and 97 other senators came together to pass the USA PATRIOT Act, which established a surveillance regime that took civil libertarians more than a decade to dismantle. In light of these previous terrorism overreactions, the burden is on the individuals demanding that we do something (anything!) to demonstrate that their proposals are reasonable and include responsible safeguards for constitutionally protected rights.

6. Democrats’ response to terrorism looks exactly like their last call for gun control.

It is no vice to want to respond forcefully to terrorist attacks. But in this case the response looks exactly like the Democrats’ last call for gun control. In the months since they last pushed this legislation, the Democrats have not granted even for a second that the due process concerns that defeated it last time are reasonable.

This strongly suggests that the Democrats do not have the due process rights of Americans in mind in this legislation. One can reasonably wonder why the Democrats’ response to terrorism seems to set its sights on something other than terrorism.

Seth MacFarlane Can’t Read Charts About Gun Ownership,"In the aftermath of the brutal Orlando terrorist attack, comedian Seth MacFarlane—the fellow behind the talking teddy bear movie and the creepy song about women’s breasts—tried and failed to make a point about private gun ownership. After claiming that we need to “ban automatic weapons,” MacFarlane tweeted out two charts to seemingly make the case for gun confiscation:

(2/2) …is cross-referenced with this data, it's pretty damning. pic.twitter.com/k3MqcfXQtc



— Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016



These tweets generated quite a big reaction, but the data they cite are not, in fact, “damning;” they’re not even purgatorial. To understand why, one simply has to compare the two charts, notice what is different between them, and also note the clever, if profoundly dishonest, sleight of hand in which MacFarlane engaged.

The first chart, which simply measures the rate of privately owned guns per 100 people, contains a large number of disparate countries from many different regions and continents. The second chart, in contrast, measures that data alongside gun-related deaths per 100,000 people. MacFarlane was trying to make the case that, due to the United States’ high levels of both gun ownership and gun violence on the second chart, we have a gun violence problem tied specifically to our high rates of gun ownership.

What is easy to see, however, and what MacFarlane neglected to mention, is that the second chart does not contain data comparable to the first one: there are many less countries on the second, and they are overwhelmingly more prosperous than most of the countries on the first chart, which comes from The New York Times. Indeed, the blog Tewksbury Lab—the source of the gun violence chart—explicitly makes that clear; they labeled it “Gun Violence as a Function of Gun Ownership rates for countries with a Very High Human Development Index Score.”

In other words, MacFarlane’s chart examining gun-death rates draws from a carefully curated and deliberately selective data pool, one in which countries with “very high human development” are the norm.

Ever Heard of Apples and Oranges?

Why does this matter? Because MacFarlane’s entire thesis is destroyed when you expand the data pool to feature more countries like those on the first chart. Indeed, Tewksbury Lab—from which MacFarlane borrowed the second chart then cropped out the title to cover up his rank dishonesty—provides an additional chart that proves this to be true: within a broader data pool that compares numerous countries of varying economic development, the United States still has the most guns yet has nowhere near the highest amounts of gun-related deaths.

MacFarlane’s effort to correlate gun ownership and gun violence is reputed by his own data sources.

Indeed, the countries in question with the highest rates of gun-related deaths—El Salvador, Honduras, Swaziland, Jamaica, Guatemala—all have overwhelmingly lower rates of gun ownership than the United States does. This means MacFarlane’s effort to correlate gun ownership and gun violence is reputed by his own data sources.

To be fair, the fellow who runs Tewskbury Lab, Joshua Tewksbury, feels the same way as MacFarlane, drawing a positive correlation between gun ownership and gun violence, “all other things being equal,” i.e., in countries of similar wealth and prosperity.

This is a favorite tactic of gun controllers, who prefer to compare gun violence rates only among “developed” countries while dismissing the contradictory data from undeveloped ones.

But as Ryan McMaken of the Mises Institute has pointed out, there is actually no good reason to restrict one’s comparative data pools in such a way (unless one is assuming that people in underdeveloped countries are mere brutal savages who simply can’t help but murder each other with firearms). Comparing countries in data pools outside the narrowly-restricted ones gun controllers favor actually yields excellent evidence that gun ownership and gun control both have no effect on rates of gun violence.

But MacFarlane couldn’t be bothered to engage the real-world data in such a fashion. It got in the way of his uninformed, slapdash opinion, and he probably wouldn’t have gotten nearly as many retweets.

The fight for gun rights has always been difficult, mostly because of con artists like MacFarlane. But gun rights activists have both the moral and empirical high ground regaring this precious civil right. The worst thing we could do would be to allow washed-up Hollywood charlatans to hijack the debate in a way that obscures the real facts of the matter.

"If Firing An AR-15 Scares You, Maybe You’re A Sissy","The horrific terrorist attack in Orlando has inspired a lot of commentary from the punditry, but the most outlandish thus far has to be Gersh Kuntzman’s personal account in the New York Daily News of handling and firing an AR-15 at a Philadelphia shooting range. Kuntzman wanted to shoot the rifle “to better understand the firepower of military-style assault weapons and, hopefully, explain their appeal to gun lovers.”

This is actually a rather commendable exercise: instead of merely pontificating about a firearm, Kuntzman undertook to use one, test it out, and understand it. Yet Kuntzman did not find the experience to his liking: “mostly,” he writes, “I was just terrified.”

What follows reads less like a journalistic exposé and more like a Civil War battlefield diary written by a terrified 17-year-old conscript. Firing the AR-15, Kuntzman writes, was “humbling and deafening”; the recoil “bruised [his] shoulder”; the shell casings “disoriented” him; the “smell of sulfur and destruction” made him “sick”; the “explosions” (which were “loud like a bomb”) gave him “a temporary form of PTSD.” For a long while after firing the gun, he was “anxious and irritable.” Firing the AR-15, he wrote, “felt…like a bazooka.”

In a follow-up column, Kuntzman reiterated: the “sheer power” of the AR-15 was “horrifying.” The noise produced by the gun was “deafening,” “anxiety provoking.” After firing the gun, he was “irritable and jittery.” The weapon “scared the crap out of [him],” and moreover, “It should scare the crap out of all of you, too.” Again he claims: “To me, [the AR-15] felt like a bazooka.” And he says his experience with the AR-15 “bruised [him], body and spirit.”

Here is a counter-proposal: Gersh Kuntzman is a sissy.

An Aversion to Guns Is One Thing

I do not use that word as a commentary on Kuntzman’s character or his integrity, neither of which I know much about. Nor do I use it to criticize or denigrate his masculinity; one does not need to enjoy firing a gun in order to be a man. As National Review’s Charlie Cooke points out, someone’s dislike of the shooting range is “not a reaction that deserves anyone’s opprobrium.” I wholeheartedly agree. I have friends and family who don’t like firearms—they don’t enjoy the noise, the smell, the kick of the gun—and there’s really nothing wrong with that.

Yet the sheer hyperbolic excess in which Kuntzman engages is not an example of someone who simply dislikes guns. The claim that firing a run-of-the-mill rifle at a shooting range can give a person “PTSD,” that it can make one “anxious and irritable,” that it gives one “anxiety,” that it is a “horrifying” weapon: this is not merely the position of a person who would prefer not to be at a firing range. It is, rather, the position of a grown man who has willingly and consciously chosen to be piss-in-his-pants terrified of a weapon that isn’t really that frightening.

An aversion to guns is one thing. Claiming that a .223 caliber weapon “felt like a bazooka” is another thing entirely. It shows a deliberate immaturity and an intentional desire to be comically afraid of something that is, all other things being equal, not scary.

If you can’t fire a rather commonplace small-caliber semi-automatic sporting rifle without feeling “irritable and jittery” for hours afterwards, that’s a problem with you, not with the gun.

Trying Out a Gun Once Doesn’t Mean You Know Anything

Kuntzman is not merely an intentional sissy, he is also a deeply unserious journalist who shouldn’t be commenting on firearms even apart from his comical reaction to the AR-15. He originally claimed the AR-15 was a “tactical machine gun,” an embarrassing error he ended up stealth-editing out of the piece. (He has actually stealth-edited the piece several times to cover up some embarrassing errors and statements—see the screenshot of his article as the first item below, compared with a screenshot of an earlier quote from TownHall.com.)

He also believes the Second Amendment only protects one’s right to bear arms in the context of a militia, a position that literally makes no sense at all. He asks whether we would tolerate private ownership of nuclear warheads under the Second Amendment, a question that does not even bother to engage with the legal and practical definitions of the word “arms.” He also trivializes the experience of soldiers who have spent time in battle and suffer from actual PTSD—the real kind, not the kind felt by willfully faint-hearted New York commentary writers.

If the New York Daily News can’t find a more qualified, less cowardly person to write about guns, it should cease publishing about the topic altogether. I am sure Kuntzman, for one, would prefer it that way. If he is ever again forced to reckon with the “horrifying, menacing and very, very loud” AR-15, he may start having flashbacks to the brutal few hours he spent at the Double Tap Shooting Range and Gun Shop. He might even get “irritable” again. The horror.

4 Major Problems With Gun Control Arguments,"Every mass shooting and act of terror is an opportunity for liberals to push gun control. Something must be done to stop gun violence, but there are four problems with the liberal argument for gun control. These are: (1) hypocrisy; (2) reality; (3) misapplication of blame; and (4) discrimination. In the end, there is a better, more reasonable solution.

1. Gun Control Hypocrisy

Gun control contains three types of hypocrisy. The first is the contradiction of protection (value of human life), the second is the contradiction of solution (terrorism and criminals), and the third is the contradiction of right-control.

The argument for gun control is, essentially: human life is valuable, killing humans is wrong, guns kill humans, so, limit access to guns to protect human life. Liberals’ wish to protect human life, however, does not apply to everyone, since under their policies some life is not valuable, like those of the preborn.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said whether a baby in the womb is human doesn’t have anything to do with policy. To win over pro-abortion women, Hillary Clinton said the Constitution does not protect the unborn. Liberal policy is to ignore the value of some life to advance a perceived “right” to attain votes.

When society arbitrarily dictates which life has value, it does two things: (1) fosters a culture where not all human life has value, so some humans can be discarded or treated less than others, to the point of killing them; and (2) says humans can arbitrarily decide which human life has value. So, aborting some (preborn) is warranted and morally acceptable because they do not have value, while aborting others (born) is unwarranted and immoral because they have value.

It’s contradictory to argue that access to an instrument (guns) should be limited because a class of people (born) have value, but simultaneously that access to other instruments (vacuum, uterine currette, syringe, embryotomy scissors, Dubois embryotomy decapitating scissors) should not be limited because a class of people (preborn) have no value.

The second problem is the contradiction of solutions. The liberal answer for defeating violent extremism (i.e., radical Islamic terrorism) is jobs and social programs. Vice President Joe Biden, at a three-day White House summit on terrorism, opened by stating societies must provide economic alternatives to terrorism. Marie Harf, a spokeswoman for the State Department, told Chris Mathews on “Hardball” that we must counter terrorism by providing job opportunities. In February 2015, President Obama’s framework for fighting violent extremism was education, jobs, and social programs. So if the root cause of violence and the solution to violent extremism overseas is job opportunities, education, and social programs, it should be the political solution to violence in America. Not gun control.

Third, liberals ensure Americans that government control of guns is not a restriction on Second-Amendment rights. This is a contradiction in right-control.

When Hillary spoke this year at the Hartford Connecticut YMCA, she said that as president she would change the “gun culture,” and could do this consistent with the Second Amendment. Liberals wouldn’t tolerate language like, “As president I would change the death culture, controlling abortion consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment,” or, “As president I would change discrimination toward women by limiting access to pornography.” When some states or organizations want to change the “death culture” or “porn culture” consistent with the Fourteenth or First Amendments, liberals accuse them of sending America back to the Stone Age, and Planned Parenthood or the ACLU sues.

2. Gun Control Doesn’t Respond to Reality

Some want to turn what’s illegal into a right (e.g., drugs, prostitution, or illegal immigration) or argue that decriminalizing certain things (e.g. drugs or prostitution) lessens crimes. About guns, however, the argument is the opposite. Either it’s viewed as a “right” not to protect or argued that criminalizing it would lessen crimes.

Making guns illegal or restricting access to them won’t end gun violence. By analogy, possession and use of many controlled substances is illegal, yet people possess and use them. Indeed, illegal drug overdose is the leading cause of death in America (a study released by the Drug Enforcement Agency found that overdose death is the leading cause of injury death in the United States, over vehicles and firearms).

Obama has used Australia and England as lofty examples of Western societies ending gun violence. However, depending on the study cited, there is no clear and convincing evidence that gun homicides in Australia have declined since the ban on certain weapons and their buyback plan (National Firearms Agreement). Studies do agree that suicide rates have declined.

The Associated Press, though, says criminologists agree the National Firearms Agreement has reduced gun homicides. Results following England’s self-proclaimed “toughest gun control laws in the world” are known and are not good; crimes using banned weapons have risen. At a glance, gun control in Australia (which doesn’t have a Bill of Rights), seems to have decreased gun violence; yet, it depends on the studies. In reality, however, prohibiting an act or an object does not necessarily reduce crime or violence.

3. Gun Control Misapplies Blame

Journalists and many politicians blame guns, mental illness, or some other thing when a shooting occurs. Although mental illness could be a contributing factor, it is not the cause. After Columbine, the media also blamed Marilyn Manson. Manson’s response was twofold: (1) times have not become more violent, just more televised and (2) the blame for the shootings is not music but us: “When it comes down to who’s to blame for the high school murders in Littleton, Colorado, throw a rock and you’ll hit someone who’s guilty.”

Violence is not something new to this world. Before guns there was violence and mass killings. What has changed is the mass production of violence and its glamorization. Movies and video games romanticize violence or make it grotesque, desensitizing the conscious and natural disdain towards it. When the heart becomes numb to violence and taught to act on passions, a violent reaction will occur when someone decides to act. As Jesus said, it is not what is put into the mouth that defiles a man, but what comes out of the heart. Blame falls not on the instrument, but on us as individuals for defiling our hearts.

4. Gun Control Is Discriminatory

The Contradiction of Protection above leads to discrimination. Advocating for laws to protect one group while disregarding the rights of another is discrimination. A country having gone through a Civil War that nearly ripped it apart once treated blacks as property and women as second-class citizens. It still treats babies and women as property and babies as second-class. It is discrimination to say Germans should live but not Jews, whites should live but not blacks, the born should live but not the preborn.

It’s a utilitarian worldview centered on the self to discriminately apply the Constitution or natural rights on only certain groups so the majority within a protected class can live in harmony. Selfishness of rights breeds violence. We think ourselves advanced, caring, and tolerant, but still foster discrimination and violence towards certain groups when advocating for laws that protect one class over another. Advocating for gun control while advocating for abortion and pornography is utilitarian selfishness, based on the premise that the preborn and women can be discriminated against while appearing altruistic.

What We Should Do Instead

First, foster a culture of respect for all human life, from conception to natural death. Also, in response to mass shootings, the response should be focused on the shooter’s depraved heart and the religion or philosophy that drives him, not on the instrument used to kill. Individuals must start to control what comes into the heart, and society must root itself in virtue, the Commandments, the Beatitudes, and spirituality.

School education needs to include moral and ethical principles founded on the natural law. Last, offering free classes on firearm safety will teach responsible use of firearms, decreasing its glamorization. Wars and crimes will never be eradicated, but violence can be substantially reduced.

Democrats Tanked Gun Control To Up Their Election Chances,"On Monday evening, Senate Democrats put party over principle in rejecting common-sense, reasonable gun control measures. After the mass murder at Orlando gay club Pulse, Sen. Chris Murphy and his colleagues staged a flashy talk-a-thon in which they demanded that votes be taken on legislation strengthening gun control laws. The Senate Republicans agreed to the Democrats’ demand. Democrats got what they asked for, then blew it.

Senate Republicans agreed to vote on four gun control proposals—two offered by Democrats and two offered by Republicans. The Democratic proposals included Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s bill linking a terrorism watch list to a gun sales ban. On the Republican side, Sen. John Cornyn also offered legislation that would link a terrorism watch list to a gun sales ban, but his version added due process protections for Americans who are put on the list. The other two proposals expanded the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, although the Republican version did not go as far as the Democratic version. For a brief moment it seemed as if the Senate would take some kind of action.

Then all four gun control proposals were voted down because of the Democrats.

Rather than agree to the incremental gun control measures Republicans proposed, the Democrats chose to pass no gun control legislation at all. At some point after loudly demanding legislation for more than a week, Senate Democrats decided it would be better for their reelection prospects that no gun control bills pass the Senate during the election season. Their decision was hypocritical, unprincipled, and pure politics.

Republicans were willing to link the terrorism watch list to a gun sales ban, as Democrats have demanded. The price of agreement was due-process protections for Americans placed on the list. But apparently due process is too much for the Democrats. They would rather have no sales ban than a sales ban that comports with the Fifth Amendment. The Democrats similarly rejected an incremental expansion of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Apparently, some gun control is not worth sharing credit with the Republicans.

Not content to merely vote against incremental gun control, Senate Democrats then decided to throw a tantrum about it. Murphy sleazed that Senate Republicans “have decided to sell weapons to ISIS.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted her agreement. Sen. Harry Reid nonsensically accused Republicans of blocking the very gun control measures Republicans had proposed.

Make no mistake: Senate Democrats rejected two incremental gun control bills for no other reason than that Republicans were voting for them. Democrats’ hatred for Republicans was more important to them than the moral standards they claim to possess.

"America Is Awash In Guns, And Crime Is At Record Lows","Most Americans believe America is submerged beneath a tidal wave of gun violence. A Pew Research poll in 2013 found that 56 percent of Americans thought gun violence had risen in the last 20 years, 26 percent thought it had remained the same, and only 12 percent thought it had fallen. You might be surprised to learn the 12 percent were right.

The gulf between the facts about guns and the public’s perception is immense, and was created deliberately. Anti-gun advocates invent new terms (“assault weapon”) and politicians lie to win over a skeptical public. Too often these myths are swallowed by journalists and celebrities who don’t bother to check the data and don’t know how modern firearms actually work.

The myth that rising sales of semi-automatic rifles have led to rising levels of gun homicides is pervasive. “The United States has been pummeled by gun violence since the assault weapons ban expired in 2004,” read The Boston Globe’s June 16 editorial in a typically misleading statement of alarm. Although a Globe reader would reasonably conclude that the country is suffering a spike in homicides, the opposite is true. All violence, including gun violence, in America has declined dramatically for more than two decades.

Gun Ownership Up; Gun Crime Down

Using federal government data, University of Michigan and American Enterprise Institute economist Mark Perry last year measured the gun homicide rate against the number of guns per person from 1993-2013. As the number of guns per person rose from 0.94 to 1.45, the gun homicide rate fell by 49 percent, from 7 to 3.6 per 100,000 people.

Also using federal government data, the Pew Research Center reported last year that non-fatal gun victimizations have fallen from 725.3 to 174.8 per 100,000 people from 1993-2014. So all gun-related crime is falling, not just gun homicides.

The United States seems to be recovering a large chunk of the civility obliterated in the tumult of the 1960s and ’70s, suggesting (as do global historical data) that human-on-human violence is predominantly a product of culture, not technology. The U.S. homicide rate more than doubled from 1963-1973 and remained high for the next 20 years. In 1973, the rate was 9.4 per 100,000 people; in 1993 it was 9.5. Although we will need more time before we can know for sure, this spike in homicides appears to have been an historical aberration. Since 1993, the homicide rate has collapsed and it now hovers around its 1962-63 level.

In 2014, the homicide rate was 4.5 per 100,000 people, less than half the rate in 1995. The last time it was that low was 1963, when the rate was 4.6. The median age in the United States is 37, so for the average American alive today the odds of being murdered have never been lower — even though Americans possess millions more firearms than they did two decades ago when homicide rates were higher.

The Same for Rifles (‘Assault Weapons’)

What about so-called “assault weapons?” The FBI divides firearms into handguns and rifles, with the rifles category covering everything from the little .22-caliber rifles kids shoot at summer camps to the dreaded AR-15. In last year’s “Uniform Crime Report,” the FBI listed the number of homicides committed with rifles since 2010. (A few thousand homicides each year are committed with firearms of undetermined type — most likely handguns. These are numbers for confirmed rifle deaths.) The numbers are: 367 in 2010; 332 in 2011; 298 in 2012; 285 in 2013; and 248 in 2014.

This decline in confirmed homicides by rifle coincided with a massive increase in the number of “assault rifles” Americans own. From 2010-2014, sales of semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 rose 28 percent per year, the Los Angeles Times reported on June 13. So while the number of rifles in circulation was increasing dramatically, the number of confirmed murders committed by someone using a rifle fell by almost one-third. During the same time, the number of homicides committed with handguns fell by 9 percent.

The data produce one inescapable conclusion: The entire premise for a new “assault weapons” ban — that the proliferation of “assault weapons” has led to unprecedented carnage — is completely untrue. Yes, the United States is a particularly violent Western country. But blaming this on America’s love of guns is simplistic and wrong. The homicide rate in the United States does not track neatly with the gun ownership rate.

When searching for ways to reduce homicides in the United States, it would be more helpful to discuss America’s macho culture or America’s violent culture than America’s “gun culture.” That is, if your goal really is to make America a more peaceful place. If your goal is simply to win elections by scaring the public, then you would be talking like Sens. Harry Reid and Chris Murphy.

Imagine: Liberal Bias At A Major Journalism Conference,"In June, I had the honor of attending one of the top journalism conferences in the country, if not the world. For three days, I rubbed shoulders with reporters from places such as The New York Times, USA Today, and ProPublica.

Call me naïve, but I expected to learn about fairness, integrity, and hard work. This means giving equal weight to politically divisive issues such as gun rights, women’s health, and policing. Instead, during some training sessions I watched top professionals in their fields encouraging political bias against conservatives before reporters’ pens could even hit paper.

Bias at a lefty news organization would be expected, and the same for those on the Right. (For full transparency, I am employed at a news organization that is openly affiliated with the conservative Heritage Foundation.) But to preach political bias at a conference that represents the gold standard in journalism is alarming, and is something that we, as journalists, have a duty to address.

The purpose of the 2016 Investigative Reporters and Editors conference was to share investigative journalism tips and tricks from one reporter to another. The concept behind the conference is selfless: fellow journalists openly share their most successful secrets so we competitors in the field can come together for the greater cause. Attendees could choose from more than 100 sessions with hundreds of speakers representing a diversity of topics.

To be clear, only a select few appeared politically charged. But those that were reflect a dangerous outlook for the future of journalism, and it’s time they were called out.

Two panels in particular caught my attention. The first was called “How to investigate the war on women’s health.”

The ‘War on Women’s Health’

“How to investigate the war on women’s health” is described publicly online as such:

How to investigate the war on women’s health

Speakers: Hannah Levintova (Mother Jones), Molly Redden (The Guardian US, formerly Mother Jones), Nina Martin (ProPublica)



**Moderated by Marianne Szegedy-Maszak, Mother Jones



In the first quarter of 2016, state lawmakers introduced more than 1,000 restrictions on sexual and reproductive health—more than 400 related to abortion alone. This election season, this conflict will rage on and will touch millions of lives. That’s why this realm is ripe for investigative reporting. A panel of reporters and editors who cover this beat will offer advice on how to dig deeper on reproductive rights. They’ll discuss intersections with other beats, the unique challenges of interviewing sources on either side of a stark ideological divide, and best practices for researching the major players involved—the donors, lobbyists, scientists, and politicians.

For starters, “The war on women’s health” has no basis in fact. The language assumes lawmakers deliberately aim to harm women, which is an extremely bad-faith assumption. There is no proof of this malevolent design, either. Further, according to a May 2016 Rasmussen poll, only 25 percent of likely U.S. voters believe a “war on women” even exists. Yet a top journalism nonprofit organization adopts this language and uses it to teach young journalists how to cover the area of women’s health. Then, organizers of the conference extended panelist invitations only to journalists from outlets such as Mother Jones who unabashedly support this premise.

This is deeply troubling for a number of reasons. Conference organizers could have chosen any issue in the world to train and equip young journalists to cover. The ones that they do pick send the message to reporters and editors in newsrooms nationwide: these are the issues that are worth your time.

One might ask, if we’re training young reporters to investigate “abortion restrictions,” might they also investigate “abortion safety”? And what about the other “millions of lives” that will be lost due to abortion? Are those lives not worth investigating?

I don’t mean to discredit the important work that Mother Jones, The Guardian, and ProPublica have done in the area of women’s health. But in assembling this panel, IRE sends the message that only one political view of women’s health care matters. Only one side of women’s health care is worth investigating. In a country where only 29 percent of Americans believe abortion should be legal under any circumstances, that message seems a bit unfair.

In May 2013, Kermit Gosnell, an abortionist who operated a late-term abortion clinic in West Philadelphia, was convicted of first-degree murder for killing multiple babies who were accidently born alive during the procedures (by “snipping” their necks with scissors, no less). He was also found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for leaving a 41-year-old refugee, Karnamaya Mongar, lying on an abortion table to die. For these charges, and many more, Gosnell is now serving a life sentence.

The media greatly failed in their duty to investigate or even report on this case, where baby body parts were routinely shoved down the garbage disposal “to the point where they plunged it one day and an arm popped out.” This failure is generally accepted by media on both sides of the aisle as fact.

After attending this conference, it became clear to me how we missed such an atrocity. It made me reflect on what kind of responsibility we—as journalists and editors—bear for allowing these atrocities to happen sometimes, not even behind our backs.

Reporting on Guns

The second panel that failed to encourage the best journalism practices was called “Reporting on guns.” The description, according to the IRE website, is as follows:

Reporting on guns



Speakers: Lois Beckett (ProPublica), Ben Hallman (Huffington Post), Mike McLively (Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence), Jonathan Bullington (The Times-Picayune)



**Moderated by Matt Drange, Forbes



With more guns than people in the U.S., you’d think there would be an army of journalists covering every aspect of guns, from gun violence to the business of guns to gun policy and everything in between. The reality is, there are precious few journalism resources dedicated to consistent coverage of guns. Most newsrooms only get involved when there’s a mass shooting. Come hear from some of the best in the business as we talk about how to cover guns and highlight recent in-depth reporting on them. We aim to send you back to your newsroom with story ideas you can execute right away, along with resources you can use for the long haul.

In this case, the problem wasn’t with the premise of the panel, but rather, the journalists invited to speak. Ben Hallman is a former senior editor at The Huffington Post and current deputy editor for The Trace, a nonprofit news organization funded by the the Joyce Foundation and the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund (a gun-control advocacy group that seeks to “unseat politicians who do the NRA’s bidding”). Browsing The Trace and Hallman’s present and past portfolio, it’s clear he has it out for the National Rifle Association.

The NRA, like any advocacy group, deserves to be held accountable. But at a journalist conference organized by journalists, one might think that you’d find a staunch Second Amendment supporter sitting next to Hallman. Or, at least, someone who investigates the other side to the gun debate.

If an organization preaching good journalism decides to invite an advocate who represents the liberal side, that they should invite someone from the other side.

Instead, accompanying Hallman on-stage was Mike McLively from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence does some great work, but is a highly politicized organization that advocates in favor of gun-control legislation, much of which groups such as the NRA oppose.

If an organization preaching good journalism decides to invite an advocate who represents the liberal side to the gun-control debate, it should go without saying that they should invite someone from the other side. Perhaps that’s why, when watching your TV at night, it’s so easy to conclude that the majority of Americans support more gun control. But a quick Google search of the polling reveals something much different.

“While support for gun rights surpassed that of gun control in December of last year, reaching a two-decade high, it has since fallen five percentage points,” reads a 2015 Pew Research report. “Now 50 percent say it is more important to control gun ownership, just slightly more than the 47 percent who say it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns.”

During the session on guns, Lois Beckett, the panelist who most fairly represented both sides to the gun debate, asked attendees to raise their hands if they thought the media were biased against conservatives in their coverage of guns. The room went silent, with almost no one raising a hand. Beckett, shocked, asked again. Instead of raising their hands, the editors and reporters filling the room looked at one another and laughed. They laughed because they all knew there is a liberal bias, but to them, it’s funny. Nothing more.

The Future of Journalism

Before writing this article, I reached out to Mark Horvit, executive director of IRE, who did not indicate that leaders even considered inviting someone from a group such as the NRA.

If IRE truly seeks to help reporters understand these issues, the organization needs to do better at including a ‘mix of voices.’

“We sometimes add experts to sessions if they’ve done research on a topic or have information that can help the session,” Horvit said of the decision to invite advocates such as McLively, adding: “For example, we had a former police chief on a panel about policing, and we’ve had judges and elected officials speak on sessions. While such speakers almost certainly represent specific positions, the hope is that the mix of voices adds to everyone’s understanding of an issue.”

A skewed panel like the one IRE hosted in June, however, runs the risk of blinding up-and-coming journalists to an entire side of the gun debate before they even get started. If IRE truly seeks to help reporters understand these issues, the organization needs to do better at including a “mix of voices.”

For the panel addressing the so-called “war on women’s health,” Horvit admitted the title was “provocative,” but said “that is not an excuse” for any bias that occurred. “I agree that in the future, we need to look especially closely at both the focus and makeup of panels on topics that cover politically charged issues,” Horvit said, suggesting hope that next year, IRE leaders might look more critically at the panels they compose.

To close the conference, attendees had the privilege of hearing from the original Boston Globe “Spotlight” team, the group of investigative reporters and editors who uncovered the Catholic church sex abuse scandal. This meant having the honor of hearing from Marty Baron, who led the original “Spotlight” team and now serves as executive editor of The Washington Post. As he was on stage, Baron expressed frustration about the current state of journalism, where the public now gets its news from politically charged outlets that each has its own set of facts. We can’t even agree on the facts anymore, Baron lamented.

After attending this conference, I gathered the problem goes far beyond agreeing on the facts.

Why Owning Guns Is An Act Of Love,"NPR reports that modern gun-control laws were first legislated as action against African-Americans. Karen Grigsby Bates of NPR’s Code Switch team found many African-Americans believe owning guns is crucial to protecting themselves and their rights.

In 1968, The Black Panthers marched on the California statehouse with loaded weapons: “Shocked lawmakers made carrying loaded firearms illegal. And in 1968, after several urban riots, the Federal Gun Control Act was passed, which attempted to ban the sale of cheap handguns. What that did, said Robert Cottrol, a law professor at George Washington University, is to leave black residents in high-crime areas vulnerable.” Notice that the powerful made the people powerless. Injustice comes in many forms.

All people desire freedom coupled with safety to secure their homes and neighborhoods. Gun ownership by law-abiding citizens stems the tide of crime in any municipality.

People do not purchase weapons based on fear. It is those who fear gun ownership who call for gun control. The call for “responsible gun ownership” is simply twisting words of those who want to declare an “enemy” of gun owners.

I submit that gun ownership is nothing more than an act of love. Let me explain.

It demonstrates love of law. America is a nation of laws. Laws protect the responsible purchase and possession of firearms by peaceful, law-abiding citizens. David Clarke, the sheriff in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has said simply “Take advantage of your legal right to carry a firearm.”

Love of freedom. We are citizens in a nation of freedoms. Watch the commercial celebrating the freedom of a person to defend herself. What happens when someone is told to obey the law but has little protection against those who would break it? Freedom to act must go hand-in-hand with a demand for responsibility.



Love of life. If women give birth, give life, shouldn’t we care whether they can protect themselves and others? Dana Loesch gives a compelling one-minute commercial telling why moms “are freedom’s safest place.” Body guards with weapons on their person protect the lives of major politicians. Why shouldn’t the woman getting off the bus after a second-shift job in downtown Chicago have the same protection?



Love of place. “No Americans should have to face evil with empty hands” says Coloin Noir. Life is sacred. Property is to be protected. A person has a right to her place, to feel safe, to be at rest. We all love our homes, where we live. We care for property not because it is an idol but because we are its steward.



Gun ownership demonstrates love of family. David Mamet, in praising the president for making a law that gives his family lifetime protection, said “The individual is not only best qualified to provide his own personal defense, he is the only one qualified to do so.” The screenwriter and filmmaker’s point? If the president gets to protect his family, we should be able to protect ours, too. Love of family is another reason for gun ownership.

I would like my readers to hear a voice similar to those with whom I began. My African-American brother Pastor Eric Jewell Hayes Sr. maintains,

While gun ownership can be an expression of love for the culture at large, for Blacks it is also an expression of identity. It becomes a way for African-Americans to assert that they too are Americans; that they should enjoy the same privileges of other ethnicities without impediment. In a very real way, gun ownership for Blacks is saying, I’m an American, let me be an American too.

I stand with Pastor Hayes, with the voices in the NPR report, and for all those who love life, their place, their family, and their freedom. Gun ownership is an act of love.

Some will celebrate this essay, and others will be outraged. To the folks in the second group, the first group will always be willing to defend your right to your opinion.

Why People Don’t Trust Liberals To Regulate Guns,"Whenever high-profile bullets start flying, calls for new gun control measures are never far behind. In what has become our new national pastime, the tragedy in Dallas was immediately politicized, with the Left demanding more firearm regulations as the simple and “obvious” solution to the far more complicated problems of an overly-militarized police force with ineffective accountability and the violent tribalism of the “Black Lives Matter” crowd forged by the Left’s own virulent identity politics. One would think that when five police officers are murdered in apparent retaliation for the growing number of wrongful deaths at the hands of law enforcement, the types of weapons used would be irrelevant compared to defusing an escalating cycle of violence that corrodes civil society.

It was even worse a month ago in Orlando, when Internet, radio, and television were all inundated with nonsense soon after the mass shooting there. Here the reaction was even more stilted, with the U.S. Justice Department redacting the shooter’s ISIS connection and the mainstream media frantically reaching for its customary scapegoats no matter how poorly they fit the facts.

If one were to judge solely by media reports and liberals on social media, one would think an ambulatory AR-15 rifle walked into a club and killed dozens of LGBT people because it was home-schooled by conservative Christians.

These are bizarre and unreasonable responses flung about before the facts come in and people have a chance to mourn. They also set the tone for demands for “common-sense” gun regulation to prevent more untimely deaths. Progressives quickly become exasperated that anyone would resist such measures. It perplexes them that anyone could be so cruel, uncaring, and blinded by ideology to the suffering of others to refuse some simple and practical rules about who can acquire guns.

Liberals Keep Demonstrating Incompetence

So, liberals and progressives, let me lay it out plainly and clearly: One’s invocation of common sense invariably falls on deaf ears when one is uncommonly senseless. The Left’s reactions to Dallas and Orlando do not exhibit the kind of good judgment necessary for making sensible decisions about who is allowed to own which weapons.

Some want to ban what they call “assault” weapons. Now, that’s a rhetorical label rather than a meaningful term, but behind it is the wish to outlaw weapons whose design and purpose is primarily to kill large numbers of people at once. On its face, that sounds like a sensible reaction to someone killing a large number of innocent people at once. While I consider it misguided, there is a straightforward logic to the broader sentiment. That is, until the Left demonstrates the kind of gross ignorance and hyperventilating fear that makes one incapable of the sound judgment required to transform broader sentiments into practical actions.

Progressives are among the first to note that people fear the unfamiliar—the things they do not understand. That’s why they work so hard to promote understanding for those minorities the Left says are unduly feared. It’s why they have developed so many labels ending in “phobia” for those who disagree with them. Unfortunately, they’re also the first to forget that this maxim applies to themselves as well. Contrary to how they try to present themselves, progressives are not enlightened beyond the reach of such human foibles.

More often than any other subject, we probably notice liberal incompetence on matters with which they have little experience such as religion. Liberal reporters tend to report on the pious as though they were discovering a remote tribe of hunters and gatherers for the first time. But while that may be the most frequently exposed inexperience, it’s not the only one.

I’m no gun aficionado, but I understand the same is true about firearms. When reporters, politicians, and other decision- and opinion-makers get basic facts wrong like what gun was used, whether fully automatic and “military grade” weapons are readily available for civilian purchase, and so forth on a regular basis, they merely demonstrate an ignorance that should disqualify them from making sweeping decisions on which weapons should be available for everyone.

Liberal Fear Doesn’t Inspire Confidence, Either

As for the kind of overwhelming fear and terror that drive out rational thought, Gersh Kuntzman provided the quintessential example after the Orlando shooting.

I’ve shot pistols before, but never something like an AR-15. Squeeze lightly on the trigger and the resulting explosion of firepower is humbling and deafening (even with ear protection).



The recoil bruised my shoulder. The brass shell casings disoriented me as they flew past my face. The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick. The explosions — loud like a bomb — gave me a temporary case of PTSD. For at least an hour after firing the gun just a few times, I was anxious and irritable.

These are not the words of someone making a sober assessment. They are the words of someone who, as Kuntzman admits, “was just terrified.” He actually thinks firing a gun a few times gave him PTSD. Stephen Green put it well at Instapundit: “Other than the fact that Gersh Kuntzman was apparently holding the rifle incorrectly, firing it incorrectly, made an incorrect (and shameful) claim about having PTSD, was incorrect that Mateen used an AR-15 in the Orlando terror attack, and was incorrect about being able to purchase a fully automatic ‘tactical machine gun,’ this is a totally accurate piece he’s written for the Daily News.”

How are folks who practically wet themselves at a firing range going to make sensible decisions about which weapons are too dangerous to own? The more people want to pass gun laws because they got scared at the sound of popping tires, the less likely anyone is to actually trust them to do that.

Somehow You Keep Using Your Power to Target Normal People

But banning a particular set of weapons is only one side of the issue. The Left also wants to keep any dangerous weapon out of the hands of dangerous people. That also sounds very sensible at first blush—it’s why we have a fairly rigorous system of background checks in place already.

However, it seems much less reasonable once we begin to see whom the Left often deems most dangerous. When they conspicuously ignore actual motivations that don’t fit their narrative, such as the Dallas shooter’s desire to kill white people or the Orlando shooter’s pledge of loyalty to ISIS, they invariably cast blame elsewhere, and in the end, the whole prospect of letting the Left keep weapons away from dangerous people makes much less sense.

When a gunman seemingly motivated by Black Nationalism (not well-known for being a conservative ideology) targets white police officers, it’s still Republicans who are really to blame because they hold the wrong political positions. Likewise, every time a terrorist slaughters a bunch of people, liberals fall all over themselves to assure everyone that a religion characterized throughout its history by violent expansion is really a religion of peace.

Instead, liberals try to find a host of bizarre ways to somehow blame the murderous actions of a Muslim Democrat on conservatives, Christians, Second Amendment supporters, or supporters of the North Carolina bathroom bill. In light of this, it is perhaps understandable that Christians, conservative gun-owners, and Republicans think that when liberals want to take guns away from dangerous crazies, they really mean us—the law-abiding gun-owners who aren’t out shooting people, but nevertheless disagree with liberals on other issues.

Failing to Protect Us Also Doesn’t Inspire Confidence

It’s no better when we move beyond popular rhetoric into the realm of official acts. Orlando provoked many into asking why we shouldn’t use the no-fly list or the terror watch list or some other official list to enumerate who may not own a gun. Well, in addition to such lists being notorious for lacking due process because they’re the products of unaccountable bureaucrats, too many of those bureaucrats bear the same typically liberal prejudices.

The FBI was watching Omar Mateen, but decided he wasn’t a threat. The State Department shut down an investigation into his mosque because it “unfairly singled out Muslims.” This fails to inspire much confidence that public service will somehow improve on the Left’s typical ability to make good judgment calls. From liberal office holders down to the rank-and-file, the Left includes folks who think a boy’s declaration that he’s a girl really makes him a girl, yet that a boy’s repeated declarations that he’s killing people on behalf of ISIS has nothing to do with why he’s killing people. Quite frankly, we would have to be insane to let people like that decide which of us should be armed.

Our right to bear arms is guaranteed in the Constitution precisely because our founders wanted to put decisions about who is empowered to defend themselves and their liberties outside the purview of mobs, politicians, and bureaucrats whose interests in the matter run contrary to the interests of the American people. Every time a mass shooting happens, the knee-jerk reactions of the Left only prove the wisdom of that decision. If you really want to pursue reasonable gun regulations, you need to start by being reasonable in the first place.

Why It’s Consistent To Be Pro-Gun And Pro-Life,"Proponents of gun control legislation are often staunch supporters of the nebulous “right to choose” an abortion. Conversely, those who staunchly defend the right to keep and bear arms also frequently take the pro-life position. But to gun control proponents this is an untenable, even contradictory, position; “Guns kill people! They’re dangerous and deadly! Their only purpose is to kill! Yet you say you’re ‘pro-life’? You’re a hypocrite!”

Such sentiments, however, are based on logical fallacies, emotional reactions rather than rational analysis, and a misunderstanding of the role firearms play in a law-abiding society. In fact, the right to keep and bear arms and the pro-life position are entirely consistent with one another. It’s the positions of gun control proponents who are also abortion proponents that don’t match.

The nexus between the right to keep and bear arms and affirming the right to life is the sanctity of human life and the right to self-defense. Gun controllers fail to grasp, or to acknowledge, that firearms are means to ends; they are objects that possess no ability to act on their own, and have no inherent moral qualities. They cannot choose. They must be directed by human intention, and serve the ends of that intention.

A Right to Life Includes a Right to Self-Defense

As objects, they have no choice or say about how they are used. Their “purpose” is not to kill, but to shoot bullets efficiently. Given the likely billions of rounds fired each year by all firearms in all hands across the United States and the numbers of deaths due to gunshot wounds, which number in the tens of thousands, one can easily realize people put firearms to a great number of uses other than harming humans. To look at overall use, then, firearms are notoriously inefficient at killing, were that their sole “purpose.”

But human intention is paramount in using any tool or object. There are, broadly speaking, two groups of people: law-abiding and criminal. The intentions they have in employing firearms tend to be perfectly opposite. In fact, criminals intend to deprive someone of life, liberty, or property. This is the motivating force that precipitates the situation to which the law-abiding must react. Law-abiding people who are armed can then bring deadly force to stop the criminal actor.

The rights to liberty and property are meaningless in the absence of a right to life. Similarly, the right to life doesn’t matter when one is deprived of the right and means to self-defense. Firearms, generally, are the most effective means of self-defense. They are not the only ones, nor is their use always the most appropriate in a given situation. But in the hands of the law-abiding, they are importantly employed to defend the right to life.

The right to life is not, however, contingent upon self-defense; self-defense aids and abets it. One does not forfeit one’s right to life just because one lacks the means, ability, will, or awareness to defend oneself. The unborn human has a right to life, as does anyone who has not forfeited that right through criminal action and society’s legal judgment. But the unborn do not possess the means, ability, will, and awareness to defend themselves; they must be protected.

Any society that recognizes the right to keep and bear arms as legitimate means to the right of self-defense must then also recognize its obligation to defend the right to life of the helpless among us.

The right to life is mutual, and not exclusive, so long as someone doesn’t forfeit it through voluntary criminal action. You have a right to life, as do I, as do the helpless. One’s right to life does not exclude the right to life of another.

You Can’t Control Nature, But You Can Control Yourself

But what, then, to make of gun controllers, and abortionists? They argue on the one hand that they have a right “not to be killed” or to “be safe” or to “have a safe environment.” On the other hand, they also argue abortion is necessary for the healthy and happy life of the mother of the to-be-aborted child, and that she, and she alone, may choose when and if to end the life within her.

These are untenable positions. There are no rights to “safe environments.” Rights are natural to human life. They flow from nature, but depend on human volition and moral choice. It is because we can choose either evil or good that we can and must have rights. But those rights are vis-a-vis other humans only—you have no right to life from circumstance or natural action.

Will you indict a tiger, or an earthquake? Bring it up on what charges, to appear in what court? The environment will be as safe or deadly as we can make it, if we have any power to affect it. But, as noted before, the right to life is mutual, and not exclusive; and thus, also, is the right of self-defense. That being so, it cannot be the case that law-abiding actors must forfeit their right to self-defense in the (vain) pursuit of another’s “safe environment” or perception of safety.

The right to life and to self-defense implies a moral responsibility to act in the defense of one’s own life or on behalf of the helpless. This moral responsibility flows from the fact that choice and action, guided by morals, are a necessary condition of defense. It is, of necessity, a reaction to a threat, on some level.

As for a “safe environment,” there is no right to health or happiness. We are merely free to pursue them as best we can, but we are not obligated to receive either health or happiness from others, or from our environment, which are out of control of our moral choice.

But once again, the right to life is mutual, and not exclusive; nor is it dependent on means, ability, will, or awareness. The mother has no right to a healthy or happy life a) at all, and b) certainly not at the cost of another’s life, such as her unborn child’s.

No one has such rights, for they are a fiction. They cannot be guaranteed through moral action, nor against the vagaries of circumstance. Rights are the realm of law, not of medicine nor psychology. One does not have a right to be free of, say, celiac disease, or vitiligo, or depression. This reflects the inherent unfairness of life with which we must come to grips.

Thus, gun control proponents and abortion proponents seek an exclusive, non-mutual right to their lives at the expense of either unborn children’s right to life or others’ right of self-defense. The illusions of safety, health, and happiness, which they consider rights, are not; they are conditions that cannot be guaranteed or enforced through moral action. This is in stark contrast to the consistent, moral respect for life and self-defense of those who recognize the moral necessity of the right to keep and bear arms, and the protection of the unborn life.

Can’t We Mourn Police Instead Of Exploiting Their Deaths?,"Handwringing of the PC kind is a ritual exertion in my solidly Democrat town. Chappaqua is not called the Upper Upper West Side for nothing.

On July 11, our town board organized a “Community Gathering in a Time of Grief and Sorrow” to mourn victims of the Dallas shootings. It was the second such liturgy in four weeks. The first convened after the Orlando rampage. Contrast between the two was telling. The first was well-attended, self-congratulatory, even festive. The second was sparse and ambivalent.

Gun control was a subtext of both. Town dignitaries replayed Hillary’s response to the rampage in San Bernadino: “We must take action to stop gun violence now.” Mention of totalitarian Islam was inadmissible in the first gathering. Any recognition of black hostility toward whites—festering since the 1970s and detailed by David Horowitz in “Hating Whitey” (1999)—was absent in the second.

It’s Almost Out of a Clichéd Movie

The June rally began with a cantor from Temple Beth El leading the crowd in singing “Ya’asch Shalom,” a prayer for peace. A Congregational minister led “Amazing Grace,” and quoted Martin Luther King Jr. (“Hate confuses life; love harmonizes it”). Reluctant to place Omar Mateen’s murder spree in an ideological context, she crooned: “For those who decide to kill each other and cause such sorrow, I truly have a hard time believing that they have experienced love, absolute love, unconditional love.”

That Mateen had experienced Islam went unsaid. Nondenominational hate was the culprit in Orlando. Love was our shield and defender. Next day’s headline in local press read: “Love Triumphs at Chappaqua Vigil for Orlando Victims.”

Town Supervisor Robert Greenstein served the obligatory candy: “More love and less hate stands for a better tomorrow.” The crowd was encouraged to reach out lovingly to the LGBT community. Between rainbow flags and compulsory cant came calls for gun control. Listen to the lady cleric: “I pray in the aftermath of this horror we can find ways to support and honor our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer friends and neighbors while also being mindful of the cost that gun violence brings to many communities every day.”

Congresswoman Nita Lowey dispatched an envoy to convey her vow to ban guns. Undermining the Second Amendment is worth it “If it stops one person from doing something awful.”

A member of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America read a self-referential essay by an unnamed gay woman whose sense of safety Orlando had shattered: “Last night I kissed my girlfriend in public in a simple act of love and protest that straight people participate in without thought or fear.” The lament was received solemnly, as if gay discomposure were the issue at stake.

On hand to keep attention fixed on guns and gays—and prevent any awkward references to Islam—was Khusry Elley of the Upper Westchester Muslim Society and Westchester Coalition Against Islamophobia. Elley, a key figure in the BCCI money laundering scandal of the late 1980s, is an unsettling fixture at public events like this.

He is former chairman of WESPAC (Westchester People’s Action Coalition), a coven of left-wing activists. Journalist Daniel Greenfield wrote on WESPAC last year, declaring them anti-Israel and Hamas-friendly. Elley’s own blog still retains older anti-Semitic comments that a man less confident of his own immunity would have removed by now. In January, 2008, he wrote that “the Jewish lobby has gone from strength to strength” and now dictates foreign policy. A month later, he called the United States “captive to a minority with money” and added: “No one can explain to me how a great nation like the US allows itself to be dictated by a few million Jews and the Zionist nation of Israel.”

Elley has praised Sayed Qutub, the Muslim Brotherhood theorist seminal to al-Qaeda. He calls him “a man demonized by the West but his book Social Justice in Islam should be required reading for all Muslims.” The San Bernadino killers thought so, too. Qutub’s Leninist-inspired writings were found among their effects.

Yet here was Elley extricating Islam from any role in the Orlando shootings: “It appears the only crime in the eyes of the killer was the sexual orientation of the victims. We should urge our lawmakers for the harshest measures for hate crimes and take whatever measures are available to prevent such dastardly acts.”

Our local florist donated long-stemmed pink roses to the occasion. The library honored the event by placing a selection of LGBT books on a prominent display stand inside the entrance.

We Love to Talk about Blacks and Gays, But Not Police

The timbre of July’s gathering was strikingly different. It was a schizophrenic event that strained to honor five dead officers and, at the same time, bow heads for two black victims of police racism. The crowd was thinner. There were no incantations about love’s healing power, no call to reach out to men and women in law enforcement.

Dozens of police and firemen came from across Westchester to remember their colleagues killed protecting Black Lives Matter protesters. All were in dress uniforms, their badges covered with black armbands. Formalities opened with the Emerald Society bagpipers and a presentation by the police department’s color guard. The president of the local school board led the Pledge of Allegiance. The names of the five dead officers were read aloud.

Then the talks began. Ceremony went off-key from there. The chief of police and the president of the local Police Benevolent Association gave the eulogies. Chief Ferry felt obliged to defend militarized weaponry in police hands to counter “militarization of criminals.” Officiating clergy and bureaucrats ascended swiftly to the Bigger Issues: gun control, “disparity in justice,” and covert support for the anti-cop pieties Ferry had just rejected.

Supervisor Greenstein set the tone. He was suitably aggrieved (by all the lives lost) but in that double-minded way President Obama would adopt next day in Dallas. After obligatory commonplaces about honor of service, Greenstein threw meat to the very movement that prompted a black sniper to slaughter five white policemen: “Americans of all races and all backgrounds are outraged by police misconduct. It is unacceptable. When one of us is victimized we all suffer.”

Chief Ferry felt obliged to defend militarized weaponry in police hands to counter ‘militarization of criminals.’

In other words: Those officers should not have been murdered; nevertheless . . . . Besides, the overriding issue lay elsewhere: “Whether the event stems from terrorism, hate crimes or any other motive is irrelevant. Gun violence as a tool of hatred targeting race, gender, sexual preference, profession or any other reason cannot be tolerated. We must say no to gun violence.”

The source of hatred in Dallas went unmentioned. Anti-white animus is a progressive motif that precedes the events of Dallas. It is also a taboo subject, the silence yielding covert complicity in what Jim Sleeper in “Liberal Racism” (1997) called “the color-coding of American life.”

Not one speaker uttered a word against the dangers of making race an organizing principle of our civic life. Instead, the tenor of things affirmed Sleeper’s comment of 20 years ago: “Liberalism no longer curbs discrimination. It invites it. It does not expose racism; it recapitulates and, sometimes, reinvents it.”

We Are Not in Selma Any More

The racial politics of Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a virulent product of that re-invention. Its website states: “Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise.”

The ambiguity of his comment insinuated a moral equivalence between dead police and their murderer.

BLM decries the many ways “violence is inflicted on Black folks across the world” and refuses to behave while “white supremacy and antiBlackness live and thrive in every society, culture, and part of our world.” Stating its aim of “(re)building the Black Liberation movement,” the website lapses into radical left boilerplate that hints at a larger game: “Black queer and trans folks bear a unique burden from a hetero-patriarchal society that disposes of us like garbage and simultaneously fetishizes us and profits off of us, and that is state violence.”

No, Toto, we are not in Selma anymore. But local Dems refuse to notice.

They brought back Khusro Elley. With him came under-the-radar sympathy with the BLM movement. All innuendo, Elley mourned the “unfortunate and unnecessary deaths” of the past week. The ambiguity of his comment insinuated a moral equivalence between dead police and their murderer. He waxed bolder: “We are outraged by the killing of African American men and women.” Then the punch line, a veiled accusation that had to sear the marrow of every officer listening: “I would rather be Muslim than black in America.”

A rabbi followed, admonishing against indifference with quotes from Elie Wiesel, an Auschwitz survivor. But indifference to whom? To what? The implicit Holocaust reference suggested solidarity with black grievance, not with the uniformed men and women standing in front of him.

Sky Lanterns in the Dark

The Congregational minister appeared again to deliver another posy to gun control: “I truly pray I am not standing here in another month for another vigil for another senseless act of violence.”

America’s race industry is advantageous to the caliphate’s advance men.

There was nothing senseless about the Dallas murders. They were the inevitable response to a toxic ideology that rationalizes the spilling of Pig’s Blood. Micah Johnson set out to kill white people, specifically white law enforcement. According to his Facebook page (since removed), he had joined the Mississippi branch of the Black Panther Party. Johnson was an incendiary retread in the cast of Huey Newton, Bobby Seale, and Eldridge Cleaver in his cop-shooting days.

Those half-forgotten names represent a racial antagonism that considers itself justified in the name of historic grievance and claims of ongoing persecution. As a poster stated on the Facebook page of the African American Defense League on July 18: “Where was ‘All Lives Matter’ between 1619 and 1968?”

The character of Elley’s participation in these interfaith clambakes sends a signal: America’s race industry is advantageous to the caliphate’s advance men. A gun grab, too, has uses. His presence serves as warning that our existence is intolerable to some others, possibly even those who pray with us. But it is an alarm we prefer not to hear.

This month, the florist sent no roses. The library featured no relevant books. No one read an essay by a police widow. It was left to volunteers in the Chappaqua Fire Department to release sky lanterns into the gathering dark in honor of the dead.

How The Left Is Weaponizing The American Legal System,"For quite some time the American Left has been busy turning American law into a partisan political weapon. Various progressive factions have undertaken a disparate and uncoordinated but still ideologically homogeneous effort to criminalize dissent using the courts and statutory law.

By most traditional metrics, these efforts have been failures: the liberals have often lost, and the conservative targets have avoided jail time or crippling criminal or civil convictions or penalties. But the weaponization of our legal system should not be judged by traditional metrics. The point is not for liberals to “win” any particular lawsuit or legal enforcement so much as it is to use lawsuits and the law as the weapons in and of themselves. The process is the punishment. And in most of these cases the punishment is very severe. That’s the idea.

In large part this reflects growing liberal opposition to a pluralistic society: not merely opposition to ideas but rather opposition to ideas about ideas, a strong and deliberate enmity towards intellectual diversity and dissenting thought. Gay marriage, the “settled science” of climate change, the morality of abortion, the wisdom of allowing grown men into little girls’ restrooms—all of these things (and many other liberal ballyhoos) are assumed to be unassailable. “It’s 2016,” many on the Left will say, sneeringly. Meaning: “It is no longer appropriate or acceptable for you to say or think things with which I disagree.”

The Left’s Hatred for Dissent

It should thus come as no surprise that the victims of this “lawfare” are almost universally conservative. The liberal order is in the midst of a great ideological hardening in which its adherents view progressivism’s domestic ambitions not merely as better or even superlative but as morally sui generis: progressive ideology is seen as the singular salvific political option, and conservatism is viewed as an evil mix between Nazism and antebellum pro-slavery racism. (A few years ago some researchers at my alma mater wrote a study linking conservative beliefs to “psychotism;” that paper turned out to be fatally flawed, but the belief that conservatives are all dictators at heart persists throughout much of our political landscape.)

Yet America is, at least by the standards of the rest of the Western world, a remarkably pluralistic nation: more so than a great deal of Western Europe, anyway, where many countries’ speech codes are draconian enough to preempt a great deal of political and cultural speech altogether. (In 2010 an English preacher was arrested for claiming homosexuality is a sin; in Scotland a man was arrested for an allegedly offensive post on Facebook regarding immigrants.)

The modern liberal impulse cannot very well tolerate a society that allows for multiple viewpoints, but the American tradition of free speech—along with its damaged but still vibrant culture of conservatism and conservative political thought—means that much of our political debate is still favorable ground for conservatives. That’s the way America was designed, intentionally and with forethought: to allow for dissent, to foster it, even to encourage it.

So the Left is turning to lawfare: a systematic effort to turn the American legal system against liberalism’s political opponents. The point is to take the court system (which is supposed to be a neutral arbiter of justice) and the law itself (which in many cases is ideologically neutral) and convert both into partisan weapons for liberal political advancement. It should cause you no small measure of discomfort to know that the Left has been largely successful in these efforts. Lawfare works.

Let’s look at some of the Left’s most prominent examples of lawfare to get an idea of how it works: how the law is used to squelch dissent, silence conservative voices, and punish incorrect opinions.

David Daleiden and Planned Parenthood

Daleiden is the founder of the Center for Medical Progress and the undercover investigator who exposed Planned Parenthood’s program to chop up aborted babies and sell their body parts to medical technology companies. Daleiden pretended to be a buyer interested in purchasing baby body parts from Planned Parenthood, and he secretly recorded high-ranking Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of dead baby organs.

Planned Parenthood was humiliated globally and implicated in countless felonies, so Daleiden had to be punished. He was charged with the purchase and sale of human organs, a misdemeanor, as well as tampering with a government record, a felony. His home was raided, with damning Planned Parenthood footage allegedly seized. Exemplifying the corrupt and partisan bias behind the charges, the prosecuting attorney general had financial ties to Planned Parenthood, and the attorney general’s office allegedly shared evidence with Planned Parenthood even though a judge had ordered them not to.

After months and months, a judge dismissed both charges against Daleiden (and one against his partner). The dismissal surely represents a great victory for the First Amendment (and for the pro-life movement). But the message was also clear: if you cross the pro-abortion Left—especially if you embarrass them in front of the whole world and expose their barbarous practices—you may face a costly, time-consuming, protracted legal battle.

Rick Perry and Travis County

A few years ago, a Texas district attorney from Travis County, Democrat Rosemary Lehmberg, was pulled over for drinking and driving with a 0.239 blood alcohol level. While in custody she repeatedly threatened to retaliate professionally in her capacity as district attorney against the police officers involved.

As a result, Rick Perry—who was governor of Texas at the time—threatened to veto funding for a Texas anticorruption unit Lehmberg herself headed. It makes sense: why would a governor want to fund a public corruption task force headed by a woman so obviously neck-deep in corruption herself?

Perry followed through on his threat to veto. Shortly thereafter, a grand jury indicted Perry on charges he had abused his power of office. Texans for Public Justice, a liberal advocacy group, had advocated for the indictment. Eighteen months later the charges were dismissed. In the meantime, Perry had been forced to deal with the indictment (and a potential 109 years in prison) while running his presidential campaign.

In fact, Perry believed the indictment was one of the reasons he performed poorly in the Republican primary. Whether or not that was the case, the damage had already been done: as punishment for exercising a legitimate and proper function as governor of Texas, Perry’s life had been ensnared in an expensive, distracting, hassling court case for a year and a half. Republican governors elsewhere were meant to take note of what happens when they draw the ire of liberals and corrupt Democratic officials.

The Wisconsin John Doe Affair

A number of years ago, the Gestapo came to modern-day America. Families in Wisconsin woke up in the early morning to find veritable squadrons of police officers at their doors. Police would barge in, seize computers and other sensitive information, and order the families to keep their mouths shut. The experiences were traumatic enough that many people did not want to speak on the record about them, if at all.

What had these families done—laundered money, engaged in the drug trade, committed murder? None of the above: the families were instead guilty of being conservative. A petty, vindictive, hyperpartisan Democratic district attorney named John Chisholm had used a clever legal maneuver known as a “John Doe” investigation to harass, intimidate, and terrify conservative Wisconsonites suspected of illegal political coordination with Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Assisted by Judge Barbara Kluka, Chisholm went after anyone and everyone he could. Families were traumatized to the point that stable marriages were in danger of dissolving. Conservative advocacy groups were muzzled.

In service to a political agenda, Wisconsin Democrats turned the state into a weapon against innocent American citizens. If you were one of the targeted families or individuals—or if you simply lived next door to people, or a few streets over—you’d probably think twice about participating in the democratic process in the future, at least if your opinions are conservative.

Mark Steyn and Michael Mann

Several years ago, conservative commentator Mark Steyn, writing at National Review Online, called global warming scientist and alarmist Michael Mann’s work on climate change “fraudulent.” In response, Mann sued both Steyn and National Review. That was in 2012; the case is still dragging on in a Washington DC court. Steyn has been vocal about the astronomical cost of fighting a years-long court battle; the legal battle also led to Steyn parting ways with National Review, for which Steyn had written for many years.

This isn’t Mann’s first lawsuit: he sued Canadian scientist Tim Ball for libel five years ago when Ball suggested Mann should be in prison for his role in the Climategate controversy.

Based on the Climategate e-mails, there are actually serious questions about the scientific validity of Mann’s work; the kind of rhetoric Steyn invoked was perfectly justified in light of those concerns. But Mann isn’t interested in restoring his good name (a name that was already rather sullied to begin with); he is interested in punishing Steyn and National Review with an endless, extremely expensive court battle that will discourage them (and others) from commenting on climate change in the future.

In addition to these and other instances of lawfare, there are several troubling indications that liberals want to expand the reach of vindictive lawsuits and law enforcement.

Global Warming and RICO

After years of alarmism and hysteria, climate change activists are dismayed to find out that the general public really doesn’t care all that much about global warming. Angry and embarrassed by the failure of the climate change campaign, liberals are turning towards a new tool to help quash dissent on the subject: lawsuits.

Last year Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse proposed using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to prosecute fossil fuel companies for “climate denial.” Earlier this year a professor from the University of Wisconsin argued the same thing. Multiple climate scientists subsequently advocated in favor of prosecuting climate dissidents. Incredibly, the U.S. attorney general signaled an openness to the idea.

These prosecutions haven’t yet begun. But they are gaining currency on the Left, and you can be sure this idea will continue to gain traction, especially if global warming hysteria continues to be ignored and alarmists humiliated by this lack of interest.

Prosecuting Gun Manufacturers

Another public policy area in which liberals have consistently suffered humiliating defeats is that of guns. From the Supreme Court’s recent landmark Second Amendment rulings to the liberalization of gun laws at the federal, state, and local levels to continued widespread support for American gun ownership, the Left surely cannot help but feel embarrassed over firearms.

Gun ownership could be targeted not by traditional and fair democratic means but by the cynical and vindictive use of the court system.

As a result, liberals have indicated a willingness to repeal a law that protects gun manufacturers from frivolous anti-gun lawsuits. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act shields gun companies from being held liable for criminal use of the firearms they produce. This makes sense: one would not, after all, sue Ford or Chevrolet if one of their cars was used in a drunk-driving incident (like the one for which Lehmberg was arrested).

But liberals recognize the power of strategic lawsuits, so in recent years have been clamoring to repeal the PLCAA and allow people to sue gun manufacturers for crimes the manufacturers had absolutely nothing to do with. Earlier this year Democrats in Congress proposed a bill to allow just that. If liberals eventually get their way, gun ownership could be targeted not by traditional and fair democratic means but by the cynical and vindictive use of the court system. American citizens could have their rights stolen from them through crazy and indefensible lawsuits.

It is worth pointing out that it is not merely Democrats who have advocated and celebrated such noxious and underhanded tactics. The Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump, has signaled he wants to use libel laws to harass and intimidate people who criticize him. In fact, as a private citizen, he’s done it already, by his own admission: he once sued an author who criticized him, and he did it specifically “to make [the author’s] life miserable.” But of course Trump was a Democrat and a liberal for many years, so we might expect this from him.

How to Protect Americans from Legal Bullies

These efforts represent a serious threat to the American way of life. There are in fact laws in many states that are meant to prevent frivolous lawsuits; they are known as anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) statutes, and they can be invaluable for avoiding these types of attacks. Congress should look into passing a federal anti-SLAPP provision. There should also be tighter oversight and policing of the kinds of statutory abuses that corrupt politicians like Chisholm engage in.

Liberalism itself has numerous structural flaws against which conservatives should argue. But this latest strain of progressive political tactic represents a new, almost existential problem: an attempt to use American law to shrivel the acceptable boundaries of American political thought. If you have the wrong opinions about climate change; if you expose the wrong sordid scandal at the wrong abortion clinic; if you support the wrong candidate, you may be a target for a crippling, frightening, stressful lawsuit or legal barrage. Your life may be derailed. You may lose your savings, your job, your health, your family.

Of course, you can avoid all of these negative consequences—by keeping your mouth shut and toeing the liberal party line. That’s always an option. And it’s the one they want you to choose.

Video Shows: 'Common Sense' Gun Control Is A Myth,"A new undercover video reveals how little gun control advocates actually know about the objects they want to ban. Posing as volunteers for “Citizen Coalition for Common Sense Gun Reform,” a fictitious gun-control group, two conservative media personalities conducted man-on-the-street interviews with individuals who said they wanted “common sense” gun control measures.

A startling trend among the responders was that they wanted to ban weapons that were “black and scary,” even if their function was similar to another less “scary” looking gun. Some even mistook some rifles to be fully automatic — a class of weapon which has been heavily regulated since 1934 — while others used incorrect terminology, like “fully semi-automatic,” when describing the guns in front of them.

The term “assault weapon” gets thrown around a lot — but it’s not actually a technical term at all. It was invented by politicians with an agenda. It’s not an actual classification of a weapon, as neither the military nor gun manufacturers use that term. “Fully semi-automatic,” isn’t a real term either: fully automatic weapons fire multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger, while semi-automatic weapons fire only one round per trigger pull.

Despite knowing next to nothing about the guns they wanted to ban, the gun controllers were frighteningly quick to sign a petition in favor of making firearms illegal to purchase or possess.

This isn’t anything new. Politicians and the media are able to perpetuate lies about guns and gun violence all the time because the public knows so little about guns or the laws that regulate.

Why Wizard World Will Regret Banning Fake Guns,"Dear Wizard World,

It recently came to my attention that due to the online slacktivism of the social justice mobs, you will no longer feature a Chicago man’s replicas of guns from famous games and comics for sale at your convention.

From what I understand, the replica maker Dave Selvaggio of DS Arms went through all the proper channels to gain his spot on the convention floor, and has been planning his display since March. Selvaggio, I’ve learned, is a licensed FFL dealer who was also planning to include safety training along with his fake replicas.

As a lover of all things nerdy, I can’t express how disappointed I am about your decision to cave to the social justice hysterics that has infected our escapism lately. Not just because I feel like this political activism has gained one more foothold in a place it doesn’t belong, but because you have opened a can of worms you will have a very hard time closing.

How About Education Instead of Fear

For one, there is nothing wrong with firearms, and learning firearm safety. While firearms have been used for murder, they have been used so by bad people. The vast majority of gun owners, including gun owners who attend your convention, are not bad people. Painting firearms with a broad brush of negativity brought on by intense media coverage whenever one is used illegally is the height of both ignorance and falsehood. Clearly those who pushed you to take the booth down exhibited both traits.

Selvaggio was quoted saying “Just because people are fans of comic books and sci-fi doesn’t mean they’re not interested in protecting themselves and their family and their belongings.”

He is absolutely correct in this. I can attest that my friends and I, the majority of which enjoy sci-fi movies, video games, and comics, are also gun owners and enthusiasts. By banning this booth you’ve sent the message that guns are not okay, nor is education about and safety with them. You would rather ban learning in favor of fearmongering and misinformation.

Furthermore, the Wizard World weapons policy clearly states it allows convention-goers to carry replica weapons, so long as they’re non-firing. Is this not what Selvaggio was selling? These were nothing more than toy guns no different from the ones carried by cosplayers roaming your convention floor, are they not? Banning Selvaggio’s booth for selling pieces you’ll see everywhere is like telling one wave in an ocean that it can’t come ashore. No matter what, you’re gonna be swimming in it.

The contention here seems to rest on the fact that Selvaggio is a knowledgeable gun owner and dealer, capable of teaching others to be knowledgeable gun owners themselves, but with real weapons. If that was the problem, then perhaps it would have been best to simply tell Selvaggio to keep his training offers to himself, and just sell his replicas. I wouldn’t advise this, because the more knowledge people have, the better—the trigger discipline of some of your attendees is atrocious—but you would have spared Selvaggio the letdown of so much time and energy wasted planning this booth for your convention.

If You Want Fun, Banish the Whiners

Selvaggio clearly had wares he wished to sell, which now he can’t. That’s both time and money out of his pocket. You’re also taking something off the floor that would clearly be popular with your convention-goers. Replica sword and blade booths are all over the place. Are these not weapons as well? Would your attendees not love to see these wares for purchase, as they would any other toy weapon?

Wizard World spokesman Jerry Milani said “We want everyone to have a good time at the show. We want this to be fun.” But I’m failing to see where the fun comes in when you’re caving in to pseudo-moral busybodies who would have you do away with something everyone enjoys in the name of a political standpoint.

I’ve seen some of the tweets that were sent your way when the debacle started, and I have to say that none of these people have “fun” in mind, nor do some seem to understand that there will be toy guns there regardless of the booth’s disappearance.

Don't forget to stop by our booth at Wizard World Chicago, where we'll be tossing live, poisonous snakes at people. #GunFreeComicCon

I don't care if his guns are toys, having a gun seller at #WizardWorld when there have been 2000+ shootings in Chicago this year is nuts.

Thinking of setting up a booth to promote human trafficking at Wizard World Chicago. Any interest? #GunFreeComicCon



— The Outhousers (@TheOuthousers) August 16, 2016

If you're a creator or media person who cares about gun violence or believe #BlackLivesMatter, I'd recommend you tell @WizardWorld the same.



— Matt SantoriGriffith (@FotoCub) August 16, 2016



As you can see by this last tweet sent out by the man who started this protest, Matt Santori-Griffith (@FotoCub) the interest is clearly political, not fun, and herein is where you really stepped in it.

Let Convention-Goers Make Their Own Decisions

You allowed Santori-Griffith and his online mob to dictate what everyone else at the convention can and can’t enjoy. Adults, who should be allowed to make their own decisions about whether they want to purchase from Selvaggio’s booth, or sign up for his safety classes, are now unable to do so because you allowed online outrage brigades to decide that for them.

As a guy who attends conventions like yours from time to time, I’m insulted that you would allow someone who has never met, my friends, or Selvaggio, to that call on our behalf. While I concede it is your decision to pull the booth, you did so at the business end of intimidation by people who do not speak for other convention-goers. It would have been better for you to allow Selvaggio’s booth to remain, and let your attendees decide for themselves whether they should take part in what the booth was offering. Let those who strongly disagree with it stay away, and if they didn’t want to attend the convention due to the booth’s presence, so be it.

But by caving to their demands you not only let them decide for other attendees, you gave them an opening to continue to make demands in the future. As in all things, once you open the door for politically motivated outrage brigades to have their way, they will continue to push for more and more concessions. Soon, they may call for a limit to cosplay accessories like weapons because it promotes violence. Certain characters may not be welcome because they’re too insensitive for one reason or another. Certain speakers won’t be allowed because of their beliefs, and more. Does that sound like fun to you? It certainly doesn’t to anyone outside of the outrage brigades and political busybodies.

Rest assured that this won’t be the last time you see these slacktivists, or the last time you’ll be pressured through online mobs to change your convention. My advice is simple: Don’t cave to them. Your attendees love your convention as-is, and altering it to suit the desires of a minority of social justice extremists will only drive people away.

If possible, reinstate Selvaggio’s booth and allow convention-goers to make their own decisions about whether they’d like to shop there. Allow those who don’t wish to attend to the convention due to this to not attend. They can miss out on the fun, but chances are they’ll show up there anyway.

You have the opportunity to put your foot down and set an example for all other conventions. Demonstrate you won’t be bullied, nor cowed, that you won’t allow your goers to be presided over by people who have never met them. Take this opportunity to tell your customers and attendees that you do want them to have fun, and you won’t let others decide what that is on their behalf.

Please consider this letter carefully. Many of us out here would greatly appreciate it if you did.

Norman Rockwell Explains Why Olympian Kim Rhode Can’t Get Traction,"You might not think of Norman Rockwell as the artist of American “gun culture.” Maybe you should. Of the nearly 4,000 images in the “Definitive Catalogue” of Rockwell’s works, about 96 include guns. That’s only a little more than 2 percent of the total number, but I don’t think 100 pictures of guns is anything to wave off.

More important than the numbers, however, is the ordinariness of the guns in the art. They’re just part of life: commonplace things to have around. Let me give you a simple example of what I mean.

If you look on the shelf behind the stovepipe, you’ll see the butt end of a shotgun. This barber apparently enjoys jamming with his buddies after work, but also enjoys going out after the rabbits and pheasants and such. So there’s his gun, right there in his shop.

You don’t see a lot of that anymore. My own barber has a shop quite similar to Shuffleton’s—but no guns visibly displayed. I wish there were! One of the only non-gun-related businesses I’ve been into where a gun has been easily visible was our lawyer’s office, when we closed on our home. He had a nice AR-15 leaning up against a file cabinet.

I actually mentioned it to him: something like “that’s great that you get to bring your rifle to work.” He told me it wasn’t his gun, he was holding it for a friend who was out of town. Fifty years ago, it’s doubtful that a rifle in a professional’s office would have prompted any comment at all. Rockwell doesn’t hesitate to put them there, such as in this one (granted, it’s just a wall hanger, but there it is):

Now, not all the guns in Rockwell’s work are just lying around. Some are in active use, mostly for hunting purposes, but in some cases, gun are used in less lighthearted ways. Here’s one of them.

This is from a series of pictures Rockwell did for the Edison Mazda company in the 1920s. They’re among his best pictures from this time period—far better than his much more famous covers for the Saturday Evening Post. (Better than his Post covers from the ’20s.) But they’re not very well known.

This man is holding what looks to be a post-Civil-War-era black powder revolver, not a then-modern high-speed double-action revolver. (He’s not armed with a then-modern high-speed electric light, either. In fact, I’m not entirely sure I understand what makes this a good ad for Edison Mazda, but that’s not quite the point in this article.) This armed citizen is coming downstairs in the middle of the night, presumably to investigate some alarming noise.

Now, the thing that might take a minute to sink in is that Rockwell made this picture as a commercial artist. Apart from the beauty of the image itself—it’s a magnificent picture—the thing that really stands out about it is that this was done as an advertisement for a major national company. And it was simply taken in stride. I’m trying to think of a national, mainstream company that’s not directly involved in making guns and gun paraphernalia using a firearm in an ad campaign in recent years. I’m stumped.

The fact is, people are afraid of guns, and the advertisers who address those people are, consequently, afraid of guns.

How This Affects Kim Rhode’s Visibility

This has all kinds of consequences. Take Kim Rhode, the first woman to medal in six straight Olympics—a person you probably haven’t seen on TV, or heard much talk about. She can’t seem to nail down a non-firearms-related sponsor, despite her amazing career.

The reason for her obscurity and lack of major sponsors is that she’s a skeet shooter. Her sport involves the shotgun. (Discussion. Another discussion. Notice how the article makes it seem as though Rhode had gratuitously introduced her views about the SecondAmendment into the Olympic arena, when in fact the comments the article quotes were responses to direct questions.)

Rhode isn’t your standard Rockwellian gun user: Rockwell’s many guns are almost all in the possession of men. In that sense, Rhode represents one of the gun culture’s most remarkable changes of the last generation or so—the incredible growth of women shooters. As far as I know, Rockwell drew only one woman with a gun.

This is actually a Peter Rockwell bronze, but it was a joint effort between Norman and his son, produced for the Cathedral in the Pines in New Hampshire. It’s part of a group of bronzes honoring the contributions of women in war. Norman Rockwell drew the image upon which the bronze is based. It’s obviously a frontier woman preparing to defend her home against an Indian attack. (You can see an arrow in the upper left.)

Like the Edison Mazda ad, this image shows a gun being used in a very grave situation. The woman is resolute—and waiting for her shot. The gun’s not at her shoulder yet. She knows what she’s doing. She’s going to make her shot count. In other words, she’s been well taught. As Rhode points out, though, it’s getting tougher and tougher in many places to teach people about guns.

Rhode lives in California, where Gov. Jerry Brown last month signed six bills that tighten everything from gun ownership to non-owner gun usage to ammunition purchases. Handguns can be lent only to family members and only six times a year, and other guns if “occasional and without regularity.” Large-capacity magazines will be banned, even for competitive shooters.

“They are, in a way, killing my sport, making it more difficult for people to start my sport and try it,” Rhode said. “If I’m going out to coach Boy Scouts or teach somebody how to shoot and I can’t loan them a gun or shell, it becomes very challenging to get new people into the sport.”

If you can only lend guns to a friend “occasionally and without regularity,” you certainly can’t teach her to shoot very well. One would think any proposed law that made it harder to teach people to shoot responsibly and well would be immediately killed. But apparently not.

It’s time to push back, and not with any dark rumblings about “Second Amendment people” or what have you. The best way to push back is to take a kid shooting. Especially a girl. You might be teaching a future Olympian. Or a person who efficaciously refuses to be a victim.

If you’ve been denied an adequate knowledge of firearms so far in your life, start by buying yourself some guns and then taking yourself shooting. (Check here. They’ll teach you right.) Then take a moment to acknowledge the splendid accomplishments of Kim Rhode.

Stop Grandstanding: Cancer Kills More People Than Guns,"The Constitution’s amendments to explicitly guarantee rights draw the boundaries of political debate—that is, limit government’s power and scope. Yet the Left debates our constitutional rights the same way they talk about taxes and almost everything: as privileges of a beneficent government.

This is why they are always asking why someone “needs” a weapon, or why someone should be “allowed” to have a weapon: it is, at best, a simple category mistake of treating a right as though it were not a right, or, at worst, an exercise in question-begging.

There are more guns than the 320 million people in the United States: more than 114 million handguns, 110 million rifles, and 86 million shotguns. The Left once at least acknowledged this. As the number of guns in the United States has soared to record highs, and as the violent crime rate has dropped to record lows (half of its 1991 peak), left-wing politicians have grown increasingly bold in sowing fear in the public.

At least in the good old days they actually realized that Americans like guns, and aren’t giving them up. Barack Obama, despite an accidentally candid moment about Pennsylvanians “clinging to their guns or religion,” still got an F from the Brady Campaign in 2009. Joe Biden once touted his ownership of a shotgun, and advised shooting it through the front door in case of startling noises.

It was not until Obama and Biden were safely re-elected and lame ducks that they made gun control a central part of their agenda, and declared that we have an “epidemic” of gun violence. Now, rather than candidate Obama promising not to “take everyone’s guns away,” he openly muses aloud about an Australian-style gun control regime that would, incidentally, require taking everyone’s guns away.

While many have been outraged at this particular Obama flip-flop, the president has been more hype than action. Despite all of the campaign-style rallies, gun ownership has only increased under Obama, and in large part due to his fear-mongering. The president exaggerates the prevalence of shootings (as “gun violence” was known in less pretentious times).

Obama says gun violence is an “epidemic.” So it follows that any number of fatalities equal or greater to this amount would also constitute an “epidemic.” Right? Abortion, for example, killed about 700,000 children last year, nearly 78 times as many fatalities as from gun homicides, and more than the number of Americans killed in any war. Is that an epidemic, Mr. President?

About 30,000 of the 2.6 million American deaths each year are by firearms. It is heartbreaking to say, but of this 30,000, about 20,000 are suicides: two-thirds of the victims of gun violence die by their own hand. About 1.5 percent of deaths are by guns, and 0.34 percent are by gun homicides.

How many of the more common causes of death get presidential press conferences? Why isn’t heart disease (about 611,000 deaths) a leading political issue instead of constitutionally protected guns? Why can’t we have more Rose Garden speeches on cancer (about 585,000 deaths)?

According to the FBI, more Americans are killed with blunt objects like hammers (496), knives (1,694), and hands, fists, or feet (728) than by either shotguns or rifles. So at least Biden has chosen a less offensive firearm with which to defend himself.

For every gun in America, there are 0.00002 homicides. Put another way, for every homicide in America, there are 36,117 firearms. What is striking is not how many gun homicides there are, but, relative to the downright staggering number of firearms available in the third most-populous country on earth, how few.

The New York Times’ Lack Of Gun Knowledge Is Embarrassing,"Nobody—not even the editorial board of The New York Times—is free from the moral responsibility to do a little research before commenting on a matter of public import. If you are going to talk about a contentious public issue, you should learn a little bit about it beforehand to avoid misleading others and making yourself look profoundly foolish.

Unfortunately the Times’s editorial board recently ignored this timeless advice and issued an editorial that was essentially a grand exercise in willful ignorance. According to the Times, Missouri’s recent passage of a “constitutional carry” gun law has transformed the Show-Me State into “the shoot-me state.” The Times says the law represents “a wholesale retreat from gun safety in the state.”

This is reckless enough to almost constitute journalistic manslaughter, for reasons that are obvious to anyone with an Internet connection and the ability to use a search engine. Before we get to that, just reflect: is there any policy topic in the United States that causes more people to get more things wrong than guns? Is there a public debate in which the ratio of commentary to knowledge is more lopsided? It is always astonishing not merely how little people know about guns, but also how determined they are to learn almost nothing about them.

Times Asserts But Feels No Need to Prove

So it goes with the Times, which believes that a liberalized gun-carry regime will result in mass bloodshed in Missouri. The most controversial aspect of the law is that it allows Missouri citizens to carry concealed weapons without a permit, something the Times thinks is a very bad idea. Naturally the question arises: is there an increased risk from constitutional carry laws? Are there compelling data from other states to suggest as much? Where is the evidence?

The Times provides none at all. The paper claims the law is “an invitation for people to be armed without responsible controls.” It cites exactly zero proof suggesting the law will have a negative effect. This is understandable, because no such proof exists. In fact, there is evidence to suggest just the opposite.

How might we determine this? By doing what the Times refused to do: we can look at the data from other states with constitutional carry laws on the books. For instance, Vermont has had a constitutional carry regime since roughly the beginning of the United States. In 2014, according to the FBI, Vermont had only six gun murders total. It tied for the second-lowest confirmed gun murder rate in the country. Only half of those were with handguns (which is understandably the weapon of choice for concealed carry).

Vermont’s constitutional carry arrangement has lasted well over 200 years. Where is all the violence and bloodshed? Did the state’s violent criminals not get the memo?

Or what about Wyoming? The state passed a constitutional carry law in 2011. Did the state suddenly experience an explosion of gun-related violence? Well, no. In fact, the numbers dropped, from 11 gun murders in 2011 to five in 2012. It jumped to nine in 2013 and then dropped again to eight in 2014. That’s an overall reduction in gun deaths since the law was passed. Did Wyoming’s move represent a “retreat” from “gun safety?” You can hardly tell if so.

What about Arizona? Gov. Jan Brewer signed a constitutional carry law there in 2010. What happened next? Gun murders plummeted over the next four years: from 232 in 2010 to 222 in 2011 to 211 in 2012 to 184 in 2013 to 153 in 2014. Gee, some “shoot-me state!”

The New York Times Is Irrationally Afraid of Guns

Other recent state-level constitutional carry laws—in Idaho, Maine, Kansas, and elsewhere—have only been enacted in the past year or so. As a result, it is too early to tell if these states experienced drops in gun homicide rates similar to Wyoming and Arizona. What we do have literal centuries of data to suggest is that passing constitutional carry laws do not automatically spike gun violence, and indeed in states where constitutional carry is passed, gun violence may drop at the same time.

Why did the Times refuse to consider such data? Why did it neglect to examine the effect similar laws have had in other states? You might chalk it up to partisan bias. But there is something else at work here: hoplophobia, or an irrational fear of firearms. Like a great many people, the editorial board isn’t interested in learning about guns. They are interested in being afraid of guns and transmitting that fear to other people.

Sadly, this is the level to which much of our gun debate has sunk: fact-based and well-reasoned argument on one side, and illiterate, willfully ignorant, and dishonest rhetoric on the other.

These kinds of reactions are helpful in one way, however: they remind gun rights activists to stay vigilant in defense of our precious Second Amendment rights, for they are always under threat.

Journalists Should Be More Skeptical Of That New Gun Study,"There’s a new gun study out about gun ownership, and progressive gun controllers are really excited about it. Its results have been breathlessly reported by progressive outlets like NPR, Time, Slate, Mic, and even The Onion.

According to this new gun study, half of America’s guns are owned by only 3 percent of people in this country, and that excites progressives because it must mean that their radical anti-gun public policy agenda — its dramatic, multi-decade failure to be enacted notwithstanding — is way more popular than the Second Amendment. “There are totally more of us than there are of them” is a comforting lie that adherents of an unpopular agenda often tell themselves, especially when each new month brings news of record-breaking gun sales.

If you’re pretty psyched about that new gun poll, however, I’ve got some bad news for you: its results are almost certainly garbage. Here’s why.

Gun owners lie to pollsters. All the time. Often in extremely creative ways. People who actually know gun owners know this. Sure, some people who own guns might be honest with the random stranger claiming to be a pollster who wants to know precisely how many guns these people own. But there’s a pretty good chance that a huge chunk of gun owners will never in a million years be honest with the guy on the phone asking how many guns they own. There are a number of reasons for this.

First, guns are an expensive item highly coveted by violent criminals. The Department of Justice (DOJ) estimated that 1.4 million guns were stolen in home burglaries between 2005 and 2010. In St. Louis, where violent crime skyrocketed in 2015, reports of gun thefts were up nearly 70 percent last year. Gun owners know that a great way to become a burglary target is to advertise that you’re a gun owner with an arsenal that’s there for the taking. All a canny burglar would need to do is wait until nobody was home, and then he could go on a free gun-grabbing spree.

So how do gun owners respond to the ever present threat of gun theft? By refusing to reveal to random idiots on the phone whether they own any guns or precisely how many they own. Because of the risk of home invasions and burglaries by those on the prowl for guns they can use in other crimes, you can assume with an extremely high degree of confidence that public polls drastically understate the true level of gun ownership in the U.S.

Second, gun owners are constantly on the lookout for politicians who want to take their guns. While many gun controllers dismiss this as tinfoil hat paranoia (“Ugh, nobody wants to take your guns, you gun-humping, toothless, inbred moron!”), the fact of the matter is that a lot of progressives really do want to take your guns. We know this because these gun grabbers literally tell us how much they want to grab everyone’s guns. Every politician, including the current president and one of his potential successors, who favorably references Australia’s gun confiscation regime and calls for its enactment in the U.S. is, in fact, endorsing some form of gun registration or confiscation in the U.S.

It turns out that when you constantly tell people you’d love to come and take their guns away — actually, that you’d love to force other people to come and take your guns away (gun control is great, but certainly not worth the risk of the gun controllers putting themselves in danger) — those gun owners tend to believe you. And when they believe you’re serious about trying to take their guns, the last thing they’re going to do is help someone build a nice list of every address where guns might be found. Registration, after all, is the first step towards confiscation.

This very dynamic was recently demonstrated in Connecticut, which required gun registration throughout the state. Compliance rates were about what you would expect: industry experts estimate that only 15 percent of those required to show up and register their guns actually did so. If only 15 percent of gun owners are going to comply with an actual registration law that carries penalties, what percentage do you think will be honest with a random caller on the telephone?

It’s no coincidence that “tragic boating accidents” in which every gun someone owns ends up at the bottom of a large body of water are so common among gun owners. Here’s a representative example of that phenomenon:

https://twitter.com/ImmaWildling/status/636887992217436161

As Dr. Gregory House, the main character in the medical drama House was fond of saying, “Everybody lies.” When it comes to potentially hostile outsiders demanding to know how many guns someone owns, gun owners lie early and often.

Which brings us back to that fancy new poll everyone’s talking about. Perhaps a review of the raw data used in the poll could give us some clues about the reliability of its results. Maybe its response rates could help us understand how many people pollsters had to call before getting a straight answer from anyone.

Unfortunately, that data is not available, nor will it be made available any time soon. The researchers behind this new poll, who generously leaked its topline results to major global news organizations, did not see fit to make that data available for public review. No, according to those researchers, that raw poll data will remain under wraps until fall. Of 2017:

The full results of the Harvard/Northeastern gun ownership study are undergoing peer review and are slated to be published in the autumn of 2017 by the Russell Sage Foundation. While the full peer review is not complete, Azrael said, the current results have gone through an initial round of comments and revisions from a group of leading firearms researchers.

This type of behavior raises all kinds of troubling questions about the underlying data, as well as the motives of the researchers who put it together. If peer review is incomplete, why on earth are the study’s conclusions already being released? And if these reviewers are widely respected experts in the field, why must they remain anonymous, even as the study’s conclusions are being broadcast to the world? And finally, on what planet does it take more than a year to review the results of a simple poll?

None of the likely answers reflects well on the people who put this study together, because this is not how scientists conduct themselves. This is how political actors conduct themselves. This is how people with political motives and political objectives conduct themselves.

When it comes to random strangers demanding answers from gun owners on how many and what kinds of guns they own, gun owners are going to lie, they’re going to do it with extreme prejudice, and they’re going to do it for sound reasons. As the coverage of this poll demonstrates, nobody who calls your home asking how many guns you own has your best interest in mind. Most gun owners knows this. It’s a shame the gun controllers won’t just admit it.

The Doctor Who Loves UK’s NHS Has No Idea What She’s Talking About,"In a recent blog post that went viral, American gynecologist Jen Gunter made sweeping declarations about the superiority of the British National Health Service, the government-run, taxpayer-funded system that provides medical care throughout the United Kingdom.

What inspires her impassioned stance? Years of research into the pros and cons of each system? Extensive experiences with the NHS as well as the U.S. system? Not quite.

On a recent visit to the United Kingdom, Gunter’s cousin twisted her ankle. Gunter accompanied her to an emergency room. The wonderful staff, who didn’t ask for payment, politely and promptly treated her cousin. (Presumably lost on Gunter was the fact that her cousin had already paid out the nose in taxes to the NHS for her treatment.) There might have been unicorns involved—it’s not clear.

She then juxtaposes this one interaction against the very real problems facing the U.S. system, declaring the NHS the winner. It’s the rhetorical equivalent of me saying I had a great trip to the doctor in America, therefore the NHS sucks.

The NHS Is No Model System, Folks

What Gunter and other champions of the British model fail to note — or quite possibly aren’t aware of — is that the NHS has some serious problems of its own. The system is 2.45 billion pounds (roughly $3 billion) in debt. Doctors are again threatening to strike over a new government contract that would require them to provide more extensive care (i.e., work more) on the weekends. (They rightly argue that they are overworked already.) The waiting list for routine operations has reached 3.34 million people.

But, you know, Gunter’s cousin got codeine almost immediately for her ankle, so therefore the NHS is outstanding.

It wasn’t a surprise that her post went viral, although when news outlets such as MSN began running excerpts from it as irrefutable proof of the superiority of socialized medicine, they made serious asses of themselves.

Americans frustrated by outrageous medical costs, obstacles to care, and statistics that contrast our system unfavorably with health care in other developed countries are rightly looking at the alternatives. Yet many do not observe that these studies often compare apples to steel-toed boots regarding the sheer size and diversity of the populace the U.S. system serves. I suggest we look beyond anecdotes provided by tourists such as Gunter when making comparisons.

Socialized Care Is Substandard, Rationed Care

There are very real gaps in the care socialized medicine provides. Gunter and others like her fail to address, or possibly learn in the first place, what these are. An example near and dear to my heart is the lack of preventive care provided under many of these systems. In the United Kingdom, where I lived off and on for seven years, you don’t have “well visits.” You see a doctor only once a problem is apparent. This never really bothered me until I became a mother.

For the first seven months of my son’s life, I was essentially on my own in fostering his health. A lactation consultant lectured me on the evils of bottle feeding, and a midwife weighed him two days after he was born, but that was it. My son didn’t have a pediatrician. He saw the same doctor I did, a man who admitted he knew little about babies and would Google my questions.

The difference when we moved to the United States was stark. Right away my son’s pediatrician noted he had weak muscle tone and was behind in several key areas of development. After an MRI, it was determined he had autism. He started a rigorous course of treatment including speech, physical, occupational, and feeding therapy. He is now incredibly high-functioning, which would not have been the case had his condition been spotted later on.

When my American-born daughter presented with the same issues, an MRI revealed she had neuroblastoma, a form of pediatric cancer. She underwent chemotherapy and numerous surgeries and is now a healthy six-year-old. Her oncologist told me she is often disheartened when she attends international conferences and talks to European doctors forced to rely on outdated protocols when treating patients because they haven’t been able to convince the government it’s worth spending more on newer therapies.

The preventive care built into our system made all the difference for my kids. Unlike Gunter, I won’t now declare the system “superior.” It has way too many problems to earn that title. But I would suggest that in seeking alternatives, our nation work on building a system that eliminates flaws, not simply shifts to different ones.

Watch Trevor Noah Accidentally Destroy The Case For Gun Control,"Trevor Noah, the host of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, accidentally destroyed the case for gun control during his show on Wednesday night.

Noah’s accidental broadside against gun-free zones came during a portion of his opening monologue in which he made fun of a Minnesota man fed up with Islamic terrorism. The target of Noah’s ire was an ice cream shop owner in a small town southeast of St. Cloud, Minnesota — the site of a mass stabbing at a mall last weekend — who put up a sign outside of his restaurant that read, “Muslims Get Out.”

Noah mocked the store owner for a little bit, but then he moved on to the meat of his opening bit by mocking the man’s rationale for his “Muslims Get Out” sign:

You know what’s also strange is this man genuinely thought people who go around blowing people up would be stopped by a sign? You realize you’re talking to terrorists, not vampires. They don’t need to be invited in, alright? Or maybe he’s onto something, because if you think about it, we’ve never tried that. We’ve never actually tried to repel terrorists with signs. Yeah, maybe that’s all the airports need is a sign that says “No Terrorists,” yes? Yeah, and then guys are going to be walking going, “Oh, I was going to blow up the airport, but the rules are rules and they said I can’t come in. They said I can’t. They said I can’t come in.”

Does that argument sound familiar?

Noah probably doesn’t know it, but he just accidentally made an airtight case against gun-free zones in particular and gun control in general. He is 100 percent correct: people hell-bent on murdering as many people as possible don’t really care about silly signs or laws that tell them not to murder people. A sign that says “No Guns” will no more keep a violent jihadi from gunning down a bunch of innocent people than will a sign that says “Muslims Get Out.” And how do we know that gun-free zones, nearly always marked with signs designating them as such, don’t deter murderous psychopaths? Because mass shootings, rather than happening at gun ranges or in gun stores, keep happening in gun-free zones.

Contrary to Trevor Noah’s snarky assertion that “we’ve never tried to repel terrorists with signs,” our country has fecklessly tried for years to “repel terrorists with signs.”

The Sandy Hook massacre? Gun-free zone. Columbine? Gun-free zone. The Aurora movie theater shooting? Gun-free zone. The shooting last year at an Oregon community college? Gun-free zone. The shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette? Gun-free zone. The attack on a military recruiting center in Chattanooga? Gun-free zone. The Ft. Hood shooting? You guessed it: gun-free zone. The San Bernardino attack? Gun-free zone. And the massacre perpetrated by an ISIS enthusiast at an Orlando night club? Gun-free zone.

While Noah clearly doesn’t grasp the logical implications of his argument, his particular insight — that evil people who want to do evil things will find ways to carry out their schemes regardless of what signs you post or laws you pass — forms the foundation of the entire argument against gun control.

Bad people who want to murder you don’t care about your stupid signs and stupid laws.

New York City, for example, is a pressure cooker bomb-free zone. That mall in Minnesota was most definitely a weaponized knife-free zone. And yet… Terrorists don’t care that terrorism is illegal. They care about killing you. And they’ll kill you with whatever they can, whether it’s a gun, a knife, a pressure cooker, or a box cutter.

“Yeah, but this just proves we need to have stricter gun laws to prevent terrorists from getting guns in the first place,” Trevor Noah might respond. “Gun control is about more than just signs telling people not to do stuff.”

Except it’s not. The entire premise of gun control is that words on a piece of paper somewhere will prevent a terrorist from killing people. What is a law if not a sign that says what you’re allowed and not allowed to do? Yet time and time and time and time again, strict gun control regimes have completely failed to prevent mass murderers from committing mass murder. Chicago and Washington, D.C., have some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation, yet those laws have done little to stem the tide of gun crime in those cities.

As Trevor Noah demonstrated via his mockery of the Minnesota man with the “Muslims Get Out” sign at his restaurant, the logic of gun control that says signs forbidding bad stuff stops bad stuff from happening is nonsensical. “Words stop bad things from happening” is just dumb. A sign that says “Muslims Get Out” will do absolutely nothing to prevent radical Islamists from wreaking havoc. Trevor Noah understands this. If only he would learn to apply his logic to the argument from gun controllers that all we need to end violence are a few more signs telling terrorists not to use guns.

"If Keith Lamont Scott Had Followed Gun Laws, Would He Still Be Alive?","The black man shot and killed by a black police officer in Charlotte, N.C. Tuesday was a felon who had gone to prison for seven years, making it illegal for him to possess a firearm.

According to records from Bexar County, Texas, Keith Lamont Scott was convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in July 2005 and sentenced to seven years in prison. In relation to that case, he was charged and found guilty of evading arrest. He was also charged with unlawfully carrying a weapon, reckless driving, and assaulting his wife, but these charges were later dismissed.

Here is information about the case from the Bexar County Clerk of Court, followed by the list of other charges in Texas:

As reported in the Charlotte Observer (but buried at the very bottom of a lengthy post), Scott also has a criminal history in North Carolina and South Carolina, dating back to 1992.

A public records search shows Scott was convicted in April 2004 of a misdemeanor assault with a deadly weapon charge in Mecklenburg County. Other charges stemming from that date were dismissed: felony assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, and the misdemeanors assault on a child under 12, assault on a female, and communicating threats. In 1992, Scott was charged in Charleston County, S.C., with several different crimes on different dates, including carrying a concealed weapon (not a gun), simple assault, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He pleaded guilty to all charges. Scott also was charged with aggravated assault in 1992 and assault with intent to kill in 1995. Both charges were reduced, but the disposition of the cases is unclear.

Scott’s criminal record is significant in light of police reports that he was carrying a gun at the time of his fatal encounter with a police officer this week. Under federal law (18 U.S.C 922(g)(1-9)), it is illegal for anyone who has been “convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year” to possess a firearm.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police chief told reporters Wednesday that officers have said Scott had a handgun when he got out of his car. When he refused to drop the weapon, that’s when officers shot him.

“It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” Chief Kerr Putney said.

Video footage from a dash-cam of the incident was made available to Scott’s family Wednesday. After viewing the video, the family said they wanted the videos released to the public immediately. In an emailed statement, the family’s attorney, Justin Bamberg, said, “After watching the videos, the family again has more questions than answers.”

Bamberg said it was impossible to see what was in Scott’s hands, and that “he was slowly walking backwards” when he was shot.

Despite reports from sources within the department that say the video shows Scott with a gun, Putney also said he can’t see Scott’s hands well enough to determine whether he was holding a weapon.

“The angle in which he’s standing, I can’t see his hands,” Putney told CNN. “Therefore, I can’t see a weapon in his hands or him pointing a weapon that would be in his hands. I can’t see, based on the angle, that definitive piece of visual evidence that I need.”

However, Putney said, a gun was found at the scene beside Scott.

“We have various statements that he had the weapon, that he wouldn’t drop it, after repeated verbal commands,” Putney said. “At the incident, there is a weapon recovered right there in close proximity to the subject.”

When Megyn Kelly of Fox News asked Putney Thursday night if he had “any doubt” that Scott had a gun, the police chief said even though it would be good to have video evidence, sometimes that’s not enough.

“There’s a lot of other evidence that I can’t speak to further,” he said. “The State Bureau of Investigations, an independent investigative body, has taken over. I really can’t speak to the investigation further, but there’s a lot of other evidence that gives us a great deal of support and comfort that the version that you heard from us before is supported by the evidence. . . . that version is still very much accurate.”

When Kelly asked him about fingerprints on the gun and whether it was registered to Scott, Putney said that’s all very relevant, but he can’t speak about it now with the ongoing investigation.

Having a criminal record like Scott’s doesn’t give police officers license to shoot. However, the facts about Scott’s criminal history cast doubt on the narrative that he was a gentle family man who was just sitting in his car reading a book.

CNN Has Absolutely No Clue How Gun Laws Work,"CNN published on Tuesday a comprehensive update on the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by police in Charlotte, North Carolina. The article, entitled “Keith Scott Shooting: What we know a week later” and written by CNN reporters Catherine Shoichet and Polo Sandoval, purports to tell readers all of the relevant facts surrounding the shooting. Unfortunately, the CNN report leaves out some vital facts while wildly misstating or misrepresenting others.

The most glaring omission in the report is any mention that police witnessed Scott in possession of illegal drugs. That fact is key, because Scott’s simultaneous possession of a firearm and use of illegal drugs is a glaring violation of both state and federal law. When police initially witnessed Scott in possession of marijuana, which is illegal under both federal law and North Carolina law, they chose to ignore it, because they were in the area to serve a warrant on a separate individual. He was not a priority at that time. Police did not move in on Scott until they also witnessed him brandishing a gun while under the influence of illegal drugs.

It is impossible to understand how or why police chose to confront Scott without knowing about his use of illegal drugs and his illegal possession of a firearm while under the influence of illegal drugs. Here’s how Slate described the importance of this fact in this article with the headline “Marijuana Possession Played Key Role in Police Shooting of Keith Scott”:

Possession of marijuana played a significant role in the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference that officers were trying to serve a warrant for someone else when they spotted Scott rolling “what they believed to be a marijuana ‘blunt’ ” in his car. At first they allegedly didn’t think much of it, until they saw Scott had a weapon and thought, “uh-oh, this is a safety issue for us and the public,” Putney said.

The omission by CNN of Scott’s drug use is by itself enough to tar the rest of CNN’s attempt at objective reporting, but CNN’s reporting only gets worse from there. In fact, it appears that CNN has little to no understanding about the federal and state laws governing possession and use of handguns in North Carolina:

Officers decided to approach Scott after Officer Brentley Vinson saw Scott hold up a gun up while in his SUV, police have said.



North Carolina is an open-carry state, meaning gun owners can carry their firearms in public and openly in their vehicles.

That is not true. North Carolina law does not allow all “gun owners” to carry firearms in public and openly in their vehicles. North Carolina law allows legal gun owners to openly carry firearms in public without a permit. Scott was not a legal gun owner by any stretch of the imagination. As a formerly imprisoned felon convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, Scott was permanently banned from gun possession and gun ownership by both federal and state law.

In addition to omitting Scott’s illegal drug use, CNN also conveniently forgot to disclose that Scott was not allowed to so much as touch a gun, let alone carry one around in public. Scott’s gun possession didn’t just violate one gun law (the law against felon possession), but two (the law against possession while under the influence). CNN didn’t see fit to mention either of these key facts, which undoubtedly influenced the police decision to confront him.

But let’s get back to CNN’s implication that Scott was legally allowed to be handling his firearm in his car because North Carolina is an “open carry” state. CNN’s passive-aggressive assertion requires a near-total ignorance of how open-carry laws like those in North Carolina actually work.

For starters, Scott was not “open carrying.” He was actually carrying his weapon concealed in an ankle holster, and he was doing so without a permit (state law prohibits the state from issuing concealed carry permits to convicted felons like Scott). According to the North Carolina Department of Justice, “It is unlawful to transport a weapon (absent a proper permit) that is BOTH concealed and readily accessible to a person.” Even if Scott were not prohibited from carrying any weapon, concealed or otherwise, his method of carry in his vehicle was a clear violation of North Carolina law. A gun concealed in an ankle holster, itself concealed by someone’s pants, is the near-polar opposite of “open carrying.”

This brings us to CNN’s next egregious error. “Open carry” laws do not allow individuals to walk around in public with a gun in their hand. In the absence of an imminent mortal threat which requires the threat and potential use of deadly force, handling a firearm in public is a gigantic no-no. The term used for this type of illegal handling is called “brandishing.” Open-carry laws do not, by any stretch of the imagination, authorize individuals to brandish firearms or to openly handle them in such a manner that a reasonable person would take the exhibition of the weapon to be a threat.

Contrary to what CNN suggested, the term “open carry” has a near-universal legal definition: it is the visible carrying (not handling) of a weapon via a visible holster for handguns, or via a shoulder or chest-mounted sling for a rifle. Police officers open-carry their handguns on a belt-mounted holster, usually on their hips.

Rather than lawfully open carrying, as CNN implies Scott was doing, Scott was actually a felon (legally banned from gun possession) under the influence of drugs (which also legally bans an individual from gun possession) who was carrying a concealed weapon (which is banned for non-permit holders) which he then brandished (also illegal) and which he then refused to surrender to police (also illegal).

It would be extremely difficult for Scott to have simultaneously violated any more gun laws than he did. Police saw him smoking marijuana and decided to give him a pass on his apparent penchant for weed since they were focused on more important matters. It wasn’t until Scott, by openly using illegal drugs while in possession of a firearm, left police no choice but to confront him. Yet CNN didn’t just refuse to provide that information, its reporters went out of their way to mischaracterize North Carolina’s gun laws. Its readers deserve better than lies and half-truths about what happened in Charlotte.

4 Big Unanswered Questions About The Kardashian Robbery,"Kim Kardashian West was allegedly robbed at gunpoint last night in her luxury apartment in Paris. The “Keeping Up With The Kardashians” star was reportedly approached by five men dressed as police officers who forced their way into her apartment, where she was bound and gagged in the bathroom. The thieves reportedly held a gun to her head while they stole more than $10 million dollars worth of jewelry.

1. Why Was Her Security so Loose?

Here’s what we know: her personal bodyguard, Pascal Duvier, wasn’t with her at the time. The building’s night watchman, whom the robbers easily overpowered, was her only source of protection last night.

Michael Jackson’s former security chief has put the family on blast for not taking additional security measures after a run-in with a creepy prankster four days earlier.

2. Is It Possible This Is a Hoax?

His rebuke raises questions: was the building’s concierge really the only person protecting Kim? If so, why was her security team that careless? Is it possible this level of gross negligence points to a coordinated effort that her team, or even Kim herself, was in on?

Just hours before the alleged robbery, Kardashian tweeted about her bodyguard always being in her shot, yet at the time of the incident, he was away with her sisters at a nightclub instead of protecting Kim.

This guy is always in my shot! pic.twitter.com/7LC6ewaYPO — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) October 2, 2016

This brings us to a bigger, underlying question about this entire ordeal: is it possible the robbery is a hoax or some sort of stunt? Kanye has been very vocal about his money woes. Is it possible this is an elaborate plot to collect insurance money in an effort to solve her husband’s cash flow problem? The Internet seems to think so.

Some have compared Kim to Ryan Lochte, while others think the timing of her husband’s discovery of the news was fishy. Last night, Kanye West was told about the news mid-concert, prompting a dramatic walk-off from the stage.

The moment Kanye heard Kim Kardashian was being held at gunpoint by armed men inside her hotel room in Paris

https://t.co/azWb6sTaKD — E (@DevotedTroubler) October 3, 2016

Perfect timing!

If there’s any chance this is indeed a hoax, Paris officials would be smart to loudly say so in an effort to distance the crime. The headlines surrounding Kim’s robbery certainly won’t help the city’s attempt to revive its tourist industry after 130 people were killed by terrorists during a series of coordinated terrorist attacks in the city last November. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said Monday the city will cancel an expensive advertisement campaign, as the bad headlines surrounding Kim’s alleged ordeal will undo their investment.

3. How Did the Robbers Get a Gun?

Paris, after all, is basically one big gun-free zone. So how did these jewel thieves get their hands on a weapon that’s so tightly controlled? To own a gun in France, one must obtain a hunting or sporting license and undergo annual psychological evaluations. Unlike in the United States, in France no one is guaranteed the right to bear arms.

France’s heavy restrictions on guns aren’t preventing people from illegally obtaining them anyway — the number of illegally owned firearms is estimated to be double the number of legally owned ones, according to The Washington Post. In short, it wouldn’t be difficult for a ring of jewel thieves to get their hands on a gun (or several). So, how did these robbers get a gun? Did they obtain one illegally? If so, how are France’s gun laws helping anyone?

4. Will Kim Walk Back Her Support for Gun Control?

What’s perhaps the most ironic part of the entire ordeal is that Kim was allegedly robbed at gunpoint while unable to protect herself. In light of her recent ordeal, will she rethink her support for gun control?

Bre Payton was a staff writer for The Federalist. She wrote on subjects ranging from Kanye West to Supreme Court rulings, to 2016 and breaking news. She appeared on Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, NPR, BBC World News, among others, and her work was featured in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Daily Signal, and WORLD Magazine, to name a few. She had also worked as a reporter for Watchdog.org and received her degree in Political Journalism from Patrick Henry College.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/10/03/4-big-unanswered-questions-kardashian-robbery/,2016-10-03
Libertarian Veep Pick Weld Shifts Stance On Guns,"In a speech in Philadelphia Thursday, Libertarian Party vice presidential candidate Bill Weld displayed a shift from his previous stances about the right to bear arms.

After a few questions about the Veterans Administration—Weld favors privatizing it on the Medicare model—one college-age supporter at the Temple University event asked how, if the Constitution guarantees the right to life, can it also countenance the right to bear arms as broadly as it does in twenty-first-century America?

Given Weld’s support for restricting Second Amendment rights in Massachusetts when he served as governor there, a libertarian could be forgiven for questioning his commitment to the Constitution here.

Gun Rights Protect Our Right to Life

Weld first gently dismissed the student’s constitutional argument, noting that document also enshrines the right to bear arms, and that the right to life in no way contradicts it. As he extended his argument, Weld did not rely on the more mainstream arguments about sportsmen and home protection. Instead, he adopted the classical liberal approach—the one the Founding Fathers favored—of insisting that personal firearms ownership is essential for the defense against a tyrannical government.

In nations where the state has deprived the citizens of guns, Weld noted, liberty has not fared so well. That defense of gun ownership, in particular, is telling; it is usually not one offered by lukewarm gun controllers looking to hide their opposition to gun rights. Like many ideas of small-l libertarians, it harkens back to the natural law on which our Bill of Rights is based.

Weld drew on his background as a federal prosecutor to describe the need for keeping guns out of the hands of terrorists and people with mental illness, spending more time on the need to effectively fight the latter group. Many Libertarians may question his timely change of heart on guns. But in making a vigorous defense of Second Amendment liberties, it appears Johnson and the Libertarian Party may be rubbing off on Weld.

Weld’s History on Guns

Weld’s history on the right to bear arms is varied, but mostly on the side of the gun controllers. When he ran for governor of Massachusetts as a Republican in 1990, he opposed an assault-weapons ban. Three years later, have caved to the majority-Democrat legislature and supported a ban. Weld even went further, as The New York Times noted in an article that year: “His proposed legislation would also limit the number of handguns an individual could buy and would impose tough penalties for illegal gun sales and gun-related crimes.”

While more jail time for criminals who use guns is popular with most Americans and consistent with the Constitution, other limitations Weld backed in 1993 are off-limits to most Libertarians and Republicans. Indeed, questions about Weld’s gun control record formed one basis for opposition to his nomination at the Libertarian National Convention earlier this year.

If Weld has, indeed, changed his mind on the topic—and his comments last week should leave no doubt of that—the Johnson-Weld campaign would do well to get that message out if they wish to attract anti-Trump conservatives and other voters interested in preserving their Second Amendment rights.

Weld on the Campaign Trail

The event’s turnout would be considered light for a major-party nominee, but was credible for a third-party candidate on a rainy day in a very Democratic neighborhood. Weld’s speech was positive, and more policy-focused than much of what passes for oratory in 2016. Much of what he said was standard fare for a moderate Libertarian, but his Second Amendment shift may help reassure conservatives considering voting for him and Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson in November.

Although he described himself as having been a “small-l libertarian” since the 1970s, Weld’s stump speech was, like most of the Johnson-Weld effort this year, more reminiscent of John Anderson than Ron Paul. It is not the worst approach, under the circumstances. When the two major-party candidates are both widely perceived as corrupt and unlikeable, preaching apolitical sanity and compromise makes a lot of sense.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/10/03/libertarian-veep-pick-weld-shifts-stance-guns/,2016-10-03
Support For Assault Weapons Ban Hits Record Low,"Support for a so-called assault weapons ban in the U.S. just hit a record low of 36 percent, according to a new Gallup poll released on Wednesday. The poll showed that 61 percent of American adults now oppose a ban. That level of opposition is the highest ever recorded.

Increasing opposition to the 1990’s-era gun ban isn’t just limited to Republicans. Gallup’s data show that opposition to the ban has increased across the board. Barely 50 percent of Democrats currently support the ban today, compared to 63 percent support from Democrats in 1996, just two years after the federal ban was signed into law. Less than a third of independents currently support a ban, while Republican support hovers at 25 percent.

An assault weapons ban is also widely opposed by those who don’t even own guns. Gallup’s latest survey found that only 45 percent of households without guns support the ban, compared to 26 percent support among households with guns.

In its summary of the new poll, Gallup expressed surprise at the results and described flagging support for a ban in the midst of a terrorism spree as a “paradox”:

Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut.

Gallup also completely botched both its definition of “assault weapon” and its characterization of “assault rifles” in the introductory paragraph of its poll summary:

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The fewest Americans in 20 years favor making it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess semi-automatic guns known as assault rifles. Thirty-six percent now want an assault weapons ban, down from 44% in 2012 and 57% when Gallup first asked the question in 1996.

Contrary to Gallup’s characterization, the terms “assault weapon” and “assault rifle” are neither synonymous nor interchangeable. An assault rifle, by definition, must be capable of both semi-automatic (one round fired per trigger pull) and fully automatic fire (multiple rounds fired per trigger pull). This combined capability is referred to as select-fire or selective-fire. The U.S. military defines an assault rifle as a “selective-fire rifle chambered for a cartridge of intermediate power.” If you Google the term “assault rifle,” the search engine will tell you that an assault rifle is “a rapid-fire, magazine-fed automatic rifle designed for infantry use.” Long story short: if a rifle is purely semi-automatic, it is by definition not an assault rifle.

Actual assault rifles have been heavily regulated in the U.S. since 1934. In 1986, the new manufacture of these types of guns for non-military use was banned outright. Under current law, civilians may only own pre-1986 assault rifles if they possess a special tax stamp issued by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). These stamps cost hundreds of dollars, require extensive background checks, and take months (if not years) to be issued by the ATF.

For that reason, the 1994 assault weapons ban is completely agnostic on the legality of civilian ownership of fully automatic assault rifles. One problem faced by the authors of the 1994 law was that there was no accepted definition of what constitutes an assault weapon. Is it any object that can be used to assault someone? Or is it any gun that can be used to assault someone? If it’s the latter, are there guns that are designed in such a way that it would be impossible to assault someone with them?

Rather than being a specific dictionary or industry term, “assault weapon” is a purely political invention. Outside the law, it can mean whatever its user wishes it to mean. Within the confines of the 1994 law, however, it had a specific meaning (and one wholly unrelated to Gallup’s characterization of what constitutes an assault weapon).

Under the 1994 law, a semi-automatic rifle magically became a banned assault weapon if it had any two of the following five cosmetic features in addition to a detachable magazine: a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor, or a grenade launcher. Those features have no real impact on the functionality of a weapon. A gun that lacked those cosmetic features would be every bit as lethal as one that included every single feature. In fact, to get around the law, many owners simply pinned and welded their stocks and pinned and welded a muzzle brake to the barrel to make their rifles compliant with the 1994 law. And contrary to the predictions by the law’s supporters that its expiration in 2004 would lead to a rifle-fueled crime wave, the exact opposite happened. Even today, you are more likely to be killed by someone’s fists or feet than you are to be killed by a bullet fired from a rifle (pistols, not rifles, are the weapon preferred by the overwhelming majority of violent criminals).

Which brings us back to Gallup’s alleged paradox of opposition to the so-called assault weapons ban increasing in the midst of a wave of terrorist shootings. There is actually nothing at all paradoxical about it. Americans understand that terrorists want to murder us, and that our laws are no obstacle to their blood lust. They will use planes, or bombs, or trucks, or knives, or boxcutters, or guns. Just as strict gun control laws in cities like Chicago and Washington, D.C., have done nothing to prevent sky-high murder rates in those cities year after year, poorly thought out laws regulating rifles will do nothing to prevent terrorists from trying to murder innocent Americans.

Americans also understand that while gun control laws don’t necessarily deter violent criminals or terrorists, they do make it harder for innocent Americans to protect themselves from those same criminals and terrorists. And when you take into account the U.S. government’s continued failure to protect its people from terrorist attacks, increasing opposition to laws that make it harder for people to defend themselves and their families makes perfect sense. If the government is not willing or able to perform its duty to protect the homeland, then people will feel compelled take matters into their own hands, and they will bristle at any attempt to neuter their right to self-defense.

The new Gallup poll showing record low support for new gun control laws shows that Americans understand just fine both the futility of gun control laws and the new reality of a government that can’t prevent terrorism. That’s not a paradox. It’s common sense.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/10/26/american-support-assault-weapons-ban-hits-record-low/,2016-10-26
What The Shootout At The O.K. Corral Tells Us About Gun-Free Zones,"Get into a debate on the subject of guns and before long someone will bring up the Wild West. The assumption is that anyone who supports the Second Amendment also supports gunfights in the street at high noon or is so naïve as to believe that such gunfights are not at the end of this particular slippery slope.

Of course, this, as with so many other anti-gun arguments, is based on a fallacy. Most of the famous gunfighters were, in fact, outlaws. The rest were the lawmen who fought them. Take Jesse James, for example. A bank robber, murderer, and all-around bad guy, he operated outside the law and thus wouldn’t be restrained by anti-gun laws. Gunfights weren’t happening among law-abiding citizens. Sound familiar?

The most (in)famous of Wild West gunfights was likely the shootout at the O.K. Corral, which took place 135 years ago this week. It isn’t quite what those who don’t support gun rights would have you believe.

Virgil Earp was deputy U.S. marshal for Pima County, Arizona as well as the town marshal of Tombstone. As such, he was the law. Along with his brothers, special policemen Morgan and Wyatt, and temporary policeman Doc Holliday, he had been involved in an ongoing feud with a group of outlaws calling themselves The Conchise County Cowboys (or simply The Cowboys), led by Johnny Ringo.

Since the Earp brothers had interfered with The Cowboys’ illegal activities, they had received death threats from the group so, to keep the town of Tombstone safe from The Cowboys and other outlaws, local officials made it a weapon-free zone. The City Council passed Ordinance 9 on April 19, 1881, requiring all weapons to be left at the livery or saloon when their owners were in Tombstone. As town marshal, Virgil Earp was in charge of enforcing this.

The ordinance read:

To Provide against Carrying of Deadly Weapons (effective April 19, 1881). Section 1: It is hereby declared to be unlawful for any person to carry deadly weapons, concealed or otherwise [except the same be carried openly in sight, and in the hand] within the limits of the City of Tombstone. Section 2: This prohibition does not extend to persons immediately leaving or entering the city, who, with good faith, and within reasonable time are proceeding to deposit, or take from the place of deposit such deadly weapon. Section 3: All fire-arms of every description, and bowie knives and dirks, are included within the prohibition of this ordinance.

The shootout at the O.K. Corral began when Earp tried to confiscate The Cowboys’ weapons as they entered Tombstone, a violation which put both law enforcement and citizens at risk. This wasn’t the only instance of gun-free zones in the so-called Wild West.

“Carrying of guns within the city limits of a frontier town was generally prohibited. Laws barring people from carrying weapons were commonplace, from Dodge City to Tombstone,” said Adam Winkler, a professor at UCLA’s School of Law and author of “Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.” “When Dodge City residents first formed their municipal government, one of the very first laws enacted was a ban on concealed carry. The ban was soon after expanded to open carry, too. The Hollywood image of the gunslinger marching through town with two Colts on his hips is just that — a Hollywood image, created for its dramatic effect.”

It seems that those who oppose the Second Amendment have been taking Hollywood fantasy for fact when it comes to guns in the Wild West. The truth is that the most famous gunfight in American history happened in a gun-free zone, and it is the anti-gun groups who seek to send us back to the rough-and-tumble days of the old West.

These laws have been tried time and again, and have been failing America for 150 years. It is often the good guys with guns who stop the outlaws, and the outlaws who choose to carry when the law says they cannot, like that day in Tombstone, Arizona 135 years ago.

"Dear Lefties: If You Don’t ‘Feel Safe,’ You Can Always Buy Some Guns","After Donald Trump’s smashing electoral victory earlier this week, a familiar liberal phenomenon was given new life: the “I-don’t-feel-safe” meme.

Many people were moved to feel “unsafe” as Trump claimed the presidency over Hillary Clinton. One woman, an immigrant from the United Kingdom, said: “I don’t feel safe here anymore.” At Northwestern University, according to the school’s newspaper, “Muslim students feel unsafe.” One high school student in Seattle said, “We feel unsafe with our futures.” At Upworthy, a self-identified “queer black woman” explained “how you can help [her] feel safe in Trump’s America.”

Now, on the one hand, this is all sort of silly. “Feeling unsafe” has become a time-honored tradition in modern America, all the more so under Trump. Indeed, earlier this year at Emory University it only took the word “Trump” written in chalk for students to feel “unsafe.” But this is all kind of goofy. There is no real indication—yet, anyway—that “Trump’s America” will be a less-safe country for anyone.

On the other hand, it’s somewhat understandable: Trump has courted racists throughout his brief political career, he has been inexcusably rude and depraved towards women both now and in the past, and he has invigorated a small but vocal faction of “alt-right” bigot maniacs. So we can sympathize with people who think a Trump presidency might be at least theoretically dangerous for certain demographics.

With that in mind, here is a suggestion for anyone who feels newly “unsafe” in the United States of America: buy some guns and train yourself well how to use them.

Seriously—do it. There are few better ways to protect yourself against violence, terrorism, and oppression than firearms. Ida B. Wells knew it, as did Frederick Douglass—two Americans who had more than enough reason to feel “unsafe” throughout their lives.

It’s an Acquired Skill

The good news is that, in America, your gun rights have never been more widespread and more accessible. Barring some states that make it difficult to buy a gun, it is easy enough to acquire a good firearm for your own personal protection.

Of course, you should absolutely learn how to use a gun before arming yourself with one. But there’s good news there, too: you can find a gun safety course just about everywhere. The National Rifle Association—the nation’s oldest civil rights group and an absolutely dogged defender of your right to keep and bear arms—has countless resources to help you find a safety course near you.

Once you’ve familiarized yourself well with the basics of gun safety, you should buy a gun. If you’re unsure of which gun you want to buy, you can check out the innumerable gun ranges around the country. Most of these ranges will let you rent the weapon of your choice and test it out as much as you want. The staff at these ranges will usually be happy to give you tips on how to improve your accuracy and your basic firearm handling skills.

Next, Get a Concealed-Carry License

Once you’ve become proficient at handling firearms (and you’ve committed yourself to a good training regimen to keep your skills sharp), you can apply for a concealed-carry license. Thanks to the relentless efforts of state-level Republican Party officials, it has never been easier to get your concealed-carry permit: every state has a concealed-carry law on the books, and the vast majority of them are “shall-issue,” meaning the state cannot prohibit you from acquiring your license unless you are forbidden by law from having one.

Many historically persecuted minority groups have found gun ownership to be a wonderful way to provide for their security. In the wake of the Orlando terrorist attacks this year, gay Americans began heavily patronizing gun stores. If certain groups or demographics feel “unsafe” in the United States now that Trump will be president in January, they are free (and encouraged) to follow the lead of their LGBTQ fellow citizens.

One of the reasons America is great is that, even now, we recognize that the citizen is sovereign, and that he or she retains certain inalienable rights that government has no authority to take away. One of those rights is self-defense—and any American who is genuinely concerned about his or her safety can avail himself or herself of that right very easily.

This is a troubling time for America. But we are still the greatest country on earth. And we should not neglect the Second Amendment, a constitutional provision that, for more than two centuries, has helped keep it that way.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/11/11/dear-lefties-dont-feel-safe-can-always-buy-guns/,2016-11-11
Progressives Demand Gun Control After Knife Attack At Ohio State,"Progressives used a brutal knife attack at Ohio State University (OSU) on Monday as an excuse to demand more gun control, even after authorities declared that they had no evidence the attacker even used a gun during his rampage.

The attacker reportedly struck pedestrians with his vehicle and proceeded to stab several others, harming at least nine individuals, one of whom is in critical condition. Despite OSU’s initial tweets stating there was an active shooter on campus, authorities later said there was no evidence that the attacker used a gun during his attack. The victims are being treated for stab wounds and injuries sustained from being struck by the attacker’s vehicle.

An OSU police officer shot and killed the machete-wielding attacker, believed to be an immigrant from Somalia, the university’s public safety director said in a statement, according to WNYC.

Even though there is currently no evidence a gun was used by the attacker, and even though a good guy with a gun was solely responsible for ending the attacker’s rampage, various progressive activists, celebrities, and journalists spent the morning using the attack as a pretext for demanding even stricter gun control laws.

It’s Not Gun Makers’ Fault People Commit Crimes With Their Products,"Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey has claimed that the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) makes a gun “the only product of its kinds for which Congress has given the industry extensive freedom from liability.” However, the PLCAA afforded no protections to the arms industry that did not already exist for all industries. Activists are targeting this law because it prevents the anti-gun lobby from using the legal system to bypass the legislature and cripple the lawful sale of arms, as Healy is attempting to do in Massachusetts.

The PLCAA, which was passed with bipartisan support, only shields manufacturers under a narrow set of circumstances. It prevents innocent firearms manufacturers from being held liable when criminals misuse their products. To understand the opposition, one must understand the nature of the lawsuits it was written to prevent.

Liability for What They Did, Not What They Didn’t Do

Many have heard of “strict products liability” but are unsure of exactly what it means. If one thinks that it simply means that a manufacturer must pay for any harm its goods cause, the argument against the PLCAA might make some sense. However, that is far from the reality.

Generally, manufacturers and dealers are held liable for any harm caused by products sold “in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user.” This includes manufacturing defects, unsafe design, and inadequate warnings. This means a plaintiff need not prove the manufacturer was at fault; he need only prove the existence of a defect. So, if a product is deemed “unreasonably dangerous,” a manufacturer would almost certainly lose a lawsuit involving harm from that product. This is why the anti-gun crowd salivates at this type of liability.

One might think that because guns are dangerous, they must fit in the PLCAA somewhere. However, this type of liability concerns products that are “unreasonably dangerous.” For instance, knives are dangerous, but everyone knows the whole purpose of a knife is to cut. Product liability theory does not mean that a knife-maker has to pay whenever someone is cut by a knife; it means they must pay if a defective knife hurts someone.

The knife paradigm applies directly to guns. The purpose of a gun is to poke holes at a distance, and everyone knows this. Just as I cannot claim that my knife was defective because I used it to cut something I shouldn’t have, I cannot claim that my gun was defective if I use it to poke a hole in something I shouldn’t have.

Say, though, my gun occasionally slings a round way off to the left, and someone is hurt because of that. In that case, the gun was defective, and the manufacturer can be held liable. This has always been the law, and the PLCAA did nothing to change that.

It’s Unjust to Punish People for Others’ Crimes

The PLCAA was enacted because certain judges, along with special interest groups, threatened to stray from existing law and impose liability in situations where guns behaved as designed but were misused by criminals. There was no basis for this type of liability, and Congress acted because “the possibility of imposing liability on an entire industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse of the legal system.”

All the PLCAA does is clarify existing law to protect the lawful business of selling arms. The act does not prevent any lawsuits where the dealers or manufacturers acted improperly, as evidenced by the recent lawsuit against Century Arms, which sold allegedly defective AK-47 variants. On this, the claim that the act protects “illegal and irresponsible” actions is patently false.

Healy and the anti-gun lobby are targeting PLCAA because it prevents them from joining forces with “a maverick judicial officer or a petit jury” to “expand civil liability in a manner never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution.” Even a single court ruling opposite the PLCAA could crush the lawful arms trade in that jurisdiction. Aside from abrogating the right to attain arms for citizens in that jurisdiction, such rulings would unconstitutionally burden commerce between that jurisdiction and other states. This is a core justification for the act, taken right from its text.

To understand that this law offers no special protection for the firearms industry, simply ask whether it would be just to hold Ford financially responsible for hit-and-runs committed by Mustang drivers. That is exactly what the anti-gun lobby seeks: to force lawful manufacturers and dealers to pay for the illegal use of their products. This serves only to create a loophole in the law, not close one.

"Sorry, New York Times, But ‘Smart Guns’ Are A Dumb Idea","The New York Times has a problem with guns. The problem is both personal and professional, namely: the fellows who run the Times do not know all that much about guns, and they do not care to take any steps to learn about them.

The problem manifests itself heterogeneously: they cannot seem to get guns right no matter how they approach them. They do not understand concealed carry laws. They do not understand gun statistics. They do not understand assault weapons bans. They do not understand the rules of NRA conventions. They do not understand Australia’s gun control laws. They do not understand concealed carry demographics.

Add to this extensive list another thing about firearms the Times does not understand: smart guns.

In an editorial published this past Sunday, the Times asks: “Why Not Smart Guns in This High-Tech Era?” The paper’s editors, you see, think guns should be “equipped with fingerprint scanners, radio frequency chips or other evolving technology that blocks anyone but the owner from using them,” and they are frustrated that “gun-lobby politics and threats” are keeping smart guns off the market, thus causing untold numbers of murders and suicides.

This would indeed be very troubling—if it were true, or anything resembling true. In fact, the “gun lobby” does not oppose smart gun technology. For example, the NRA, in its own words, “doesn’t oppose the development of ‘smart’ guns, nor does it oppose the ability of Americans to voluntarily acquire them.” Only in a New York Times editorial could you construe an explicit statement from the National Rifle Association to mean the exact opposite of what it means.

The Times refuses to look deeper than the false boogeyman it has created out of the NRA. There are three reasons gun-owning Americans are suspicious of, and reluctant to purchase, “smart guns.” These reasons merit serious consideration, which is perhaps why anti-gun folks are so reluctant to consider them.

1. Smart Guns Are Impractical

The first is entirely utilitarian: smart guns as they exist today are wholly impractical. When I say “impractical,” I mean, “Not practical enough that you’d want to risk your safety buying it.”

Case in point: last November the NRA-published magazine America’s 1st Freedom reviewed the Armatix iP1, the widely hailed firearm that some consider to be the first feasible “smart gun” on the market. What did they find? In their own words, “a number of very serious problems,” namely: a chronic tendency to jam, “the worst double-action trigger [they’ve] ever tested,” an inability to safely thumb the hammer forward, a limited range of functionality due to the radio frequency mechanism to which the gun is paired, and a sky-high price tag (nearly $1,800).

Dryly, the reviewers note that they found the pistol “greatly wanting.” Do tell. If this is the finest the smart gun market has to offer thus far, no wonder nobody wants anything to do with it. Would you want to drop nearly $2,000 on an unsafe, semi-non-functional, inconvenient gun?

People who buy guns do so to ensure that they can keep themselves and those they care about safe. They are generally not willing to leave that safety up to this kind of chance, even if The New York Times really, really thinks they should.

2. If You Need a Gun, You Can’t Fiddle

But what if these kinks can be ironed out and a smart gun can function perfectly every time it needs to be fired? Still there are reasonable objections to this technology.

Smart guns generally operate by way of a radio frequency identification device (RFID): you must be wearing a special watch, or a ring, or some other trinket for the gun to operate. But what happens if the watch batteries fail? What happens if you lose the ring? What happens if the device is damaged? Your gun becomes an inert object, utterly useless to you and your family. Most gun owners do not want to have to keep track of an easily lost or easily damaged item in order to ensure their gun works.

Moreover, the basic premise of an RFID device renders a smart gun far less practical than a normal one. Presumably you will want to keep the radio device and gun separate so children or other unauthorized users cannot easily access the gun. Unless you’re wearing the RFID device all the time, this naturally means that, in a domestic emergency, you’ll have to scramble for the device before the gun can even work.

If there’s an intruder in your house threatening your children or your spouse, you don’t want to have to run across (or out of) the room to find a small object, then run back to the other side of the room (or another room entirely) to get the gun. No serious student of self-defense will want to waste precious seconds running around assembling far-flung parts to make a firearm work.

The same time crunch applies to “fingerprint scanning,” as well: think of how often your iPhone fails to read your fingerprint properly. Would you want the same unreliable technology if your life were at stake?

3. The Danger of Giving Power to Control Freaks

Yet even if a smart gun owner is willing to sacrifice safety for a small sense of security, there is a third issue to consider, and it is the most troubling: the threat that, once smart gun technology becomes widespread, the government will mandate that all guns must be “smart.” This is not a conspiracy theory or even a simple academic exercise: it’s already the case in New Jersey.

This is a deeply concerning proposal. Not only would government-mandated smart gun technology make American firearms prohibitively expensive (thus denying the poor a valuable option for self-defense), but there is a chance the technology could be used against gun-owning Americans themselves. Criminals or mass shooters could theoretically scan a public area to determine who has a gun and thus whom to shoot first. They could also scan individual houses to see which contain firearms (thus giving the criminals advanced warning of the presence of a firearm) or who doesn’t (thus marking the house as an easy target).

Also, as the NRA itself confirmed, the iP1 features a “kill switch” that “[allows] it to be disabled by third parties.” Got that? Whoever owns an iP1 can have his handgun disabled remotely. Does that sound like a secure firearm to you?

Americans are wise to be mistrustful of smart gun technology. In its present state it is unreliable and expensive. Even if the technology improves, however, it is still intrinsically a risky and fraught choice for self-defense. Yet The New York Times editorial board cannot figure out why nobody wants to buy these guns. Perhaps they should try talking to some real gun owners in order to find out. But why would they start now?

Top 20 Most-Read Articles On The Federalist In 2016,"It’s been a wild year for us all, and some of that wildness translated into a great year of expanding readership at The Federalist. Here are the top 20 most-read articles on our site for 2016.

After all, Kerry could have said that Hiroshima was “a reminder of the depth of the obligation every one of us in public life carries to stop extremist regimes like Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.” Or he might have said Hiroshima was “a reminder of the depth of the obligation every one of us in public life carries to ensure that we are well prepared for the next force that threatens peace.”

In a new video, former Navy SEAL Dom Raso explains why the AR-15, the most popular rifle in the country, gives Americans the best chance of surviving in an age of terror.

“The only way for us to stay free was by having whatever guns the bad guys have,” he said. “This firearm gives average people the advantage they so desperately need and deserve to protect their life, liberty, and happiness.”

I did not even realize how hard I had been working to hide my true self until I met Mr. X, but suddenly it was as though all those awkward moments of my past came into focus and I could see the meaning of my whole life. I am—I always have been—the wife of Mr. X.

Coming out was one of the hardest decisions of my life, and at times the hatred and heartache I’ve faced have been worse than I could have imagined. Hardest of all is the rejection from Mr. X himself, who has declared publicly he has no interest in me whatsoever. But I know that no matter what anyone says, I have to be true to myself. And I know without a shadow of a doubt that my true identity is wife of Mr. X.

On Wednesday morning, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump asked Russia to turn over the tens of thousands of e-mails deleted by Hillary Clinton. The scandal-plagued former Secretary of State maintained for months that the e-mails were personal, not work-related, and that they were in no way classified.

But in a press release issued on Wednesday, Clinton’s top campaign spokesman suddenly declared those e-mails to be a “national security issue”…

These are just some instances of voter fraud we know about. It would be silly to assume cases that have been discovered are the only cases of fraud. Indeed according to a Pew Charitable Trust report from February 2012, one in eight voter registrations are “significantly inaccurate or no longer valid.” Since there are 146 million Americans registered to vote, this translates to a stunning 18 million invalid voter registrations on the books. Further, “More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters, and approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.” Numbers of this scale obviously provide ripe opportunity for fraud

Katie, get your gun lawyer.

By now you’ve probably heard about Katie Couric’s new anti-gun documentary “Under The Gun,” and how her producer doctored video of interviews with gun owners in order to make them look stupid and heartless. Couric’s producer and director, Stephanie Soechtig, admitted to doctoring the video, and Couric herself kinda sorta apologized for it.

But that’s not the worst thing that happened with the making of this documentary. It turns out that Couric’s production team deliberately conspired to violate federal gun laws. According to video obtained by Ammoland, a shooting sports news website, one of Couric’s producers deliberately committed at least four separate felonies by purchasing four separate firearms across state lines without a background check.

San Francisco 49er quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who recently refused to stand during the national anthem at a preseason game, just unloaded on Hillary Clinton.

“We have a presidential candidate who has deleted emails and done things illegally and is a presidential candidate,” he said, referring to the 15,000 emails Clinton “wiped” from her private, unsecured server she used during her tenure as secretary of State. “That doesn’t make sense to me.”

The case against Trump does not rest, ultimately, on his family life, his divorces, his casinos, strip clubs, bankruptcies, and lawsuits. It doesn’t rest on his personality: his generally mean-spirited demeanor, his lack of polish, his erratic temperament, weird hair, or vulgarity. Nor does it even rest on policy differences—his past support for Democrats, gun control, abortion, Planned Parenthood, or his generally awful foreign policy.

All these things are true, and some are good reasons for conservatives not to vote for him. A vote for Trump is a vote against the principles that Republicanism and conservatism are built on.

But I believe the case against Trump should go even further. I believe no American, conservative or liberal, should support Trump. He doesn’t simply violate conservative principles. He violates American principles. Donald Trump is a danger to self-government, civil liberties, the culture of democracy, and the ideals of a free and open society.

To the many things the Trump administration in waiting has made cool again, add private businesses refusing service to customers based on moral objections.

Friday, fashion designer Sophie Theallet, who has dressed the current first lady Michelle Obama, offered a preemptive refusal to hypothetically dress the next first lady, Melania Trump, should she ask for some of her clothes— presumably not the ones available at The Gap. In her unsolicited letter, Theallet informed the world that a person who did not ask for any of her clothes would not be getting them.

During a campaign stop at a coffee shop in Minnesota on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton told a young black woman to “go run for something” if she wouldn’t support the former secretary of State’s bid for the White House.

According to The Hill, the woman was confronting Clinton about the remarks she has made in the past, including comments she made about “super-predators” in 1996. Some people have taken those comments as digs at black men.

Clinton made reference to meeting a Somali-American city council member, presumably Abdi Warsame of the Minneapolis City Council, yet the woman persisted in arguing with Clinton.

Throughout the campaign, her opponent Bernie Sanders has criticized Clinton’s ability to deliver on her promises to crack down on Wall Street after taking more than $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in a year.

“Was that a mistake? Was that a bad error in judgment?” Anderson Cooper asked.

“Well, I dunno,” Clinton said. “That’s what they offered. Every secretary of State that I know has done that.”

Noah probably doesn’t know it, but he just accidentally made an airtight case against gun-free zones in particular and gun control in general. He is 100 percent correct: people hell-bent on murdering as many people as possible don’t really care about silly signs or laws that tell them not to murder people. A sign that says “No Guns” will no more keep a violent jihadi from gunning down a bunch of innocent people than will a sign that says “Muslims Get Out.” And how do we know that gun-free zones, nearly always marked with signs designating them as such, don’t deter murderous psychopaths? Because mass shootings, rather than happening at gun ranges or in gun stores, keep happening in gun-free zones.

Why am I telling you this? I’m sure you can guess. There’s a lot of talk about sexism and sexual assault recently because of tapes released about Donald Trump and several women who have never spoken before—some in more than 30 years—telling their stories of how he sexually assaulted them.

I don’t know whether their stories are true. If he’s guilty and found to be so in a court of law, then I hope he’s punished. I do wonder, however, why his accusers never mentioned these things when NBC hired Trump to be on national television. I wonder why they never mentioned it when he stepped into politics years ago. I wonder why they never mentioned it during the primaries. I wonder why they never mentioned it until October, just before the election.

By now you’ve probably seen this video from last fall in which a Yale student screams at a professor, insisting that a college campus ought not be an intellectual space, but a space to make students feel safe and at home. Now, newly resurfaced videos show what happened just before the aforementioned altercation took place.

“You should not sleep at night!” a female student shrieks at Yale sociology professor Nicholas Christakis in that video which has since gone viral. “You’re disgusting!”

If you reside in Utah, vote Evan McMullin (he is currently polling near dead even).

If you reside in New Mexico, vote for Gary Johnson.

If you are in the following swing states, vote for the highest-polling third-party candidate the week of the election: Iowa, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Maine.

I was convinced of many things watching the 10-part series: I was convinced the criminal justice system and Manitowoc County were likely corrupt, and that many people in that office wanted to see Avery end up back in jail. I was convinced that I was being manipulated by directors Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos (more on this later). I was definitely convinced that Avery was guilty of the murder. And, believe it or not, a viewer could believe all those things simultaneously.

The sad lot of the Electoral College is that what you see isn’t what you get. Like the counter-intuitive fact that a tire blowout on the right requires a steering wheel correction to the left, the EC works backwards. What appears to deprive the populace of its power to decide a president is the very mechanism that preserves its power. It works that way because this isn’t a democracy; not a pure one.

“Pure democracy” is just another phrase for “mob rule.” Dictatorship of the majority means 51 percent of the citizenry rule the other 49 percent. That minority has no rights except those the condescending majority grants. It works well for those in the 51 percent, not so much for those in the 49. Plato knew it, and James Madison, who knew his Plato, did too. Plato and Madison both recognized that justice and liberty for the minority is possible only when power is shared between groups in society.

A man with a concealed carry license stopped a shooter after the latter opened fire on a crowd of people at a nightclub in South Carolina early Sunday morning, according to WISTV.com.

After getting into a fight with another person, the 32-year-old suspect pulled out a gun and began to fire at a crowd of people gathered outside of the club, hitting and injuring four, WISTV reports. One of the victims, who holds a concealed-carry permit, shot back in self-defense, hitting the suspect in the leg.

In 2013, Michael Turner saved the life of a 16-year-old girl who had been viciously attacked and stabbed in a Target store in Pennsylvania. And instead of thanking him for protecting its customers and preventing them from being murdered, Target is now suing him for his heroism and alleging he acted irresponsibly.

The attacker, Leon Walls, was convicted of attempted homicide for stabbing then-16-year-old Allison Meadows in 2013.

Security footage from the store shows Walls grabbing Meadows and stabbing her before Turner tackles the knife-wielding perp and chases him out of the store with a baseball bat.

The invitation to engage as a child had revealed my whole dilemma: I didn’t hate the little girl in the photo. I hated her need. I hated her anonymity. I hated the visible proof that she loved her abuser. I hated that she didn’t know any better, that it took her another ten years to figure out why she still slept with the light on and showered in her underwear and vigilantly lined the crack under the bathroom door with a beach towel and destroyed her teeth with gum she relentlessly chewed as a means of escaping the recollection of his breath on her face. I hated that he fooled her. He fooled everybody. He was really good.

“Wake up!” I wanted to scream at her. “Can’t you see what’s going on? Do something about it!”

It’s the same desperate inclination I’m fighting today. Everywhere I read in the news, there’s talk of another school or gym or business that is boldly adopting “progressive” new locker room policies designed to create equal rights for people who identify as transgender. These policies allow transgender individuals to use the locker room consistent with the sex they identify as their own, regardless of anatomy.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/12/22/top-20-read-articles-federalist-2016/,2016-12-22
Journalist Learns What Happens When You Ignore Gun Safety Rules,"In February of 2015, I wrote what I thought was a helpful guide for journalists who wished to have a better understanding of guns and gun laws throughout the U.S. Entitled “14 Things Everyone Should Understand About Guns,” the guide summarized different state and federal gun laws, explained the mechanics of how different guns work, and included a list of ironclad gun safety rules that should be followed at all times, with no exceptions.

I didn’t just want anti-gun journalists to better understand the objects of their hatred. I also wanted them (and everyone else) to know how to safely handle a firearm. That’s why the very first of the 14 items in the article was about the four basic rules of gun safety: 1) Treat all guns as though they are loaded, 2) Never point the muzzle at anything you don’t intend to destroy, 3) Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on target and you’re prepared to fire, and 4) Always confirm your target, as well as what’s in front, behind, and around it.

Unfortunately, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold did not read that article. How do we know? Because Fahrenthold had to go to the emergency room after he shot himself in the eye with one of his children’s confetti guns:

When I came home from my last TV hit, the kids, ages 4 and 5 months, were asleep. The house was quiet. I was still full of caffeine and do-gooder energy and decided to tidy up.



Among the clutter on the coffee table, I found my 4-year-old’s Party Popper, a bright yellow gun that fired confetti. For some reason, I held the gun up to my eye and looked down the barrel, the way Yosemite Sam always does.



It looked unloaded.



Then, for some reason, I pulled the trigger.



When I got to the ER, I had a swollen face, metal-foil confetti in my hair and a faint odor of gun smoke. Finally, the doctor could see me.



“I shot myself in the eye with a glitter gun,” I said. I showed him the Party Popper, which I had brought with me, in case he wanted to send it off to the National Institute of Morons for further study.



I got home from the hospital with a scratched cornea and a tube of eye ointment. The next day, with some of my dignity permanently lost, I got started on a bigger story.

He’s lucky his dignity is the only thing he lost, because he could’ve permanently lost his vision in that eye. And if he’d been as careless with a real gun as he was with a toy gun, he or someone else might have lost their lives. I don’t highlight this incident to mock Fahrenthold, and I disagree with his characterization of himself as a “moron.” The issue isn’t that he’s stupid, it’s that he was never taught to not do what he did.

The incident is important because it shows just how important it is to know the basic rules of gun safety, even if you don’t own any guns or ever plan to handle one. No responsible gun owner on earth would have done with a toy confetti gun what Fahrenthold did. Let’s go through his incident step by step to point out what he did wrong and how the four basic gun safety rules could’ve prevented what happened.

Mistake #1: “For some reason, I held the gun up to my eye and looked down the barrel, the way Yosemite Sam always does.”

That’s a direct violation of gun safety rule #2: Never point the muzzle at anything you don’t intend to destroy. Had he pointed the gun in a safe direction, nobody would’ve gotten hurt even if he violated all of the other rules. Instead, he pointed it at his eye and guaranteed that if the gun was fired, his eye would be the target.

Mistake #2: “It looked unloaded.”

That’s a violation of gun safety rule #1: Treat all guns as though they are loaded. Had he followed this rule and checked and unloaded the gun, nobody would’ve gotten hurt. Remember: there’s no such thing as an unloaded gun. If you always assume a gun is loaded, you’ll never be forced to explain to a doctor or law enforcement official that you didn’t mean to shoot that person since you thought the gun was unloaded. Always confirm a firearm is unloaded before handling it. If it’s not, unload it immediately.

Mistake #3: “Then, for some reason, I pulled the trigger.”

That’s a violation of gun safety rule #3: Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on target and you’re prepared to fire. Or, as the instructors I’ve worked with like to paraphrase it, “Keep your #&$^#&%! finger off the *!^%#@$% trigger you #$#^%! idiot.” Violating rule #3 is the ultimate cause of every negligent firearm discharge. Even if you ignore all the other rules, the gun will not fire a bullet and potentially cause irreparable damage unless someone pulls the trigger. Fahrenthold could’ve walked away unscathed after ignoring rules #1 and #2 if only he had followed rule #3.

The four basic rules of gun safety exist for a reason: to keep you and everyone around you safe. They must be applied religiously at all times, even if you think you’re just playing with a harmless toy gun. Even if you don’t plan on ever owning or handling a gun, you should memorize and obey the four basic gun safety rules at all times. And if you disagree, just ask David Fahrenthold.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/07/washington-post-journalist-learns-happens-violate-gun-safety-rules/,2017-01-07
Liberals Don't Understand How Gun 'Silencers' Work. Here Are The Facts,"A military jet taking off with its afterburner on full blast. A jackhammer. A sandblaster. A freight train. A rock concert. What do these seemingly unconnected sounds all have in common? They’re significantly quieter than the sound of a gun being fired. Even one with a “silencer” attached to it.

Why is this important? Because there’s a growing movement to make it easier for gun owners to reduce the ear-piercing sounds of the guns being fired, and progressives are outraged by it. They’re outraged by it because they don’t have the slightest idea how so-called gun silencers actually work. Here’s the Washington Post‘s most recent take on the issue in an article headlined “Gun silencers are hard to buy. Donald Trump Jr. and silencer makers want to change that”:

The federal government has strictly limited the sale of firearm silencers for as long as James Bond and big-screen gangsters have used them to discreetly shoot enemies between the eyes. […] The silencer industry and gun rights groups say critics are vastly overstating the dangers, arguing that Hollywood has created an unrealistic image of silencers, which they prefer to call ‘suppressors.’ They cite studies showing that silencers reduce the decibel level of a gunshot from a dangerous 165 to about 135 — the sound of a jackhammer — and that they are rarely used in crimes. But gun-control activists say silencers are getting quieter, particularly in combination with subsonic ammunition, which is less lethal but still damaging. They point to videos on YouTube in which silencers make high-powered rifles have ‘no more sound than a pellet gun,’ according to one demonstrator showing off a silenced semiautomatic .22LR.

Note how the Washington Post waves away the actual data and science surrounding the issue by immediately characterizing the indisputable science of ballistics as nothing more than a competition between studies proponents like and opponents dislike (“They cite studies showing…”). Imagine them saying the same thing about the specifications of a car’s engine: “They cite studies showing that the car’s engine has 6 cylinders and can go up to 130 miles per hour.” You don’t need “studies” to tell you how loud a gunshot is or to tell you how loud that gunshot is when the gun has a suppressor attached. You just need a tool (or simple app on your smartphone) to measure sound.

Then there’s the Washington Post‘s characterization of a .22LR as a “high-powered rifle,” a characterization that is…not even remotely close to accurate. It’s laughably false, since the .22LR caliber is one of the smallest and weakest rifle rounds on earth. On a good day, it can be used to take down small varmints that are no more than 150 yards away, and that’s it.

And don’t even get me started on the inanity of using a YouTube video as your sole source of evidence about the sound levels of suppressed and unsuppressed gunfire. Without even getting into the issue of how a recording device is incapable of capturing the pressure wave associated with a rifle blast, even if it could, your computer’s speakers don’t get close to loud enough to reproduce the actual sound of a gunshot.

But if you thought the Washington Post‘s ignorance of the issue was embarrassing, wait until you see how D-list Hollywood comedians whose entire source of knowledge on guns comes from fictional movies and TV shows tackled the subject:

Unfortunately, Black and Richter are not alone in their complete ignorance of how guns or silencers work. You’ve internalized the myths. You’ve watched the movies and heard the whisper-quiet “pew pew” as the assassin’s bullet is fired. But that’s not how suppressors actually work. Here are the facts.

To put things into perspective, the sound of firing an unsuppressed AR-15 — the most popular rifle platform in America — is approximately 165 decibels, or dB. A jet engine from 100 feet away is approximately 140dB. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration bans employers from exposing employees to 115 decibels for more than 15 minutes per day without providing them sound mitigation or hearing protection measures.

Physical pain and potentially permanent hearing damage begins to occur at 140dB. Eardrums will begin to rupture at approximately 150dB. If you fire an AR-15 without a suppressor and without any hearing protection, the overpressure generated by the gunshot will blow out your eardrums, as well as of those of anyone else in the near vicinity. If you were forced to defend your home from armed invaders and had to shoot one of them in a small hallway or bedroom, you and your family would suffer permanent hearing damage from the sound of the gunshot alone.

Andy Richter’s embarrassingly ignorant scoffing aside, this is exactly why the use of suppressors is by definition a health issue. But contra Richter and Black, suppressors don’t silence anything. The term “silencer” is a complete misnomer. To understand why, you need to understand the physics of gunfire.

Let’s start with why gunshots make the sounds they make. If you don’t understand simple ballistics, you’ll never understand the utility of a simple suppressor. A gunshot’s sound has three components: the expulsion of explosive gases that propel a bullet out of the barrel of a gun, the sonic boom of a bullet breaking the sound barrier, and the sound of the gun’s action (the hammer or striker smacking the firing pin). All of those different components combine to make the deafening noise that is a modern gunshot.

A suppressor works by redistributing the flow of explosive gases triggered by the firing of a gun (the first sound component listed above). A suppressor cannot prevent the loud sonic crack created by a bullet exceeding the speed of sound. By redirecting the flow of gas that follows the projectile out of the barrel, a suppressor can slightly reduce (but not eliminate) the sound of a standard handgun or rifle being fired. A decent suppressor for an AR-15 (.223/5.56mm) can reduce the sound of that rifle being fired by 30-35 dB. Thus, a quality suppressor can turn what would’ve been a 165 dB, eardrum-bursting gunshot into a mere 135 dB gunshot — roughly the same volume as a jackhammer you might see a construction worker using. Remember that pain and permanent hearing damage begins at 140 dB.

“But why don’t you just wear ear plugs or over-the-ear hearing protection instead of using a suppressor?” you might ask. It’s a good question. There are a number of reasons why suppressors make sense even if you always double up on ear protection (ear plugs and over-the-ear muffs) when you’re at the range or hunting game. Standard over-the-ear hearing protection combined with the use of ear plugs will reduce the sound of a gunshot by about 30-35 dB, the same reduction as a suppressor. So standard hearing protection, which is far cheaper, obviously makes more sense than getting a suppressor, right?

Wrong, for two reasons. First, sustained exposure to volumes in the 130-140 dB range, which is what you would experience shooting a typical AR-15 with doubled-up hearing protection, will undoubtedly wreak havoc on your hearing. Just ask anybody who works on a flight line or who hunts regularly. There’s no good reason to make it hard for law-abiding citizens to double-up on hearing protection and use a suppressor to reduce the likelihood of permanent hearing damage.

The second reason, and the reason that bears directly on the Second Amendment right to defend yourself with arms if necessary, is that home invaders are not likely to give you an extra minute or two to put the foamies in your ears and locate your earmuffs before they start murdering you and your family.

Plus, when you hear someone break into your home and you grab your gun and enter the hallway and place yourself between the intruders and your children’s bedrooms, you want to hear every last whisper and footstep so you know exactly where the home invaders are, what they’re saying, where they’re going, and how quickly they’re doing so. If you are required to shoot those intruders in that hallway, or next to your children’s bedrooms, you’ll likely neutralize them. But in the process, you’ll probably deafen yourself and your family. And for what reason? Because some Hollywood ignoramus thinks “silencers” will turn everyone into Jason Bourne?

We’ve already established that there are multiple legitimate, legal reasons for homeowners or hunters to use suppressors to protect their hearing. What about criminals, though? Wouldn’t they also desire that same increased access to the tools of every Hollywood assassin?

Not really. For starters, if a criminal wanted to make a suppressor, it wouldn’t take much time. A suppressor for a gun isn’t much different than a muffler for a car. It’s a tube of metal with some baffles inside. That’s it. It takes far more time, effort, money, and expertise to build your own rifle in your garage (a process that is entirely legal) than it does to make your own suppressor (a felony). So why aren’t criminals building their own suppressors in droves?

Because it doesn’t make any sense for them to do so. Why? Because as we now know, so-called silencers don’t make anything silent. They merely take something that is deafening and make it not-deafening. At the same time, they make a firearm heavier, longer, less accurate, and therefore less lethal. Criminals tend to use firearms that are cheap, easy to find, and easy to conceal. Suppressed guns are anything but that.

Then there’s the fact that overwhelming majority of handguns, which are used in 90 percent of gun murders in the U.S. where the type of gun is known, are physically incapable of even accepting a silencer. That’s because a gun must have a threaded barrel to accept a silencer. Since threaded barrels are expensive and in far shorter supply than non-threaded barrels, your average criminal looking for a quick score has little to no interest in acquiring a gun that has one. Suppressors aren’t cheap, they aren’t easy to conceal, and it’s really difficult to find guns that can even accept them. When you know these facts, you can understand why suppressors are never used by criminals. They’re just not worth the cost or the hassle.

Gun controllers want you to believe a suppressor can take a garden-variety criminal and turn him into James Bond. They want you to believe suppressors make criminals more lethal. Nothing could be further from the truth. Suppressors are nothing more than sound-reducing mufflers for guns. And their regulation compared to that of actual firearms makes absolutely no sense. I can go into any gun store in my state right now and walk out with any high-powered rifle I want within minutes. The federal gun dealer will run a background check on me, see that my record is clear, and then sell me the gun, which I could then use to shoot people or things.

Gun suppressors take a sound that will instantly cause permanent hearing damage and reduce it to the whisper-quiet level of a jackhammer or a jet taking off from an aircraft carrier.

Compare that to the legal process for getting a suppressor, a hollow metal can which cannot fire bullets and has the approximate lethality of a roll of paper towels. To legally possess a suppressor, I must receive special permission from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE). I am required to pay a special $200 tax to receive that permission. I am required to fill out extensive paperwork (far longer and more intrusive than what is required to purchase an actual firearm) and provide BATFE with a photograph and two sets of fingerprints.

I am required to inform my chief local law enforcement officer that I am in possession of a National Firearms Act (NFA) item. I am required to keep all of my paperwork with the NFA item wherever it goes. And I must get permission from BATFE to cross state lines with that NFA item. Right now, that approval process takes upward of a year. So if I were to walk into a federal gun dealer who is licensed to sell NFA items today, I’d be lucky if I could take possession of a simple suppressor before 2018. On what planet does that make any sense?

The simple fact of the matter is that it makes zero sense. Suppressors allow legal gun owners to protect their hearing and that of their loved ones. They enable legal gun owners to more effectively protect their homes and their families. That’s it. They don’t make it easier for crooks to commit crimes any more than car mufflers make it easier for alcoholics to drive drunk. In fact, suppressed weapons are less attractive to criminals because they’re expensive and make weapons extremely difficult to conceal.

These are facts, not opinions. And they’re facts based on an understanding of basic ballistics and gun mechanics. Gun suppressors take a sound that will instantly cause permanent hearing damage and reduce it to the whisper-quiet level of a jackhammer or a jet taking off from an aircraft carrier. Regulating mufflers for a gun the same way we regulate machine guns makes no sense. Imagine a legal regime that allowed you to instantly buy a car today but forced you to wait over a year before you could legally install a muffler on it.

If lawmakers want to enable their law-abiding citizens to protect their hearing without having to jump through hoop after hoop or pay a special tax for the privilege of not going deaf, they should amend the National Firearms Act to exclude suppressors. But if they think their constituents and their families deserve to go deaf because one too many politicians or celebrities learned about guns, gun laws, and physics from James Bond movies, then they deserve to get an earful.

Shooting In Kentucky Taught Me Why Americans Love Guns,"Of all the freedoms that puzzle non-Americans most, the Second Amendment must surely top the list. While most of the constitutional rights, such as freedom of religion and speech, enjoy similar recognition and respect in Europe, the right to bear arms seems far removed from our definition of freedom.

So when I knew I would be heading to Kentucky, the gateway to the South, experiencing the freedom of shooting was near the top of my “do list.” My original plan had been to visit one of Louisville’s several shooting ranges, many of which happily catered to international visitors. I read through the various FAQ documents and pricelists to prepare. Yet getting my hands on a gun turned out to be simpler than I had expected, thanks to good old-fashioned Southern hospitality.

My entry point to this new world was an acquaintance I had made the day before, when I attended one of the voting stations for the Kentucky Republican caucus. Will was a committed political campaigner and a gun rights advocate. At 25 years old, he was happily married and the archetype of a local politician in the making: photogenic, friendly, and connected with Louisville’s movers and shakers.

When I started dropping hints about wanting to visit a shooting range, I had cheekily hoped he might volunteer to take me. Most of the ranges were a good 30 miles from metropolitan Louisville, and I was stuck in the rather un-American position of relying on public transport (or, at the very least, Uber). But Will had a better idea.

“Tomorrow, Janelle and I are heading out to see her parents—and her dad is a real gun nut. You should come too,” he said.

“You don’t think he would mind?”

“Teaching a clueless European to shoot for the first time? Are you kidding? He would love it.”

We Drive Out to ‘The Farm’

So the next day we drove out to the family’s “farm,” a former plantation deep in Kentucky’s rural “horse country.” Pulling up a sprawling country house complete with stables and acres of hilly grass, I could hardly believe my luck.

As we stepped up the drive, Will rattled off details. This was where the Hamptons had raised their children, four of whom still lived there. It was home to the family’s four cats, two dogs, and three horses, all of which had been rehomed from local sanctuaries. Oh, and the family’s guns, too.

Will’s mother-in-law greeted us in the kitchen, calling down two daughters to say hello. We drank soda while I answered half a dozen questions about how I was enjoying Kentucky, how it compared to London, and the like. My shooting tutor for the day, Mr. Hampton, was still finishing some work outside.

From the moment Mr. Hampton walked in, he was every inch the natural host: warm, gregarious, with a gently commanding presence and a loud laugh. He fired off some loaded questions about British politics: what did I think of Nigel Farage? How was the government responding to the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels? Did I really consider David Cameron a conservative?

The Roots of the Second Amendment

He then took me to his “gun safe.” As he held up each of the guns in turn, I made my first mistake. I asked if I could take photos.

“Any photos you take are geo-stamped and available through the cloud,” he explained. “Now, everything I own here is legal, but in future that might not be the case. In that scenario, I do not want the government knowing what I have.”

This was my first insight into the politics of gun ownership, and what I would later learn was a familiar trope for gun enthusiasts: the idea that an authoritarian government would target the Second Amendment.

This suspicion ran deep. When I asked Mr. Hampton if he had attended the Republican caucus, for example, he told me that he was actually a registered Democrat. Before his retirement he had worked in health care, where many of the senior management were active Democrats. Worried about professional retribution for his political views, he had registered as a Democrat as to keep his true leanings secret.

Mr. Hampton hauled six of the guns, a handful of targets (laminated “bulls eye”-style designs one can purchase from a gun store and then attach to pre-existing fixtures in your garden), and a dozen boxes of ammunition into a small trailer hitched to the back of what looked like a sit-on lawnmower. We then headed out, him driving and me following, to a large clearing 100 yards or so from his back porch.

First Things First: Gun Safety

Before I could even touch one of the guns, however, Mr. Hampton wanted to tell me about gun safety. The vast majority of gun fatalities, he explained, were actually the result of people failing to observe basic rules of safety. He picked up a Smith and Wesson handgun and began to demonstrate. He pushed a loaded magazine into the gun before unclipping it and placing the magazine back on the table.

“Now tell me,” he said. “Is this gun loaded?”

“I… I don’t know.”

“And that is exactly the right answer,” he said proudly, maybe mistaking my general cluelessness for some kind of nifty intuition. He turned the gun over and showed how one solitary bronze bullet had made its way into the barrel.

This was one of the biggest mistakes people made, he explained: assuming a handgun without a clip was unloaded when, in fact, it still had a bullet lodged inside. In Hollywood, this was a pretty commonplace plot twist (the famous “one in the chamber”), but in real life, it was also a big factor in accidental gun deaths.

Mr. Hampton pushed the magazine back into the gun and handed me a pair of ear protectors and goggles. It looked like I was going to be firing the first shot.

“Now, we are going to walk down the range, closer to the target. But first you need to listen up. You only shoot that way,” he said, pointing down the range. “You do not shoot right, because that is not my property.”

I looked over to the right and saw a few scruffy knolls and bundles of twigs. There was absolutely nothing to distinguish this land from that on the makeshift range in front of me.

“But there are bullets there,” I said, pointing to the ground.

“I know. Because my neighbor shot them. But it is not my property, so we will not be shooting that way.”

This was something that I learned went hand-in-hand with gun freedoms: the sacrosanct nature of property rights. Even though his neighbors’ strip was essentially wasteland and not separated by any kind of fence or feature, it was still their property. And they retained absolute jurisdiction over it.

In fact, the right to protect your property is a hot topic in Kentucky. In just a few days’ time a local court would adjudicate in the case of a local gun owner who had shot down a civilian drone flying over his land. My hosts, like many local families, had become avid supporters of the defendant, signing petitions calling for his liberty to be upheld.

Then, the Death Threat

“Oh, and if you turn around and face back this way—facing towards my house, my family, or my horses with that gun—then, believe me, I will shoot you first.”

I felt a flurry of adrenaline. It felt strange to receive an effective death threat (albeit an entirely conditional one) from a man who had been offering me his finest breakfast snacks just an hour or so beforehand. But given the circumstances—I was effectively a total stranger holding a lethal weapon next to his family home—it made sense.

I tensed my shoulders and prepared to shoot. Mr. Hampton leaned over and showed me how to line up the sight on the gun, and where to place my hands. I was nervous. I remembered a time as a teenager when I had managed to give myself a black eye by underestimating the recoil on a friend’s low-grade air rifle. I gripped the gun tight and prepared myself for the jolt.

The handgun gave off no more than a gentle push upwards. There was a quick flash of flame which, viewed through my goggles, seemed slightly distant and other-worldly, almost like a video game. I could just make out the shreds of cardboard flying into the air as the bullet ripped through the target.

“You got it. Slightly to the right though,” he said, squinting into a pair of binoculars.

The gun was a semi-automatic, so was ready to shoot again without any effort from me. I gently squeezed the trigger. Again, there was a loud bang, a slight pop upwards. I fired again, twice, in quick succession.

“We call that rock and rolling,” said Mr. Hampton. “It’s hella fun, but you’re going to lose your accuracy that way.”

We worked our way through a few boxes of ammo, as I tried to refine my accuracy and decide which gun I preferred. After ten minutes, I spotted two of Mr. Hampton’s daughters heading down to join us, one wearing her bright pink ear protectors. They told me that their father had taught them to shoot when they turned 12 years old. Judging by their accuracy with the target, he seemed to have done a fine job.

They were curious about my first experience, which I found myself describing, in a moment of unselfconsciousness, as “pretty exhilarating.”

‘How About We Move On to Something Bigger’

“Now, how about we move on to something bigger,” said Mr. Hampton, reaching into the trailer to retrieve his piece of pride: a heavy-duty AR-14 assault rifle, the same model used by U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was a slick piece of machinery, with the stylish, clean finesse of a top-range sports car. He smiled proudly as I looked it up and down.

Then, with the suddenness of a biblical apparition, I saw it: the red, blue, and yellow of the target, sitting neatly between the axes of the crosshair.

I took my place in the chair and placed my right arm on the gun rest. I held the gun in front of me and began to line up the sight. Although it looks like a modern assault rifle has a manual binocular-style scope, the image actually comes from a razor-thin laser beam which, although capable of offering crystal-clear vision at some 500 feet, can take an awfully long time for a beginner to master.

I shifted around in my seat, trying to maneuver my eye into the line of vision. I worried that for the first time my natural cack-handedness was going to get in the way of things. Then, with the suddenness of a biblical apparition, I saw it: the red, blue, and yellow of the target, sitting neatly between the axes of the crosshair.

I gingerly shifted the gun into position until the bull’s eye of the target seemed to be sitting in the center of the crosshair and, with the slightest twinge of my trigger finger, let rip. The flurry of bullets tore through the target and sent clumps of soil flying up from the ground below.

If this didn’t capture the feeling of freedom that came with shooting, it was hard to know what would.

An Experience of American Freedoms

That night I stayed at the farm and ate dinner with the Hamptons. They asked me to say a few words about my first experience of shooting and I duly obliged. I told them how grateful I was for their hospitality, not to mention the 40 dollars’ worth of ammunition we’d managed to spend down at the range. Remembering their fondness for horses, I thought I had a way to make it up to them.

“It would feel crass to offer you money,” I said. “But I’d like to give something back. Perhaps I could make a donation to a local horse sanctuary?”

Mr. Hampton cut me off.

“You don’t have to do that. All we want is for you to experience the freedoms that we have in this country.”

He raised his glass and proposed a toast: to freedom. We enthusiastically clinked our glasses.

Why Americans Want to Own Guns

When asked why they owned guns, the Hamptons talked about protecting themselves. Here on the farm, miles away from essential services and community, they felt at the mercy of any potential intruders and wanted to know they had the means to defend themselves.

They felt at the mercy of any potential intruders and wanted to know they had the means to defend themselves.

But it wasn’t just rogue intruders or opportunistic criminals they sought to counter. It was also much bigger and more powerful forces. America’s Founding Fathers, who fought against authoritarian British rule, had envisioned the Second Amendment as a way for citizens to protect themselves against rogue government. As far as Mr. Hampton was concerned, this remained as a valid as ever.

“Taking away a citizens’ right to protect themselves is a necessary first step towards dictatorship,” explained Mr. Hampton. “Every dictatorship in history—Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Pol Pot—was able to do what it did because it had successfully disarmed and pacified the population first.”

On an immediate level, Mr. Hampton’s conviction in gun ownership was about keeping government power in check. But it also went right to the heart of the U.S. Constitution. If the Second Amendment were rescinded, then what would stop the government from scrapping those other essential liberties it outlines: freedom of speech and conscience, or freedom from slavery?

Will and I discussed this long into the night, as we sat on the porch swigging glass after glass of Kentucky’s finest bourbon. I liked Will. He was urbane, empathetic, and had an unmistakable socially liberal streak. But while he didn’t share his father’s knee-jerk antagonism towards the U.S. government, it was clear he was equally adamant in his belief in peaceful gun ownership. Despite my initial skepticism, I found him a persuasive advocate.

By Default, Humans Should Be Free

As the effect of the bourbon faded, I found my queasiness about guns returning. I thought about that famous yardstick of individual freedom—the commonly articulated “harm principle.” This was the idea, set out by John Stuart Mill, that we should be free to do anything as long as it didn’t harm others. It was hard to escape the idea that guns weren’t just capable of enacting the most severe definition of “harm” possible, they were specifically designed for it.

The Second Amendment also seems to differ from some of the other constitutional rights in that it wasn’t essential per se in delivering a prosperous society in its own right—unlike, for example, the right to freedom of speech, or freedom of religion. I understood that gun ownership is a way of limiting governments’ power, but weren’t there easier, and more effective, ways of doing this?

But as I left the farm and returned to the open roads of Kentucky, my thoughts began to crystallize. On these 50 or so acres, the Hamptons had succeeded in creating their own realm. Rather than just a home, they had turned this land into their own jurisdiction, where the family lives by its own values. Theirs was a small world of civic values, charity, a genuine openness to visitors, and, above all, a strong sense of personal responsibility. In that realm, at least, it seemed hard to deny them the freedom to shoot.

16 Fake News Stories Reporters Have Run Since Trump Won,"Since at least Donald Trump’s election, our media have been in the grip of an astonishing, self-inflicted crisis. Despite Trump’s constant railing against the American press, there is no greater enemy of the American media than the American media. They did this to themselves.

We are in the midst of an epidemic of fake news. There is no better word to describe it than “epidemic,” insofar as it fits the epidemiological model from the Centers for Disease Control: this phenomenon occurs when “an agent and susceptible hosts are present in adequate numbers, and the agent can be effectively conveyed from a source to the susceptible hosts.”

The “agent” in this case is hysteria over Trump’s presidency, and the “susceptible hosts” are a slipshod, reckless, and breathtakingly gullible media class that spread the hysteria around like—well, like a virus.

It is difficult to adequately sum up the breadth of this epidemic, chiefly because it keeps growing: day after day, even hour after hour, the media continue to broadcast, spread, promulgate, publicize, and promote fake news on an industrial scale. It has become a regular part of our news cycle, not distinct from or extraneous to it but a part of it, embedded within the news apparatus as a spoke is embedded in a bicycle wheel.

Whenever you turn on a news station, visit a news website, or check in on a journalist or media personality on Twitter or Facebook, there is an excellent chance you will be exposed to fake news. It is rapidly becoming an accepted part of the way the American media are run.

How we will get out of this is anyone’s guess. We might not get out of it, not so long as Trump is president of these United States. We may be up for four—maybe eight!—long years of authentic fake news media hysteria. It is worth cataloging at least a small sampling of the hysteria so far. Only when we fully assess the extent of the media’s collapse into ignominious ineptitude can we truly begin to reckon with it.

Since Trump’s election, here’s just a small sampling of fake news that our media and our journalist class have propagated.

Early November: Spike in Transgender Suicide Rates

After Trump’s electoral victory on November 8, rumors began circulating that multiple transgender teenagers had killed themselves in response to the election results. There was no basis to these rumors. Nobody was able to confirm them at the time, and nobody has been able to confirm in the three months since Trump was elected.

Nevertheless, the claim spread far and wide: Guardian writer and editor-at-large of Out Zach Stafford tweeted the rumor, which was retweeted more than 13,000 times before he deleted it. He later posted a tweet explaining why he deleted his original viral tweet; his explanatory tweet was shared a total of seven times. Meanwhile, PinkNews writer Dominic Preston wrote a report on the rumors, which garnered more than 12,000 shares on Facebook.

At Mic, Matthew Rodriguez wrote about the unsubstantiated allegations. His article was shared more than 55,000 times on Facebook. Urban legend debunker website Snopes wrote a report on the rumors and listed them as “unconfirmed” (rather than “false”). Snopes’s sources were two Facebook posts, since deleted, that offered no helpful information regarding the location, identity, or circumstances of any of the suicides. The Snopes report was shared 19,000 times.

At Reason, writer Elizabeth Nolan Brown searched multiple online databases to try to determine the identities or even the existence of the allegedly suicidal youth. She found nothing. As she put it: “[T]eenagers in 2016 don’t just die without anyone who knew them so much as mentioning their death online for days afterward.”

She is right. Just the same, the stories hyping this idea garnered at least nearly 100,000 shares on Facebook alone, contributing to the fear and hysteria surrounding Trump’s win.

November 22: The Tri-State Election Hacking Conspiracy Theory

On November 22, Gabriel Sherman posted a bombshell report at New York Magazine claiming that “a group of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers” were demanding a recount in three separate states because of “persuasive evidence that [the election] results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania may have been manipulated or hacked.” The evidence? Apparently, “in Wisconsin, Clinton received 7 percent fewer votes in counties that relied on electronic-voting machines compared with counties that used optical scanners and paper ballots.”

The story went stratospherically viral. It was shared more than 145,000 times on Facebook alone. Sherman shared it on his Twitter feed several times, and people retweeted his links to the story nearly 9,000 times. Politico’s Eric Geller shared the story on Twitter as well. His tweet was retweeted just under 8,000 times. Dustin Volz from Reuters shared the link; he was retweeted nearly 2,000 times. MSNBC’s Joy Reid shared the story and was retweeted more than 4,000 times. New York Times opinion columnist Paul Krugman also shared the story and was retweeted about 1,600 times.

It wasn’t until the next day, November 23, that someone threw a little water on the fire. At FiveThirtyEight, Nate Silver explained that it was “demographics, not hacking” that explained the curious voting numbers. “Anyone making allegations of a possible massive electoral hack should provide proof,” he wrote, “and we can’t find any.” Additionally, Silver pointed out that the New York Magazine article had misrepresented the argument of one of the computer scientists in question.

At that point, however, the damage had already been done: Sherman, along with his credulous tweeters and retweeters, had done a great deal to delegitimize the election results. Nobody was even listening to Silver, anyway: his post was shared a mere 380 times on Facebook, or about one-quarter of 1 percent as much as Sherman’s. This is how fake news works: the fake story always goes viral, while nobody reads or even hears about the correction.

December 1: The 27-Cent Foreclosure

At Politico on December 1, Lorraine Woellert published a shocking essay claiming that Trump’s pick for secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, had overseen a company that “foreclosed on a 90-year-old woman after a 27-cent payment error.” According to Woellert: “After confusion over insurance coverage, a OneWest subsidiary sent [Ossie] Lofton a bill for $423.30. She sent a check for $423. The bank sent another bill, for 30 cents. Lofton, 90, sent a check for three cents. In November 2014, the bank foreclosed.”

The story received widespread coverage, being shared nearly 17,000 times on Facebook. The New York Times’s Steven Rattner shared it on Twitter (1,300 retweets), as did NBC News’s Brad Jaffy (1,200 retweets), the AP’s David Beard (1,900 retweets) and many others.

The problem? The central scandalous claims of Woellert’s article were simply untrue. As the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Ted Frank pointed out, the woman in question was never foreclosed on, and never lost her home. Moreover, “It wasn’t Mnuchin’s bank that brought the suit.”

Politico eventually corrected these serious and glaring errors. But the damage was done: the story had been repeated by numerous media outlets including Huffington Post (shared 25,000 times on Facebook), the New York Post, Vanity Fair, and many others.

January 20: Nancy Sinatra’s Complaints about the Inaugural Ball

On the day of Trump’s inauguration, CNN claimed Nancy Sinatra was “not happy” with the fact that the president and first lady’s inaugural dance would be to the tune of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way.” The problem? Nancy Sinatra had never said any such thing. CNN later updated the article without explaining the mistake they had made.

January 20: The Nonexistent Climate Change Website ‘Purge’

Also on the day of the inauguration, New York Times writer Coral Davenport published an article on the Times’s website whose headline claimed that the Trump administration had “purged” any “climate change references” from the White House website. Within the article, Davenport acknowledged that the “purge” (or what she also called “online deletions”) was “not unexpected” but rather part of a routine turnover of digital authority between administrations.

To call this action a “purge” was thus at the height of intellectual dishonesty: Davenport was styling the whole thing as a kind of digital book-burn rather than a routine part of American government. But of course that was almost surely the point. The inflammatory headline was probably the only thing that most people read of the article, doubtlessly leading many readers (the article was shared nearly 50,000 times on Facebook) to believe something that simply wasn’t true.

January 20: The Great MLK Jr. Bust Controversy

On January 20, Time reporter Zeke Miller wrote that a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the White House. This caused a flurry of controversy on social media until Miller issued a correction. As Time put it, Miller had apparently not even asked anyone in the White House if the bust had been removed. He simply assumed it had been because “he had looked for it and had not seen it.”

January 20: Betsy DeVos, Grizzly Fighter

During her confirmation hearing, education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos was asked whether schools should be able to have guns on their campuses. As NBC News reported, DeVos felt it was “best left to locales and states to decide.” She pointed out that one school in Wyoming had a fence around it to protect the students from wildlife. “I would imagine,” she said, “that there’s probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies.”

This was an utterly noncontroversial stance to take. DeVos was simply pointing out that different states and localities have different needs, and attempting to mandate a nationwide one-size-fits-all policy for every American school is imprudent.

How did the media run with it? By lying through their teeth. “Betsy DeVos Says Guns Should Be Allowed in Schools. They Might Be Needed to Shoot Grizzlies” (Slate). “Betsy DeVos: Schools May Need Guns to Fight Off Bears” (The Daily Beast). “Citing grizzlies, education nominee says states should determine school gun policies” (CNN). “Betsy DeVos says guns in schools may be necessary to protect students from grizzly bears” (ThinkProgress.) “Betsy DeVos says guns shouldn’t be banned in schools … because grizzly bears” (Vox). “Betsy DeVos tells Senate hearing she supports guns in schools because of grizzly bears” (The Week). “Trump’s Education Pick Cites ‘Potential Grizzlies’ As A Reason To Have Guns In Schools” (BuzzFeed).

The intellectual dishonesty at play here is hard to overstate. DeVos never said or even intimated that every American school or even very many of them might need to shoot bears. She merely used one school as an example of the necessity of federalism and as-local-as-possible control of the education system.

Rather than report accurately on her stance, these media outlets created a fake news event to smear a reasonable woman’s perfectly reasonable opinion.

January 26: The ‘Resignations’ At the State Department

On January 26, the Washington Post’s Josh Rogin published what seemed to be a bombshell report declaring that “the State Department’s entire senior management team just resigned.” This resignation, according to Rogin, was “part of an ongoing mass exodus of senior Foreign Service officers who don’t want to stick around for the Trump era.” These resignations happened “suddenly” and “unexpectedly.” He styled it as a shocking shake-up of administrative protocol in the State Department, a kind of ad-hoc protest of the Trump administration.

The story immediately went sky-high viral. It was shared nearly 60,000 times on Facebook. Rogin himself tweeted the story out and was retweeted a staggering 11,000 times. Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum had it retweeted nearly 2,000 times; journalists and writers from Wired, The Guardian, the Washington Post, Bloomberg, ABC, Foreign Policy, and other publications tweeted the story out in shock.

There was just one problem: the story was more a load of bunk. As Vox pointed out, the headline of the piece was highly misleading: “the word ‘management’ strongly implied that all of America’s top diplomats were resigning, which was not the case.” (The Post later changed the word “management” to “administrative” without noting the change, although it left the “management” language intact in the article itself).

More importantly, Mark Toner, the acting spokesman for the State Department, put out a press release noting that “As is standard with every transition, the outgoing administration, in coordination with the incoming one, requested all politically appointed officers submit letters of resignation.” According to CNN, the officials were actually asked to leave by the Trump administration rather than stay on for the customary transitional few months. The entire premise of Rogin’s article was essentially nonexistent.

As always, the correction received far less attention than the fake news itself: Vox’s article, for instance, was shared around 9,500 times on Facebook, less than one-sixth the rate of Rogin’s piece. To this day, Rogin’s piece remains uncorrected regarding its faulty presumptions.

January 27: The Photoshopped Hands Affair

On January 27, Observer writer Dana Schwartz tweeted out a screenshot of Trump that, in her eyes, proved President Trump had “photoshopped his hands bigger” for a White House photograph. Her tweet immediately went viral, being shared upwards of 25,000 times. A similar tweet by Disney animator Joaquin Baldwin was shared nearly 9,000 times as well.

The conspiracy theory was eventually debunked, but not before it had been shared thousands upon thousands of times. Meanwhile, Schwartz tweeted that she did “not know for sure whether or not the hands were shopped.” Her correction tweet was shared a grand total of…11 times.

January 29: The Reuters Account Hoax

Following the Quebec City mosque massacre, the Daily Beast published a story that purported to identify the two shooters who had perpetrated the crime. The problem? The story’s source was a Reuters parody account on Twitter. Incredibly, nobody at the Daily Beast thought to check the source to any appreciable degree.

January 31: The White House-SCOTUS Twitter Mistake

Leading up to Trump announcing his first Supreme Court nomination, CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jeff Zeleny announced that the White House was “setting up [the] Supreme Court announcement as a prime-time contest.” He pointed to a pair of recently created “identical Twitter pages” for a theoretical justices Neil Gorsuch and Thomas Hardiman, the two likeliest nominees for the court vacancy.

Zeleny’s sneering tweet—clearly meant to cast the Trump administration in an unflattering, circus-like light—was shared more than 1,100 times on Twitter. About 30 minutes later, however, he tweeted: “The Twitter accounts…were not set up by the White House, I’ve been told.” As always, the admission of mistake was shared far less than the original fake news: Zeleny’s correction was retweeted a paltry 159 times.

January 31: The Big Travel Ban Lie

On January 31, a Fox affiliate station out of Detroit reported that “A local business owner who flew to Iraq to bring his mother back home to the US for medical treatment said she was blocked from returning home under President Trump’s ban on immigration and travel from seven predominately Muslim nations. He said that while she was waiting for approval to fly home, she died from an illness.”

Like most other sensational news incidents, this one took off, big-time: it was shared countless times on Facebook, not just from the original article itself (123,000 shares) but via secondary reporting outlets such as the Huffington Post (nearly 9,000 shares). Credulous reporters and media personalities shared the story on Twitter to the tune of thousands and thousands of retweets, including: Christopher Hooks, Gideon Resnick, Daniel Dale, Sarah Silverman, Blake Hounshell, Brian Beutler, Garance Franke-Ruta, Keith Olbermann (he got 3,600 retweets on that one!), Matthew Yglesias, and Farhad Manjoo.

The story spread so far because it gratified all the biases of the liberal media elite: it proved that Trump’s “Muslim ban” was an evil, racist Hitler-esque mother-killer of an executive order.

There was just one problem: it was a lie. The man had lied about when his mother died. The Fox affiliate hadn’t bothered to do the necessary research to confirm or disprove the man’s account. The news station quietly corrected the story after giving rise to such wild, industrial-scale hysteria.

February 1: POTUS Threatens to Invade Mexico

On February 1, Yahoo News published an Associated Press report about a phone call President Trump shared with Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto. The report strongly implied that President Trump was considering “send[ing] U.S. troops” to curb Mexico’s “bad hombre” problem, although it acknowledged that the Mexican government disagreed with that interpretation. The White House later re-affirmed that Trump did not have any plan to “invade Mexico.”

Nevertheless, Jon Passantino, the deputy news director of BuzzFeed, shared this story on Twitter with the exclamation “WOW.” He was retweeted 2,700 times. Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama, also shared the story, declaring: “I’m sorry, did our president just threaten to invade Mexico today??” Favreau was retweeted more than 8,000 times.

Meanwhile, the Yahoo News AP post was shared more than 17,000 times on Facebook; Time’s post of the misleading report was shared more than 66,000 times; ABC News posted the story and it was shared more than 20,000 times. On Twitter, the report—with the false implication that Trump’s comment was serious—was shared by media types such as ThinkProgress’s Judd Legum, the BBC’s Anthony Zurcher, Vox’s Matt Yglesias, Politico’s Shane Goldmacher, comedian Michael Ian Black, and many others.

February 2: Easing the Russian Sanctions

Last week, NBC News national correspondent Peter Alexander tweeted out the following: “BREAKING: US Treasury Dept easing Obama admin sanctions to allow companies to do transactions with Russia’s FSB, successor org to KGB.” His tweet immediately went viral, as it implied that the Trump administration was cozying up to Russia.

A short while later, Alexander posted another tweet: “Source familiar [with] sanctions says it’s a technical fix, planned under Obama, to avoid unintended consequences of cybersanctions.” As of this writing, Alexander’s fake news tweet has approximately 6,500 retweets; his clarifying tweet has fewer than 250.

At CNBC, Jacob Pramuk styled the change this way: “Trump administration modifies sanctions against Russian intelligence service.” The article makes it clear that, per Alexander’s source, “the change was a technical fix that was planned under Obama.” Nonetheless, the impetus was placed on the Trump adminsitration. CBS News wrote the story up in the same way. So did the New York Daily News.

In the end, unable to pin this (rather unremarkable) policy tweak on the Trump administration, the media have mostly moved on. As the Chicago Tribune put it, the whole affair was yet again an example of how “in the hyperactive Age of Trump, something that initially appeared to be a major change in policy turned into a nothing-burger.”

February 2: Renaming Black History Month

At the start of February, which is Black History Month in the United States, Trump proclaimed the month “National African American History Month.” Many outlets tried to spin the story in a bizarre way: TMZ claimed that a “senior administration official” said that Trump believed the term “black” to be outdated. “Every U.S. president since 1976 has designated February as Black History Month,” wrote TMZ. BET wrote the same thing.

The problem? It’s just not true. President Obama, for example, declared February “National African American History Month” as well. TMZ quickly updated their piece to fix their embarrassing error.

February 2: The House of Representatives’ Gun Control Measures

On February 2, the Associated Press touched off a political and media firestorm by tweeting: “BREAKING: House votes to roll back Obama rule on background checks for gun ownership.” The AP was retweeted a staggering 12,000 times.

The headlines that followed were legion: “House votes to rescind Obama gun background check rule” (Kyle Cheney, Politico); “House GOP aims to scrap Obama rule on gun background checks” (CNBC); “House scraps background check regulation” (Yahoo News); “House rolls back Obama gun background check rule” (CNN); “House votes to roll back Obama rule on background checks for gun ownership” (Washington Post).

Some headlines were more specific about the actual House vote but no less misleading; “House votes to end rule that prevents people with mental illness from buying guns” (the Independent); “Congress ends background checks for some gun buyers with mental illness” (the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette); “House Votes to Overturn Obama Rule Restricting Gun Sales to the Severely Mentally Ill” (NPR).

The hysteria was far-reaching and frenetic. As you might have guessed, all of it was baseless. The House was actually voting to repeal a narrowly tailored rule from the Obama era. This rule mandated that the names of certain individuals who receive Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income and who use a representative to help manage these benefits due to a mental impairment be forwarded to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

If that sounds confusing, it essentially means that if someone who receives SSDI or SSI needs a third party to manage these benefits due to some sort of mental handicap, then—under the Obama rule—they may have been barred from purchasing a firearm. (It is thus incredibly misleading to suggest that the rule applied in some specific way to the “severely mentally ill.”)

As National Review’s Charlie Cooke pointed out, the Obama rule was opposed by the American Association of People With Disabilities; the ACLU; the Arc of the United States; the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network; the Consortium of Citizens With Disabilities; the National Coalition of Mental Health Recovery; and many, many other disability advocacy organizations and networks.

The media hysteria surrounding the repeal of this rule—the wildly misleading and deceitful headlines, the confused outrage over a vote that nobody understood—was a public disservice.

As Cooke wrote: “It is a rare day indeed on which the NRA, the GOP, the ACLU, and America’s mental health groups find themselves in agreement on a question of public policy, but when it happens it should at the very least prompt Americans to ask, ‘Why?’ That so many mainstream outlets tried to cheat them of the opportunity does not bode well for the future.”

Maybe It’s Time to Stop Reading Fake News

Surely more incidents have happened since Trump was elected; doubtlessly there are many more to come. To be sure, some of these incidents are larger and more shameful than others, and some are smaller and more mundane.

But all of them, taken as a group, raise a pressing and important question: why is this happening? Why are our media so regularly and so profoundly debasing and beclowning themselves, lying to the public and sullying our national discourse—sometimes on a daily basis? How has it come to this point?

Perhaps the answer is: “We’ve let it.” The media will not stop behaving in so reckless a manner unless and until we demand they stop.

That being said, there are two possible outcomes to this fake news crisis: our media can get better, or they can get worse. If they get better, we might actually see our press begin to hold the Trump administration (and government in general) genuinely accountable for its many admitted faults. If they refuse to fix these serial problems of gullibility, credulity, outrage, and outright lying, then we will be in for a rough four years, if not more.

No one single person can fix this problem. It has to be a cultural change, a kind of shifting of priorities industry-wide. Journalists, media types, reporters, you have two choices: you can fix these problems, or you can watch your profession go down in flames.

Most of us are hoping devoutly for the former. But not even a month into the presidency of Donald J. Trump, the outlook is dim.

Why It’s Wrong To Compare Terrorist Attacks To Generic Gun Violence,"On Friday, an Egyptian man armed with two machetes attacked a group of security guards patrolling the Louvre Museum in Paris. The man, who yelled “allahu akbar” during the attack, was shot and taken to the hospital. Thankfully, no one was killed. The attack still terrified Parisians and many across the West. Why? Because of the attacker’s intent and our own vulnerability in our day to day lives.

Since President Trump signed his executive order on immigration two weeks ago, social media has been flooded with memes and graphs showing how few people have died at the hands of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries who’ve committed acts of terrorism. The Left uses this narrative to argue that we don’t need to worry about Middle Eastern terrorism or refugees coming into the country.

But this misunderstands, on a deep level, the psychology of terrorism and the importance of intention.

Terrorism Aims to Destabilize Society

Statistics about terrorism are often accompanied by the number of gun deaths that occur every year. This is a typical tactic of the Left. Whenever Islamist terrorism comes up, they change the conversation to guns and gun control.

There’s no doubt that gun violence in America is out of control. But comparing terrorism to gun violence misses the importance of intention, and how strongly it affects peoples’ sense of security. This is at the root of why terrorism frightens people so much.

It matters whether your potential attacker is trying to steal money from you, or is trying to kill you in the name of religion. The result might be the same tragic end, but the American public senses that there’s something infinitely more sinister about being the victim of a plot versus being the victim of a crime. And that’s what these ISIS-inspired attacks are: a plot.

The New York Times recently reported that many of the so-called lone wolf attacks that we’ve seen over the past few years were really coordinated by operatives in Syria. They aren’t just random, unrelated acts of violence by isolated, mentally ill individuals, as the mainstream media would have us believe. They are part of a broader strategy that is rooted in the religio-political ideology of Islamism.

That’s why we treat terrorism differently from a law enforcement point of view. Because it’s directed not just at murdering our citizens, but also at destabilizing our country. Gun violence is a terrible problem. But its perpetrators aren’t trying to destroy our way of life. And they aren’t working in a coordinated effort. That is what scares people.

Terrorism Makes People Feel Helpless

And people are afraid. In 2016, a survey on what Americans fear most found that terrorism filled the number two and number four slots, even though the chances of being the victim of terrorism is miniscule. But that’s not why people are afraid. They’re scared because there’s a sense that it could happen anywhere, anytime.

For the most part, a person can avoid going into a bad neighborhood, or dealings with criminals. This might help decrease their chance of being the victim of gun violence or a knife attack or a mugging.

But there’s nothing they can do to mitigate their likelihood of being the victim of a terror attack. Terrorist attacks feel random. For most people, that is scarier than almost anything else.

A study in the 1980s examined what influences peoples’ sense of how much danger they’re in. It found that a lack of control over a situation will inflate a person’s perception of risk. The study similarly found that uncertainty had the same effect. Being unsure about what’s going to happen and knowing we’re helpless to prevent it increases how afraid we are.

What the D.C. Sniper Showed Us About Random Violence

I was in Washington, D.C. visiting my brother and sister when the D.C. sniper was on the loose. People were terrified. The sniper could strike anywhere. There didn’t seem to be a pattern to whom or where he struck. There was nothing you could do to improve your odds. (Although my sister and I may have run in zig-zags leaving a metro station in Arlington to improve our chances.)

This is the same mentality behind the fear of terrorism—even though, statistically, it’s virtually impossible that you will be the next victim. Their fear is compounded because they know that we live in a society that’s too politically correct to do much about it. They’re reminded of this every time the media rushes to blame anything but religious ideology whenever a terrorist attack occurs.

So, even though the Louvre attacker didn’t have a gun or a bomb, and could only have done so much damage before being stopped by police, it still shakes our sense of security. It reminds us how vulnerable we are as we go about our daily lives, and how easy it is for someone to take advantage of that.

It’s also a reminder that there is a cadre of people around the world who would kill us as soon as look at us. That’s a pretty scary prospect.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/07/wrong-compare-terrorist-attacks-generic-gun-violence/,2017-02-07
"No, Congress Isn’t Letting Mentally Ill People Get Guns","Why do the media lie so spectacularly and regularly about guns? Nominally the answer is, “Because there are a lot of liberals in the media, and liberals generally do not like guns all that much.” But this is only half an answer, because at some point one imagines shame would kick in and the lies would eventually stop.

Well, it apparently doesn’t and they apparently won’t. The latest gun lie comes courtesy of numerous major media outlets and media figures. “Senate wants to block rule on guns and the mentally ill,” says PBS. “Congress Just Repealed Rules To Keep Guns From The Mentally Ill,“ says the Huffington Post. “Senate votes to block rule meant to prevent people with mental disorders from purchasing guns,” says the Hartford Courant.

“Congress just repealed a rule to keep the mentally ill from buying guns,” tweeted Huffington Post editor Marina Fang. MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow declared that Republicans were voting to “make it easier for seriously mentally ill people to get guns.” The Associated Press announced: “Congress blocks rule barring mentally impaired from guns.” USA Today termed the vote “the gun lobby’s brazen attempt to tap into a market of seriously mentally ill Americans.”

The headlines continue: “Congress Says, Let the Mentally Ill Buy Guns” (The New York Times); “Senate votes to let mentally ill people buy guns” (AOL News); “Congress Blocks Rule Barring Mentally Impaired From Buying Guns” (NBC News); ”Congress nixes regulation that would block gun sales to mentally ill” (Christian Science Monitor); “Mentally ill, and armed” (Vice); “Republicans in Congress just made it easier for mentally ill people to get guns” (Washington Post). “Senate abolishes Sandy Hook gun rule to keep guns from the mentally ill” (“The Today Show”).

These are all spectacularly shameless lies, almost superlatively so, the kind of lie you might have told when you were five years old and unable come up with anything better. The rule in question does not, in fact—fact being the key word here—“keep guns from the mentally ill,” and repealing it will not allow the mentally ill access to firearms. This is a falsehood, one that would require roughly 3.5 seconds of fact checking to disprove. Where are the fact-checkers? They have all apparently gone on vacation, leaving a bunch of third-rate copyediting staffers in place to write the false copy.

Really, It’s You’re Mentally Ill If You Want Guns

As the AP itself noted just a few lines beneath its categorically dishonest headline, the rule did not affect “seriously mentally ill Americans” but rather “[Social Security] beneficiaries with mental impairments who also have a third party manage their benefits.” As the Obama administration defined it, requiring some financial help to manage your government benefits is enough to strip you of your constitutional rights. According to the media, it’s enough to get you labeled, in Maddow’s words, “seriously mentally ill.” (Maddow added: “I swear I’m not kidding.”)

Ask yourself: do you want to live in a country wherein innocent citizens are denied their fundamental rights because they need some financial management assistance?

Most reasonable people would not. Indeed, a great many reasonable people opposed the Obama rule: not just the National Rifle Association but also “the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, the Disability Law Center of Alaska, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors, the National Association for Rights Protection and Advocacy, the National Association for Rural Mental Health, the National Council on Disability, the National Council of Independent Living, the National Coalition of Mental Health Recovery, the National Disability Leadership Alliance, the National Disability Rights Network, the New York Association of Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services, and Safari Club International,” as well as the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Association of People with Disabilities, the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, and numerous other advocacy organizations.

Were these groups also engaged in a “brazen attempt” to sell guns to mentally ill people? Or were they concerned about and opposed to an arbitrary and capricious rule from an incompetent and vindictive administration? The media did not even bother to look, much less care. They just wanted to lie, so they did.

Either way, it looks like this law is on its way out. Thank goodness. In the meantime, we can expect the media to continue to lie about it—and to lie about the next gun issue that arises, and the next one after that. It’s what they do.

How Donald Trump Shot The Gun Industry In The Gut,"When candidate Donald Trump stood atop the stage at last year’s National Rifle Association convention in Louisville, Kentucky, the gun world felt a proverbial “thrill up its leg.”

For the previous eight years, gun rights advocates, gun owners, and the firearms industry had been fighting an all-out war with the Obama administration and its allies in Congress, the media, and the courts to fend off the constant chipping away of the Second Amendment. From magazine limits to ammunition bans to attacks on the character of gun owners, it seemed each day brought a new skirmish.

But fate had delivered a savior, many thought. Trump was unabashedly pro-gun, pro self-defense and pro-Second Amendment, and wasn’t cowed by previous Republicans’ inclinations to downplay the role of lawful firearms ownership in the protection of American society. When he received the full-throated endorsement of the NRA, gun owners knew they had a candidate they could get behind.

So it’s no surprise that when Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton — who’d once hinted that Australian-style gun bans might be a valid option for U.S. gun control — the pro-gun world went wild. No longer would each day bring a potential new fight. Finally, gun owners had a president in the White House who bragged about his concealed-carry license, for crying out loud.

The victory even prompted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) leaders in the “deep state” to rethink their enforcement of outdated gun laws, like suppressor regulation, the import ban on AK-47 rifles, and restrictions on some now-ubiquitous ammunition. Gun owners believed a new day had dawned.

Gun Control Threats Are Good for Business

Unfortunately, Trump’s win has had the unintended consequence of throwing the firearms industry into a deep slump, forcing major companies to lay off workers, driving prices deep into the red, and forcing some gun dealers out of business. While the Obama years might have been a dark time for gun rights, the Democrat president was a boon for gun retailers and manufacturers (a fact Obama has admitted himself). Each time the needle ticked further in the direction of gun restriction, Americans flocked to their local gun store and plunked down cash for more irons.

The industry swelled because of the “panic buying,” with new manufacturers popping up, old names in the industry swelling their ranks, and more new gun owners pushing into demographics with previously tepid interest.

In the Trump era, however, that fear is gone, and with it the market’s urgency to beat the clock on the next “commonsense” gun ban. That’s helped nudge iconic gunmakers Colt and Remington to lay off hundreds of workers and shut down entire divisions of their companies, forced manufacturers to close their doors, and prompted retailers and distributors to offer deep discounts on firearms, with one offering an AR-15 rifle at prices below even the cheapest handguns.

“The combination of increased inventory in the channel and a likely decrease in consumer demand for the near term has made for a more challenging sell-through environment,” said a top executive with gunmaker Ruger during a February 23 investor call.

Supporting Gun Rights Takes Off the Pressure

In another shot to the gut, the suppressor industry is also feeling the Trump slump. Under Obama, the number of suppressors (which dampen the sound of a gun’s report to hearing-safe levels) sold to America’s gun owners skyrocketed — despite the onerous ATF application process, additional regulations, and $200 tax for each. It seemed that each week featured a new company entering the market and interest surged among hunters and sport shooters.

But in a sad irony, Trump’s support of legislation working its way through Congress that would allow suppressors to be purchased over the counter like a handgun or rifle has prompted potential customers to wait on their next suppressor buy. That’s forced companies like SilencerCo — which Trump son Don Jr. has endorsed and has cornered about 75 percent of the suppressor market — to deliver upwards of 50 percent of its workforce pink slips.

Suppressor industry groups have pleaded with consumers to buy anyway, arguing if the legislation passes (and that’s a big if) it won’t for a while and waiting with crossed fingers just drives manufacturers out of business. It is demonstrably a tough time for the firearms industry today, with the panic-buying surge over and buyers waiting on the sidelines for the next legislative move.

“You’ve never had a better administration for the gun industry than Obama, and now never a worse one for the gun industry than Trump,” an industry analyst said during the earnings call with Ruger.

But many say Trump and Congress can pull the gun market out of its nose dive with legislation like concealed-carry license reciprocity (which would prompt a surge in handgun purchasing), accelerating the progress of the Hearing Protection Act (which would get new buyers in stores for suppressors), and by adopting many of the rule changes proposed by ATF leaders (which would open the market to more gun imports and allow the purchase of more ammunition).

Until then, though, expect further decline until the industry bottoms out. But in the meantime at least, there’s hope among gun enthusiasts that at least for the next four years their rights won’t be pried from their “cold dead hands.”

Allowing The AR Pistol Brace May Give Gun Industry The Shot It Needs,"In an obscure ruling penned in an eight-paragraph letter to a little-known gun parts maker, America’s top firearms law enforcement agency reversed an earlier decision on the legal use of a gun accessory that could have major implications for industry and may even undercut more than 80 years of gun control.

Developed by military veteran Alex Bosco to help his wounded warrior friend shoot heavier handguns more easily at the local firing range, the SB-Tactical pistol stabilizing brace was largely considered a curiosity by most of the shooting public when it was released in 2013.

Intended for use on so-called AR-15 pistols — which look and function like a standard AR-15 rifle, but have barrels shorter than 16 inches and do not include a shoulder stock — the SB-Tactical brace wrapped around a user’s arm so the shooter could fire the nose-heavy pistol more comfortably and accurately one-handed. The brace is made of a flexible plastic, attaches to the back end of an AR pistol, and looks a lot like a stock.

Then Gun Enthusiasts Began Customizing

That’s where the problems started cropping up. Relegated to the deepest recesses of the gun-nut public, AR pistols were mostly considered difficult to operate and impractical to own. They inhabited a loophole in the 1934 National Firearms Act that imposed heavy taxes and registration of any rifle with a barrel shorter than 16 inches. So-called “short barreled rifles” were considered the nefarious tools of gangsters at the time, and in response to the Prohibition crime wave, Congress essentially banned SBRs from civilian ownership.

But a pistol doesn’t fall into the purview of the restrictive National Firearms Act, so a gun that functions like a rifle but doesn’t have a stock and is “intended” to be shot using one hand was considered kosher under the law.

Fast-forward 70 years, and the popularity and sheer adaptability of the AR-15 rifle posed a dilemma. The rifle’s “buffer tube” — which houses a spring and weight to help cycle the bolt during a shot — extends out beyond the butt end of the gun, making for an uncomfortable but serviceable part to press against a shooter’s shoulder. That still wasn’t enough to make the AR pistol much more than a range toy.

When the SB-Tactical brace was released, however, with a letter from the gun-law-enforcing Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms saying the device didn’t turn a pistol into a rifle, the gun world went nuts. Now these AR pistols could be outfitted with a brace that functioned like a stock in a pinch and the ATF said it was all above-board. It wasn’t long before firearms enthusiasts were flocking to gun stores buying AR pistols and slapping on an SB-Tactical brace for a poor-man’s — and legal — pseudo short-barreled rifle.

When the ATF saw the hijinks, it issued a letter in 2015 that punched the industry in the gut, ruling that “misusing” the brace by putting it against your shoulder “remade” the pistol into a rifle and was therefore subject to the NFA’s draconian rules. Gun store owners shelved their pistols and shooters were scared to take their guns to the range for fear of becoming an instant felon.

But on April 25, the ATF — after a concerted effort from gun owners and SB-Tactical — has “clarified” its 2015 ruling and said as long as the brace is installed as intended and isn’t modified in any way, putting it against a shoulder doesn’t miraculously turn it into a heavily-regulated SBR.

This Affects You Even If You Don’t Use This Equipment

Most everyday gun owners might ask, so what? I don’t have one of these weird guns, so what does this have to do with me?

First off, the ruling could prove a shot in the arm to a firearms industry struggling after the election of President Donald Trump. With a full-throated endorsement from the NRA and a pro-gun campaign agenda, Trump’s embrace of gun rights has had the unintended consequence of depressing gun sales. The Obama-era panic buying is history, and that’s left a glut of “Hillary 2016” inventory sitting on shelves gathering dust — particularly AR-style rifles, which had been in the Clinton crosshairs for years.

The new stabilizing brace ruling could stir up more interest in ARs from gun buyers who might now see the pistol version as a viable option. The ATF doesn’t allow owners to convert a rifle into a pistol, but there are plenty of pistols and other AR parts manufacturers out there who could really use a business boost.

But the biggest, and perhaps most significant, effect of the ruling could be the undermining of the National Firearms Act. The technology of today has forced the feds to tie themselves in knots trying to write rules that comport to a gun law written when the Thompson submachine gun was the biggest threat and revolvers ruled the handgun world.

What is a pistol? What is a rifle? Why does a stock make a pistol a rifle? Why does a vertical foregrip make a pistol an “Any Other Weapon” under ATF rules? It’s because the laws intended to ban what was around at the time, and times have changed a lot since then.

These days gun owners know there’s zero difference whatsoever between a 10-inch-barreled AR-15 with a padded buffer tube and one with a true buttstock. Both do the exact same thing to a target, but one costs an extra $200 in taxes and a nine-month wait for registration, and the other does not. With new technology like the pistol brace challenging the boundaries of nearly century-old gun laws every year, it’s only a matter of time before the NFA dies a lonely death of bureaucratic irrelevance.

Progressive Writers Agree: Those Republicans Deserved To Get Shot,"A shooter opened fire on Congressional Republicans practicing for the annual Congressional baseball game at a baseball park in Alexandria, Virginia, Wednesday morning, injuring lawmakers, staff, and law enforcement. It is unclear at this time whether the shooter was killed or is currently in police custody.

In the wake of the shooting, lots of people on the Internet lost their minds. Several progressives even went out of their way to suggest the victims deserved to get shot because they have the wrong views on gun control, or Obamacare, or Donald Trump. Here are some of the most insane reactions to the Congressional baseball shoooting so far.

This guy writes for Huffington Post. He previously published an article saying that Trump opponents were morally justified in wanting to commit violence against him:

What's more harmful: Putting millions already on the margins more at-risk via draconian policies, or shooting a racist lawmaker in the hip? — Jesse Benn (@JesseBenn) June 14, 2017

His main beef with Wednesday’s shooting is that it was poorly organized:

For violent resistance to work it'd need to be organized. Individual acts can be understandable, but likely counterproductive/ineffective. — Jesse Benn (@JesseBenn) June 14, 2017

Newsweek seemed to think the most important fact about the shooting is that one of the victims supported Donald Trump:

Steve Scalise, shot at a congressional baseball game in Alexandria, was an early endorser of President Donald Trump https://t.co/K9akKI8Mdw pic.twitter.com/CuhYVnxnb1 — Newsweek (@Newsweek) June 14, 2017

Malcolm Harris quipped that it might be self-defense because Republicans have opposed Obamacare:

Media personality Tariq Nasheed implied that Scalise deserved to be shot:

The Atlantic‘s David Frum tweeted out a bunch of lies about Virginia’s gun laws (both state and federal law require background checks in Virginia, long guns can’t be concealed, and there’s no evidence as of yet that the shooter even had a valid concealed carry permit):

Virginia:

No background checks

No licensing

No registration

No permit req’d for concealed carry of long guns

Open carry long guns & handguns — David Frum (@davidfrum) June 14, 2017

MSNBC reacted to the shooting by demanding gun control.



“We have very loose gun laws around rifles, semiautomatic rifles, whatever it might be,” Clint Watts said.

HuffPost contributor Charles Clymer went on quite the rant about gun control:

Gun control activist Shannon Watts wasted no time in politicizing the tragedy:

The answer to the horrific #shooting tragedy this morning in Alexandria is not more guns and fewer gun laws. pic.twitter.com/D6ielP3npe — Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) June 14, 2017

Virginia Gov. Terry McAulliffe made a very interesting statement about gun violence, initially claiming that 93 million people a day lose their lives to gun violence in America:

This person says people who oppose gun control, not the progressive activist who tried to murder a bunch of Republican congressmen, are responsible for Wednesday’s shooting:

New York Times Lies About Gun Laws To Excuse Leftist Violence,"Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: a Democrat walks into a park and tries to murder every Republican he sees, and The New York Times declares that Republicans started it, and also it’s probably their own fault.

Much has been written about how The New York Times used its first editorial after a horrific mass assassination attempt on Republican lawmakers to absolve the shooter of agency over his own actions, and then to blame Republicans and “the gun lobby” for empowering the “deranged” progressive activist to murder them in the first place. Not content with peddling just one Big Lie, the esteemed NYT editorial board loaded its rhetorical shotgun with Big Lie buckshot and spread as many lies over as large an area as possible. Taking a cue from “Hamilton,” the paper of record didn’t want to throw away its shot.

It wasn’t enough for NYT to just recycle the lie — famously spread by the NYT six years ago, natch — that the shooter who tried to kill Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) in 2011, Jared Lee Loughner, was driven to act by Sarah Palin. It wasn’t enough for the editorial board to claim without evidence that the shooter in Alexandria was “deranged” in order to relieve him of responsibility for his own actions and avoid examining why he chose to walk into a public park and open fire on his declared enemies.

Deliberate evil must be grappled with, its causes and motivations explored; insanity, on the other hand, can be conveniently waved away. A crazy person doing crazy things requires no soul-searching, but an ideological ally making war on a shared political enemy after consuming and internalizing conspiracy theories peddled by your media comrades in arms? That would require some introspection and honest self-reflection, and ain’t nobody got time for that at The New York Times. It wasn’t enough for the Gray Lady to lie about a shooting in 2011 or to pretend yesterday’s shooter was just a garden-variety kook with no motive beyond insanity.

No, the NYT felt compelled to follow up on those lies with some lies about gun laws. A deranged man, the logic goes, can’t be responsible for his own actions, which means we must find the real culprit responsible for the atrocity. Having excused the shooter, NYT moved on to identifying the real villain: loose gun laws demanded by the evil gun lobby:

Was this attack evidence of how readily available guns and ammunition are in the United States? Indisputably. Mr. Hodgkinson, by definition, should not have had a gun, but he was licensed in his home state, Illinois. And in any event it would have been easy for him to acquire a weapon in Virginia, which requires no background checks in private sales, requires no registration for most weapons and has few restrictions on open carry.

These are lies, and vicious ones at that. As The New York Times surely knows, federal firearms laws trump any and all state and local laws, and under federal law, all gun purchases across state lines must be processed by a federal firearms licensee (FFL) and accompanied by a federal background check. There are no exceptions. Private individual-to-private individual sales across state lines are banned by federal law, which requires the transaction to be processed by an FFL, which is also required by federal law to run a background check on all transactions. There are no exceptions. The shooter was a resident of Illinois who was visiting Virginia. NYT’s implication that he could have legally purchased any type of firearm in the state of Virginia without a background check is a lie.

But the NYT didn’t stop there. The editorial then decided it needed to build on its Loughner lie and its Hodgkinson lie and its background check lie with a lie about open-carry laws. For those who may be unaware, brandishing and carrying are not synonyms. Walking around with a pistol or rifle in your hands is brandishing, not open carrying, and brandishing in public is only legal if you are in the process of defending yourself or someone else from imminent mortal harm. For pistols, the term “open carry” refers to the carrying of a gun in a visible holster. For rifles, it means the weapon is secured to your body by a sling. It does not mean walking to your van, grabbing your guns, holding them in your hands, and then aiming them at people you plan to kill.

These are not my opinions. They are facts, and they are facts that the New York Times deliberately ignores in order to peddle a false narrative that yesterday’s victims really have only themselves to blame.

When a certifiably insane man who believed that grammar was a government mind control conspiracy opened fire on a congresswoman in Arizona, The New York Times declared that the twin evils of Republican rhetoric and the gun lobby were to blame. A Nobel laureate employed by the New York Times indicted not the actual shooter, but a “climate of hate” created by — you guessed it — Republicans.

When a progressive Democrat activist who gorged himself on crackpot conspiracy theories peddled by left-wing luminaries like Rachel Maddow and participated in anti-GOP hate groups on Facebook with names like “Terminate the Republican Party” deliberately planned the mass assassination of a bunch of Republican lawmakers playing baseball, The New York Times blamed…Republican rhetoric and the gun lobby. When an insane man attempts to kill a Democrat, it’s the Republicans’ fault. When a Bernie Bro tries, after spending weeks watching Democrats like Kathy Griffin peddle assassination porn to their merry followers, to assassinate a park full of Republicans, violent rhetoric from unhinged partisans is suddenly no longer relevant.

The New York Times could’ve used Wednesday’s attempted massacre against Republicans to urge, without caveats, an end to violent and hateful rhetoric about one’s political opponents and a return to civility and basic decency. It instead chose to double down on debunked lies, to craft entirely new lies to justify its old lies, to vilify its political opponents, and even to blame them for the very acts of violence perpetrated against them. The New York Times had a chance to restore some modicum of civil discourse to the public square, and it refused.

The paper of record’s editorial board had an opportunity to lay down their arms, but they refused to throw away their shot.

It’s Time To Allow Concealed-Carry Permits In Washington DC,"In the wake of the targeted shooting of Republicans at baseball practice and the heroic efforts of capitol police to apprehend the shooter, it’s time we revisit an ineffective, unconstitutional law that bans adults from obtaining concealed-carry permits inside the District of Columbia.

Not only do our representatives and other government officials deserve to feel safe while doing their civic duty on our behalf, but the rest of us who enjoy DC regularly have a right to protect ourselves while visiting a hotspot for crime.

More Guns Save Lives By Democratizing Force

If any area of the country should expand gun laws, it’s Washington DC, where power is centralized, crime is rampant, and more guns will save lives. As the hub of political activity where our political leaders gather and work, there’s often hardly enough police or security to go around for representatives and their aides. Many work, attend meetings, and travel accompanied by a staff member and no protection whatsoever.

In the case of the Alexandria shooting, armed police were only on-site because a member of congressional leadership was also, which allowed a quicker resolution to an awful situation as they immediately returned fire. But what if Majority Whip Steve Scalise hadn’t been present? More people would likely have been injured or killed.

Although crime, particularly homicide, is down in the District, violent crime is still higher than the national average and the city, along with nearby Baltimore, is among the top murder capitals of the nation. Recently while at my favorite kid-friendly restaurant on Capitol Hill, I asked a cop what it was like to try to stop crime there. He shook his head and said they often reprimand the same perpetrators over and over. What about loosening gun restrictions? “They never will,” he said with a sigh. “This city is too liberal.”

The Nation’s Gun Control Mecca

Washington DC gun laws are far too strict. Currently, buying and selling handguns is illegal in the District. Residents and non-residents can apply for a concealed-carry permit, but due to a stay issued by a federal appeals court last year, “DC Just Cause” is in effect. That means folks seeking a permit to lawfully carry must go through an arduous process that includes meeting multiple requirements, “including demonstrated to the Chief good reason to fear injury to his or her person or property or has any other proper reason for carrying a pistol.”

Once the paperwork is filled out, granting permission is still at the discretion of local police. Should the police finally give permission for an individual who has demonstrated “need” to acquire his concealed-carry permit, there are still restrictions on top of that.

Even after that, a lawmaker who’s been threatened before and established his need for a permit can’t reload his six-shot revolver more than once on his foes as that would equal 12 rounds, the max amount allowed in DC. But isn’t the whole point of acquiring a concealed-carry permit to allow for personal protection or protection of defenseless around you? Limiting law-abiding citizens’ ability to protect themselves and others only makes innocents vulnerable to bad people, who have less regard for following the law. If you’re going to commit murder, you’re not going to be worrying about breaking a rounds restriction in the process.

The Second Amendment Is Constitutional, Ya’ll

Of course, fans of the Second Amendment already know the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia addressed this issue in his epic, must-read majority opinion for District of Columbia v. Heller, a landmark case overruling the District’s previous outright gun ban, for which the District has substituted an effective paperwork ban.

It is enough to note, as we have observed, that the American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon. There are many reasons that a citizen may prefer a handgun for home defense: It is easier to store in a location that is readily accessible in an emergency; it cannot easily be redirected or wrestled away by an attacker; it is easier to use for those without the upperbody strength to lift and aim a long gun; it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police. Whatever the reason, handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid. We must also address the District’s requirement (as applied to respondent’s handgun) that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times. This makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional.

Lawmakers in places like DC don’t want the average adult walking around with a concealed-carry permit because they too have bought into the absurd lie that more frequent bearing of loaded weapons would be a menace to society. This has been debunked so many times it’s hardly worth doing so here. Dozens of statistics show the more gun control decreases, the more crime does too. In other words, the more people possess guns, the less others commit crime. There are countless stories of people protecting themselves or loved ones with a legally purchased handgun.

I Just Want to Protect My Kids from Crazies

Although I live in Northern Virginia, as a mother of four who homeschools at least one history buff, we make regular, often weekly, trips into DC for various festivals, conventions, exhibits, or just to revisit an favorite museum or monument. I find every year my kids are able to glean more from the same exhibits they’ve seen dozens of times.

However, in the wake of so many terrorist attacks over the last five years, especially of “soft” targets, I’ve often wondered how I would protect myself and my four kids should tragedy strike while we are visiting one of the most targeted areas in the world. The National Mall, for example, is a wonderful place to learn and roam, but there’s very little shelter. If something tragic happened there, we’d have difficulty hiding or finding shelter, let alone actively protecting ourselves.

I’m a sane adult but don’t have an express vocational need for protection, except protecting the valuables my children represent. If I were allowed to possess a concealed-carry permit, I could rest a little easier knowing I could proactively protect my children and those around me in the event of sudden crisis. As Scalia said in Heller,

Undoubtedly some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem. That is perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct.

No, it is not. As a friend said to me in an e-mail, “The de facto ban on concealed carry is why I travel to D.C. as little as possible. I’m way more likely to get knifed or shot or robbed there than I am just anywhere else, and it’s the one place I can’t legally defend myself. Forget that.” So it’s time for the District to lift its tight restrictions on gun laws, allow reasonable adults to acquire a concealed-carry permit, and let everyone rest easier in our nation’s capital.

What I Learned About America From 'Gunsmoke' And 'House Of Cards',"As a university English professor, I am always on the lookout for laboratory experiments to conduct to rival my science and math colleagues. So recently I engaged in a binge-watching experiment across a few days, to analyze two jarringly different TV narratives of American virtue: The fifth season of “House of Cards” (2017), and a string of episodes from the ninth season of “Gunsmoke” (1964). The comparison revealed something of how the stories we Americans tell about ourselves and America changed across half a century.

“Gunsmoke” on CBS claims to be the world’s longest-running prime-time TV drama series with the same star and setting, from 1955 to 1975. One TV critic memorialized its Western mythology as “the Iliad and the Odyssey” of America. In its first years a top-rated show, it kept a solid loyal following. John Wayne, who had once long before been anointed by the real Wyatt Earp, gave his blessing to its opening. Its star James Arness was a decorated World War II hero.

“House of Cards” on Netflix superseded an older British send-up of parliamentary democracy to become in its own right a mythic American TV story for the 2010s, focused on an imperial presidency and decadent American leadership class. They, in the words of one character, lack any “North Star” of ideals, values, or even ideology. One of its stars, Kevin Spacey, did become a real-life hero of the old White House Correspondents Dinner during President Obama’s administration.

Both Sets of Leads Are Childless, Yet Different

On “House of Cards” this season, Spacey’s President Francis Underwood puts out a cigarette in an American flag as he prepares to resign in the wake of scandals involving murders and electoral manipulations that make Watergate look like a vaudeville skit, not to mention sexual relations that would make Arness’ Matt Dillon in “Gunsmoke” blush. The current-day political drama ends with the murderous first spouse Claire Underwood (Robin Wright) becoming president while exclaiming in an Evita-like pose: “Now it’s my turn.”

That turn of events would be unthinkable in a “Gunsmoke” universe, where traditional gender roles are well-prescribed, despite Amanda Blake’s admirable strong female lead, Miss Kitty, whose ambiguous relation with Matt is matched by her ambiguous business at the Long Branch.

This leads us to one of few commonalities between the two series: A lack of focus on intergenerational community values, or what the Iroquois called “the seventh generation” ethos, in postwar American pop culture. There is zero concern at the terminus of the sexual revolution in “House of Cards” about children and family. They are strongly implicit in “Gunsmoke,” yet the main characters remain single and, like the Underwoods, childless.

Different Views of Virtue’s Restraint

But although the TV “Gunsmoke” was billed from Wayne’s introduction onward as an “adult” Western, presenting in weekly dramas many of life’s complexities and tragedies along with the humor of character actors, it was never morally ambiguous.

For example, while its treatment of racial issues in early episodes emphasized Native Americans, and can seem stereotyped today, it did so pretty seriously in looking for fairness. A rough frontier sense of natural law and integrity girds Dillon’s loins: Life is a cycle of tragedy, and requires heroic self-discipline, good humor, and an ensemble of friendship in many hangout scenes. Sexual infidelity and a materialistic or greedy lifestyle are to be mourned and warned against for feeding passions leading easily to violence.

Uncelebrated by “Gunsmoke” is the back-stabbing blind ambition and infidelity that transfix viewers of “House of Cards,” except as moral lessons that nonetheless are surprisingly contextualized in the complexities of human nature for the earlier TV drama.

In line with American secularism, neither series is explicitly religious, although “Gunsmoke” finds implicit grounding in the misty Judeo-Christian American civil religion of its day, with one of the regulars Festus (the singing cowboy Ken Curtis) belting out the hymn “Shall We Gather by the River” at a frontier funeral in a pious scene. “House of Cards” remains “One Nation Underwood.” “Gunsmoke” steered past the upheavals of the 1960s in a meta-time of perhaps oblivious mythos. But American studies scholar Nicolaus Mills wrote in a memorial tribute that, “In his role as a lawman who fired his gun only reluctantly and as a last resort, Arness embodied the best values of America’s cold war culture.”

Older and wiser to the ways of the world, “House of Cards” offers us few pretensions to restraint, virtue, or faith in the search for power by aged baby boomers facing mortality and anxious millennials jockeying to replace them. It raises the question of whether Plato or Aristotle were right about the cathartic or mimetic effects of art. Does art help remove our baser instincts through affective release, or reinforce them through imitation, or both?

What Terror and Isolation Presage

Regardless, if we were more concerned as a culture with the “seventh generation” we would be considering more the narratives on which to nurse a country, and their impact on young people, one of whom recently told me that this Native American ethos is outdated as it is hateful “to people who choose not to reproduce.”

“House of Cards” feeds the dominant narrative of fragmentation and divided hate in American polity today, in hellish visions as if from Edward Gibbons’ “Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” nonetheless all too accepted now. It may remind us that a national culture of terror and isolation were for Hannah Arendt precursors of totalitarianism.

Despite a blasé attitude toward violence, “Gunsmoke” offers a different vision, that of U.S. Marshall Dillon as a trusted and affable authority figure, embodying the self-discipline needed to run and keep a commonwealth-republic. Even if the civil religion it fed upon is mostly a felt absence, Dillon’s Dodge City still affords a surprising refuge of humanistic community from the real-life stress of Underwood’s posthuman Washington today.

Gun Controllers Know Their Policies Won’t Stop Murder. It's Another Game,"Over at National Review, Charlie Cooke has done an invaluable service by pointing out that the FBI’s brief report on the Alexandria GOP baseball practice shooting “is devastating to the idea that the gun-control measures presently coveted by the Democratic party would have done something to prevent the attack.”

It certainly is. But this gets at the heart of the deeper problem of the American gun control debate, a problem that is both persistent and pervasive: the legal measures the gun control movement generally seeks would be almost completely ineffectual at curbing U.S. gun violence.

It is difficult to overstate this. The big players in the gun control movement—the Democratic Party, the Brady Campaign, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, whatever tax shelter Mike Bloomberg is currently chairing—all tend to espouse the same legislative ambitions for gun control, yet these would be effectively useless at stopping both mass shootings and lower-profile gangland and domestic incidents of gun violence. I do not support this useless and pointless gun control. And I do not trust the people who advocate it.

Here’s What They’re Pushing and Why It Won’t Work

As Cooke points out, over the past 20 years or so, Democrats have lobbied aggressively for several gun control provisions: that private sales should require background checks; that certain firearms with certain cosmetic features should be classified as “assault weapons” and subsequently banned; and that magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition should be outlawed.

These aims largely align with the desires of the wider gun control community. Various groups also demand, say, that convicted domestic abusers be prohibited from purchasing firearms (they already are) and that Internet gun sales be subject to background checks (they already are). These are the general aspirations of the gun control movement, and you can readily expect that, after every serious shooting, these demands will be remade, recycled, and reiterated.

There is just one problem with these impositions: they have almost nothing to do with gun violence in America. Had these proposed rules been in place, they would have had virtually no effect at preventing America’s recent high-profile mass shootings. At Sandy Hook, for instance, the killer murdered his mother and stole her firearms. No amount of background checks would have prevented such a thing.

The primary rifle he used, meanwhile, was a common .223-caliber weapon not even outlawed by Connecticut’s then-current “assault weapon ban.” And while the killer did indeed use large-capacity magazines in his rifle, it is doubtful that a ban on such equipment would have made much difference. It honestly does not take that long to switch out empty mags, and a determined shooter can do it very quickly.

Or consider the Islamist killers who perpetrated the San Bernardino shooting in late 2015. One legally purchased the two handguns used in the attack, passing a background check. A friend of the shooter, meanwhile, purchased the rifles they used in a “straw purchase,” and the guns were modified in such a way as to be illegal under California law—as good an indicator as any that silly cosmetic “assault weapons” bans do not work at all.

Gun Regulations Simply Won’t Stop Criminals

Name a mass shooting in America over the past 20 years or so and you’re likely to find one of two factors: either the shooters obtained their weapons legally, in which case the popularly proposed legal remedies would have made no difference, or they obtained their weapons illegally, and in a manner that the popularly proposed remedies would not have affected.

Put another way: in virtually every shooting incident that gun controllers cite as evidence of the need for more gun control, the gun control they demand would not have stopped the shooting. It would be tantamount to Mothers Against Drunk Driving demanding stricter government inspection standards for windshield wipers in an attempt to prevent drunk driving incidents: it would accomplish nothing.

The same is true for the more run-of-the-mill gun violence that plagues a fair number of American cities and urban areas. It has been known for some time that criminals do not, as a rule, get their guns legally. The types of new rules gun controllers often propose—expanded background checks, say—would thus have very little effect on American gun violence.

Yet gun controllers would have us believe that, with the passage of a universal background check bill, murderous thugs and gang members would suddenly decide of their own volition, “Gee, I guess I’d better get my firearms through legitimate channels from here on out!” This is a thoroughly improbable scenario.

Something Else Is Afoot

With all of these considerations, I oppose all of these proposed laws for the same reason millions and millions of other gun rights advocates oppose them: because they would place additional burdens and restrictions on law-abiding gun owners while doing nothing to prevent criminals from acquiring and using firearms.

So we are left with this question: if their proposed remedies would be so obviously and demonstrably unlikely to solve the very problems they claim to intend to solve, then why do gun controllers keep advocating these ridiculous and counterintuitive laws?

The answer is not hard to see. Gun control advocates, like most political actors, are pragmatic and practical. They understand that certain legislative goals and ambitions must play out over a period of time rather than in a political instant. You can see this type of long-game strategy in, say, the American health-care debate: after seven years of Obamacare, Democrats are increasingly pursuing single-payer, something that was much less feasible before the Affordable Care Act. Indeed, Sen. Harry Reid has explicitly stated that Obamacare is intended solely to be “a step in the right direction” towards single-payer, nothing more.

So it is with gun control: liberals propose these useless laws and regulations not in an attempt to honestly curb gun violence but rather in a long-form attempt to pass other laws down the road. It will be much easier to ban large classes of semiautomatic rifles, after all, after five or ten years of banning scary-looking AR-style “assault weapons.” It will be far easier, too, to sharply restrict firearm purchases after a decade of regulating ammunition sales, the latter of which will soon begin in California.

This doesn’t have to be some grand conspiracy theory or dark, shadowy intrigue. Gun controllers are not stupid. They understand long-form political action as well as anyone. They do not like guns and they are more than patient enough to play the drawn-out politics necessary to curtail American gun rights.

This is why I oppose these perennial gun control efforts and deeply mistrust the people who advocate them. To be fair, I get it: if the situation were reversed, and I were starting from a legal position in which gun rights were severely restricted in this country, I would play the same game if necessary. It’s the smart thing to do.

But our Second Amendment rights are too precious and hard-won to allow them to be chipped away by slow and deliberate political strikes. Every worthless gun law passed today will give way to a slightly more restrictive law several years from now, then one more after that, and another after that. Gun controllers are welcome to play this game, of course. But we should be prepared to head them off as early as possible. They understand the stakes, and they understand how to get what they want. So should we.

Here Are The Actual Federal Laws Regulating Machine Guns In The U.S.,"The horrific mass shooting of scores of people in Las Vegas on Sunday has once again re-ignited the gun control debate in the U.S. News reports indicate that the shooter, who opened fired on a crowd of concertgoers on Sunday night, killed at least 50 people and wounded more than 200. Audio recordings of the shooting, which captured rapid fire bursts, suggest that the shooter used a fully automatic weapon. The speculation that the shooter may have used fully automatic weapons set off frenzied demands that the government do something to ban these weapons and charges that the so-called gun lobby was responsible for making machine guns legal and easy to buy.

The handful of tweets below are indicative of the current fact-free tenor of debate on the issue:

Nevada doesn’t require gun owners to be licensed, register weapon or limit number of guns. MACHINE GUNS ARE LEGAL https://t.co/o1S25PNAhO — Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) October 2, 2017

While the desire to prevent atrocities like the one committed in Las Vegas is both understandable and good, it is impossible to have a reasoned discussion on the best ways to prevent mass attacks when emotions, rather than facts, are the foundation for debate. Here are the facts on federal regulation of machine guns and fully automatic weapons in the United States.

Federal law highly regulates the manufacture, sale, and ownership of fully automatic weapons in the United States. For those unfamiliar with firearms nomenclature, a fully automatic weapon is one that is capable of firing multiple rounds with only one pull of the trigger; a semi-automatic weapon will fire only one round per trigger pull while preparing the gun to fire another round when the trigger is pulled again. The main federal law governing fully automatic weapons is called the National Firearms Act, or NFA. First enacted in 1934, this federal law regulates fully automatic weapons, suppressors, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, and destructive devices such as bombs or grenades. The NFA was subsequently modified in 1968 by the Gun Control Act and in 1986 by the Firearm Owners Protection Act.

Items included in the NFA are referred to colloquially as “NFA items,” and are highly regulated. A special license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) is required to manufacture, sell, and own any of these items, without exception. Whereas regular gun manufacturers and dealers must obtain a Federal Firearms License, or FFL, to legally make and sell non-NFA firearms, entities who wish to make or sell NFA items must obtain an additional license on top of the FFL. These dealers are referred to as FFL/SOT (special occupational tax) or Class 3 FFL dealers. It is a lengthy and burdensome process that requires extensive investigation by ATF.

Under the NFA, it is illegal for any private civilian to own any fully automatic weapons manufactured after May 19, 1986. Only certain types of FFL/SOTs may make them, and then only for purchase by qualified state and federal agencies. There are no exceptions. According to the ATF’s official handbook on NFA laws and regulations, it’s not even legal to make new replacement parts for pre-1986 machine guns: “There is no exception allowing for the lawful production, transfer, possession, or use of a post-May 18, 1986 machinegun receiver as a replacement receiver on a weapon produced prior to May 19, 1986.”

So what about pre-1986 machine guns? Are civilians permitted to own those? Yes, with a host of exceptions. The pre-1986 machine guns may be sold only by a FFL/SOT and must be registered with the ATF. Easy peasy, right? Not really. The process of registering a NFA item with the ATF is costly, invasive, and time-consuming. Federal law requires extensive background checks of anyone wishing to own a NFA item such as a machine gun. If you wanted to purchase a machine gun today, it would take close to a year, and you would be required to submit fingerprints and a photo to accompany your background check. Each NFA item also requires its own tax stamp, which costs $200. Once the ATF decides that an individual is permitted by law to own a NFA item, it adds that individual’s name, address, and biographical information to a federal gun registry and matches it to the serial number of the licensed NFA item. This goes for every item listed in the NFA, not just machine guns. Individuals with NFA items are then required to notify the ATF when they move and any time they plan to travel outside their state of residence with the NFA item.

And that’s just the federal registration process. We haven’t even discussed the cost of purchasing a legal machine gun. If you can find a legal, ATF-stamped, pre-1986 machine gun for less than $10,000, then you’re a miracle worker. A legal NFA sear — the machined part of the trigger group that makes a firearm capable of fully automatic firing — can cost anywhere from $15,000 to $50,000. And lest you think that any random yokel can just head into the garage and cobble together functional full auto sear, think again. While it is indeed possible, the tools and know-how required to precisely mill the sear, not to mention the myriad other necessary modifications, are in relatively short supply.

Reports, like those from ABC reporter Terry Moran, that machine guns are perfectly legal in Nevada and other states are highly misleading. Federal law, after all, pre-empts state law. In fact, under Nevada state law, NFA items are only legal if they have been legally obtained and registered under federal law. You can’t just waltz into the state with an unregistered machine gun and expect to walk around scot-free. This is the case in all states which allow possession of NFA items. Legal federal ownership is a prerequisite in every case. If the NFA item is not owned, registered, and stamped in compliance with federal laws and regulations, then the item is illegal under state law.

In conclusion, fully automatic weapons are highly regulated under both federal and state law. Only licensed entities are permitted to manufacture, sell, or own them. Private civilian ownership of machine guns is illegal unless the individual has been explicitly permitted by the federal ATF to own them. All fully automatic weapons must be registered with the federal government in a central registry with no exceptions. A special tax is levied on all NFA items (machine guns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles, short-barreled shotguns, and destructive devices) with no exceptions.

These are not my opinions. They are cold, hard facts about gun laws in the United States. We all want to stop the kinds of atrocities that happened in Las Vegas, but we can’t do that unless we know and accept all the facts about the situation. The sooner we can all agree to debate the facts, rather than be ruled by our emotions, the sooner we can work together for a solution to the problem of gun violence.

When You Politicize Shootings You Make It Harder To Find Solutions,"There are generally two kinds of social media reactions to heart-wrenching events like yesterday’s mass shooting in Las Vegas: one is to offer prayers and sympathy to the victims and their families, and the other is to reflexively lash out in anger at those who don’t share your political agenda. Although emotionally satisfying, one of these responses makes it nearly impossible for the country to engage in any kind of useful discussion moving forward.

No doubt, there is immense frustration after a mass shooting, and this looks to be the most deadly in American history. The unstated reality is that many of these murders probably can’t be stopped. Attempting to preemptively discern which of our neighbors are ideologically driven or mentally capable of committing mass murder is no more feasible than trying to keep every one of the 350 million guns in the country away from them. Most often, even the relatives seem to be at a complete loss as to why it happens. “We’re lost. I don’t understand this,” the Vegas shooter’s brother told the media. They never do.

The more horrifying realization is that once a person has lost his moral bearings the killing part is pretty easy. The gunman, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, poured hundreds of bullets from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel into a concert below. Some reports say his criminal record amounted to no more than minor traffic infractions, and other reports say he was “known” to the local police. Some people have jumped to conclusions regarding “terrorism,” though, as of this writing, there is no evidence of any political motive. Sooner or later we’re going to know everything about the man.

Maybe Paddock evaded or abused some gun law. Maybe it can be tightened. But those who reflexively call for more restrictive gun laws without even knowing how or why Paddock got his hands on guns — or what kind of firearms he used — give themselves away. Those who conflate automatic and semi-automatic guns also give themselves away.

Those in the press who mislead the public on all these issues give themselves away, as well. They are interested not merely in stopping mass shootings, but limiting gun ownership. This kind of reaction hardens the resolve of Second Amendment advocates and creates an environment that makes any realistic options moot. Rather than specifically pointing to areas of achievable compromise, the reaction of most gun-control advocates seems to be a declaration of partisan war.

“Our grief isn’t enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA,” tweeted Hillary Clinton (emphasis mine), “and work together to try to stop this from happening again.” This an example of someone — and there increasingly more like her — who can’t distinguish ideology from general decency. The NRA is a strawman for countless political activists who are too cowardly to condemn the 55-plus million Americans who own firearms and the millions of others who support their right to do so. Reflexively treating law-abiding gun owners or the organizations that represent them as if they are tacitly encouraging or cheering violence does nothing to advance the goals that gun-control advocates claim to embrace.

It wasn’t that long ago, in fact, that Democrats led by Sen. Chris Murphy, a person who’s probably done as much as anyone in recent years to ensure the failure of gun-control legislation, were accusing Republicans of selling guns to ISIS.

“Thoughts & prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative indifference,” the Connecticut senator said today. “It’s time for Congress to get off its ass.” Other than self-aggrandizement, Murphy has never gotten off his ass to do anything about the issue. None of the legislation he’s championed would have done anything to stop the shootings in Newtown or any other events he’s decided to exploit.

In fact, when Republicans agreed to legislation that would link the terror watch list (which includes many thousands of Americans, most innocent of wrongdoing) to a gun sales ban as long as there was some semblance of due process, Senate Democrats killed it. Murphy is so intent on weakening the Second Amendment he is perfectly willing to circumvent the Fifth and Sixth, as well.

This kind of ideological stridency and partisanship feeds into the distrust gun owners have towards politicians. For many of them, gun laws feel a lot like incremental steps to undermine access. It’s difficult to disagree with this perception when you read and listen to the rhetoric of most liberal gun-control groups. The only thing this kind of partisanship creates is a spike in legal ownership. That is fine by me, but probably not what the sincere gun-control advocate was hoping to accomplish.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/02/politicize-shootings-make-harder-find-solutions/,2017-10-02
Democrats Have No Idea How To Prevent Mass Shootings,"Unlike the vast majority of pundits, politicians, and late-night celebrity talk show hosts who vaguely implore Republicans to “do something,” Nick Kristof of The New York Times has taken the time to offer eight ideas he believes would help alleviate mass shootings. In fact, the headline of the article reads “Preventing Mass Shootings Like the Vegas Strip Attack.” Alas, the column doesn’t fulfill its promise, though it is useful in illustrating the problem Democrats face in the gun-control debate.

The column gets off to an inauspicious start when Kristof points to Australia’s confiscation of guns as a model for policy — which is, of course, a non-starter in a nation with more than 300 million firearms and an individual right to own them. Every time a pundit mentions Australian gun policy he is, in essence, conceding that confiscation is the ideal we should be working towards. The success of the Australian program is highly debatable, and anyone who fails to mention that the United States saw similar drops in gun crimes and homicides during the same timeframe — despite a big spike in gun ownership — is already suspect.

In any event, Kristof has eight additional ideas for us.

“1 – Impose universal background checks for anyone buying a gun. Four out of five Americans support this measure, to prevent criminals or terrorists from obtaining guns.”

This is tantamount to pleading for the existing ban on “machine guns” or “automatic weapons.” In 1993, Bill Clinton created the National Instant Background Check System. Since then, although there are some exemptions, the vast majority of gun owners go through a background check. There were 27,538,673 of them in 2016 alone (pdf). The reason Kristof throws in the word “universal,” I assume, is that he believes there are “loopholes” in this policy at gun shows and interstate purchases.

Yet, as my colleague Sean Davis has explained:

If you purchase a firearm from a federal firearms licensee (FFL) regardless of the location of the transaction — a gun store, a gun show, a gun dealer’s car trunk, etc. — that FFL must confirm that you are legally allowed to purchase that gun. That means the FFL must either run a background check on you via the federal NICS database, or confirm that you have passed a background check by examining your state-issued concealed carry permit or your government-issued purchase permit. There are zero exceptions to this federal requirement.

What’s more, Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock did not, as far as we know (and these things can change as reporting is ongoing), have a criminal record. According to numerous reports, he obtained all his firearms legally and without raising any red flags while passing numerous background checks. In fact, most of the mass shooters who have terrorized Americans in recent years didn’t have any criminal records. Most could pass background checks, and did. Some were radicalized and known to the FBI. Most were mentally anguished rather than criminally inclined, which is an exceptionally difficult thing to define, predict, or control.

It is true that occasionally the system failed. This happened in the case of Dylann Roof, who should have been stopped by a background check, but a breakdown in “paperwork and communication between a federal background check worker and state law enforcement” allowed him to purchase a handgun. Make the system we have better.

“2. Impose a minimum age limit of 21 on gun purchases. This is already the law for handgun purchases in many states, and it mirrors the law on buying alcohol.”

Well, some of us believe it’s absurd that 18-year-olds can support themselves, have families, and join the military, but are prohibited from buying a beer. But that’s another debate. Many states already have age 21 limits on purchasing guns. Not that it really matters. The vast majority of the mass shooters over the past decade were over 21. Most of them were well over 21.

The ones that weren’t, like Adam Lanza, illegally obtained their guns from legal owners. Lanza stole his guns from his mother, who had legally registered every one of them. I couldn’t find a single major mass shooting (this is typically defined as four or more people killed or injured by gunfire, which includes many criminal events that most people would not associate with what happened in Las Vegas, but that’s another story) who had legally purchased weapons as an 18- to 20-year-old. It seems dubious to suggest that passing such a law would do anything to “prevent” mass shootings.

“3. Enforce a ban on possession of guns by anyone subject to a domestic violence protection order. This is a moment when people are upset and prone to violence against their exes.”

Taking someone’s rights away because he or she is “upset” or potentially violent might work in the “Minority Report” but it is likely unconstitutional here in the real world. In fact, in some ways, a case about just this topic sparked the idea that grew into the Heller case and ended up properly codifying the Second Amendment as an individual right.

It came in 1998, when a doctor named Timothy Joe Emerson was in the midst of an acrimonious divorce and his wife requested a restraining order against him from a Texas court. At the time, Emerson had been collecting guns for years and legally owned around 30 firearms. What Emerson didn’t know was that federal law at the time forbade anyone under a domestic restraining order from possessing firearms. He was arrested. Emerson’s court-appointed lawyer argued that without any judicial finding that his client posed a danger to his wife, Emerson still had a constitutional right to own a gun. And he won. It was the Emerson decision that sparked a number of libertarian think tank legal scholars to challenge DC gun laws.

“4. Limit gun purchases by any one person to no more than, say, two a month, and tighten rules on straw purchasers who buy for criminals. Make serial numbers harder to remove.”

This is like limiting soda sizes. The idea that shooters will be stopped because they can only purchase two guns per month seems dubious considering many of these shootings have been meticulously planned, none more, it seems, than Paddock’s mass murder in Vegas. There is also the problem of arbitrarily limiting citizens from practicing their constitutional rights. This would be like arguing that we should limit columnists to practicing their freedom of speech to only two columns a week because words are mightier than the sword.

“5. Adopt microstamping of cartridges so that they can be traced to the gun that fired them, useful for solving gun crimes.”

To my understanding, every mass shooting incident has been solved. How this regulation would prevent more is unclear. The rest of Kristof’s suggestions focus on gun safety measures that have nothing to do with mass shootings.

“6. Invest in ‘smart gun’ purchases by police departments or the U.S. military, to promote their use. Such guns require a PIN or can only be fired when near a particular bracelet or other device, so that children cannot misuse them and they are less vulnerable to theft. The gun industry made a childproof gun in the 1800’s but now resists smart guns.”

This suggesting is irrelevant on a number of levels. For one, smart guns would do little or nothing to “prevent” most mass shootings. Second, no major Second Amendment advocacy group or politician I know of opposes the production or promotion of “smart guns” — they oppose the state compelling people to use them. There are a few other problems: They don’t work yet. They are impractical. They are intrusive to law-abiding gun owners.

“7. Require safe storage, to reduce theft, suicide and accidents by children.”

It’s unclear how these requirements would “prevent” mass shootings, but often the proposed safe storage legislation makes it virtually impossible for gun owners to protect themselves or their family. Regardless, many states already have such laws and every state already has laws covering negligent behavior regarding children.

There is no correlation between gun ownership and suicide rates.

“8. Invest in research to see what interventions will be more effective in reducing gun deaths. We know, for example, that alcohol and guns don’t mix, but we don’t know precisely what laws would be most effective in reducing the resulting toll. Similar investments in reducing other kinds of accidental deaths have been very effective.”

Again, there is no evidence that mass shootings are fueled by alcohol or substance abuse, but rather that they are fueled by mental illness and radicalism. There are already numerous studies regarding gun use and abuse, and one hopes others study the data, as well. But if Kristof is suggesting that the centers for Disease Control participate, the answer is that there is no reason to further politicize the agency. Because no matter how well-intentioned people try to be in this debate, that’s almost always the case. That includes Kristof’s column, which fails to offer a single idea short of confiscation that would stop mass shootings in the future.

Gun Debate Is Pointless Because Left Wants To End Second Amendment,"It didn’t take long. Long before all the facts about the tragic mass shooting in Las Vegas were known or even all the missing were accounted for, liberals were riding their familiar gun control hobby horses. Within hours of the atrocity, articles were being posted online from the usual suspects, like Frank Bruni and Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times and Richard Cohen of the Washington Post, trotting out familiar themes. They want laws requiring more background checks, age limits on purchases, preventing people with a record of mental illness or domestic violence from being sold weapons, so-called “smart gun” measures that can trace guns and ammunition more easily, and even suggested banning handguns.

As is the case with most of the mass shootings that have shocked Americans in recent decades, none of these measures would have prevented the slaughter in Las Vegas. Initial reports say that shooter Stephen Paddock passed background checks when he purchased weapons. That makes sense since the police have initially said he didn’t have a record of prior offenses.

Even if every one of the left’s favorite pet ideas about guns were enacted, the only likely outcome would be to make it far more difficult for law-abiding citizens to legally purchase guns. And in those places, like Chicago and New York City, where draconian gun laws are already on the books, that is exactly what has happened, as the process to obtain and legally use a gun is so onerous that most ordinary citizens don’t even try. Needless to say, these measures do nothing to prevent gun violence by those who obtain weapons illegally.

Yet what’s interesting about the inevitable recycling of this debate is that liberals aren’t speaking up for the one measure that might actually change the country in a manner they’d like: repealing the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

What Happens If We Repeal the Second Amendment

Nothing could possibly stop all gun crimes. But if we were living in a country where it was illegal for private citizens to possess most weapons, there’s little doubt that firearms would become a scarce commodity. Forget background checks, mental health restrictions, smart guns, and every other measure designed to make those who wish to legally purchase firearms difficult. Just make it a crime to sell or own them. Use existing registration laws to round up the guns that are already legally owned. Restrict legal possession to law enforcement agencies.

If that’s too harsh for you, just copy Australia and require anyone who owns a gun to obtain a federal license and demand that they have a “genuine reason” for wanting one, thus giving bureaucrats, the police and judges the right to deny a gun to those who whose story doesn’t pass muster according to some subjective standard.

That would create a black market for firearms that would supply criminals with all the guns they’d need. But it would also mean that guns would become scarce and expensive. Since there are already hundreds of millions of firearms in circulation in the United States, it might take some time for the Feds to make a dent in the number of guns out there. But along with a massive buyback program, if the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were given the vast resources that liberals tell us should never be expended on rounding up illegal immigrants, I don’t doubt that the supply of guns would dry up. The end of legal firearms wouldn’t necessarily prevent another Las Vegas or Sandy Hook or Aurora, Colorado, but a country in which arms were no longer plentiful might be one with fewer such incidents.

Why Won’t Gun Control Advocates State The Truth?

If pressed for honesty, most liberals would admit that’s exactly the kind of country they would like to live in. Why then don’t they call for changes in the laws to make the U.S. more like Australia, where studies say mass shootings and homicides have been reduced?

The answer is obvious. The overwhelming majority of Americans support the right to bear arms guaranteed by the constitution. Even when they were using tragic incidents to demand more gun control, liberal politicians like former President Obama would keep telling us that they believed in the Second Amendment and didn’t want to take away guns from honest citizens. Yet every time they made such statements or began new efforts to pass more gun laws, gun purchases soared since many Americans believed they were lying about not wanting to let them keep their guns.

Their skepticism is rooted in the knowledge that all of the so-called “common sense” laws for which liberals advocate are designed to hinder legal firearms purchases, not criminal gun violence or mass shootings. That is why members of the National Rifle Association, a group that is routinely demonized by the left, thinks even an anodyne measure like more background checks at gun shows is just the thin edge of the wedge of a Second Amendment repeal.

So this time, instead of rehearsing the same tired arguments about ideas that wouldn’t change anything, perhaps the left can tell us what they really want and let the country have an honest debate.

Gun Advocates Must Acknowledge The Price Of Liberty

The choice is clear.

If we are to remain a nation where the right to bear arms is constitutionally protected, we’re going to have to live with the possibility, maybe even the probability, that legally-obtained weapons will sometimes be used for a bad purpose by insane or evil people. If we want to be a country where gun violence is reduced drastically, then we will also have to be one where ownership of legal weapons is restricted to a privileged few rather than a right all citizens enjoy.

Those who support the Second Amendment must be honest about the price of the liberty they cherish. But those who wish to deprive us of that right must also be honest about what they want. The Second Amendment exists because the Founders believed giving the monopoly on firearms to the state was a prescription for tyranny. Is that a risk most of us wish to run?

Many Americans do wish to relegate the Second Amendment to the trash heap of history. Perhaps many would like to trade some of their liberty for fewer worries about gun violence. But if liberals want to talk about gun control, rather than more disingenuous nonsense about background checks, that’s the argument they should be forced to make.

Anything short of that is a waste of our time. Until the left directly addresses their desire to change the Constitution and end gun rights altogether, their rhetoric about gun violence should be ignored.

Jessica Chastain Uses Vegas Attack To Juice Sales For Failed 2016 Movie,"Actress Jessica Chastain is exploiting the recent tragedy in Las Vegas, where a gunman killed at least 58 and wounded another 515, to promote her movie that bombed in the box office last year.

Chastain, who played the lead role in “Miss Sloane” — an anti-Second Amendment movie which sold an average of 10 movie tickets per theatre during the first two weeks of the film’s box office debut — is apparently trying to hype up Blu-Ray sales of the failed movie with this tweet:

https://twitter.com/jes_chastain/status/915382464394211329

Chastain’s tweet, coming just days after the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history, isn’t just tasteless and exploitative. It also reveals how little the actress understands about how guns work and how they’re regulated in the U.S.

Police say at least a dozen of the 23 firearms recovered from the hotel room where the shooter was holed up were semiautomatic rifles fitted with a device known as a bump-fire stock to simulate fully automatic fire.

As speculation abounded about the shooter’s suspected use of an automated rifle, many called for automatic weapons to be banned. As Sean Davis pointed out, fully automatic weapons are heavily regulated by the federal government, and it is a federal crime to own one absent a special license provided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. While many commentators and lawmakers have demanded a new law to ban bump-fire stocks, such a ban wouldn’t actually prevent bump-firing itself, a technique which uses the physics of a gun’s recoil to significantly increase the speed at which an individual’s finger pulls the trigger on a semi-automatic weapon.

The fact that the shooter may have altered weapons legally available to purchase and modified them in order to use them for an evil purpose suggests that gun regulations demanded by gun controllers do little to prevent gun violence. After all, the shooter passed the very same background checks which gun controllers say would have prevented mass shootings.

Chastain is clearly entitled to her own opinion on the issue of gun control, but using an atrocity to juice sales of her failed movie is just gross.

"Come And Take Them, Bret Stephens","The idea that gun-control advocates don’t want to confiscate your weapons is, of course, laughable. They can’t confiscate your weapons, so they support whatever feasible incremental steps inch further towards that goal. Some folks are more considerate and get right to the point.

“I have never understood the conservative fetish for the Second Amendment,” writes The New York Times’ new-ish conservative columnist Bret Stephens today. Referring as a fetish to an inalienable right that has a longer and deeper history among English-speaking people than the right to free speech or the right to freedom of religion is an excellent indicator that someone probably hasn’t given the issue serious thought. Or maybe he’s just looking for hits. (Congrats.)

I mean, Stephens isn’t contending Americans shouldn’t own five AR-15s. He’s arguing that the state should be able to come to your house and take away your revolver or your shotgun or even your matchlock musket. Stephens might as well have written “Eww, guns take them away!” and left it that, but instead he offers debunked arguments and misleading statements that are likely borne out of the frustration of knowing his position is untenable.

“From a law-and-order standpoint, more guns means more murder,” writes Stephens, before pulling a narrowly catered statistic that ignores the vast evidence that the number of guns does not correlate with the murder or the crime rates. They are all over the place. What studies like this do, though, is purposely conflate gun homicides and suicides. If Stephens wants to argue that confiscation would lead to fewer suicides, he’s free to do so. But he’s also going to have to explain why countries with the highest suicide rates often have the strictest gun control laws. The fact is that despite a recent uptick in crime, since 1990, the murder rate has precipitously dropped — including in most big urban centers — while there was a big spike in gun ownership.

Then Stephens compares justifiable gun homicides — shooting a felon while protecting one’s home, etc. — with unintentional homicides with a gun. After some back-of-the-napkin calculation, Stephen concludes that guns are useless as a means of personal protection. Anyone who’s spent ten minutes thinking about gun control understands there is no way to quantify how many criminals are deterred by the presence of guns, or how many, for that matter, are turned away in the midst of crime. Has anyone calculated how many non-gun-owning families are safer because their neighbors own firearms?

Without getting into the practicality of confiscating more than 300 million guns, it seems odd that someone would let murderers and madmen decide what inalienable rights we should embrace. It is almost humorous reading someone advising you not to worry about domestic tyranny as he explains why the state should eradicate a constitutional right and confiscate your means of self-defense. But Stephens comes to the likely true conclusion that you can’t stop random men from killing.

I’m not the first pundit to point out that if a ‘Mohammad Paddock’ had purchased dozens of firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition and then checked himself into a suite at the Mandalay Bay with direct views to a nearby music festival, somebody at the local F.B.I. field office would have noticed.

No, he’s not the first pundit to make this confusing point. To his credit, Stephens refrains from comparing random madmen with those who kill in the name of a worldwide ideological movement that relies on terrorism as a political weapon. We can do something to detect the latter. It should be pointed out that the FBI might not have done anything about a “Mohammad Paddock,” in the same way they were unable to do anything about Syed Rizwan Farook or Tashfeen Malik or Nidal Hasan or Omar Mateen. Yet Second Amendment advocates certainly didn’t call for the confiscation of guns afterwards.

But my favorite part of Stephens’ column is when he asks: “I wonder what Madison would have to say about that today, when more than twice as many Americans perished last year at the hands of their fellows as died in battle during the entire Revolutionary War.”

Setting aside the population scale, Stephens might not know that one of the reasons the Federalists, including Madison, opposed the Second Amendment was that they believed concerns over protections from federal government were overblown because there were so many guns in private hands that it was unimaginable any tyrannical army could ever be more powerful than the general public. Others, like Noah Webster, reasoned that, “The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.”

“Repealing the Amendment may seem like political Mission Impossible today,” writes Stephens, “but in the era of same-sex marriage it’s worth recalling that most great causes begin as improbable ones.”

To some troglodytes, the writing of the Constitution and Bill of Rights was perhaps the greatest cause of the nation. Moreover, same-sex marriage was instituted by the courts. Repealing the Second Amendment is going to take a lot more heavy lifting. There are probably too many fetishists around.

I’m one, too. As an American and a Jew descended from people who came here escaping both Nazism and communism, I’m okay with fetishizing the Second Amendment. As a person who can read history and contrast the nineteenth- and twentieth-century history of America and Europe — and about anywhere else — I “get” the fetish. And when I read columns like the one Stephens wrote today, I definitely get it.

"Why We Need More Men With Guns In The World, Not Less","We’re used to anti-gun zealots shamelessly using national horrors to take political cheap shots, but following the Las Vegas massacre, they’ve hit a new low by blaming masculinity for the bloodshed that shocked our nation.

Matthew Dowd, a strategist for the Bush-Cheney 2004 presidential campaign who is now a chief political analyst at ABC News, said in a tweet that what needs to change in America is “a culture celebrating guns equating them with strength combined with a bizarre antiquated manhood.”

Gun Violence Is Not a Growing Problem, Despite Reports

Anti-gun activists would like you to think that gun violence is a growing problem in the United States as alpha males flock to gun shows to buy weapons. But this is completely untrue. Gun violence has decreased almost equally with the increase in gun ownership. States with higher gun ownership don’t have more murders. Not to mention, since 1993, the gun homicide rate has fallen by nearly 50 percent, despite recent increases in some urban areas.

This decrease in gun violence is a statistic gun control activists often bury because it doesn’t fit their narrative. Regardless of facts, they continue to spread misinformation, resulting in many people thinking we’re awash in gun violence. A Pew Research survey in 2013 found “56% of Americans believe gun crime is higher than 20 years ago and only 12% think it is lower.”

A mass killing like the one we witnessed in Las Vegas is horrific, but we can’t extrapolate from this that gun violence is on the rise or that men who own guns are an inevitable threat. The fact is, mass shootings are still very rare, and most men who own guns aren’t out killing people. They’re mostly out saving lives or preparing to do so.

Most Men Use Guns to Protect

Men across the nation put their lives at risk every day to protect us. From police officers, to soldiers, to private citizens who protect their families—and strangers—from criminals, most men use their privileges and rights as gun owners to do good. Just ask the woman who was nearly raped but was saved by a neighbor who owned a gun. If he hadn’t been there, she would have been brutally attacked. But he was there—with his gun. And this is just one story in thousands.

Dowd and others might call this “antiquated” masculinity, but I call it much-needed masculinity, and there’s nothing bizarre about it. A man who buys a gun to save a life, to protect the weak, is a strong and good man, just as a man who uses a gun to take a life is despicable and evil. The issue here is not the gun or even masculinity, but the character of the individual wielding the gun.

Yes, men are naturally more violent than women, but that’s because it’s in a man’s nature to use his strength to protect and defend. When a man uses his masculine traits for evil, the fault is not his masculinity, it’s his depraved heart. Evil is an individual problem, from person to person, not men in mass or men as a group.

If you want to change the culture of violence in our nation, change individual hearts and minds and cultivate mutual respect for all people—men included. Don’t take away their rights and opportunities to use their masculine strengths for the good of others.

Masculinity Is Not Bad, Either

Just because guns have always been associated with masculinity doesn’t make it wrong. Guns have been associated with masculinity since the Chinese invented black powder. From the hand cannon to the rifle, men in all nations have used guns, not only for conquest, but to defend their homes. To protect is to be a man.

The relationship between masculinity and guns doesn’t mean men love violence. It means they want to develop and use the best tools to defend themselves, their families, and their property. Guns empower them so they can exercise their strengths as men. This is a right to celebrate, not shun.

When I go to a gun show with my husband, I confess to being impressed by its sheer masculinity. The long rows of guns carefully displayed, the care men take to examine each brand, to discuss the latest models and which performs the best. I don’t see men drooling for violence. I see men who love to develop a skill, who take seriously their responsibilities as gun owners, and who feel deeply satisfied when they become highly competent at something that has meaning and purpose, and saving a life is a great purpose—one men feel most keenly.

When a man uses his masculine traits—and a gun—for good, it’s comforting. To see him strive to excel at handling a gun so he can save, not destroy, is thrilling. I love to watch a man handle a gun with competence—the way he searches for the perfect gun, the one that fits his hand perfectly, how excited he is to get home so he can take it apart to examine its mechanisms, clean it, care for it, and master it. He goes to the range to practice, reads gun magazines to learn more about gun responsibilities and use, watches training videos, and practices drawing his weapon so he will be effective in a time of need. This is a man using his masculinity for good, honing his skills—and it’s beautiful!

Real Men (and Women) Use Guns for Good

As a woman, I proudly celebrate masculinity and gun ownership. The more strong, responsible men who own guns and who are skilled at using them, the better. When I’m with a man who is concealing a gun, I feel safer. I even feel more feminine. I feel protected and valued that he would take the time to learn a skill and invest in a tool that is meant to keep me, others, and himself safe from harm.

A man, of course, isn’t the only one who can own a gun. Women can, too, and there are many accounts of women defending themselves from home invasions and attackers. So add women to the “gun culture.” They’re right there along with men. It’s just more common for men to own guns because, like I said, it’s in their nature to protect. They also like gadgets, and they’re highly motivated to perfect their skills. Some women are like this, but it’s more natural for men to be motivated to guard the perimeter of their lives.

All of us who value masculinity, and the strength and competency that come with it, need to push against this effort to emasculate our men. Blaming guns (as if they act alone) and masculinity for violence of any sort is an attempt to deny personal responsibility and to remove much-needed protections from our society. The Left wants to leave us weak and vulnerable, so governing authorities have more power and control in our lives. They hate guns and men because both stand in the way of tyranny.

As men are diminished, as their power taken from them, the more evil grows. I, for one, don’t want that to happen. In this world riddled with evil, with growing centralized power, I want a good man with a good gun standing between me and those who want to strip me of my freedoms and my life.

6 Reasons Your Right-Wing Friend Isn’t Budging On Gun Control,"I’ve seen my friends and colleagues on the Left side of the gun control debate dumbfounded at why Second Amendment advocates don’t seem to budge on their views after mass shootings. So I thought I would try my hand at explaining this phenomenon in the hopes that maybe more will be inclined to have a better conversation about guns and the Second Amendment in America. There are several reasons 2A advocates aren’t running to your side of the argument, and it might not be the ones you think.

1. We Rarely Get to Come to the Conversation in Good Faith

The most destructive, divisive response when dealing with Second Amendment advocates is the notion that we aren’t on your side of the issue because we “don’t care” about the tragedy and loss of life. Two years ago at Christmas I had a family member, exasperated that I wasn’t agreeing about gun control, snarl, “It appears that if your [step] daughter was killed because of gun violence you wouldn’t even care!”

I’ve seen journalists, politicians, and friends in recent days say something to the effect of “If children dying (in Newtown) won’t change their minds, nothing will!” The obvious implication is that we are unmoved by the loss of life.

It is a true dehumanization of Second Amendment advocates to think that we didn’t see the events unfolding in Las Vegas and have the same ache deep in our souls. That we, too, haven’t read the memorials of those who gave their lives for others and silently cried over our computers or phones. We felt it, and we hurt, and some of us even died or were heroes and rescued others. As hard as it may be to imagine, a person can watch this, ache, hurt, and be profoundly affected by these events and not change his or her position on the Second Amendment.

You may be thinking that the right-wing kneejerk response to assume that progressives just want to confiscate guns is also a denial of coming to the table in good faith. You would be right. However, I suggest assuming progressives just want to ban guns, or some other policy, is not equivalent to thinking, “If you really cared that people died you would agree with me.”

2. The ‘Blood on Their Hands’ Attacks Are Offensive

The constant screaming about the National Rifle Association’s influence means nothing to many of today’s gun owners, but the “blood on their hands” attacks do. The NRA certainly has policy sway on Capitol Hill, but to the average gun owner it’s seen as the first line of defense, not a holy church with Wayne LaPierre as the pope.

For example, my family of gun owners left the NRA last year—and many felt the same way—when they capitulated on some due process rights issues (that then-candidate Trump agreed with). That was the last straw in what many viewed as a string of policy concessions. Few, in my experience, view it as Charlton Heston’s NRA and consider it too cozy with “the swamp.” Honestly, the best thing that could happen to the organization is a serious challenge to the Second Amendment, because the people who have stopped supporting the organization over other policy issues would come flying back.

Unfortunately, celebrities and loud voices in the media appear to use NRA and “gun owners” interchangeably. The average gun owner sees a tweet, Facebook post, or editorial cartoon depicting the NRA as blood-soaked and they believe it’s really talking about gun owners. Same with Jimmy Kimmel in his late-night monologue, or when CBS’s Scott Pelley mused if the assassination attempt on congressional Republicans was “to some degree, [a] self-inflicted” event.

3. The Loudest Voices Are Often the Most Ignorant

Whether it is an explosive news story or a late-night show host, journalists and celebrities are pretty ignorant about guns. I can see why the Left constantly feels right-wingers are deflecting the gun debate because we get pedantic at details, constantly correcting things like the inappropriate labeling of “assault rifles.” While this is an extremely emotional issue after a tragedy, it’s also a policy debate.

Good policies should be extraordinarily specific, explicit, and, you know, accurate in describing what it’s actually legislating. It’s hard for Second Amendment advocates to believe that the loudest voices are approaching this policy issue with seriousness when they constantly get even the most basic details wrong. I don’t want legislation that’s been emotionally manipulated into existence, I want legislation that is shown to actually do what it is intended to do.

4. The Most Prominent Policy Ideas Have Nothing to Do With the Tragedy

There’s an excellent column by Leah Libresco in the Washington Post explaining how certain policy initiatives haven’t actually been shown to prevent mass shootings. It’s a great primer on the nitty gritty data that Second Amendment advocates see supporting their side of the argument. I understand it can be frustrating that 2A advocates don’t seem to want to “do something” after a tragedy. But when we go down the laundry list of policy proposals after a tragedy it’s hard to consider them effective at preventing another tragedy when they wouldn’t have prevented the one that inspired them.

5. We Seriously Don’t Care About Gun Laws in Other Countries

We really, really don’t. That, of course, is because of the Second Amendment. The countries often brought up in the gun control debate not only have less than conclusive results (see the above link) but they don’t recognize personal possession of a firearm as a constitutional right. That is the bottom line. While their gun confiscation laws and the outcomes might be interesting, they are not applicable here.

6. We Really Do Consider Owning Firearms a Right

I view the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence as declaring the intrinsic and inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And I believe the framers knew that liberty is only achieved when the citizenry is known to keep tyrannical government, and those who would do me harm, at bay. My favorite explainer on citizens and their relation with tyrannical government is James Otis’ “Rights of the British Colonies” essay, but many like to use Hamilton’s Federalist Paper No. 29.

Beyond that, part of having liberty is personal safety from harm. Outside of the grace of God, I am the one primarily responsible for my safety, because I am able to be responsible for my safety. While I view the government’s primary responsibility the safety of its citizens, I am first responsible for my safety. Further, because I am able to be responsible for my safety, I have a duty as a good citizen to be prepared to protect others who cannot protect themselves. This is part of liberty. And the primary way I can ensure my liberty is by owning a firearm (and voting for those in favor of limited government—but that’s another debate).

Second Amendment advocates truly view owning a firearm as an intrinsic right and a must to preserve liberty. It has nothing to do with hunting. It has nothing to do with hobbies. That’s why when discussions of firearms that aren’t meant for hunting come into the debate you don’t see many advocates conceding they aren’t needed. Further, it’s the primary reason we seem unwilling to budge on this policy when tragedies occur. Evil acts don’t cancel out a law-abiding citizen’s rights.

So many gun control advocates are begging for a conversation on this issue, and it’s unfortunate they don’t see the Second Amendment advocates as willing to engage. I find it hard to have an honest and vulnerable conversation about a deeply held right when the starting point is often challenging my motives while coming from a place of ignorance on firearms. If you’re really looking to win over your gun-loving friend, try reading up on firearms, dumping anti-NRA talking points, and assume he or she is equally committed to preventing these evil acts.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/06/6-reasons-right-wing-friend-isnt-coming-side-gun-control/,2017-10-06
The 411 On The Bump Stocks Everyone’s Talking About After Las Vegas,"“Bump stock” is the word of the week following the reprehensible shooting in Las Vegas. Here’s a guide to the trending gun topics.

What Is Bump Firing?

Sunday night’s shooter was able to launch as many bullets as he did because of a trick called bump firing. Bump firing is to semi-automatic shooting as Olympic luge is to a plastic saucer sled. To bump fire, the shooter braces the gun against his hand rather than his shoulder. Then he pushes the gun into his trigger finger to fire. This allows the recoil of the shot to move the entire gun, including the trigger, against the finger of the shooter. This imitates the rapid firing of an automatic weapon. This guy explains and demonstrates:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykfPIJjraPQ&feature=youtu.be

The unbraced rapid firing means a big loss in accuracy. So why is this even a thing? Because it’s fun to shoot fast. It’s a range trick with range toys; nothing more. Accuracy can be somewhat improved with a bump stock. The stock mechanizes the bumping action so the shooter can brace the weapon against his shoulder like usual. Here’s an AR-15 tricked out with a bump stock:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B7tzaYgp5g

Why Are Bump Stocks Legal?

Briefly, because they don’t make a gun fully automatic.

When a semiautomatic gun is ready to fire, the hammer is cocked and held in place by the sear. Pulling the trigger releases the sear, allowing the hammer to fall, igniting the cartridge. Some of the energy of the shot is used to push the bolt to the rear, which cocks the hammer once more. The sear catches the hammer and holds it cocked. To fire again, the trigger must be released for it to reset so it can be pulled again.

When a fully automatic gun is ready to fire, the hammer is also held back by the sear. When the trigger is pulled, the sear is released, and that action releases the hammer. The hammer falls and ignites the cartridge, pushing the bolt to the rear, and cocking the hammer. But the fully automatic sear catches the hammer only momentarily, then lets it fall again as long as the trigger is held to the rear. Only when the trigger is released will the sear catch and hold the hammer, preventing it from falling on the firing pin.

The rapid firing action is accomplished internally by means of the full auto sear and firing group. By law, semi-auto guns sold in the United States are not allowed to be “easily convertible” to full-auto. The full-auto firing sears and firing groups are themselves illegal to own in all but the rarest instances.

So a bump stock doesn’t turn a semi-auto into a full-auto. But it does assist a shooter in increasing the rate of fire of a semi-auto. There are only two ways to do that: learn to move your finger really fast, or use the recoil energy of the gun to move the gun really fast against your trigger finger. The bump stock is an external mechanism that only approximates full-auto functionality.

Did the Obama Administration Really Make Bump Stocks Legal?

In 2006 (during the George W. Bush presidency), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) reversed an earlier decision allowing the sale of a spring-loaded bump stock, called the Akins Accelerator. This is called a reclassification—that is, they reclassified the device as a full-auto conversion kit. The company was required to hand over its customer list, and those customers had to surrender the springs in the stock to the ATF.

In 2010 (during the Obama presidency), the ATF determined that a bump stock called the Slide Fire did not fully automate a semi-automatic gun: “[W]e find that the ‘bump-stock’ is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.” This type of bump stock was the one the Las Vegas shooter used.

Why did the ATF see no problem with the Sure Fire as opposed to the Akins Accelerator? Best guess is that it’s because the Sure Fire doesn’t have springs.

Where Does the Gun World Stand on Bump Stocks?

The NRA can be thought of as the establishment branch of the Second Amendment lobby. Their official statement relating to the Las Vegas shooting allowed for examining existing laws regarding firearm parts:

“Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions, the National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law. The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.”

However, the Gun Owners of America, who brand themselves as tougher-minded and more absolutist in their defense of the Second Amendment, issued a statement arguing that the tragedy in Las Vegas does not occasion new legislation. Another GOA statement opposes a ban on bump stocks, pointing out, “Bump stocks were approved by the ATF during the Obama administration to help gun owners with disabilities fire their weapons.”

Rep. Steve Scalise Survives Assassination Attempt To Destroy Chuck Todd,"There are two types of people: those who ambush Republicans such as Steve Scalise with cheap shot political attacks, and people with decency. Chuck Todd on Sunday decided he wanted to be the former.

One might think a journalist would think through how to best take advantage of his first interview with the nearly assassinated Republican leader who recently returned to Congress. Scalise, for those who don’t know on account of how lightly it was covered by national media, was ambushed by a progressive gunman in June, while Scalise was practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game. The shooter was killed by the security detail who protect Scalise. Also shot were Crystal Griner, one of the Capitol Police officers assigned to protect Scalise; congressional aide Zack Barth; and lobbyist Matt Mika.

The gunmen had discussed his hatred for Republicans extensively in social media prior to the shooting.

Politico published a great article on what Scalise went through on the field where the liberal activist shot him, in the hospital during the early fight for his life, and in a rehabilitation facility where he learned how to walk again. Here’s a portion:

The doctors impressed upon Jennifer [Scalise] how dire the situation was: The bullet had traveled through her husband’s hip, shattering the femur and doing significant damage to the pelvis. He’d lost a significant amount of blood. With bullet fragments lodged in his muscle tissue and organs, doctors had to keep Scalise open for hours after the helicopter landed, struggling to remove bits of shrapnel and plug fresh fonts of blood. ‘That night, it could have gone the other way a few times,’ Scalise says. ‘When I got to the hospital, they said I was within a minute of death if they didn’t get some blood back into my system. So it was very severe. And you know, I’m unconscious through all of that. So they cut me open [and] did a lot of procedures on me that first day.’

The “Meet the Press” host decided to spend the entire aired portion of his interview with the House majority whip pushing gun control. For eight minutes, Todd focused on what he sees as Scalise’s political shortcomings, and badgered him to adopt the views of his political opponents. Scalise, for his part, spent the entirety of the interview making Todd look like the uninformed and naive partisan activist he is.

“Meet the Press” is a political show, and Scalise is a leader in Congress. After someone is shot for his political views, there should be more than enough to discuss. Maybe Todd could have established Scalise was okay, and discuss what he’d been through. For many people, who have been hungry for media coverage of the shooting, it would be nice to establish in a news forum what’s going on with Scalise in his life. Ideally there should be some sort of humanity and rebuilding of trust in terms of how hostile liberal journalists deal with their political opponents, such as Scalise. If Todd wanted to address his own push to restrict gun rights, maybe limit it to 5 or 10 percent of the interview.

Instead, the undercurrent of Todd’s badgering questions was to tell the shooting victim he did it to himself. He began with the premise that Scalia was wrong on gun control. You can watch the interview here:

Here are three major problems with Chuck Todd’s push for gun control.

1. Sliced and Diced

The full interview, with the exception of one vague opening question about returning to a sense of “normalcy” after “everything you’ve been through this summer,” was about gun control. If you read the full interview transcript, or watch the unedited interview, it was actually a nicer conversation. It focused more on Scalise’s return to Congress, including how both Democrats and Republicans reached out to support him. It dealt with an actual issue that many people would like discussed on national news programs: tax reform. It was still overly focused on gun control, but nothing like the finished product, where all of the interesting viewpoints were excised in favor of Todd’s pet issue.

But even then, when only the gun control portions were included, the editing is most curious. For instance, one of the points Scalise kept making was that enforcing existing gun laws is key to their effectiveness. When he said that federal enforcement of gun laws under the Obama administration dropped 25 percent, that was not included in the final interview.

2. Incapable of Being Even Remotely Objective

With the exception of that opening question, here were all of the statements/questions Todd made in the edited interview. As you can see, they’re all focused on the push for gun control:

Why do you make the case that it’s too soon to have a gun control debate?

Do you feel as if this issue of mass shootings is a problem that the federal government has to figure out how to solve?

But there’s been some things that weakened some aspects of of the mental health when it came to the database, where there was a fight to allow people that have had, if you get disability benefits because of mental health issues, you can still pass a background check. Should that be the case?

Why do you think we do lead the world in these things, in gun deaths. Mass– We lead the world in these mass gun incidents. We lead the world in, um, death by guns. We lead the world in how many guns per person we have in this country.

But they’ll tell you, you just go in Gary, Indiana. So I mean, you just go across state lines. And you can have all the tough gun laws you want in the world, but if you cross state lines, I mean, this is, that’s why they argue for a federal intervention.

Let me ask you this philosophically. Is there a limit? Do you believe — is the right to bear arms unlimited or is there a limit?

But is it unlimited?

You believe it’s unlimited. So–

So it’s not unlimited.

So–so you do agree there should be some limitations.

But you said there in law. Would you have supported those limits at the time?

Do you agree with the automatic weapons ban?

Alright, what do you make of this bump stock? Uh, of this accessory that takes a semiautomatic weapon and turns it into virtually an automatic weapon?

Do you think [the ATF] should [review their authorization]?

But you’re not ready to codify it in the law?

Is there a point where somebody’s right to bear arms infringes on somebody else’s right to be safe and secure at a country music concert?

Do you look- we’re learning that this guy stockpiled a lot of weapons, a lot, over the last year. We don’t necessarily monitor that type of sales. I know there’s always been some concerns about that. Had we been monitoring, he might have gotten a check in from the F.B.I. or A.T.F. that’s going, “What are you up to?” And maybe that might have intervened. Is that something you could imagine ever supporting, the idea that there is a limit on how many guns you buy in a year, in a month, in a week?

Do you think we have too many guns on the streets?

In most of his responses, Scalise did a great job explaining the Declaration of Independence and the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights. He explained to Todd that a government that monitors the people down to their gun purchases is tyrannical and totalitarian. He patiently explained that the right to keep and bear arms does not extend to shooting innocent people, and managed not to roll his eyes or walk out when Todd asked that question. And he kept making his point about the need to enforce existing gun laws rather than pass more gun laws.

Todd would be doing his employers proud if he were officially employed by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. But he’s supposed to be a neutral moderator of the longest-running Sunday political program.

Instead, he has a long track record of advocating strenuously for limits on the Second Amendment. He frequently gives Republicans “advice” encouraging them to step away from defending the inalienable right to defense of life and liberty. When victims of gun violence argue in favor of gun control, he presents them as moral arbiters. When victims of gun violence argue against gun control, he badgers them for their political views.

Earlier this week, in the words of Huffington Post, “It Took Just 1 Minute For Chuck Todd To Shut Down Gun Control Critics.” Again, that’s great if it’s your job to oppose the Second Amendment as a partisan extremist. It’s not so great, when you’re supposed to be interviewing both Democrats and Republicans down the middle.

Here’s Todd pushing his gun control agenda this week:

WATCH @chucktodd: “When planes flew into the World Trade Center did we say now is not the time to talk about terrorism? When our banking system nearly collapsed in 2008 did we say now is not the time to talk about financial regulation?” pic.twitter.com/NNCRUESuQg — Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) October 3, 2017

It’s fine if Todd wants to argue in favor of gun control. But he has no business arguing in favor of gun control while pretending to interview people as a journalist. The man who once presented himself as a referee ought to know better.

3. Naive and Uninformed

Here’s Todd a few weeks ago:

Again, Todd is not even trying to give the impression he is not hostile to his political opponents. He’s not trying to pretend he has no political opponents. But the manner in which he displayed his hostility is so profoundly ignorant as to be shocking.

As the Founders who declared independence and wrote the Constitution of the new republic repeatedly explained, governments merely secure the rights that are inalienable and endowed by God. Governments don’t create the rights. As the Declaration puts it:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men…

A few years ago, MSNBC correspondent Mike Viqueira said: “The anti-gun control, pro-gun rights crowd has won the argument at this point. They’ve succeeded in framing the issue as one of essential American national values.” Todd responded by saying “nobody has sort of a rational policy debate about it.”

Here’s what Rep. Mo Brooks said moments after Republicans, including himself, were shot at on that baseball field. Asked if he’d changed his mind on gun rights, he said:

Not with respect to the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment right to bear arms is to ensure that we always have a republic. And as with any other constitutional provision in the Bill of Rights, there are adverse aspects to each of those rights that we enjoy as people. And what we just saw here is one of the bad side effects of someone not exercising those rights properly. But we’re not going to get rid of freedom of speech because some people say some really ugly things that hurt other people’s feelings. We’re not going to get rid of Fourth Amendment search and seizure rights because it allows some criminals to go free who should be behind bars. These rights are there to protect Americans, and while each of them has a negative aspect to them, they are fundamental to our being the greatest nation in world history.

So, no, I’m not changing my position on any of the rights we enjoy as Americans.

For Todd, defending the inalienable right to defend life and liberty has no place in a “rational” policy debate about … the right to keep and bear arms.

Todd had a hard time accepting that Scalise is unwilling to abandon his principles after being shot on a baseball field for holding those principles. Todd also has a hard time understanding the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. Todd has trouble with the American value of the right to defend life and liberty.

There’s no doubt he’ll continue his partisan push to restrict Second Amendment rights as if he were a paid employee of the gun control lobby. But to use his interview on the occasion of Scalise’s return to Congress was gross.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/09/steve-scalise-survives-assassination-attempt-to-destroy-chuck-todd/,2017-10-09
Why Does Left Contradict Itself On Gun Rights Versus Abortion Rights?,"There are few more polarizing topics in American political discourse than guns and abortion. Both have featured prominently in the news recently, following the tragic Las Vegas shootings and the House’s new 20-week abortion ban. The Left and Right use guns and abortion as either a cause to rally around, or as a target to destroy. But the Left is often hypocritical in its theory of rights, where they come from, how they are enshrined in law, and how they can and should be advocated for or protected in the political process.

The debate around guns and abortion often revolves around how they should be regulated on the state level. While my evidence is anecdotal, I believe that the vast majority of Americans do not understand how fundamental rights have been enforced throughout American history as they relate to state action. It’s important to understand this history, and how we got where we are, when evaluating the differing view of rights across the political spectrum.

The History of the Bill of Rights

In 1791, when the Bill of Rights was ratified and enacted, it was applicable to the federal government but not to the states. For example: states still had the ability create an established church and fund it with tax money, and many states did just that well into the 1800s. The First Amendment was inapplicable. Similarly, states could outlaw firearms if they so desired and their state constitution allowed it. The Second Amendment was inapplicable.

In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified and this balance of federalism was altered. The reason for this amendment, of course, was to combat the grave injustices that states would continue to allow against former slaves, their descendants, and other minority groups. Through subsequent Supreme Court cases, the Bill of Rights was applied against the states so that state governments could not deny freedom of speech, religion, et cetera to any citizens—regardless of what state constitutions and laws said.

Predictably, proponents of the Second Amendment argue that if the federal government can’t regulate or forbid gun ownership, neither can state governments because of the Fourteenth Amendment. Similarly, proponents of abortion rights argue that abortion is a fundamental right protected in the Bill of Rights, and states can’t regulate it as their citizens see fit because of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Left Holds Contradictory Views on Guns And Abortion

However, the Left’s philosophy regarding guns and abortion contains a contradiction that it isn’t willing to confront. Jimmy Kimmel, in what I believe was a genuinely heartfelt and sincere late-night response to the Las Vegas shootings, exposed that hypocrisy. “When an American buys guns then there is nothing we can do about that,” he said sardonically. “The Second Amendment, I guess, our forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s is the argument, I assume.”

But have you ever noticed that the Left only makes an “originalist” argument about the Constitution when it comes to the Second Amendment? Several of these originalist arguments have surfaced after the Las Vegas tragedy, and Kimmel alluded to one in his statement. Another common argument alleges that one must be a member of the militia to have an individual right to bear arms. Regardless of whether such arguments have any merit, they seek to understand exactly what the Second Amendment meant at the time of its enactment, and bring that meaning into the present day.

Contrast these arguments with the Left’s stance on abortion rights. These rights stem from a general right to privacy most prominently found in the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant issued by a judge based on probable cause.

Justice Douglas, in an opinion for the Supreme Court, wrote one of the most famous phrases in American jurisprudence: “The foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras [the partially shaded outer region of the shadow cast by an opaque object], formed by emanations [an abstract but perceptible thing that issues or originates from a source] from those guarantees that help give them life and substance. Various guarantees create zones of privacy.”

This type of philosophy, often referred to as a “living and breathing” view of the Constitution, was used to create a Constitutional right to contraceptives and then to abortion.

On Abortion, The Left Changes Their Tune

Now imagine a late-night comedian, with all his holier-than-thou sarcasm, saying, “And when Americans want to abort unborn babies, there is nothing we can do about that. Because when our forefathers said the government couldn’t charge into our houses and seize us or our possessions without a warrant, I guess they also meant that we could terminate pregnancies.”

Such a scenario will never happen. When it comes to the sacred right of the Left—the right to abortion—the living and breathing view of the Constitution is the only one that receives any merit. Yet when it comes to gun rights, according to the Left, the only right we should retain is the right to carry a musket. Because that’s what the Second Amendment, in practice, covered in 1791. The hypocrisy of these simultaneous views is staggering.

Imagine the reaction to a conservative judge writing, “Americans have the right to own and carry high power weapons, often referred to as ‘military style or assault weapons,’ because in the shade of the Second Amendment there is an abstract but perceptible right that we perceive to exist absent any other historical context of what the amendment was intended to create.” The reaction from the left would be predictable, but it begs the question, why is this philosophy good enough for abortion but not good enough for guns?

The Left Hates The NRA—But Loves Planned Parenthood

Of course, if a judge did this, a Republican would have almost certainly nominated that judge to the bench. The reaction from the Left would be that the NRA’s corrupting influence on the political process led to that nomination and thereby tainted the purity of the ruling. This leads me to a second criticism of Jimmy Kimmel’s monologue.

“Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, and a number of other law makers who won’t do anything [about gun violence] because the NRA has their balls in a money clip also sent their thoughts and their prayers . . . which is good because they should be praying to God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country.”

Do you ever notice how the only lobby that runs the country, according to the Left, is the gun lobby (and sometimes the Koch brothers)? Step back and think about what the NRA is. It’s a group of citizens spending their own money to exercise their First Amendment rights to speech, association, and petitioning of the government to protect their Second Amendment rights.

Contrast this with Planned Parenthood. It’s a group of citizens spending their own money in combination with a lot of taxpayer-funded money, to do the same thing with their preferred right. Sure, not all of the money from taxpayers goes to lobbying, but money is fungible and finite. If an organization has less of it, they have to make decisions about what areas they are going to cut.

The Left Wants To Have It Both Ways

Imagine the following hypothetical speech from Paul Ryan: “We have too many gun related deaths in this country, and many are preventable accidents. We can significantly reduce accidental gun deaths by promoting gun safety. Because the NRA is the national leader in providing gun safety courses, we are going to appropriate $500 million in the next budget to give to NRA educational and training initiatives in order to save lives.”

The reaction from the Left is easily imaginable. “The Right is funding the NRA with taxpayer money so that the NRA can turn around and spend more money on political races and support of Republicans. Its absolute corruption that should not be tolerated.” Why isn’t this same standard applied to Planned Parenthood?

You see, the Left is happy to support a right created by judicial fiat based on a 2017 view of an 1868 amendment that distorts 1791 amendments beyond all recognition. But when the Right says that the Second Amendment protects our right to bear arms—which the Second Amendment literally says—the Left is all too happy to constrain that right to muskets.

When those on the Right use their own money to form an organization, the Left calls the NRA and the politicians it supports corrupt. And yet—the Left tells the Right that it is violating women’s rights by arguing that Planned Parenthood, one of the Left’s key political allies, shouldn’t get public funds. They can’t have it both ways.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/11/left-contradict-gun-rights-versus-abortion-rights/,2017-10-11
Bipartisan Bump Stock Bill Would Actually Ban All Semi-Automatic Rifles,"A new gun control proposal in Congress that is being pitched as a bipartisan bump stock ban would actually ban all semi-automatic rifles in the United States, according to an analysis of the proposed bill.

The legislation, which was drafted by Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican, never bans bump stocks by name. Instead, the proposal bans any person from possessing or making any part that could be used to increase the rate of fire in any semi-automatic rifle. The lead co-sponsor on the gun control bill is Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat and U.S. Marines veteran who completed four tours of duty in Iraq.

“It shall be unlawful for any person … to manufacture, possess, or transfer any part or combination of parts that is designed to increase the rate of fire of a semi-automatic rifle,” the bill states. At no point does the proposed legislation specify a base rate of fire against which any illegal increases would be judged, a potentially fatal flaw in the bill’s drafting. As a result, the proposal arguably institutes a federal ban on any and all parts that would allow the gun to fire at all, since the mere ability to fire a semi-automatic weapon by definition increases its rate of fire from zero.

The design of semi-automatic weapons uses the recoil of the weapon generated by the gas explosion in the chamber when a round is fired to automatically chamber a new round, and prepare the weapon to be fired again. Because of this, any parts used in that process would likely be subject to the federal ban proposed in the Curbelo/Moulton bill, since they serve to increase the rate of fire of a semi-automatic weapon. Gas tubes, gas blocks, buffer springs, magazines, charging handles, ejectors and extractors, and even triggers themselves could potentially be banned under the bipartisan bump stock ban language proposed by Curbelo and Moulton.

The @NRA is opposed to the new bump fire stock ban legislation https://t.co/LkllbBzlM9 — Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) October 12, 2017

https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/918551398740000770

The proposal also creates significant implementation challenges, since it contains zero grandfather provisions for existing gun owners or manufacturers. The bill also fails to provide any means by which existing gun owners and manufacturers could turn in their weapons to federal authorities to avoid running afoul of the bill’s effective ban on the possession of any semi-automatic firearms or parts. Absent a statutory federal gun buyback, which is not included in the Curbelo/Moulton bill, it does not appear that current law-abiding gun owners and manufacturers would have any way to abide by the constraints of the law in good faith absent a massive federal confiscation effort.

The National Rifle Association announced on Thursday that it opposed the Curbelo/Moulton proposal. In a separate statement, the organization said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms And Explosives (ATF) already had the legal authority necessary to ban bump stocks and that additional legislation was unnecessary. The group noted that bump stocks were originally approved by the Obama administration in 2010.

It is unclear at this time whether Curbelo and Moulton intended to propose such an expansive ban on all semi-automatic rifles in the United States. Also unknown is why the authors of the proposal chose to target rates of fire across all weapons instead of specifically banning bump stocks themselves, which consist of a single grip and stock assembly that is designed to rock a rifle back and forth against an individual’s finger in order to increase the rate of fire of a semi-automatic rifle weapon.

Neither Curbelo’s nor Moulton’s office responded to repeated requests for comment and clarification on the design and intent of their gun control proposal.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/13/new-bipartisan-bump-stock-bill-would-actually-ban-all-semi-automatic-weapons/,2017-10-13
"No, Most U.S. Gun Owners Don’t Stockpile 17 Or More Guns","Newsweek recently published an article with a provocative title: “Was Stephen Paddock Normal? Many Gun Owners Keep 17 Firearms on Average.” This article was based on a survey Northeastern and Harvard universities performed in 2015.

As an economist, I swim in the sea of data every day. The words “most” and “on average” always make me suspicious. Another warning sign was that several authors of the study are housed in schools of public health, notorious for bad statistical methods. So I went looking for sources and methods. Here are my conclusions.

The survey itself is most likely flawed. There have been several interviews and press releases, but no full study results in an academic publication. When press releases come out before the peer-reviewed study is published, caution is in order.

The results of the survey are not consistent with data from other sources, and the Newsweek article states, “The number of gun owners has declined since 1994, from around 25 percent to 22 percent of the population, according the Harvard/Northeastern survey.” This is factually incorrect. The number of gun owners has increased because the U.S. population has increased.

The “news” outlets that received press releases from the researchers are The Trace and The Guardian. Both oppose gun ownership. Further, at least a few of the researchers have expressed strong anti-gun sentiments in public. Let’s look at each of these factors in greater detail.

Is It Common for People to Stockpile Guns?

The most sensational piece of data is that 7.7 million people own “a number of guns.” How many? Here’s what The Trace article says: “That top 14 percent of gun owners — a group of 7.7 million people, or 3 percent of American adults — own between about eight and 140 guns each. The average is 17.”

I’m not sure who made this rookie mistake, but the mean of a skewed distribution is not the correct measure of central tendency. The average includes data from the far right end of the distribution—people who own, say, 140 guns. But the left end of the distribution is truncated. In other words, the mean will be greater than the median. And the median is the correct measure to use: half the data points will be on each side of the median. Their most important claim uses the wrong figure.

But let’s ignore that. 7.7 million Americans own eight or more guns. That’s 11 percent of all gun owners. The real question is: Why anyone would own eight, 17, or 140 guns? It’s easy to get to four or five. One or two handguns for self-defense, a shotgun for scaring away flocks of birds, a 22-caliber rifle for eliminating predators from your garden or chickens, a larger gun for hunting. But that’s less than the mean and probably less than the median within this group.

A clue is to be found in a more recent survey Pew Research Center published in spring 2017. In a wide-ranging survey, the Pew researchers asked many interesting questions. One is relevant to the topic at hand: “percentage of gun owners saying each is a major reason why they own a gun.” This question allowed multiple responses, so the percentages don’t add to 100 percent.

That 13 percent figure looks familiar. The Northeastern/Harvard study says 11 percent of gun owners have eight or more firearms. It’s only a short leap of logic to infer that those who own many guns are mainly collectors.

Gun Owners Are Increasingly Less Likely to Tell

Added insight comes from a Zogby/O’Leary survey in 2015. It includes this tidbit: “‘QUESTION: If a national pollster asked you if you owned a firearm, would you determine to tell him or her the truth or would you feel it was none of their business?”

Gallup recently released a poll showing gun ownership had declined compared to polls they’d taken earlier. That number is inconsistent with the number of firearms that have been sold since President Obama took office as president, but the difference can be answered by the Zogby Analytic question above. The poll indicates maintaining anonymity is a contributing factor: “36% of Americans feel it is none of the pollster’s business and that includes 35% of current gun owners 47% of Republicans and 42% of Independents.”

That means only 65 percent of gun owners today will reveal that fact to a pollster. Let’s assume that has not always been true. Increasing calls for gun confiscation from progressives have provided quite an incentive to not answer questions about gun ownership.

We can combine the Zogby/O’Leary results with an additional piece of data from the NORC General Social Survey (GSS). In many years they include this question: “Do you happen to have in your home (IF HOUSE: or garage) any guns or revolvers?” In 2016, 593 respondents answered yes (32.25 percent) while 1,246 said no. But let’s assume the Zogby/O’Leary results are true. In that case, the true percentage of households where a gun is present is 32.25%/65% = 49.61%.

The GSS asked the same question in 1974, 1976, and 1977. Let’s assume the figures from the 1970s are accurate. The average percentage of yes responses in those three years is 47.87 percent. In other words, gun ownership has been pretty stable over the past 40 years. But the GSS survey includes more responses than simply “yes” or “no.” One interesting answer is “refused.” In 2008 1.11 percent of respondents refused to answer. In 2010 that figure had almost tripled to 3.29 percent. Here’s the complete series.

The absolute number of those who refused to answer hit its maximum of 54 in 2014. The small number of respondents undoubtedly explains a lot of the variability in this graph. But the sharp increase in the refusal rate that started in 2010 shows no signs of falling back to the rates seen in the 1970s. This data seems to be consistent with the Zogby/O’Leary survey results.

We can infer that most owners of eight or more guns are collectors. And it’s clear that the percentage of households where a gun is present has remained fairly constant (after correcting for refusals to answer). Now let’s turn to the sources of the stories.

The Trace and The Guardian

Only two media outlets received unsolicited information about this study. The Trace makes no bones about where they stand: “The Trace is an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism startup dedicated to shining a light on America’s gun violence crisis.”

In fact, Newsweek is one of their media partners:

The Newsweek article quotes tweets by two individuals. One is Miles Kohrman:

Kohrman’s name turned up in an interesting place: The Trace “About” page.

Perhaps Newsweek might have informed us of Kohrman’s affiliation, not to mention their affiliation with this organization. The Guardian is at least a bit more circumspect. But here’s an interesting quote in its article: “The unpublished Harvard/Northeastern survey result summary, obtained exclusively by the Guardian and the Trace, estimates that America’s gun stock has increased by 70m guns since 1994. At the same time, the percentage of Americans who own guns decreased slightly from 25% to 22%.”

Unpublished and released to exactly two outlets. At least The Guardian was willing to include some skeptics: “Some gun owners responded to the study’s findings with trepidation. Bryce Towsley, a Vermont-based gun writer and the author of Prepper Guns, a firearms guide for survivalists, said he worried about how the survey would be used politically. ‘They’re going to say, “Okay, there’s a small minority of people who have all the guns – we’re going to go after them.”’

Here are The Guardian’s most recent seven articles under the topic “gun control.” All seven of these articles and opinion pieces favor gun control.

Now for the People Involved in Making This Study

Professor Matthew Miller of Northeastern University is one of the four co-authors of the study in question. He has posted his curriculum vitae online. Here’s the citation from that document: “Azrael D, Hepburn L, Hemenway D, Miller M. The Stock and Flow of US Firearms: Results from the 2015 National Firearms Survey. Russell Sage Foundation Journal of Social Science. 2017. In Press.”

One name stands out on this list: Deborah Azrael. In a 2015 interview with Salon she made this comment: “To me the fundamental problem is that everything we know suggests that access to firearms increases the likelihood of death and injury. Disproportionately to women, disproportionately to children, but to everyone. The notion that somehow increasing access to guns to women is going to be an exception to that rule is, to me, unfounded.”

There’s just one problem: the data does not support her statement. Dr. John Lott has studied this extensively. His book “More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws” (3rd edition, 2010, University of Chicago Press) makes this point in great detail. His methodology and data are available on the Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC) website. One example is what happens to the murder rate after gun restrictions are imposed. Here are the results from Chicago and Washington DC.

In both cities, the murder rate increased after major gun restrictions were imposed. Lott has much more data and empirical work on the CPRC website.

Lott has a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California at Los Angeles, a highly regarded program. Perhaps anti-gun public health “professionals” should take a few genuine statistics courses so they can understand his work. And, no, the biostatistics course they took in their public health degree programs is not included in that category. However, discussing the flaws in biostatistics is a topic for another article.

"This Liberal Found It's More Complicated Than ‘More Guns, More Crime’","I have always looked at the gun problem and assumed that there is a “commonsense” solution if the gun lobby would just get out of the way and people would just screw their heads on right. Like most Americans, I still support efforts to improve the efficacy of the background-check system, but I now understand them to be common sense but not solutions—and potentially distractions from the core social questions of economic despair and shuttered opportunity, which plague both poor minority neighborhoods and the white working class alike.

Over the past year, I have from time to time posted the most mild-mannered of comments on Facebook, suggesting that the gun issue is more complex than one might think. I am not exactly fearless on social media, anxious about the cultural disapprobation that comes with conservative views in my circles. My posts have been exceptionally mealy-mouthed, timid suggestions that the gun issue is tricky or perhaps a particular National Review article is “worth a look.”

My reading suggestions have not been well received. My liberal friends have rather disdainfully rejected the facts offered, not usually with their own facts but with the statement that we just need to get on with doing “something.” This would seem to suggest that people who don’t agree with policy for window dressing’s sake are somehow hunky-dory with thousands of gun deaths every year. It is a little window into the sanctimony of some liberals, and I don’t like it very much.

Proposed Laws Would Rarely Have Stopped Recent Attacks

Virtually all of the guns used in mass-murder situations in the past decade were lawfully obtained, and could have been lawfully obtained under proposed laws, such as the extension of background checks to private sales (eighteen states already do so). The Aurora, Newtown, and Orlando shootings were all committed with lawfully obtained guns, or with guns taken from licensed owners.

And it is just not credible to think that restricting private sales at places like gun shows will substantially reduce urban violence. The most recent, though admittedly still dated, surveys of prisoners, which were undertaken back in the 1990s, indicate that only about .6 percent of guns obtained by criminals were from gun shows.

I’m not terribly impressed with surveys like this, but I don’t have any reason to dispute the conclusions: that there are just too many lawful and unlawful ways to obtain a gun to believe that new restrictions will make a material impact on outcomes. And even if new laws reduced gun transactions in a meaningful way, people would still continue to steal guns at a frightful rate. Somewhere between 300,000 and 600,000 guns are stolen each year, enough to cover every gun-related crime in the country, several times over.

Yes, We Have High Violence Rates, But It’s Not Guns’ Fault

One of the key arguments for gun control is the unfavorable comparison between gun violence in the United States and in other developed countries. As President Obama noted in 2015, “What we also have to recognize is, is that our homicide rates are so much higher than other industrialized countries. I mean by like a mile. And most of that is attributable to the easy ready availability of firearms, particularly handguns.”

And it is true; out of the 35 countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United States ranks 31st in homicide rates, though gun proponents hasten to note that the United States is far safer than Russia, Mexico, and Brazil, and a little safer than Latvia, none of which is likely to be bulletin-board material for our national tourism agency. And what is most disturbing is that we are not even a close 31. Our homicide rate is ten times the rate in Japan and three times the rate in Canada, for instance.

It’s truly depressing stuff, unless you are planning to move to England, where the writer Bill Bryson recently reported, in all seriousness, and with some satisfaction, that you are more likely to be killed by walking into a wall than by being murdered. I’ve pondered that statement quite a bit, trying to figure out what impels so many Britons to rush into walls, presumably headfirst, at speeds high enough to kill themselves, and haven’t found any adequate explanation, but the sentiment expressed by Bryson is still true: England is an amazingly safe place. There were only 573 murders in all of England and Wales in 2015 (Chicago by itself is on pace to hit about 700 in 2017) and only about 40 of those murders were with firearms.

I couldn’t find statistics to confirm Bryson’s running-into-walls comparison, but it is true that in England you are about twice as likely to die from falling out of or through a building as you are to be killed with a gun, and about six times more likely to die from “malaise or fatigue.”

Those numbers are deeply satisfying to gun control advocates—and to the Brits as well, I should think—but it’s not clear what they mean for the United States. Gun control advocates link the low murder rate in England, for example, to the 1997 Firearms Act, which effectively outlawed private ownership of handguns, but in truth the homicide rate in England was low long before the Firearms Act and it has actually increased modestly since 1997.

Gun Prevalence Is Not the Key Cause of Crime

And the relationship between the number of guns and murder rates is not always very clear. If you are to believe the Small Arms Survey, countries like Russia and Brazil have relatively low firearms ownership rates, but apparently all those guns are in the hands of killers and thieves, and high-ownership countries like Switzerland and Finland have comparatively low murder rates.

Switzerland, for instance, is awash in guns—a “gun in every closet” is integral both to the national defense plan and the national culture—and there is roughly one gun for every two people in the country. And yet the murder rate is pleasingly low, not so different from England itself. It is not that there is no relationship between gun availability and homicide rates—of course there is—but the story of violence and the means of controlling it are far more complicated and nuanced than advocates on either side of the story would have us believe.

I started off this process thinking, as do many of my political coreligionists, that reducing gun violence is simply a matter of will, and of overcoming the Neanderthals at the National Rifle Association (NRA). But I have learned that it is not, and that if we really want to reduce gun violence, we should be focusing not first upon the weapons but on a lot of things around it: poverty, drugs, race, and addressing mental illness, opportunity, and gangs, to name just a few.

Why Bringing A Gun To Church Is A Pretty Good Idea,"A few hours after Sunday’s horrifying mass shooting in a Sutherland Springs Baptist church, a Fox News host asked the attorney general of Texas, Ken Paxton, “As a country, what do we do? How can we get our arms around this and stop this insanity?”

“The only thing I know, because you can’t necessarily keep guns out of the hands of people who are going to violate the law … in Texas at least we have the opportunity to have concealed-carry,” Paxton answered. “And so if it’s a place where somebody has the ability to carry, there’s always the opportunity that gunman will be taken out before he has the opportunity to kill very many people.”

This comment, as you’d expect, triggered incredulous reactions from gun-control advocates. If there’s anything that gets anti-gun types worked up — well, anything other than sending “thoughts and prayers” — it’s the notion that a responsible gun owner can bring down a killer. As Newsweek put it, Paxton was perpetuating “a widely held, but deeply discredited theory that the only thing that stops a ‘bad guy’ with a gun is a ‘good guy’ with a gun.” Though an incontrovertible truth for many media, it’s not really a “theory,” much less deeply discredited. It is a fact that the only real way to stop a “bad guy” with a gun is a “good guy” with a gun, whether that person be in law enforcement or a private citizen.

Much of the coverage of this topic is layered in a scientific veneer. Once you crunch the numbers, they say, self-defense simply isn’t worth it. Studies done by the Violence Policy Center and other gun-control friendly groups bolster the idea that, statistically speaking, with a gun you are more likely to cause an accidental death than to stop someone from committing a crime.

First of all, we can’t quantify how many would-be mass shooters or random criminals avoid situations where they anticipate guns might be firing back at them. Some of these studies also conflate criminality with accidents. Once a man is menacing his neighbor with a gun, he is engaged in illegal behavior and his actions are no longer unintended. Many of these studies also conflate home gun accidents (sometimes even suicides) with concealed-carry holders — the people most likely to stop a shooter outside of the home. It is incredibly rare that those who conceal carry break the law or have accidents, so dealing with them separately undermines the storyline.

If we’re going to start making unscientific comparisons, though, then I would point out that I can’t find an example of a single example of an accidental fatality by a gun-owning parishioner during a service at a church (or temple or mosque). Perhaps someone can point one out to me. I can think of at least two incidents off the top of my head in which church parishioners likely stopped a massacre because they had guns.

One was at the New Life Church in Colorado in 2007, when a woman named Jeanne Assam, part of a volunteer armed security team, shot an anti-Christian gunman who had already opened fire on parishioners and held a bag of weapons, 1,000 rounds, and a pipe bomb. The other was last year, when a 22-year-old church usher in Antioch, Tennessee named Robert Engle tackled a shooter and, despite head injuries, ran out to his car in the parking lot, grabbed a gun, and held the shooter at gunpoint until police arrived.

Even at the Sutherland Springs Baptist church, a man named Stephen Willeford managed to shoot Devin Kelley at the church, police officials said, and when the mass shooter fled Willeford asked another citizen, Johnnie Langendorff, to chase down Kelley, which he did until the gunman wiped out and shot himself. Perhaps Kelley was off to kill more. We don’t know.

Many of the same people who tell you that mass shootings are rampant also treat you as some kind of paranoid, slack-jawed yokel for wanting to protect yourself, your family, and your community with a weapon. Now, chances are exceptionally low that you’re going to need that weapon. That’s because we live in a far more peaceful place than the news might let on. Yet we often engage in precautionary efforts for safety. Why shouldn’t responsible gun owners who are fearful of these shootings practice their rights?

Many of the same people believe more gun control (regulations that rarely deal with the causes of mass shootings; in this case, the usual suspects have been demanding that we pass laws that already exist) will do more to protect citizens than a gun. I’d love to see the stats on how many lives a bump-stock ban would save. Maybe someone will run the numbers on how people fare without any weapons when faced with shooters compared to those who are armed. The fact is that the state can’t even properly execute laws that are in place. Kelley was able to purchase firearms because the Air Force had failed to enter his assault conviction into a federal database. There will always be human error even if we pass laws inhibiting ownership.

Of course, there is no guarantee that a gun will keep you safe, either. Yet it’s going to keep you safer than any restriction gun-control advocates float. Moreover, Americans have an inherent right to defend themselves, even if that notion is controversial these days.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/11/07/bringing-gun-church-pretty-good-idea/,2017-11-07
"If You Choose To Carry A Gun For Self-Defense, Proper Training Is Essential","Some folks are amazed when they hear about a private citizen taking up arms to defend those who can’t, won’t, or have lost the ability to defend themselves against the evil side of our society. I am proud to know there are people out there who have the heart to make a difference. But how can we stay vigilant as citizens who are just out and about doing our own thing?

One major decision that people must make is whether to carry a gun for self-defense. Are you going to carry a gun? This is a huge responsibility. If you make the choice to be armed, you must first get the requisite licensing to make you legal, which means learning, understanding, and following the myriad federal and state laws that govern the carrying of a weapon in your area. You must know when and where you are legally authorized to carry a firearm and when the discharge of deadly force is legally justified.

Once you have made the choice to carry a firearm, no matter the reason, get training. If your only firearms education is what the state requires before it issues a carry permit, I can tell you beyond the shadow of a doubt you don’t have enough training. Get involved with your local shooting range and take advantage of specialized classes where you will learn to carry a firearm responsibly. Consider enrolling in specialized courses that will teach you the skills and the mindset you need to be effective in a real-world scenario. Not only will you be guaranteed to learn something, you will be around others who have the same passion and sense of civic responsibility that you have.

Many of the friends I now highly value are those I met through the shooting sports and education. The education and training opportunities offered by local gun ranges are essential. Our local Nashville indoor range, for example, offers concealed carry classes, marksmanship classes, home defense classes with a mock house set up, as well as family firearm training classes. I especially appreciate the family classes in which your entire family can participate in the training process. Not only do you get to spend time with your loved ones, your entire family can be prepared with the same skills and have a plan that allows you all to understand and work to protect each other as a unit.

I personally carry a gun as often as I can. In the state of Tennessee where I live, our laws are made to protect the gun owner rather than the criminal. As a result, most places I frequent are gun friendly or at the very least allow guns to be carried on the premises. If there are places that won’t allow for legal carry, simply avoid these businesses at all costs. It sounds simple enough to leave your firearm in your vehicle while you scamper in to get a cup of coffee, but this is when times will go bad. The better decision is to use the drive-through or find a different coffee places that respects your right to carry.

After you attain the level of training that makes you more comfortable with concealed carry, move on to real world scenario-based training. Being put into controlled situations under the stress of a class setting will build your confidence. Ensure you are using realistic scenarios based on working in and around your vehicle, home protection settings, even scenarios based on your work environment. Get training that teaches you where and when you should use your vehicle for cover or concealment. Two things will happen with this training. First, your confidence in your ability to effectively respond will grow. Second, you will want to do more and more of this type of training, which will make you even more effective. Scenario training will allow you to further understand what your opponents might be thinking and how you can outmaneuver them or possibly avoid them completely.

Mental rehearsals are also key to success in an armed encounter, or in avoiding this encounter in the first place. Close your eyes and think through the situation that you see yourself in and ask yourself how will you handle that situation? What can you do to avoid that situation? If there isn’t the possibility of egress or avoidance, how will you maneuver to have a tactical advantage? You need to think through every possible scenario that might come up in your daily routine. Once you have perfected your technique, you will be able to walk into your house, a restaurant, or your place of worship and quickly decide how and where you should be positioned, as well as how you can react to a threat in your vicinity.

There are so many things to think about when you carry a firearm. How to conceal well so that no one knows you are carrying? Where are the exits in the building you are in? How do I keep from putting my back to the door? What will others do if I have to draw my gun? How do I notify law enforcement that I am a legal concealed carrying citizen during a real world situation?

You must also be aware of your surroundings at all times. If you are a member of a church, you should be aware that they might already have an armed security team. If they do, you should inform them that you are also a concealed carrier, or better yet become part of their team. If you are a member of a congregation that doesn’t have a security team, this is a prime opportunity for you to start making a difference by volunteering your services. This is a huge responsibility, so don’t take it lightly. Along with carrying concealed comes the responsibility of knowing first aid techniques and having the equipment necessary to treat any victims as well.

The cost of vigilance is increased responsibility. If you choose to exercise your God-given right to defend yourself and your family by carrying a weapon, you must take the time to learn the laws in your area and to consistently train to maximize your ability to effectively respond to any threats that may materialize. In the end it will all be worth it. Helping others will make a difference in your life and the lives of your family, friends, and people in your community.

It’s Time For Gun Controllers To Put Up Or Shut Up,"Perhaps the chief problem with the U.S. gun control movement is that its proponents seem to have no idea what they want. Few areas of American public policy debate are as fact-free and as devoid of substantive meaning as the repeated and seemingly endless demands for more gun laws.

Take Washington Post writer Jennifer Rubin, who recently used her column to criticize “Republican Second Amendment absolutists.” Claiming the GOP should “address…guns,” Rubin condemns politicians who refuse to talk about “concrete, reasonable measures to reduce gun violence.” She accuses such politicians of “craven hypocrisy,” and implores lawmakers to “discover a sense of moral obligation” and show “concern and legislative determination” on the topic of gun control.

Notably missing from this column is—wait for it—any specific proposal for “concrete, reasonable measures to reduce gun violence.” It’s not there. There’s not even a vague proposal, not even a half-hearted gesture toward anything resembling a proposal. Generally, if one is seeking a legislative change, one tends to have an idea of what that change would actually be.

This is a perennial feature of gun-control partisans: a great deal of blustery talk about “moral obligation” with virtually no meaningful ideas as to what we are supposed to, you know, do about gun violence.

‘Do Something, Anything, I Don’t Know What’

One can witness the same evasive and empty rhetoric from TV show host Stephen Colbert, who on his show this week implored his viewers to “vote for someone who will do something” about gun violence. What that “something” precisely is, he did not say, although he briefly alluded to a desire to “get rid of the guns,” a truly staggering proposal.

Yet even when they offer specific policy prescriptions, gun control advocates are still generally incapable of advancing any legislative proposals that would target gun violence in any meaningful way. On his Facebook page recently, outraged at another “moment of silence” taking place in the House chambers, California Rep. Ted Lieu called for “reasonable gun safety legislation,” including “a universal background check law…a ban on assault rifles, and a ban on bump stocks.”

A ban on bump stocks does indeed seem reasonable enough (so much so that even the National Rifle Association endorsed a law that would accomplish this), but the other two are, in the context of the American gun violence debate, non sequiturs: a “universal background check law” would not have prevented any of the high-profile mass shootings of the past decade or so, and there is debate over whether such a law would have any measurable effect on American gun violence as a whole.

The proposal for a “ban” on “assault rifles,” meanwhile, is meaningless enough to be laughable: assault rifles are already regulated more or less to the point of practical nonexistence in this country, and in any case, in more than eight decades, assault rifles have only been used in three homicides.

Why Don’t You Have Any Ideas?

This is the general tenor of the gun control debate: either substance-free calls to “do something” or demands for needless and ineffective policy measures. It is necessary to ask: Why do gun control advocates continue to practice such empty and useless bombast? What is the point?

One is tempted to suggest pro-gun control partisans are actually interested in a lot more than “reasonable gun safety legislation.” To a great many people, guns are both frightening and repulsive, things to be disdained and opposed rather than tolerated.

There is a decent chance that the individuals who continue to demand nameless gun control, or who propose gun control measures that really wouldn’t do anything to stop gun violence, are actually interested in a lot more than simple gun control policy. They are very likely more interested in greatly diminishing if not outright eliminating gun rights in American society, and are simply taking an incremental approach to getting there.

Maybe that’s an uncharitable assumption. But then it’s worth stating the question to these types of partisans outright: since your gun control ambitions are either incoherent or purposeless, what, exactly, are you after?

It is time, in other words, for gun control advocates to put up or shut up: they need to be honest about their ultimate ambitions, or else they just need to sit down and stop dealing in rank public dishonesty. If they truly want to “get rid of the guns,” then they should stop putting forward all these pointless half-measures and just come out with it.

Men With Guns Save More People Than Cynics Like Stephen Colbert,"Last Sunday a little church in Sutherland Springs, Texas was the site of a mass shooting perpetrated by an evil, nihilistic, volatile man. Twenty-five people died, including one pregnant woman, whose child brought the death toll to 26.

When I heard, I was stunned. Any person with a conscience would naturally feel grief and horror, but the Sutherland massacre hit me harder than previous shootings because the people targeted, by all accounts, seemed to be so similar to my own family and friends.

I am from a town like Sutherland Springs, of several hundred people, a community in which everybody knows everybody. I go to a Baptist country church not unlike First Baptist, with a Christian flag, an American flag, carpets on the floors, and straight-back pews. We sing the same songs they did and, like First Baptist, sometimes do so a little off-key.

Harder still to think about, my church is filled with families just like First Baptist—little kids who look over the backs of the seats at you during the service, as if they want to say something but don’t know what. So I have grieved this week, not fully understanding the pain my brothers and sisters in Sutherland must be going through, but feeling a hurt that helped me ask God to somehow send peace and strength to those most in need.

My home community shared that hurt and a sense of kinship with the slain. I researched all the details of the massacre as they came in, trying to piece together a narrative that made sense. But what met me first was the reaction of celebrities and the “mainstream” media who largely define opinion at the left-leaning university I attend.

Have You No Human Decency?

It boiled down to one sentence: those guns-and-Jesus country bumpkins “got their prayers shot right out of them”; hope this teaches their kind a good lesson for supporting Republicans and their “terrorist” arm, the National Rifle Association. This wasn’t just the keyboard warriors on Twitter. The New York Times editorial board went out of its way to mock Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for suggesting that Christianity could combat violence and the Texas attorney general for suggesting that perhaps congregations should have one or two present who are armed.

I almost couldn’t believe what I was reading. The emotional detachment of the leftist commentators from the victims of the shooting combined with an astounding blindness to the facts on the ground led them to respond to 26 innocents dead by heaping scorn on the prayers of those who were shot and demanding we take away their neighbors’ guns.

But here are the facts on the ground: Shooter Devin Kelley was a “vocally anti-Christian” atheist who apparently shared the leftist elite’s disdain for prayer. His favorite quote on Facebook was from Mark Twain: “I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.” I believe that Kelley is right now suffering significant inconvenience for what he did. The leftist elite probably don’t. But that is neither here nor there.

Kelley, a convicted felon, got his hands on guns, and easily. Why? Not because he was in Texas, but because one giant federal bureaucracy failed to send paperwork to another. Federal bureaucrats screw things up. You can pass laws to try to improve such matters, but such laws aren’t a partisan issue and, ultimately, it’s impossible to outlaw the incompetence of unwieldy bureaucracies.

Empathy Is a Man Running Towards a Killer to Stop Him

Kelley takes his illegally obtained gun and begins to shoot up people in a church. Who stops him? Law enforcement? A posse of U.S. senators or Twitter warriors? Stephen Colbert’s bodyguard?

None of the above, and there is a lot of bitter irony here. The average police response time in large cities can range anywhere from five minutes to an hour. In rural areas, it can take even longer. Even when officers are responding to mass murder, they can’t be expected to immediately arrive on the scene. The man who stopped the shooting, Stephen Willeford, was a private citizen and a long-time member of the “terrorist” NRA. He used his legally owned AR-15 to stop the murderer in his tracks.

Last night, Colbert complained that every time there’s a mass shooting, “Nothing gets done, no-one does anything… it’s unnatural, it’s inhuman.” Colbert wants legislation against bump stocks. Exactly how this would have stopped Kelley is a mystery to me, since he didn’t use one. Colbert also wants to get rid of all the other guns, too, because “doing nothing is unacceptable.” But who actually saved lives: Colbert with his virtue-signaling, or Willeford with his AR-15?

Who’s doing more good for the world: people who pray for one another and, if necessary, put their lives on the line to defend their neighbors, or the leftist agnostics who despise them and try to take their guns?

I can’t help but imagine—though God forbid—if The New York Times and their kind won, guns were banned, then one of the thousands upon thousands of felons in Ohio who wouldn’t mind obtaining guns illegally decided to massacre my church. He’d have a free hand for ten or 15 minutes to shoot every man, woman, and child in the place.

Thankfully, this is not the case. It is still legal in most states for law-abiding citizens to conceal and carry a handgun with a permit, and seven or eight good people in my church do just that at our Sunday meetings. They would willingly put their lives on the line to protect their families, to do something to stop the shooting, even if it costs them personally.

They’re people like Stephen Willeford, not Stephen Colbert. I wish we had more of them in the national media.

Biden: Hero Who Stopped Texas Shooter Was Wrong To Have A Gun,"During a question and answer session on NBC’s “Today” show, former vice president and rumored presidential 2020 contender Joe Biden said the hero who stopped the Texas church shooter earlier this month should not have been allowed to carry an AR-15.

“With the tragedy that just happened in Texas, how do you justify the Democratic view on gun control when the shooter was stopped by a man who was legally licensed to carry a gun?” a young woman in the audience asked Biden.

“Well first of all, the kind of gun being carried he shouldn’t be carrying,” Biden said. “I wrote the last serious gun control law . . and it outlawed assault weapons and outlawed weapons with magazines that held a whole lotta bullets so you could kill a lot of people a whole lot more quickly.”

“Assault weapon” is a nonsense term not usable in legislation, since it could apply to any object used to attack another person. An assault rifle generally means a select-fire or automatic rifle with an intermediate cartridge designed for military use. The AR-15 is not an assault rifle, most clearly because it is semiautomatic. Civilians are already banned from owning automatic weapons.

The Texas man who stopped the shooter from killing more people used an AR-15 to confront the alleged murderer, who wore a ballistic vest and was armed with tactical gear and a rifle of equal firepower.

“If I had run out of the house with a pistol and faced a bulletproof vest and kevlar and helmets, it might have been futile,” Stephen Willeford told CRTV in an interview last week. “I ran out with an AR-15 and that’s what he was shooting the place up with.”

Biden apparently doesn’t think guns are useful for self-defense and protecting others, even though police and soldiers can’t stop bad guys without guns, and neither can private citizens. Public records are replete with instances of private citizens enjoying protection against evil when armed.

“It’s just rational to say certain people shouldn’t have guns,” Biden insisted, however. “The fact that some people with guns are legally able to acquire a gun and they turn out to be crazy after the fact, that’s life. There’s nothing you can do about that, but we can save a lot of lives and we’ve stopped tens of thousands of people from getting guns who shouldn’t have guns.”

5 Reforms To Gun Laws That Would Actually Make A Difference,"Following another egregious shooting, media, politicians, and celebrities are demanding that we again discuss gun control. They allege that conservatives consistently avoid the issue by saying “Now is not the time” as we actively bury the fallen.

If progressives are so insistent on talking, let’s talk, but first they must understand the existing realities of the highly regulated industry and the government incompetence that has failed to prevent tragedy. Then they should review five areas of reform that would thwart criminals while protecting gun owners.

Before getting to the reforms, we must look at the laws already on the books and define some terms. Almost every proposal coming across social media or cable news reveals a grave misunderstanding of the issue. All licensed dealers, importers, or manufacturers conduct background checks—some 273 million since 1998—that stop many prohibited groups from purchasing firearms, including domestic abusers, felons, illegal aliens, and many others.

Automatic weapons are already restricted for civilians or shielded by prohibitive costs and regulations. The majority of guns purchased in America are semi-automatic, meaning one trigger pull fires one bullet. This applies to both handguns and hunting rifles. “Assault rifle” merely describes a gun’s aesthetic and features, not its mechanisms. Suppressors do not silence a gun, nor even meaningfully suppress the sound for bystanders. They merely reduce the volume to protect shooters’ hearing.

The loudest voices usually touch on one of the above topics, either attempting to write overlapping laws or misapplying terms. Energy would be better spent on reforming and improving the systems we already have, including 1) updating the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS); 2) prosecuting prohibited buyers for falsifying information; 3) cross-referencing with other databases; 4) increasing investigation times for flagged background checks; and 5) expanding the user base for NICS.

Unlike proposals from the Left that would not have prevented recent shootings, each of these reforms would actually make a meaningful difference.

1. Clarify Which Records Must Be Submitted to NICS

The FBI maintains the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). It’s composed of three databases and runs an individual’s information against an extensive list of prohibited persons. Civilian courts and local, state, and federal agencies are required to submit mental health records, violent misdemeanors, felonies, and other convictions to the FBI to maintain the accuracy of the system.

Service members are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, a separate judicial system within the military to adjudicate violations of military rules and regulations in court-martials. The military is also required to report most offender criminal history data to the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division of the FBI to be included in NICS checks. Yet Navy requirements do not require fingerprint cards or conviction summaries to be sent to the FBI.

Whether by bureaucratic error, incompetence, or subversion, for at least a decade the military has provided insufficient information to the FBI for the NICS. No more heinous example exists than the Air Force failing to report Texas church shooter Devin Kelley’s records, allowing him to pass three NICS checks.

Legislation has attempted to address this but it failed in Congress. It is essential to clarify which authorities must report and which records must be reported, then to ensure they are reported or available to the FBI. Such legislation and oversight inspections would bolster the database to ensure that already prohibited persons are actually flagged and prevented from passing checks.

Because the three databases may have overlapping records, the FBI noted in December 2016 that “on the state level, unless otherwise instructed by state law or federal funding requirements, participation in the NICS Indices is strictly voluntary.” Some entities that should be providing information are failing to do so, and this should be addressed.

2. Prosecute Buyers for False Application Information

In April 2013, senators Ted Cruz and Chuck Grassley introduced “common-sense measures that [would] increase criminal prosecutions of felons who try to buy guns, criminalize straw purchasing and gun trafficking, and address mental health issues.” Under the Grassley-Cruz bill, a domestic abuser who lied on an application about his criminal record would face swift and harsh prosecution, ultimately leading to incarceration.

While failing a background check denies a legal gun purchase, this legislation would more strongly deter lying by prioritizing prosecution for prohibited persons attempting to get guns. Violent criminals already willing to lie on official forms or willing to kill are also willing to illegally obtain weapons if they are denied. This bill would have put them in prison before they sought a black market gun to carry out their evil plans.

Unfortunately, Democrats filibustered this bill, so it died with 52 votes. Lying on federal forms is a felony, but the Obama administration was reluctant to prosecute such cases. According to Cruz, “In 2010, 48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns. They prosecuted only 44 of them.”

Focusing on prosecution is critical, because it would have ensured that Kelley was in federal prison rather than Sutherland Springs. This is the class of people we do not want to have guns, and catching them red-handed attempting to purchase guns but not prosecuting them almost guarantees a tragic outcome.

3. Cross-Reference with DHS

The current background check system runs a subject’s information through the FBI database. While this captures important criminal records, it fails to fully account for immigration status. Illegal aliens are a prohibited class according to federal law, but the NICS does not necessarily check citizenship. The system merely seeks matches in three criminal databases, it does not provide information.

The purpose of ‘common sense’ gun regulation is to prevent unknown entities from having dangerous weapons.

A person who does not appear on the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database, the Interstate Identification Index (III), or the NICS Indices would pass the background check. When applicable, searches are run through the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), but the applicability depends on the answers given in the application. If the immigrant fails to list his alien number, no search is run through ICE, and a regular background check proceeds.

No regular cross-reference may fail to identify individuals in the country on temporary visas or who have overstayed their visas. Such oversight could allow a prohibited nonimmigrant visitor or undocumented alien to pass a background check and purchase a firearm. The NICS would catch convicted aliens or those with deportation orders, but may not catch an alias or someone with no rap sheet.

While being an illegal immigrant or foreign visitor does not inherently make one a risk, the purpose of “common sense” gun regulation is to prevent unknown entities from having dangerous weapons, and a more thorough background check to flag questionable or risky noncitizens makes sense. Additionally, focus on prosecutions for prohibited persons falsifying information is essential.

4. Increase NICS Investigation Time

The NICS allows three days for investigation. While approximately 92 percent of background checks are completed in a matter of seconds or minutes for those with no criminal record, if the system finds a match, the transaction is denied or delayed. When a match exists, the FBI has only three days to investigate, after which the seller merely uses his own judgment. Because some databases may be incomplete, expanding the investigation time from three to five days may yield relevant results, potentially saving lives without impacting the rights of gun owners. According to the FBI,

It is critical to note that the NICS Indices is ever-changing. Contributors add, delete, and modify NICS Indices entries with frequency. In addition, certain prohibitive categories contain an expiration date, which could necessitate the related information’s removal from the NICS Indices. Each contributor to the NICS Indices is responsible for the accuracy and validity of its own NICS Indices entries. The NIAA requires federal agencies to update, correct, modify or remove records once they become aware that the information is no longer prohibited under the Gun Control Act no less than quarterly. It is important to note, not all federal agencies possess relevant records under the NIAA. Therefore, some federal agencies may have no submissions to the NICS Indices.

For such a dynamic system, investigations may need to exceed three days to fully vet an applicant. To be clear, this is not a wait time. It is only a delay for the approximately 8 percent of individuals who are not instantly cleared. Of course, not all of these people will be prohibited, but additional time for vetting questionable applications could be useful.

5. Expand NICS for Broader Use

Registered dealers are required to have a Federal Firearms License (FFL). These FFL holders provide a Firearms Transaction Record (ATF Form 4473) to prospective buyers then contact the NICS to facilitate a background check. Every licensed gun dealer follows this procedure, even at gun shows.

To expand background checks, instead of attempting to regulate individual private transactions, the NICS could be broadened to allow private users to run checks. In other words, give non-FFL gun show sellers the option but not the requirement to use the NICS. Presently, only FFLs enrolled with the FBI can initiate a check.

Most gun owners and sellers do not want to arm violent criminals or unstable individuals.

Most gun owners and sellers do not want to arm violent criminals or unstable individuals, and when their personal judgment falls short, having access to the background check system would improve their vetting process. But to require all firearm sales to go through the NICS (forever closing the alleged “gun show loophole”) would require that every gun owner register as an FFL before selling their personal firearm to a friend or family member, which is unrealistic. Allowing private individuals, under certain circumstances, to enroll with the FBI (but not as FFLs) could help facilitate safer gun transfer. This could be accompanied with prohibitions on using the system for discriminatory purposes, but allowing better access to information could enhance the safety of private firearm transactions.

This is not an exhaustive list of reforms, but some for serious consideration. Guns have never been the problem, but rule of law and the integrity of the system almost always is. Whether it is due to innate human depravity or mental derangement, violence exists, and we must safeguard our systems while preserving citizens’ right to defend themselves.

Guns are used defensively to save far more lives than they take. Mainstream estimates range from 100,000 to millions of defensive gun uses every year. If we want to take gun violence seriously in the United States, we must take law seriously. We must respect the laws already on the books and prosecute those who subvert them.

Why The Supreme Court Should Step Into This Gun Waiting Period Case,"After the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to bear arms in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), it was up to circuit courts to explore the metes and bounds of that right and develop a consensus. Reality, though, couldn’t be further from this ideal.

From the Ninth Circuit recently deciding citizens have no constitutional right to sell guns, to the Second Circuit deciding the courts only need to scrutinize laws if they “severely” burden our rights, one thing is clear: we need help. The Supreme Court has been gun-shy for the past few years, but one case, Silvester v. Becerra, seems to have attracted their interest. Silvester may finally help move the courts toward competent Second Amendment decisions.

The California code requires most firearm purchasers to wait 10 days before they can bring their gun home, regardless of whether they already own one, or whether they pass their background check sooner. Jeff Silvester, a California resident who already owned firearms, easily passed a background check in less than 10 days, and wanted to buy more firearms. Because there was no reason he should be arbitrarily forced to wait after passing a background check, he challenged the law.

Silvester won in the Eastern District of California because the only reason the state could muster for forcing a gun owner to wait on receiving a subsequent gun after having passed a background check was that it would provide a “cooling off” period. Of course, the state could not prove how this period might keep someone from using guns he already had.

Then the Ninth Circuit Did Its Thing

Because the Second Amendment protects the right to bear all arms in common lawful use, any law that limits that right has to pass certain standards to be constitutionally permissible. The law must be addressed at a specific harm, and must not encompass more protected conduct than needed. The district court was not convinced by California’s fuzzy logic, and found applying an arbitrary waiting period to someone who already owns guns to be unconstitutional. Never to take the thought of their residents regaining constitutional rights laying down, California appealed to the frequently reversed, heavily politicized Ninth Circuit.

The Ninth Circuit ignored that the burden was on California to prove its case—and the state had no evidence the wait period would improve public safety when the purchaser already owns other arms. Instead, the Ninth Circuit speculated as to what kind of harms the law might conceivably prevent, not any important interest it actually serves. In the face of a decision that would allow California to arbitrarily infringe their Second Amendment rights for almost any reason, the challengers turned to the Supreme Court.

Because of the Supreme Court’s demonstrated hesitance to hearing Second Amendment cases, California didn’t even file a brief in response to Silvester’s petition for certiorari. This is common, as states have figured out that the Supreme Court desperately avoids decisions that would upset the nation’s delicate tapestry of gun laws. But Silvester’s case piqued the court’s interest, as the Supreme Court gave California an October 30 deadline to get off their butts and file a brief in response to Silvester. The high court only tends to do this when they are interested in a case, which is big news. Why this case, though? The answer might be simple: the state may have simply taken too little.

The Case Could Be Small Enough for Attention

Silvester’s case is quite narrow, covering only the application of an arbitrary waiting period to people who already own guns. The Supreme Court’s input, then, would not upset our national mélange of gun laws. Instead, it could help enable lower courts to finally move forward in competently developing Second Amendment jurisprudence.

With the court having avoided questions of “assault weapon” bans, and various concealed-carry cases, could it be that California’s fatal flaw was not stepping hard enough on the Second Amendment? In any event, the case has garnered attention from within and without the high court. It was the SCOTUSBlog’s petition of the day, and got the attention of the Cato Institute, which filed a brief in support of certiorari.

Because the case is small, the facts straightforward, the error clear, and the issue so constitutionally significant, the Supreme Court should step in and remind the Ninth Circuit what was said in McDonald v. Chicago (2010): the Second Amendment is not a “second-class” right for the circuit courts to “single out for special—and specially unfavorable—treatment.”

Kendall Jenner Wants To Buy A Gun For Self-Defense,"Kendall Jenner wants to protect herself from her slew of stalkers and house break-ins, but Kim Kardashian West isn’t a fan of her little sister getting a gun. On the latest episode of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” the Kardashian and Jenner sisters have a serious conversation about self-defense and gun safety.

Kendall Jenner’s older sister, Khloe Kardashian, offers some good advice about shooting with different guns before buying one, and selecting a gun that is right for Jenner. “You have to go and hold them and test them and see what feels most comfortable in your grip,” she said.

But when Kim walks in on them looking at different guns on their phones, she is appalled. Khloe explains how Jenner thinks keeping a gun in her house would make her feel safe.

“She feels really unsafe and says she has a different stalker outside of her house every few days,” Khloe said. “She’s a single girl who lives alone… someone’s already broken into her home while she’s away. What if she was there? I want to know about these things so that I can be knowledgeable and protect myself or know how to handle a gun.”

Kim quickly rebuts Khloe, bringing up her kidnapping in Paris last year.

“It was three against one… there was no way I was going to get out of there. I’m not like Lara Croft,” Kim said. “I’m not comfortable with it. I wouldn’t want my kids around it.”

After a montage of clips of the family meeting with gun violence activists and people who have lost family members to gun deaths, Kim reiterates why her discomfort with guns should prevent Jenner from getting one: “Owning guns has just never been my thing, and with kids in the house, I just don’t think it’s something that I’m comfortable with.”",https://thefederalist.com/2017/11/30/kendall-jenner-wants-buy-gun-self-defense/,2017-11-30

Blaming ‘Toxic Masculinity’ For Mass Shootings Is A Form Of Bigotry,"When Stephen Paddock fired on a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, killing 58 and wounding hundreds, Americans wanted to know the motive behind the worst mass shooting in modern American history. Was Paddock a terrorist? Did he have accomplices? Was he mentally ill?

Nearly four months later, we still don’t know his motives, but we can be reasonably sure that Paddock acted alone and that he wasn’t crazy. An 81-page preliminary report issued last week by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department says as much, breaking down in great detail Paddock’s movement in the days and weeks leading up to his rampage at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. But after nearly 2,000 investigative leads, 21,000 thousand hours of video, hundreds of thousands of images captured, and nearly 750 legal notices filed or sent, the report concludes that “nothing was found to indicate motive on the part of Paddock or that he acted with anyone else.”

Lacking a motive, some commentators have turned to other, more rarefied culprits. Laura Kiesel, writing in Politico, argues we shouldn’t blame mental illness for mass shootings like the one in Las Vegas. Instead, we should blame men: “If we want to stop the problem of mass shootings, we need to fix the problem of toxic masculinity.”

Kiesal goes on to cite crime statistics and sociological studies about everything from anxiety disorders to media messaging to bolster her claim that men and their toxic masculinity are somehow to blame for mass shootings.

“Men don’t just constitute almost all mass shooters in recent history; they are also responsible for the vast majority of gun-associated deaths in the country,” writes Kiesel. “Men own guns at triple the rate of women in the U.S., at 62 percent compared to 22 percent—and also commit suicide at nearly triple the rate of women. Eighty-nine percent of murder-suicides are committed by men, and most often include an unwitting female partner or ex-partner.”

Whether Kiesel realizes it or not, she’s talked herself into a position that can only be described as bigoted. What’s the difference, after all, between her argument and saying that we should not blame gun rights for gun violence, we should blame black men? There is no difference—indeed, there’s even a strong statistical correlation between black men and gun violence to back up such an outrageous claim.

Here’s How The Left Stumbles Into Bigotry

Consider the New York Police Department (NYPD) crime statistics for 2016, which show a staggering disparity in gun-related crime by racial category, with blacks accounting for the vast majority of shooting victims, suspects, and arrestees (72.5, 70.7, and 67.5 percent, respectively)—and this is in a city where blacks account for only about a quarter of the population.

Here are those figures in a shocking bar graph from the NYPD:

What does Kiesel make of such statistics? Based on her own reasoning, should she not conclude that the real problem with gun violence in New York City is black men? After all, if the vast majority of mass shootings in America are committed by men, and from this we conclude that what’s behind mass shootings is a social malady of “toxic masculinity,” then should we not also conclude that what’s behind gun violence in New York City is a social malady of toxic black male-ness?

The mere suggestion is of course offensive, and no reasonable person would conclude this from the NYPD crime statistics. But here we see the fundamental flaw in Kiesel’s reasoning. It’s true that black men in New York are doing a lot of shooting—but not because they’re black men. Race has absolutely nothing to do with it.

Far more likely culprits are government welfare policies and the dysfunctional family culture they create. The poisonous combination of welfare and minimum wage laws has gradually hollowed out entire urban communities, weakened families, and suppressed social mobility. If you restrict economic opportunity for long enough, you end up with communities where single parenthood is rampant and crime is pervasive. This is largely what’s to blame for the rates of gun violence, among other social ills, we see among black residents of New York—not race or sex or any other coincidental correlation. If we want to talk about the shocking rates of gun violence among blacks in New York, this is where we should start.

But because that’s not a conversation the Left is willing to have, we will continue to witness the spectacle of earnest, link-heavy essays in national publications arguing that a person’s sex disposes him to commit gun violence. With apologies to Kiesel, who I’m sure is no racist, this argument is as preposterous as suggesting that a person’s race disposes him to commit gun violence, and it should be treated with the same scorn.

Denying Human Nature Comes With Real Costs

All of that leaves the question of Paddock’s motive. Nothing about his life suggests he would commit this terrible crime. He was not impoverished or desperate. Being married, he was at least not a complete romantic failure. He seems to have had little in common with other recent mass shooters like Dylann Roof, the lonely white supremacist, or Omar Mateen, the confused would-be jihadi.

He had no accomplices, no radical politics, no prior criminal record, and no evidence of mental illness. He left no manifesto or suicide note. The only scrap of paper found in Paddock’s room with any writing on it, according to the police report, was “a small note indicating measurements and distances related to the use of rifles.”

That sparse and harrowing detail, tucked away in the report, underscores the cold inhumanity of the Las Vegas massacre. We understandably want to explain Paddock’s behavior and attribute it something like mental illness. He must have been depressed or bipolar or schizophrenic. He must have been part of some extremist movement. Some external factor must explain his monstrous deed.

But this search for external causes is a modern and progressive impulse. So far we have no explanation or motive except that Paddock was a wicked man intent on doing evil. Those words—wicked, evil—are not taken very seriously by the sort of people who would prefer to blame Paddock’s crimes on toxic masculinity or mental illness. Progressives in particular scoff at the very idea of human nature, much less that it is fallen and corrupt and capable of doing great evil.

To suggest that something so arcane and old-fashioned as the wickedness of human nature is to blame for Las Vegas is, for progressives, tantamount to blaming a demonic spirit. It is absurd and unscientific. After all, human nature is itself a delusion, a phantom of the imagination no more real than a demon or a wood sprite. Such talk is beneath serious people in the twenty-first century.

Much like the Left is unwilling to have a conversation about the real causes of gun violence in New York City, so too is it unwilling to have a conversation about human nature and the reality of evil. Progressives can no more admit that government welfare policies are the root cause of gun violence in New York than they can admit that fallen human nature is the root cause of mass shootings like Las Vegas.

That’s too bad, and not just because it causes otherwise-decent people like Kiesel to talk themselves into making bigoted arguments better suited to an alt-right blog. There are real costs to denying human nature and real implications to the notion that something like “toxic masculinity” can be rooted out or suppressed.

Make no mistake, when progressives talk about “addressing toxic masculinity” they are making a claim about human nature: men and women and children can be molded into whatever we choose. Indeed, men can be made into women, and boys into girls. There is nothing, really, to stop us. Certainly nothing so preposterous as human nature. If we can only shed these superstitious notions, they say, our eyes will be opened, and we shall be as gods.

We Can’t Have A Debate About Guns If Liberals Keep Lying About Them,"There’s always a lot of emotion after a horrific school shooting, and that’s completely understandable. There is also an immediate push for vague “do-something” gun-control legislation often wholly untethered from the incidents it is purporting to stop, which is less understandable. Worse, most of these efforts are bolstered by falsehoods and half-truths that make it virtually impossible to have a genuine discussion about the problem.

It’s an endless task, but let’s just take Joe Scarborough’s Washington Post column on the Parkland shooting as an example, since he uses a couple of the most fraudulent talking points about modern gun ownership.

The former GOP congressman, who once voted to repeal the “assault weapons” ban and never once “stood up” to the boogeyman NRA when there was any political risk, tells us he’s a “reasonable” conservative who believes in the Second Amendment. “I was relieved the court confirmed that citizens have a constitutional right to possess handguns at home for the purpose of protection,” Scarborough writes about the 2008 Heller decision.

That’s nice. But while Scarborough’s exceptionally narrow definition of Heller — possess handguns at home for the purpose of protection – might be convenient for a political argument, it’s misleading. The Heller decision found that the Second Amendment was an individual right to keep and bear arms for any “lawful purpose,” not merely home protection. It found that the Second Amendment “guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.” (Italics mine.) And it specifically struck down a portion of a DC law that required rifles and shotguns be kept “unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock.”

It is not just about home protection or “handguns.”

Scarborough then offers this paragraph:

If Trump and the NRA try to tell you it is your God-given, constitutional right to stockpile weapons of war, they are lying. But don’t take my word for it. In District of Columbia v. Heller, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia ruled that the regulation of gun ownership was compatible with the Second Amendment. That “important limitation . . . is fairly supported,” Scalia wrote, “by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of ‘dangerous and unusual weapons.’ ”

No one is stockpiling weapons of war, unless they’ve illegally gotten their hands on fully-automatic M-16s. Moreover, Scarborough takes Scalia out of context. Of course there are limitations on gun ownership — there are over 10,000 gun laws being ignored by criminals as we speak. Many of these laws ban or put severe restrictions on “dangerous and unusual weapons.”

Heller, though, found that the Second Amendment protected weapons “in common use by law-abiding citizens.” The AR-15 clearly meets this criteria. If Scarborough and others are proposing banning all semi-automatic handguns and rifles, that’s their right. But their contention that AR-15s are “weapons of war” or especially “dangerous and unusual” compared to other widely-owned guns, they are mistaken. The idea that Scalia would support bans on semi-automatic weapons seems risible.

“Assault weapon” mostly means “scary looking.” The AR-15 functions like any other semi-automatic. It is largely the cosmetics of the rifle that make it a useful political target — and probably why school shooters gravitate towards them lately. But the lapse of the assault weapons ban in 2004 did not precipitate an uptick in gun violence. In fact, gun violence had soon fallen to historic lows (there is plenty evidence to suggest that crime rates have far more to do with social trends and economics than a rise or fall in gun ownership, but that’s another story.)

Moreover, though there are probably around 15 million AR-15s in civilian hands today, they are responsible for a small number of gun deaths — around two three percent of gun homicides (and two percent of gun crimes) in 2016 were perpetrated by rifles, and not all of them AR-15s. The vast majority of gun homicides and suicides are committed using the kind of handguns that Scarborough believes Americans should be able to own.

Nor do murderers need AR-15s to shoot up schools. From 1999 to 2013, “assault rifles” were used in 27 percent of mass shootings — defined as four or more murder victims in one shooting. Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people at the gun-free zone of Virginia Tech using two semi-automatic handguns.

Scarborough goes on.

“Maybe the gun lobby is panicking because history is not on its side. Since 1994, the number of hunters in the United States has fallen to about 15 percent. As Kurt Andersen noted in his book ‘Fantasyland: How America Went Haywire,’ just 3 percent of Americans own roughly half of the country’s guns. Three out of four Americans do not even own a gun.”

It’s true that today only 15 percent of adults live in households in which they, or their spouse, were hunters — it is an all-time low, the highest level was 31.6 percent in 1977. The second statistic offered by Scarborough, though, conveniently moves from households to individuals which makes the number of gun owners seem far smaller than it is. Sure, gun collectors will own a large percentage of individual guns. And yes, infants and the elderly don’t typically collect Sig Sauers. But according to Gallup 42 percent of households still feature a firearm (though I’m skeptical that many Americans answer this question honestly.) That number has fluctuated from 49 percent in 1961, down to 34 percent in 1998. Overall, those are still consequential numbers and they’ve changed little.

This attempt to artificially diminish the number of Americans who own guns works in concert with efforts to blame one organization, the NRA, which apparently has a mint in its basement and a supernatural power to make politicians complicit in mass murder. All of it is meant to create the perception that only a few people stand in the way of “common sense” gun legislation. It’s a myth.

“Poll after poll proves I am not the one out of touch,” Scarborough writes after listing a bunch of nebulous regulations he claims Americans support. (Let’s not forget that the last time Scarborough told us the GOP was going to pay dearly for failing to adopt restrictive gun legislation, the Republicans won a wave election.) Now, principled people don’t let the vagaries of polling dictate their positions, but they also tend to wait for specifics. Everyone wants safer gun ownership. What many don’t want are laws that inhibit legal ownership and do nothing to stop criminality. That’s basically all the Democrats have offered.

A big part of the problem is that gun-control advocates have a singular obsession with guns — especially, a particular style of gun — and very little concern for proper enforcement or warnings systems or cultural trends that have led to mass shootings or mental health risks or how we cover these shootings. This rejection of holistic solutions exemplifies their real intentions and makes Second Amendment advocates rightfully suspicious.

Ross Douthat's Latest Gun Control Proposals Miss The Mark,"In his most recent column for The New York Times, conservative writer Ross Douthat tackled the mass shooting at a school in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 innocent people dead. While Douthat is typically measured and even-handed in considering what is driving men of a certain age and demographic profile to purchase deadly weapons and direct their fire at innocent people, his recommended solution to the problem — age-based bans on certain weapons — completely misses the mark.

Specifically, Douthat recommends that “hunting rifles,” which he does not define, be legal to own once an individual reaches 18 years of age. Revolvers, under Douthat’s suggested gun control regime, would be legal at age 21. Semi-automatic pistols would be legal when an individual turned 25, and semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 could not be sold to anyone under 30:

“Which leaves me wondering if there’s a way to adapt a high-minded vision of guns and citizenship to our era of extended adolescence and young-male anomie. “For instance, instead of debating gun regulations that would apply to every gun owner, we could consider limits that are imposed on youth and removed with age. After all, the fullness of adult citizenship is not bestowed at once: Driving precedes voting precedes drinking, and the right to stand for certain offices is granted only in your thirties. “Perhaps the self-arming of citizens could be similarly staggered. Let 18-year-olds own hunting rifles. Make revolvers available at 21. Semiautomatic pistols, at 25. And semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 could be sold to 30-year-olds but no one younger.”

These recommendations evince not only a lack of understanding of guns, but a complete unfamiliarity with U.S. data on violent crime, weapon usage, and mass shootings. In fact, the most damning indictment of Douthat’s gun control proposal is the data on mass shootings. Contrary to his suggestion that “isolated young men” are the most likely perpetrators of mass shootings, the data show otherwise. Since the 1966 shooting at the University of Texas, an incident which many believe touched off the modern phenomenon of mass shootings (defined as a public shooting in which 4 or more people were killed), there have been 150 shootings involving 153 individuals, according to a detailed database published by the Washington Post. Of those, 150 were men, and the ages of 148 of them are known.

The average of those male mass shooters is just over 33 years old. While media coverage of these shootings can often give the impression that they are committed primarily by young men in their late teens or twenties, the data show otherwise. In fact, 55 percent of all public mass shootings in the U.S. since 1966 have been committed by men who were at least 30 years old. The deadliest mass shooting in American history, which occurred in Las Vegas in 2017, was perpetrated by a 64-year-old man. Forty-one percent of shootings, according to data from The Washington Post, were committed by men between the ages of 18 and 29 (4 percent were committed by those younger than 18).

Those data alone, which show that mass shootings are far more likely to be committed by those outside of Douthat’s proposed limits, demonstrate the folly of his gun control recommendations. But it’s not just the actual age of shooters which calls into question Douthat’s age-based bans; weapon usage statistics also contradict his calls for new strict regulations on rifles.

Although media outlets and gun control proponents focus their ire on the AR-15, a relatively low-caliber rifle which has been widely sold to civilians for more than half a century, rifles are one of the least-used murder weapons in the U.S. Just as an age-based gun ban would not have had any impact on a majority of mass shooters in this country, a feature-based weapon ban that targeted rifles would also barely scratch the surface. That’s because the vast majority of murders in the U.S. are committed not with rifles like the AR-15, but with simple handguns.

According to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) statistics, only 2.2 percent of murders in the U.S. over the last five years were committed with rifles. Shotguns were used in 2.1 percent of murders. The weapon of choice for most killers in this country is not the much-villified AR-15, but the simple handgun, which was used in more than 31,000 murders between 2012 and 2016, the most recent five years for which data are available. In fact, the FBI data show that you are more likely to be stabbed to death (11.9 percent of all murders) or killed by someone’s hands, fists, or feet (5.1 percent) than you are to be killed by any type of rifle, let alone an AR-15. Rifle bans, even if they were practical, effective, and constitutional, still wouldn’t stop the overwhelming majority of murders in the U.S.

In response to criticism of his proposals on Twitter, Douthat responded by highlighting a New York Times list of 19 recent mass shootings and noting that because rifles were used in many of them, a rifle ban would clearly make a big difference:

It's a Times list, and not school-specific, but about half of these feature semi-auto rifles. Again, just seems like there's a big gap btw what ppl use for ordinary murder (mostly handguns) and these kind of deliberate sprees.https://t.co/phyGdzCHGY — Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) February 17, 2018

But even under those terms, the logic of his proposal fails. Why? Because contrary to his claim that “about half” of recent shootings featured semi-automatic rifles, the very list he references shows the opposite: in 11 of the 19 shootings he references, or 58 percent, a rifle was never used. Another defense offered by Douthat, that semi-automatic rifles are “almost always” used in mass shootings is similarly false. The deadliest school shooting in history was perpetrated using just two handguns, one of which had a maximum magazine capacity of just 10 rounds. Multiple incidents on the list cited by Douthat resulted in double-digit deaths using only handguns or shotguns.

Forget the 25/30 provocation for now; do you think it would be a disastrous infringement on liberty if the age for semi-autos in FL had been 21 and not 18? — Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) February 17, 2018

In many ways, though, the data are beside the point, because what is being debated right now is not guns or gun control. Guns are just a proxy for a much larger philosophical debate about the nature of man. Can evil be regulated away if we just put certain tools under lock and key? Can murder be driven into extinction through the right mix of technocratic regulations? I think the entirety of human history overwhelmingly indicates that the answer to both questions is a resounding “No!” Evil cannot be regulated away. Men and women intent on doing vicious harm to others cannot be dissuaded by simple rules against possessing this or that piece of fabricated metal. Criminals, by definition, do not care about laws. And criminals intent on murder, the most vicious and permanent of all crimes, will not stop lusting for blood because a piece of paper somewhere says they can’t legally possess that weapon until they turn a certain age.

And that brings us to the next philosophical question that at issue in the debate over guns: if evil cannot be regulated away, do we have the right to defend ourselves and our loved ones with force, if necessary? The men who founded this country and wrote its foundational legal document clearly believed in the God-given right to self-defense, which resulted in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. If, as the Founders noted in the Declaration of Independence, we are all endowed by our Creator with an unalienable right to life and liberty, are we not also entitled to defend those very rights? A right which ceases to exist the second a criminal threatens it is no right at all, which is why tens of millions of Americans proudly keep and bear firearms to this day.

While I respect and share Douthat’s desire to find a solution to the problem of mass shootings, I simply disagree with not only his recommendations, but also their premise. The data clearly show that his proposals would do little to address his stated problem. The bigger issue, however, is one of principle. A nation cannot be made safer from criminals by restricting the God-given rights of those who respect and follow the law. My Second Amendment right to defend myself is every bit as important and vital as Douthat’s First Amendment right to publish his political opinions as he pleases without interference from the government.

Just as I would never dare suggest that the free press be limited only to those of a certain age, or that the government should set limits on how many words a journalist may publish in any given day, I wish that political pundits would refrain from trying to set limits on the constitutional rights that I and millions of my fellow countrymen believe are the only way to defend ourselves from mass murderers like the one in Parkland, Florida.

"After FL School Shooting, Is The Second Amendment Worth Dying For?","In November 2007, the novelist David Foster Wallace wrote a short essay for a special edition of The Atlantic on “The American Idea.” Writing about 9/11 and all that came after, Wallace proposed what some might consider a monstrous thought experiment:

Are some things still worth dying for? Is the American idea one such thing? Are you up for a thought experiment? What if we chose to regard the 2,973 innocents killed in the atrocities of 9/11 not as victims but as democratic martyrs, ‘sacrifices on the altar of freedom’? In other words, what if we decided that a certain baseline vulnerability to terrorism is part of the price of the American idea? And, thus, that ours is a generation of Americans called to make great sacrifices in order to preserve our democratic way of life—sacrifices not just of our soldiers and money but of our personal safety and comfort? In still other words, what if we chose to accept the fact that every few years, despite all reasonable precautions, some hundreds or thousands of us may die in the sort of ghastly terrorist attack that a democratic republic cannot 100-percent protect itself from without subverting the very principles that make it worth protecting?

Wallace’s point was that, in the wake of 9/11, a host of policies had been put in place—the Patriot Act, warrantless surveillance, private contractors performing military duties—without a substantive public debate about the trade-offs they represented and whether they were worth it. Wallace wanted to know what it said about us as a people that we were unable or unwilling even to consider whether some things might be more important than safety.

“Why now can we not have a serious national conversation about sacrifice, the inevitability of sacrifice—either of (a) some portion of safety or (b) some portion of the rights and protections that make the American idea so incalculably precious?” he asked. And if we would not have such a conversation, “What kind of future does that augur?”

More than a decade later, we are still incapable of serious discussion of the trade-offs between safety and freedom. For the most part, we’re not even able to admit that such trade-offs exist.

Are you ready for another monstrous thought experiment? What if we decided that a certain baseline vulnerability to mass shootings is part of the price of the American idea? In some ways, mass shootings are a more apt example of what Wallace was talking about than terrorism. After all, we can arguably do something about a worldwide ideological and religious movement that uses violence as a political weapon—and we have. Whether the aggregate cost in American blood and treasure has been worth it is another question, but it suffices to say that we can do much less about a random madman intent on killing innocents than we can about ISIS and al-Qaeda.

Set aside, for now, the facile arguments for gun control half-measures that wouldn’t have stopped the Parkland shooting—or Las Vegas, Virginia Tech, Newtown, or the others. Consider instead what the Left thinks it would really take to stop these kinds of shootings: a repeal of the Second Amendment, followed by mass confiscation of firearms and subsequent heavy regulation of private gun ownership, along the lines of policies in many European countries.

I’m not trying to be provocative. That’s really what it would take. Are we willing to consider it? Should we? What does it say about us that we can’t even acknowledge the trade-offs involved in keeping U.S. school children safe? The best we could manage last week were the worn-out, ritualized responses: outraged calls for anemic gun control measures from the Left and a naive insistence from the Right that tackling “mental health issues” will somehow solve the problem.

Let’s Be Honest About ‘Common Sense’ Gun Control

The New York Times’ Bret Stephens, for one, is at least willing to be honest about the thing. Back in October, he wrote a column calling for repealing the Second Amendment. There’s of course much to criticize in Stephens’ argument, beginning with his cherry-picked statistics that fail to explain how, despite a recent surge, the murder rate, and violent crime in general, has been plummeting since the 1990s even as gun ownership has steadily increased.

I’m not going to pick apart Stephens’ piece (my colleague David Harsanyi did a fine job of that shortly after it ran). The point is that Stephens plainly states what most liberals are unwilling to admit: if we really want to stop gun violence in America, we’re going to have to make fundamental changes to our constitutional order so that the government can wrest guns out of the hands of Americans.

To suggest anything less is intellectually dishonest because anything less simply won’t work. It’s no surprise, then, that Joe Scarborough took to The Washington Post on Friday to argue for stronger background checks, a ban on bump stocks, and “assurances that military-style weapons”—whatever that means—“will stop finding their way into the hands of terrorists, domestic abusers and the mentally ill.” He puts these forward as substantive policies that will not only make a difference but won’t require rewriting the Bill of Rights, neither of which are true.

Or consider the refrain that immediately popped up on social media after the shooting: that guns should be regulated like automobiles. Sure, there are myriad ways we could do that, from requiring things like insurance and a license, to heavy restrictions on what sort of guns manufacturers are allowed to sell to the public.

But of course owning and driving a car is not a constitutionally protected right, it’s a privilege that comes with certain duties and costs. If we’re going to regulate firearms like cars, we’re going to have to decide that owning a gun will no longer be a constitutional right but a heavily regulated privilege. If we do that, we’re going to have to be honest about what that means: changing the very nature of the constitutional system America’s Founders designed.

What’s the American Idea Worth?

Here it must be said that the Second Amendment was not meant to safeguard the right to hunt deer or shoot clay pigeons, or even protect your home and family from an intruder. The right to bear arms stems from the right of revolution, which is asserted in the Declaration of Independence and forms the basis of America’s social compact. Our republic was forged in revolution, and the American people have always retained the right to overthrow their government if it becomes tyrannical. That doesn’t mean that private militias should have tanks and missile launchers, but it does mean that revolution—the right of first principles—undergirds our entire political system.

That might sound academic or outlandish next to the real-life horror of a school shooting, but the fact remains that we can’t simply wave off the Second Amendment any more than we can wave off the First, or the Fourth, or any of them. They are constitutive elements of the American idea, without which the entire constitutional system would eventually collapse.

In this, America is unlike the European nations that gun control advocates like to compare it with. Germany can restrict the right to bear arms as easily as it can—and does—restrict free speech. Not so in America. If we want to change that, it will involve a substantial diminishment of our constitutional rights as we have known them up until now. After last week’s school shooting, some Americans are okay with that, especially those families who are grieving. But I suspect most Americans are not willing to make that trade-off, and might never be—unless they suffer the same of kind personal loss.

Returning to Wallace’s thought experiment, we might rephrase it like this: is the Second Amendment worth dying for? That’s another way of asking what the American idea is worth. It’s not an easy question, and I don’t pose it lightly, as I’m sure Wallace didn’t.

But it’s one we need to ask, even in the face of heartbreaking and devastating loss. Is ours a generation of Americans called to make great sacrifices of our personal safety in order to preserve our democratic way of life? If we will not sacrifice some measure our personal safety, are we willing to sacrifice something like the Second Amendment? If so, what else are we willing to sacrifice?

Shooting Survivors’ Feelings Don’t Legitimize Their Ideas About Politics,"On February 15, the day after 17 students and faculty were murdered at a Florida high school, Twitter published a few “moments” with collected tweets about the shooting. One was captioned, “Student survivor David Hogg speaks out on gun control after Parkland shooting.”

Hogg is a 17-year-old student journalist and a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where the shooting occurred. He interviewed fellow students after the shooting, and was interviewed on CNN and MSNBC. Most of the featured tweets on the Twitter “moment” include quotes from Hogg. The final tweet, from a writer named Elisheva Avital, reads simply, “When you’re old enough, David Hogg, run for office.”

Media tends to treat survivors like Hogg as if they are policy experts, rather than ordinary people who have witnessed something most of us will never understand. Reporters often ask questions that politicize shootings and ask for a survivor’s take on legislation.

For instance, a CNN reporter asked Hogg if he had a message for Congress and the president. Hogg said action is more important than ideas. Seemingly unsatisfied with Hogg’s vague answer, the reporter pressed further. “Do you have a sense of what kind of action that would be?” she asked. Hogg replied that any action would be “a step in the right direction.” Perhaps Hogg declined to expand on his answer because he, like most high school students, did not have the knowledge required to provide specifics.

You’re an Expert on Your Feelings, Not Policy

Another highlighted tweet from Vox writer Matthew Yglesias linked to an article he wrote. The headline reads, “Watch a teenage Parkland survivor’s powerful call for legislative action.” Hogg certainly has a powerful story to share, but why is he speaking on anything other than his experience?

The article quotes Hogg saying that the Parkland shooting was the eighteenth school shooting this year. That figure has been debunked by the Washington Post and other news sources, but Vox decided to take the 17-year-old’s word for it instead of checking the facts.

While Hogg doesn’t cite his source, this number originated from an advocacy group called Everytown for Gun Safety that uses an incredibly broad definition of “school shooting.” For instance, last month, someone fired several rounds from a gun in the parking lot of a Michigan high school. This was well after classes had ended that day and no one was hurt, but Everytown listed this as one of the 18 school shootings.

Professional journalists should know better than to blindly trust this number. Hogg is a high school student who is likely to make mistakes, especially right after surviving a shooting. He should not have been treated as a credible source on this statistic.

Emotional Reactions Don’t Make Good Laws

Another highlighted tweet from ABC News included a video of students that Hogg spoke to about the shooting. One anonymous student said, “I personally have rallied for gun rights… but this experience has definitely changed my viewpoints. I was always fascinated by guns as a young girl, but this experience was so traumatizing to the point where now I can’t even fathom the idea of a gun in my house… We need more gun control in our country.”

This quote highlights a purely emotional response to gun violence. She must have known that school shootings were possible prior to February 14. The fact that it took witnessing a shooting to change her mind is proof that her reaction is based on emotion, not logic. It’s hard to blame her for thinking this way, but her sentiment should serve as a reminder that those who witness tragedies are not necessarily in a place to make rational conclusions about legislation, especially immediately after the trauma of the shooting.

It’s important to listen to survivors of tragedies and families and friends of victims. They have lived through terrible pain, and there is no better way to honor the dead than through the words of their loved ones. The media should quote survivors talking about the fear they felt and memories of their 17 murdered classmates and teachers.

Yet enduring tragedy does not make anyone a source of wisdom on legislation. Some of the survivors of the Parkland shooting reacted emotionally, as most anyone would to an unfathomable display of evil. Instead of using victims’ quotes to politicize a tragedy and sneak calls for gun control into news articles, let’s leave the policy analysis to the experts and laws to those elected to represent all Americans’ interests, and let survivors simply tell their stories.

"If You Want Gun Control, Stop Calling The NRA A ‘Terrorist Organization’","Now that the smoke has settled after tragedy in Parkland, Florida, partisans on the Left and Right have hunkered down in their foxholes to fight a familiar fight. Many on the Left are so exasperated and furious with the lack of gun control measures in Congress that they have taken a fairly new route: calling the National Rifle Association (NRA) a terrorist organization.

We can argue about effectiveness of certain proposals, but if gun control advocates ever want gun owners to come to the table, they need to stop mindless name-calling or risk further dividing the country and neutering their cause.

In looking for a villain to blame for shootings across the country, many have latched onto the NRA, trying to turn the organization into a bogeyman to unite against. We saw this knee-jerk reaction from places like Keith Olberman in 2017 to the The Root to comedians like Michael Ian Black.

https://twitter.com/michaelianblack/status/963881272396451840

While it may feel cathartic in the moment to lash out online, it’s a gross misunderstanding of the NRA and the source of their power in American politics. Even worse, this sends a divisive message to gun owners across the country that further splits our already fractured republic.

The NRA Gets Its Power from Millions of Americans

The NRA is an old organization, founded originally in the wake of the Civil War to teach marksmanship to northerners unfamiliar with firearms. Fundamentally, the NRA is a membership organization. Members pay either hundreds of dollars for a lifetime membership or opt for memberships as expensive as $40 per year. In 2013 the NRA passed 5 million members. If all NRA members lived in a single city, it would be the second-largest in the country, behind only New York.

This big chunk of the American population is the true source of the NRA’s lobbying power. Sure, many firearms companies donate to the NRA, but that money is nothing compared to the power of their membership base. If politics is any predictor, money is hardly the determining factor in political success. We saw Hillary Clinton outspend Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign, and history is rife with monied interests losing out to motivated grassroots.

Further, the NRA accounts for a small portion of the spending on lobbying. In 2017 the NRA spent $5.1 million lobbying Congress on firearms issues, which accounts for just 0.15 percent of the $3.34 billion spent on lobbying last year. The New York Times lists Sen. John McCain as the recipient of the most money from the NRA and affiliated groups, at a total of $7.74 million during his political career. In a small footnote, they clarify these numbers are from 1989 onwards, nearly 30 years of contributions.

While this number might seem staggering, consider that McCain has received more than $208.39 million in campaign contributions since 1989. The NRA’s contributions amount for less than 4 percent of all donations he’s received. The NRA’s contributions and spending don’t buy the support of legislators. In the grand scheme of things, the money the NRA donates to politicians and to lobby Congress is a drop in the bucket.

But that 5-million-member activist group isn’t. NRA members are highly motivated to vote, engage in activism, call Congress, and get involved politically at the state and local levels. They help primary conservatives weak on gun issues and fight for their right to keep and bear arms. The NRA can call upon these people to cripple congressional offices with calls. They can organize events, motivate their members, and get their policies enacted.

Calling 5 Million Americans Terrorists

Because of this member base, the NRA has been able to secure huge wins across the country, from the sunsetting of the Assault Weapons Ban in 2004 to the expansion of concealed-carry licensing to the entire nation. And the NRA isn’t alone. Groups like Gun Owners of America go even further in pushing for Second Amendment freedoms the NRA won’t argue for. GOA has made great gains recently in the wake of the NRA’s position change on bump stocks.

The NRA and other gun rights organizations draw their power from their members, and their members know it. So when people call the NRA a terrorist organization, the implication is that its 5 million-plus members are terrorists, too. When people tweet over and over that we are terrorists, putting us in the same bucket as ISIS and al-Qaeda, it’s hardly an invitation to come together and talk about how to solve gun-related issues.

The millions of us who pay for memberships and attend NRA training events are just normal Americans who disagree on policy issues. But by turning normal-American NRA members into some kind of demonic monster to be defeated, histrionic gun-controllers calcify opposition against any kind of even moderate reform.

In addition to the millions of NRA members, Pew estimates 42 percent of Americans live in a household with guns, so that’s tens of millions of people across the country. Polling on firearms ownership also likely underrepresents gun ownership in America (if a stranger randomly called, would you tell him about valuable items in your home?).

Instead of calling millions of their fellow citizens terrorists and promoting radical policies, gun control advocates should look to the NRA’s recent softening on some issues. As The Free Beacon’s Stephen Gutowski has reported, the NRA is pushing legislation that would address “the records reporting failures in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) which were exposed by the shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas” and strengthen background checks. The NRA also called on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to review bump stocks in the wake of the shooting in Las Vegas.

While these changes have irked many of the more stalwart gun-rights proponents, it should be received by the Left as willingness to discuss this issue. Unfortunately the gun-control audience has made their tactics clear: Demonize gun owners and demand Australian-style gun confiscation schemes by pushing fake statistics.

It’s Not Mentally Ill To Be a Gun-Owning Christian,"In the wake of last week’s school shooting, some elements of the American Left are reaching new depths of callous desperation in their attempt to exploit tragedy for more gun control. After all, facts and argument have failed them long ago, just as anti-gun measures have largely failed to deliver on their promises of security. Too many have been shot to death in gun-free zones for us to put much trust in creating bigger ones.

Their tearful rhetoric is likewise wearing thin, for we are now accustomed to the sad fact that every mass shooting is accompanied by shameless leftists intruding on the grief of a nation to demand decisive action before we’ve had a chance to process. While medical professionals routinely advise us not to make major decisions while grieving, the Left tellingly prefers that Americans govern our nation with clouded judgment.

It is therefore with a certain irony that, following the senseless murders at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, professional psychiatrist and amateur entertainer Jimmy Kimmel has diagnosed anyone who questions gun-control advocates’ rushed decisions with mental illness. While those who give more weight to authenticity than to wisdom and reason tend to fall in with whoever turns on the most convincing waterworks, the rest of us are content to treat Kimmel’s sermon as more of that same tearful rhetoric.

You Don’t Know Christianity Very Well, Folks

Within those comments and accusations, Kimmel took aim specifically at Christians—or at least at “alleged Christians,” as he described some prominent Second Amendment supporters. Kimmel’s beleaguered imagination apparently has trouble reconciling legal gun ownership with Christianity, just as it had trouble reconciling it with mental health.

Some people assume that Christians shouldn’t support or participate in gun ownership. Most secular liberals fail to understand Christian ethics on matters like this because so few are familiar with anything Jesus actually said. Their mental image of a good spiritual teacher proceeds from a vague and trite recollection that Jesus thought love was good and judging was bad. It has little to no root in any of Jesus’ actual teachings that his first disciples recorded.

Kimmel isn’t the only media figure plagued with hallucinations of mental illness. Earlier last week, “The View’s” Joy Beher put Vice President Mike Pence in the same category because he, as a Christian, learns Christ’s teachings. She made her diagnosis based on some snide comments (bereft of detail) from a former White House staffer on “Celebrity Big Brother” about Pence believing Jesus tells him things. Plenty of liberals think President Trump is basically the antichrist, but others are apparently more troubled about Pence believing in the actual Christ.

Christians Do Believe Jesus Speaks to Us—In the Bible

As astonishing as it may be to coastal elites who have segregated themselves from ordinary Americans, Christians do generally believe Jesus still teaches his church today. Christianity’s various traditions may differ on how many ways Christ speaks to us and which are more ordinary, but we all agree that he does and that the Bible is one of the most important ways—very often the definitive way, as my own Lutheran tradition teaches, along with that of most Protestants. Indeed, trying to read the Bible every day is the only way Pence mentioned hearing from Jesus.

This is hardly surprising to anyone who is actually familiar with what Jesus taught, for this is precisely how he treated scripture. When rebuking the Pharisees, he says, “God commanded” before quoting both the fourth commandment and Leviticus (Matt. 15). Likewise, when rebuking Satan, he does so with an authoritative “it is written” every time he responds to Satan with scripture (Matt. 4).

Of those who would go on to write the New Testament, Jesus said things like “he who hears you hears me, and the one who rejects you rejects me” (Luke 10:16) and “[the Holy Spirit] will guide you into all truth… for he will take what is mine and declare it to you” (John 16:13-14).

Anybody who follows Christ is also going to follow what he said about the Bible, so Christians believe Jesus speaks to us. One might reject Jesus as a bad teacher for teaching this. Or one might—in defiance of the historical record—refuse to believe he taught any such thing. But that doesn’t mean that believing Jesus’ teachings is mental illness in any meaningful sense.

Christianity Is an Open Book on Self-Defense

What, then, of the charge that preserving the right to bear arms conflicts with Christ’s teachings? What does Jesus have to say to Christians about modern issues of gun control and gun ownership? Not as much as either side of the political aisle might like. Christianity does not demand any specific political platform. On the contrary, Jesus made it quite clear that his kingdom is not of this world. Christ founded his church to deliver the forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation to the world, not to rule over it.

Yes, Christ’s kingdom does not bear arms. After all, sinners like us are saved by faith in Christ rather than relying on our good works. While the edge of the sword (or point of the gun) may coerce outwardly good behavior, it can do nothing to create that faith.

This does not mean, however, that Christians are forbidden from gun ownership, or from being soldiers, police officers, or rulers. Even as we live in the Kingdom of God by faith, we remain citizens of this world as well. Among Christ’s teachings is that God has provided the kingdoms of this world with means to restrain human wickedness, including the use of violence in some circumstances (Romans 13).

So while the Bible clearly condemns murder—the deliberate killing (with any weapon) of innocent or guilty people one is not authorized to kill—it just as clearly grants the sword to civil authorities for the sake of punishing wrongdoers and protecting people from them.

In America, the citizens who govern this country have empowered ordinary people to carry out that role as well by allowing us to arm ourselves. This was a wise decision from our founders and all who have defended our Constitution in subsequent generations.

Police are important in keeping the peace, and we generally rely on them to enforce the law so we do not endure the chaos of vigilantism. But when we come under attack, the attackers are virtually always closer to us than the police are. Americans have decided that we also want to be protected in those crucial minutes (or hours) before the police arrive.

So no, Jesus has not forbidden his followers from being armed or from allowing our neighbors the same privilege. He has not demanded that we ban guns. It is a matter of Christian freedom, and there are innumerable good reasons for Christians to exercise that freedom in a way that preserves our constitutional rights.

Christian Beliefs Are Associated with Better Mental Health

Far more important than the specific issue of gun ownership, however, is the role that Christian faith plays in the way we respond to tragedy—an advantage that likely has some bearing on why so many faithful Christians support the Second Amendment. Rather than a form of mental illness, modern research soundly indicates that religion is associated with both better mental health and better recovery from mental illness. It appears faith in general and the Christian faith in particular (most of that research is done in the largely Christian West) are actually quite helpful to America’s ability to deal with tragedy in a mentally healthy way.

This shouldn’t be terribly surprising. Inasmuch as we, as a culture, have despised faith, we have also crippled our ability to mourn. When tragedy strikes, too many of us respond like mechanics wondering why an engine broke down. We try to find the cause, replace the part, and re-engineer our way to a better engine that never fails.

Our own efforts neither bring back the dead nor create a world without death and suffering. For that, we can only trust in God’s promises.

When feelings are hurt, we want to outlaw words. When children go missing, we want tracking devices on every child and cameras in every corner of the world. When people are murdered, we want to ban whatever was used to kill them. All this we do out of a childlike desperation for a world in which nothing bad ever happens. Instead of taking time to grieve with one another, we cry out, “We must do something” and vow to do whatever it takes until the pain finally goes away.

But that never makes it go away. Our own efforts neither bring back the dead nor create a world without death and suffering. For that, we can only trust in God’s promises. What’s more, doing “whatever it takes” without regard for the consequences often inflicts even more pain by stripping away the protection of wisdom and dispensing with love.

It is loving to want to help those in need, but this kind of desperation knows nothing of love. Love seeks the well-being of the beloved, and it depends on truth and wisdom to guide it. But desperation seeks only its own comfort—it wants the tears and sadness to stop by any means necessary. The bloody history of the twentieth century amply demonstrates what “any means necessary” ultimately becomes in the hands of faithless utopians. The same impulse is at work in our own would-be tyrants who would surely fix the world if only they were allowed to control every aspect of it.

Faith: The Mean Between Complacency and Desperation

Faith, in contrast, is the golden mean between complacency and desperation. Rather than sit idly by in tragedy, we love our neighbors because God first loved us. We also know there is a higher power than humanity at work in the world. This means that the buck does not stop with us, and we are not burdened with engineering a salvation we can never achieve.

It’s hard to take such complainers too seriously when their idea of real action is to harass people on the Internet until they take real action.

We are therefore free to do what it right and loving without making false promises about solving all the world’s problems. We try to do all that we can to help our neighbors and make life better for them, but we do not take on the impossible and infantile task of recreating the world so nothing bad can ever happen—an endeavor that has inflicted hell on millions for the sake of giving them paradise.

It’s easy to spot desperation in action because it never really cares what is done as long as it’s something. You can see it in the fashionable contempt for “thoughts and prayers.” These people want “real action” instead. But it’s hard to take such complainers too seriously when their idea of real action is to harass people on the Internet until they take real action. Some have even stooped to harassing a shooting victim’s father because he supports President Trump.

In exchange for tripe like this, the desperate would strip away the public expressions of solidarity and commiseration that remind victims and survivors that they are not suffering alone and unheard nor beneath the notice of the Almighty. Even if one believes religion is just a crutch, what kind of person goes around kicking away injured people’s crutches?

Desperate Decisions Often Turn Out to Be Bad Ones

You can also see desperation in the calls for change that never count the costs and benefits of that change. The latest calls to ban guns aren’t accompanied by realistic evaluations of how effective such laws would be in the hands of investigators who were given advance warning about Nikolas Cruz twice and failed to take action. They aren’t accompanied by consideration for all the lives that would be lost once targets of violent crime no longer have the means to defend themselves. They aren’t accompanied by any awareness of the long-term consequences of eliminating American freedom and an essential bulwark against tyranny.

Cooler heads have consistently recognized that the actions leftists want are not what is best for our nation.

They don’t even acknowledge the simple fact that gun ownership has been increasing even as violent crime rates have fallen. On the contrary, all these rhapsodies about non-existent “common sense gun laws everybody wants” are deliberately oblivious to the massive controversy surrounding the issue because of the heavy cost of curtailing legal gun ownership. It is no different from banging on the dashboard of a car that won’t start—you do it because you think it’ll make you feel better, not because it will actually help.

Every tragic shooting that grabs the public attention shows us anew that the desperate always try to prey on those in mourning because their grief leaves them vulnerable to sharing in that desperation. But the faithful know there is a better way.

For now, the wisest course of action is one prescribed by Christ—mourn with those who mourn. The time will come—as it always does—to make a rational and loving decision about what needs to be done. Liberals claim that waiting does no good because it has consistently failed to produce any action, but the better explanation is that cooler heads have consistently recognized that the actions leftists want are not what is best for our nation. There’s nothing mentally ill or unchristian about recognizing that.

"Gun Control Across World Only Leads To Acid, Knifings, And Bombings","I have been living in Bangkok for nearly half a decade now, but I was raised in America, and I too am watching the extensive back and forth between gun rights supporters and those pushing for strict gun control in the wake of the Florida school shooting.

In my extensive world travels, I have made a number of observations in countries that have gun control that might add something of value to the ongoing debate in the U.S. I will begin with my present home, Bangkok. We have one of the most effective gun control systems on Earth in Thailand — almost nobody can afford them. Most Thai people do not have enough disposable income to afford a handgun or a rifle. So, nowadays, the bad guys use bombs.

On Sunday, February 1, 2015, I was sitting at Bangkok’s luxurious Siam Paragon shopping mall. As my friends were chatting away, I heard a strange loud thud, and felt a slight rotation that I had never felt before. “What was that?” I asked. “Thunder,” my friend replied.

“No,” I said. And then, just as I looked over my right shoulder, I saw the second bomb go off. I had front row seats to a terrorist bombing, and I watched everyone in the plaza run for their lives. It turned out that I had walked within inches of the bombs only minutes before they went off.

And this was not to be my last close call. Six months later, on August 15, 2015, my bus crept past the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok’s downtown rush hour traffic. Once we got a few blocks away, I heard the bus backfire. Well, Bangkok’s buses are nearly fifty years old so I thought nothing of it … until I got home. Suddenly, my telephone rang. One of my translators was on the other end. She asked if I was okay. I said yes.

And that’s when I got the news: Terrorist bombing. Narrowly missed me. Twenty dead. One hundred and twenty-five wounded. The Erawan Shrine and downtown Bangkok devastated. Days later, I was able to determine that my bus was one of the last to clear that shrine before the bomb went off. Had we been just one stop light later, the death toll might have been about 70 people more.

So, that’s been the result of gun control in Thailand. People normally resort to bombs here, but it is also not uncommon to hear of rural citizens building their own basic guns from scratch. So much for gun control in Thailand.

The Middle East is not far from here and I have been through several of those countries. Over there, they also seem to like bombs. Only their bombs are much bigger than those in Thailand. Sometimes they even use cars or, when all of that is in short supply, they might use a good old-fashioned sword, or even throw you off a roof if you’re really unlucky.

England is not all that far from there and I’ve been there, too. They have strict gun control in England. So instead of guns, they use acid. England had a record last year, pushing nearly 450 acid attacks, most of which were in London alone. One unlucky chap had his entire face dissolved away and now struggles to sleep because he has no eyelids to close. They keep falling off again.

Take Japan, another place I’ve traveled, as another example. There, they just fill subways with poison gas or figure out much more labor intensive ways to kill you, often involving a knife. You tend to die really slowly, so you get to feel every blow as you get stabbed over and over. From Japan, my home country of America is not all that far by plane. You can get there in less than a day. Although many people in Asia think that America has no gun control, that’s not true.

There are places with strict gun control in America, at least in major cities with progressive governments. That must work really well, right? Well, maybe not. Chicago has already had more than 249 shooting victims this year, and we’re not even three months in. Boston has been deemed “a shooter’s paradise” by Boston Magazine. Last year, not only were there plenty of shootings in the city, but Boston Magazine reported 96 percent of the perpetrators in non-fatal shootings are never arrested. How about New York? There were 998 shootings in 2016. Fort Lauderdale? Mass shooting at the airport in January, 2017. San Francisco? Plenty of shootings.

In fact, all major American cities have gun-related deaths every year and many of the smaller cities do, too. All kinds of creative gun control efforts have been made in many of these cities. Sometimes it’s a law, sometimes it’s a buy-back, and sometimes it’s just absurd. But, no matter what has ever been tried, gun-related deaths continue.

Despite a few hints of sarcasm and dark humor here, I do hang my head in sadness when it comes to gun control. I wish that I could tell you that my life in Bangkok is better with very few guns in the city, but now I have to watch out for bombs.

I wish that I could tell you that gun control worked in England, but there you have to watch out for acid. I wish that I could tell you that I was safe in the Middle East, but there you have to watch out for, well, pretty much everything. I wish that I could tell you that gun control worked in Japan, but there you might have to watch out for poison gas, knives, or maybe even an errant sword. I wish that I could tell you that gun control worked in China, but there you have to watch out for mass stabbings.

I also wish that I could tell you that gun control brought about more civil governments in most of the countries that we’ve spoken of, but with the notable exception of Japan — a highly insular island nation — I have to say that many of the governments have become more oppressive in countries that have gun control, because they know that the people will struggle to rise up if they are unarmed.

Each of the countries that I’ve ticked off is a unique nation state. Each has a unique culture and unique history. But, no matter which country or region it is, gun control has failed to prevent bad actors from doing horrific things.

At its worst, gun control fails to keep guns out of the hands of the bad guys. At its best, gun control may keep the guns out of the hands of the bad guys, but then they just resort to acid, knives, cars, trucks, roofs, windows or any other number of horrifying means.

So, what can America do to address its mass shooting epidemic? First, America needs to have a frank conversation with Hollywood about the gratuitous violence that routinely sweeps the silver screen. Today’s youth are exposed to a massive number of ever more realistic shooting scenes, and that needs to change.

Second, America’s leaders need to have a frank discussion with video game manufacturers as to the gratuitous level of violence and shootings in ever more realistic video games. Finally, Americans need to understand that mass shootings are a symptom of a cultural problem, not of the freedom to own a gun. If anything, Americans should be discussing prevalence of gratuitous violence in the culture, not how to implement stricter gun control laws. The country needs to stop its moral decay and return to a focus on well-functioning nuclear families.

In conclusion, I really do wish that gun control could work to resolve today’s terrorist bombings and other mass-killings. Sadly though, in this age, directions to create all kinds of deadly low-tech weapons of mass destruction are readily available on the internet. In the end, no matter where in the world I have been, gun control has not only failed to solve the problem of violence, but has also often created a so-called cure that sometimes turns out to be worse than the disease.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/02/21/gun-control-across-world-leads-acid-knifings-bombings/,2018-02-21
I Bought A Military Rifle When I Was Nine. There Were No Mass Shootings,"In 1953, when I was a nine-year-old growing up in Georgia, I saw an ad in the back of a magazine by Golden State Arms, a mail-order firearms dealer in California. It announced the sale of surplus Russian Mosin-Nagant 7.62 mm bolt-action rifles with 50 rounds of ammunition for just $9.99 each.

Wow! The rifle shown in the tiny ad looked cool, and the price was right. So, after robbing my piggy bank and without parental consultation, I sent a postal money order to California and waited.

A month later, a Railway Express driver appeared at our front door with a long narrow box. I hadn’t known that the Mosin-Nagant was more than 48 inches long. So I immediately confronted a tactical problem. The package was almost longer than I was tall, and it had arrived on a Saturday when my father was home. My hastily improvised plan was to sneak my new rifle into the basement and figure things out from there.

I wrestled the package through the living room and dining room. The door leading to the basement stairs was within reach. The plan was working!

But then, my father appeared out of nowhere and fixed me with a cold gaze.

“Son, what have you got there?”

“Nothing, sir.” For some reason, he didn’t seem convinced.

“Well, then,” he replied, “let’s open up that package and see what nothing looks like.”

Deflated, I watched as he withdrew my new rifle and a flimsy cardboard box containing 50 rounds of ammunition. Hefting the rifle, he expertly worked the bolt back and forth and pulled the trigger. He wasn’t a big gun owner, but he knew firearms and kept a .22 rifle for home defense. Then he removed the bolt and handed me the rifle.

“Here you go. Have fun.”

“But, daddy, the gun won’t shoot without the bolt!” I protested.

“My,” he smiled benignly, “you’re such a bright little fellow. Now get along.”

That was my introduction to gun control.

This Is What a Healthy Gun Culture Looks Like

Even though my Mosin-Nagant never fired a round, plenty of other working firearms were readily available to the boys in our neighborhood. Along with knives, homemade explosives, fireworks, chemistry sets, full-contact football without pads, bicycles without helmets, fist fights, and so on, we occupied ourselves with daily activities that would today result in our parents’ arrest by the child-rearing experts from Children and Youth Services.

Somehow we managed to reach adulthood pretty much unscathed. As for all those readily available firearms, we used them for plinking, target practice, hunting, and competitive shooting. In those long-ago days, this was considered normal.

In adolescence, some of us joined our high school rifle teams. Boys and girls participated, and the schools provided the guns and ammunition. Also, without school interference, any number of my friends owned revolvers and rapid-firing semi-automatic pistols that were kept in their cars or hidden in their book bags. In short, there were numerous firearms on school grounds every day.

Guess what? There were no school shootings. No movie theater massacres. No mass casualties caused by deranged and angry teenagers. But how could this be?

Higher Regulations Coincided with More Mass Shootings

Gun control advocates claim that the difference between then and now is the availability of semi-automatic rifles and handguns with high-capacity magazines. While it’s true that AR-15s and Glocks didn’t exist back then, it is equally true that the firearms we had were fully capable of quickly inflicting devastating, large-scale death and injury.

Today gun control advocates have arranged to take a group of shell-shocked teenage survivors of the Parkland High School shooting on a road show to the Florida state capital where, according to one young man, “We will plead with the legislators for our lives.” Putting aside the exploitation of these young people, one is moved to ask just what the road show managers and these traumatized children expect the lawmakers to do.

In stark contrast to the days when a nine-year-old could buy a firearm through the mail, there exist today layer after layer of laws and regulations restricting the sale and possession of firearms. All of these legislative and administrative measures were putatively enacted to promote public safety by keeping guns out of the wrong hands.

So now that we have gone from a time when the sale and possession of guns were virtually unregulated and there were no school shootings, to a time when such shootings and other random atrocities regularly occur despite the existence of complex legal restrictions on gun ownership, it seems fair to ask a key question. Is more gun control really an answer to the problem?

So What Changed in the Last 60 Years?

Contrary to the usual gun control talking points, the basic killing potential of firearms hasn’t changed over the years. For example, in 1966, Charles Whitman, the so-called “Texas Tower Sniper,” used a low-capacity bolt-action rifle to kill 14 people and wound 31 others before he was killed by the police. This was the first widely publicized mass civilian casualty event, and it sent shockwaves throughout the country.

Despite the tremendous publicity, Whitman’s insane act spawned no copycats. It wasn’t until 1999 that the Columbine High School shooting started the series of regular albeit infrequent school killings. But why now are children slaughtering other children in our schools?

Could it be the widespread breakdown of the family? A number of the school shooters came from broken homes with no stability or meaningful parenting. Are such children particularly susceptible to being desensitized to death and carnage by the violence-pandering entertainment industry?

The amount and graphic nature of violence in homicidal-themed video games, movies, television, and music lyrics have increased to previously unimaginable levels. While this has resulted in huge profits for the entertainment industry, what is the effect of this new pornography of violence on our children, especially on those without countervailing parental guidance?

What about the number of children being medicated with psychotropic drugs? These medications come with warnings about possible side effects such as suicidal ideation, abnormal urges, and depression. Could these very profitable drugs be part of the problem?

What about the publicity given to the shooters? Nonstop coverage of school shootings and their horrendous aftermaths may be good for ratings and circulation, but should the news media be in the business of making a profit by inspiring and motivating potential copycat killers?

The Real Special Interests Lawmakers Need to Confront

The gun control advocates say enough is enough and that something must be done. I agree. But, given its history of failure, it is apparent that the answer lies not in passing yet another useless restriction on firearms. It is time to face up to the fact that the problem is deep-seated, complex, and requires a societal examination of conscience.

Thanks to the multi-million-dollar entertainment industry, we are marinating our children’s brains in a toxic brew of graphic death and violence. Thanks to the pharmaceutical industry, too many of those children are being inappropriately dosed with drugs that impair their ability to rationally respond to life’s challenges. Both industries control vast fortunes with which they can purchase influence in Congress and state legislatures. They command battalions of lobbyists and experts who stand ready to defend their interests and to point the finger of blame elsewhere.

All of this raises this question: are our elected representatives willing to pull back the curtain and confront these powerful interests? Will they dare ask the news media, the entertainment industry, and the pharmaceutical manufacturers the questions posed here? Will they do so at the risk of losing political and monetary support provided by these interests?

Or will they pursue the politically safer alternative of furthering the demonstrably ineffectual non-solution of more gun control?

"Trump’s Proposed Bump Stock Ban Is Either Lawless, Stupid, Or Both","Gun owners know firearm laws. We must. The slightest slip-up can result in serious consequences. This is why gun owners’ eyes roll when firearm ignoramuses talk about gun policy. It doesn’t take long to tell whether a gun control bill was written by someone who understands firearm laws and regulations.

One of the most basic rules that law-abiding gun owners must follow is “don’t turn your gun into a machine gun.” The consequences for breaking this rule are serious.

To help make sure innocent people don’t accidentally become felons, a “machine gun” has a very simple definition: when you pull the trigger, more than one bullet is fired. If you cannot make your gun fire multiple bullets with a single trigger pull, then you don’t have a machine gun.

When I read President Donald Trump’s memo to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, my eyes rolled before I even made it past the memo’s subject line: “Application of the Definition of Machinegun to ‘Bump Fire’ Stocks and Other Similar Devices”

The real eye-rolling really kicked in a little further down the page: “Today, I am directing the Department of Justice to dedicate all available resources to complete the review of the comments received, and, as expeditiously as possible, to propose for notice and comment a rule banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns.”

That is already illegal. It is illegal for anyone without the proper permits and licenses to modify their semi-automatic weapon to fire multiple bullets with a single trigger pull.

I own multiple bump stocks. One of them I 3D printed myself, just to prove that modern technology makes banning them pointless. I did not manufacture a machine gun. I manufactured a stock that moves freely along a rifle’s buffer tube.

The buffer tube is the piece of aluminum that an AR-15’s stock attaches to. The buffer tube has deliberately drilled holes that allow a shooter to collapse their butt stock to change the rifle’s length of pull. That allows for an AR-15’s stock to be pinned into place, either permanently in states with assault weapon bans or temporarily in the case of collapsible stocks.

A bump fire stock, at its core, is nothing but a thumbhole stock (where the pistol grip and stock are one piece) that is not pinned in place on a rifle’s buffer tube. The bump fire stock moves forward and backward on the buffer tube as the rifle is fired, allowing the shooter to harness the rifle’s recoil to reset the trigger faster than their trigger finger muscles could on their own.

A bump stock does not change the mechanics of the rifle in any way, shape, or form. It does not turn a semi-automatic rifle into a machine gun. Trump’s memo’s instructions cannot be applied to bump stocks without radically redefining the definition of a machine gun. The only way the ATF can ban bump stocks is if they change the definition of a machine gun to include rifles that fire just one bullet per trigger pull.

This is impossible to do by executive fiat. The definition of a machine gun was codified into law by Congress in the National Firearms Act of 1934. “The term ‘machine gun’ means any weapon which shoots, or is designed to shoot, automatically or semiautomatically, more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.”

I hate slippery slope arguments, but this is a slippery slope. A machine gun is easily defined: one trigger pull results in multiple bullets being fired. Defining it any other way would not only be an abuse of power — the executive cannot rewrite a statute — but it would put an entire class of legally owned firearms in the crosshairs. For years, gun control advocates have tried to conflate semi-automatic and automatic firearms. They have tried desperately to convince an uninterested public that AR-15s are just as dangerous and even the same thing as automatic firearms.

This proposed regulation would complete that process. It buys into the gun control talking point that AR-15s are weapons of war. If this is enacted, semi-automatic rifles will be on the chopping block. Not today, not next year, but eventually. How can Americans be trusted with owning something that is just one pulled stock pin away from becoming a machine gun?

It is possible to bump fire a semi-automatic rifle using your belt loop. You can also bump fire a standard AR-15 by holding the stock a small distance away from your shoulder and allowing the recoil to push the rifle backwards. Heck, if you don’t have a belt loop, you can bump fire a rifle by holding it at your hip and pulling the trigger with your thumb. Are belt loops “machine guns?” Are thumbs “machine guns?” Are the air molecules between the rifle and your shoulder “machine guns?”

Why are we even having to ask these absurd questions when we have a Republican president who has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association?

Why Americans Have A Right To Own Guns Even If It Makes Us Less Safe,"Many on both sides of the gun debate are under the impression that the best way to settle it is by weighing outcomes in the context of a cost-benefit analysis. As a result, both sides constantly squabble over the findings of this-or-that empirical study in this-or-that country. Those who support gun ownership cite studies supporting their side, while gun control supporters cite studies purporting to show the opposite.

While I happen to think that the best evidence suggests that gun ownership does not increase crime, the reality is this way of thinking about the gun debate is fundamentally mistaken. What matters is not the risk (or lack thereof) that guns pose to society, but simply whether guns are a reasonable means of self-defense. This isn’t to say that empirical findings aren’t important, but rather that studies detailing the positive or negative effects of gun ownership or right-to-carry laws aren’t relevant to what’s at stake in the gun debate.

Consider this: your right to life isn’t dependent on whether respecting your life would yield the best set of consequences. It is absolute and unrelenting, even if it would be more beneficial to others if your right were violated. It would be wrong for me to override your right to life in order harvest your organs to save five people, even if in doing so I produce a more beneficial outcome.

Your life has basic dignity that cannot be defeated in the name of social utility. It isn’t dependent on the outcome of a cost-benefit analysis. The same goes for other rights that are derived from the right to life. For example, it would be wrong to rape someone even if doing so would save ten lives. Rights function as moral “trump cards” that override appeals to utility.

We can think of the right of self-defense in similar terms. Since our right to life cannot be overridden in the name of social utility, and since the goal of self-defense is to protect one’s life, it stands to reason that our right to self-defense also cannot be overridden in the name of social utility. Like our right to life, our right to defend ourselves is a basic dignity that can’t be defeated just because it might produce a net benefit. We don’t run a cost-benefit analysis before we allow individuals to defend themselves.

Now, possession of a right entails the possession of a corresponding right to pursue, exercise, or obtain that which you have a right to. A right would not be a right if it did not also provide its bearer with some means to obtain that to which he is entitled. So, if we have the right to self-defense, we also have the right to the means of our defense. In other words, we have a right to bear arms. And like the right to life and right of self-defense from which it is derived, the right to bear arms isn’t subject to a cost-benefit analysis.

Since the goal of the right to bear arms is to facilitate effective self-defense, the pertinent question we must ask in determining what falls under this right is whether it qualifies as a reasonable means of self-defense. Whether some weapon increases or decreases average safety is irrelevant to its effectiveness as a self-defense tool. Many on both sides of the gun debate miss this crucial point. Since guns are valued precisely for their self-defense benefits, the debate over gun ownership centers on self-defense. And on that point, the key question here isn’t whether guns increase or decrease average safety, but about whether guns are in fact a reasonable means of self-defense.

Now a reasonable means of self-defense is one that is able to reliably, effectively, and practically deliver a proportionate amount of force in response to a threat of harm. Guns clearly satisfy this description. They do not require great skill to handle and can be effectively used by all sorts of individuals to equalize disparities that are commonly exploited in violent crimes. This isn’t just armchair theorizing either: there is overwhelming agreement within the empirical literature that guns are extremely effective in self-defense. Consider the following:

Out of eight different forms of robbery resistance, “victim gun use was the resistance strategy most strongly and consistently associated with successful outcomes for robbery victims.”

Men and women who resisted with a gun were less likely to be injured or lose property than those who resisted using some other means or who did not resist at all. In the case of women, “having a gun really does result in equalizing a woman with a man.”

Out of sixteen different forms of victim self-protection, “a variety of mostly forceful tactics, including resistance with a gun, appeared to have the strongest effects in reducing the risk of injury.”

Defensive gun use “is most often effective at helping the victim rather than hurting them.”

Resistance with a gun decreased the odds of robbery and rape completion by 93 percent and 91 percent, respectively.

Taking stock of these points, the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council concluded in a 2013 review of the literature that “studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was ‘used’ by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies.”

When it comes to the use of studies and statistics, both sides tend to focus on the impact of gun ownership and right-to-carry laws on violence. These are certainly interesting issues, but they’re not actually relevant to the merits of gun ownership for self-defense. As I said earlier, the rights to life and self-defense are not dependent on whether respecting them would yield the best set of overall consequences. They are basic dignities that are not subject to cost-benefit analyses.

So even if we were to grant the claim that gun ownership decreases average safety, it wouldn’t follow that restrictive gun control measures would be justified, precisely because the gun control debate isn’t about average safety. Rather, the kinds of studies we should pay attention to are those dealing with the defensive efficacy of guns when used in self-defense. And on that question, there is no debate. One hardly even needs a study to confirm the seemingly common sense claim that guns do a good job of stopping an attack. For that reason, restrictive gun control laws violate the right of self-defense.

"Google Shopping Bans 'Gun' Searches, Not Machetes, Rocket Launchers","On Twitter early this morning, Ryan Fitz flagged something weird: Google Shopping returns no results for any search containing the word “gun.”

Nothing with ""gun"" in it gets any Google Shopping results, not even if part of another unrelated word. Try it. pic.twitter.com/rUc87l3fkD — Ryan Fitz (@CatholicFitz) February 27, 2018

https://twitter.com/eric_xiansen/status/968380767532470273

After some of my own searching, I found that Google Shopping would return results for search terms in which “gun” is a longer part of a word, such as “Gunsmoke” and “The Last Gunslinger.” But absolutely nothing for any search containing “gun.” Not even toy and recreational guns such as Airsoft.

Included in this “gun” term whiteout are books, artists, movies, and songs with “gun” in the title, such as “Annie, Get Your Gun.”



Also blocked: “The Gun Book for Girls.”



Guns ‘n Roses? Blocked.



Tom Cruise’s smash hit “Top Gun”? No can see.

Also blocked: “The Guns of August,” a Pulitzer Prize-winning 2004 history of World War I.



“The Guns of Navarone” is a novel that has been made into a classic movie. Both blocked.



What isn’t blocked, however, are plenty of other “instruments of war.” Such as battle axes, hand grenades, and rocket launchers.

Also not blocked from Google Shopping searches are more, um, creative weapons such as an assassin’s blade, crossbow, compound bow, and machete.



Lastly, I’m told that these two items below are the main ingredients for a pipe bomb. No, I really don’t know anything about that, and I’m not doing any searches on it because I don’t want the FBI at my door. Guys, I’m a mom with little kids, I have no wish to harm anyone. Okay? Thanks.

At any rate, those reported ingredients are freely available on Google Shopping. Oh, by the way, “smokeless powder” is another word for “gunpowder.”

Notice not just the disparities here in the wide availability of instruments of suffering Google Shopping makes available, but also that it’s illegal to buy a gun online unless you have it shipped to a licensed firearms dealer, who must carry out legal background check procedures before you’re allowed to pick it up. So it’s unclear what Google’s aims are here in banning searches for glue guns, Airsoft, paintball, and the like. Unless they really can’t tell the difference between Airsoft and a real gun, or don’t think the difference matters.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/02/27/google-shopping-shows-no-results-gun-can-buy-machetes-crossbows-pipe-bomb-materials/,2018-02-27
I Bought My First Gun Because Of The CNN Town Hall,"After ten minutes of CNN’s town hall “debate” I had already searched for gun safes, the closest firearms dealer near me, classes on gun safety, and an NRA membership. Whether that’s a sign the event was a rousing success or terrible failure depends on who you ask. But whenever the left talks about gun control, significant numbers of people who see value in the Second Amendment run out and purchase a gun.

Normally, that wouldn’t include me. But this time was different. Here’s why.

Everyone watched the same event. Yet, depending on the political perspective it was with horror or glee. The town hall was one long string of thinly veiled accusations against people who had nothing to do with a heinous crime that was committed a week earlier. It was not really a debate or discussion, but a kangaroo court, where the audience held Americans responsible for the actions of an evil individual they had nothing to do with. The behavior of the children and parents at the event, while understandable, was reprehensible. Trauma, no matter how real, is never an excuse for treating other people with contempt.

Emotions aren’t what led me to buy a firearm. That decision was driven by the idea driving the “discussion” at the town hall, that security is more important than liberty.

Liberty is a state of being free from oppression imposed by an authority, but it requires individuals to take responsibility over their own lives. Responsibility is something of a burden, a difficult aspect of liberty conservatives sometimes avoid talking about. Liberty grants people the power to choose and chart a path, but that means that each individual is responsible for their actions, thoughts, and even their own security. Certainly, individuals grant some select members authority to protect in an effort to enhance safety for the whole community, but the responsibility for each person’s safety still rests with that individual.

The left would argue we can have security without consequences of oppression or loss of liberty, that we can live in a state free from danger. But that’s a false hope — we are never truly free from danger. The real security they promise is freedom from responsibility, or the ability to transfer responsibility to a select group of people who can be held accountable when things go wrong. They promise security for all in exchange for a little more, and eventually a lot more, power.

America is seeing this happen everywhere. Give up speech and no longer feel bad for offending others. Give up weapons and the government will protect you. Give up the ability to choose health care and the government will provide it for you. The tradeoff in each of these cases is the promise of some benefit in exchange for a loss of freedom in governing your own life.

The left wants the government to do more than secure our inalienable rights. Liberals want the government to secure things like economic security and free health care and a “proper” minimum wage. They want the government to guarantee emotional security, so girls are told they cannot tell a boy no to a dance. They want enforced psychological security, so people are forced to conform their speech so that liberals don’t have to suffer the hardship of words and labels they disagree with. And most fundamentally, they want the government to shield them from the burden of personal responsibility.

Opposition between liberals and conservatives, in the gun control debate and otherwise, is about placement of power. Liberty places power with individual, which means it places responsibility with the individual. Security places power within a limited amount of people’s hands and thus responsibility away from the individual. They are diametrically opposed, because they are inherently contradictory.

Certainly responsibility is a heavy burden, but it elevates humanity. To choose is to express free will. Yes, failure may be a result, but simply look at the flow of humanity toward freedom. How many people have attempted to “escape” America to Communism? How many people fled away Communism? Seeing a mob of people celebrating baseless and morally reprehensible claims at CNN’s town hall was frightening. More than that, as the evidence continues to mount over the failure of law enforcement in handling the Parkland shooter, it will only heighten the truth that a promise of security from the government doesn’t actually guarantee safety.

The town hall was a display of tyranny. For tyranny has never come from a single person, but rather from a mob cheering for the destruction of liberty and rights from those with whom they disagree.

So I bought a gun.

Rubio's Approval Rating Hits All-Time Low After CNN Town Hall,"Republican Sen. Marco Rubio is at an all-time low with Florida voters following his participation in CNN’s televised town hall with Parkland shooting survivors, while Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who chose not to attend, is at an all-time high.

Both Republicans have backed gun control measures in the wake of the shooting that left 17 students and staff dead. But a Quinnipiac poll conducted a few days after CNN’s town hall suggests Scott made the right call not to participate in the heated event. Rubio’s approval rating hit an all-time low, while Scott’s approval rating hit an all-time high.

Scott is considering challenging Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson for his Senate seat in the 2018 midterm election. The governor has a seven-year history of negative approval ratings, but won approval from 49 percent of voters in the latest poll. That’s by far his highest rating ever.

Rubio, on the other hand, is at an all-time low, with an approval rating of just 38 percent. That’s down sharply from his all-time high of nearly 60 percent in August 2015, and down 8 points from the last Quinnipiac poll in July 2016.

The junior senator has an A+ rating with the National Rifle Association (NRA), but backed several gun control measures during the town hall, including changing the system for background checks and banning bump stocks, as well as raising the legal age to buy a rifle from 18 to 21. He also said he does not support arming teachers, a proposal backed by President Donald Trump that Republicans are kicking around.

As the only Republican at the event, Rubio was the focus of many anti-gun questions. The audience erupted into applause when one student asked whether he would promise to refuse future donations from the NRA, and he was booed when he declined. Nevertheless, he took a decidedly softer tone on gun control at the event, signaling a willingness to rethink his stance.

While he snubbed the town hall, Scott has also softened his tone on gun control following the shooting. He is proposing to raise the purchasing age to 21, and opposes the Republican idea of arming some teachers in schools.

The poll found Nelson with a small lead over Scott in a potential Senate matchup, with 46 percent of support to Scott’s 42 percent. Scott has indicated he’s interested in a Senate run. Term limits prevent him from running again for governor.

Quinnipiac surveyed registered voters from Feb. 23-26. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 points.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/02/28/rubios-approval-rating-hits-all-time-low-after-cnn-town-hall/,2018-02-28
4 Things We Can All Do To Stop The Next Shooting,"“Did you see that story on the news today?” my dad asked when I was about 11 years old. “A man caught his wife and kids trying to leave him. He came home, and they were packing up their things. He went in the house and got his gun. First, he shot the kids, then he shot the wife, and then he shot himself. They all died. You won’t ever leave me, will you?”

This was how my dad ensured my silence and submission. And my dad knew how to use his gun too. He proved that when he shot a neighbor kid’s dog right in front of me, from thirty feet away, just for the fun of it. I can still hear the dog’s yowls. They weren’t yelps, like you’d expect from a dog. They were screeches of pain and terror.

About a decade later, my dad once again threatened to murder my entire family. He didn’t threaten frequently, but I can recall a handful of occasions. He usually posed the threats as a joke or cloaked them in the context of a news story. This time, I was engaged to be married. I feared that the stressor of losing control of me might be the straw that broke the demon’s back. I stole his gun. I hid it, unloaded and wrapped in a towel, in a box of chintzy craft supplies, knitting, and fashion accessories I’d accrued as a teenager. It was the last place he’d look.

I left the ammo in his dresser drawer. It was my way of mocking him, as if to say, “I’ve taken your power, but left the bullets so you can play marbles with them.”

I never told the police about my dad’s abuse; his sexual perversion, murderous threats, or violent assaults. I loved my dad. I feared my dad. I still do. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I also didn’t want to risk being stuck in the same house with him if the police failed to arrest him. As a survivor of 20 years of domestic violence, I fully support my right as a mother to arm and defend myself should anyone ever threaten me or my family again.

My dad is not a school shooter. As far as I’m aware, he’s never shot anyone, although there is a family story that he once stabbed his sister in the hand. Nevertheless, he could have become a shooter and I didn’t tell a soul. I am certain that he is just one among thousands of violent offenders who slip under the radar because no one ever reports them. I suspect, like me, most don’t report because they both love and fear their abuser. No one wants to believe that their dad, brother, son, mother, daughter, or friend, could be the next monster on the five o’clock news.

Peter Langman, Ph.D., is a respected authority on mass shooters, particularly youth and school shooters. He has conducted extensive research and published works regarding the psychology of adolescent murderers. In a harrowing and fascinating study, “Rampage Shooters: A Typology,” Langman divides school shooters into three basic categories: Traumatized, Psychotic, and Psychopathic.

Traumatized Shooters come from dysfunctional families. Each of these shooters in his study experienced physical or sexual abuse. They all had at least one parent who abused drugs or alcohol or who had a criminal history. “Among the traumatized shooters … all three had father-figures who engaged in criminal behavior involving the misuse of firearms,” notes Langman in his report. “In two of these cases, the fathers engaged in armed stand-offs with police.”

Psychotic Shooters come from intact families with no history of abuse, parental addiction, or incarceration. They exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia or a schizotypal personality disorder such as delusional paranoia, delusions of grandeur, and auditory hallucinations. “The psychotic shooters were misfits in their own families,” Langman states, “and the differences between them and their siblings were obvious to their parents and teachers.”

Psychopathic Shooters also tend to come from intact families with no significant dysfunction. These shooters exhibit narcissism, sadistic behavior, little to no empathy, and a lack of conscience. Langman notes that, “the psychopathic shooters successfully recruited followers to join them in their attacks … Thus, the presence of peer support may have contributed to their decision to commit a school shooting.”

Langman’s career has involved researching manifold cases, but this specific paper focuses on 10 school shooters who were all teenagers, with the exception of one, who was 23. The youngest was only 11. Together, these young shooters murdered 69 people and injured 92 between 1997 and 2007.

For any person, abused or not, to progress to a state in which they are capable of such profound cruelty, requires a process of moral and emotional deterioration which would be marked by increasingly aberrant behavior and attitudes. How did people miss the red flags that preceded these heinous crimes? How does a person grow violently abusive without someone noticing or intervening? How can a teenager manifest schizophrenic or sociopathic behaviors, yet no one sees?

Based on my experience with an abusive dad, I would suggest to you that many people saw.

In the case of the Parkland school shooter, there were 23 police reports warning the Broward County Sheriff’s Department that he was a dangerous threat. These reports include accounts of him hitting his adoptive mother, throwing her against a wall, fighting with his brother, exhibiting suicidal behavior, and threatening to shoot up the school on social media. There were several occasions where it seems he should have been hospitalized or arrested, but nothing was done. At one point, he called the police to tell them that he was deeply troubled. One woman even reported him to the FBI, stating that he was “going to explode,” and her worry about him “getting into a school and just shooting the place up.”

Stories are emerging of an angry and disturbed teen who held a gun to the head of his mother and brother; who assaulted several people, including the son of Roxanne Deschamps, the woman who took care of him and his brother following the death of their adoptive mother in November, 2017. In a chilling 911 call, Deschamps warned police that she believed he might shoot her and her family. Nevertheless, the police did not intervene. Notes were taken, reports were logged, but no apparent effort was made to provide for his mental health or the safety of those around him.

This is every abuse victim’s worst fear: That they’ll report abuse, but the police will do nothing, and they’ll be left alone with an abuser who knows that they reported them. Unfortunately, this seems to be exactly what happened in Florida. Broward County Sheriff’s Department has demonstrated to the nation that being disbelieved or abandoned by law enforcement is a reasonable fear. Abuse reports across the U.S. will now likely decrease as gun purchases for self-defense skyrocket.

While the shooter is an abuser, it’s safe to say he falls under Langman’s “traumatized” category, if not others. His biological parents died, he was adopted, and then his adoptive parents died. According to police reports, he has a history of being bullied, bullying others, and fighting. Whether he suffers a schizotypal illness or psychopathic dysfunction is something for his doctors to decide. While reports assert he was diagnosed with disorders such as ADHD and OCD, these are not the type of diagnosis that would or should ever raise red flags. On the other hand, his suicidal behavior and murderous threats should have warranted medical evaluation.

But this isn’t the first time that school shooters have been enabled by neglectful family, friends, educators, physicians, or law enforcement officers. The following is a list of school shooters, most of whom were not included in Langman’s paper.

A 23-year-old killed 32 people and wounded 17 others at Virginia Tech in 2007 using two semi-automatic pistols. An investigative panel later criticized educators and medical professionals who failed to notice his deteriorating mental health. It also noted gaps in Virginia’s mental health system and gun laws.

In 2005, a teenager murdered nine people, including his grandfather, before committing suicide at Red Lake Senior High School in Minnesota. The shooter was born into a broken home. His mother was an alcoholic who abused him. His father had a criminal history and committed suicide by shooting himself during a police standoff.

A six-year-old brought a gun to Buell Elementary School in 2000 and killed his classmate, Kayla Rolland. “I don’t like you,” he told her before he shot her dead. The boy’s father was in prison for dealing cocaine. He had been living with his abusive, drug addicted mother before moving into his uncle’s crack house. Just a few weeks before he murdered Rolland, the boy had gotten into trouble at school for bullying and hitting other students, including for stabbing one little girl with a pencil.

Another teenager killed two and injured 13 at Santana High School in California in 2001. He had allegedly been bullied and abused by classmates. On two occasions he told people about his plan to “pull a Columbine,” but no one ever reported his threats to police.

In 2003, a teenager murdered 15-year-old Seth Bartell and 17-year-old Aaron Rollins. During his trial, three mental health experts diagnosed him with schizophrenia, while others diagnosed major depression and emerging personality disorder. The families of the victims later sued the school district, the principal, and the shooter’s family, alleging that they knew what he was planning during the days preceding his crimes. The lawsuit was settled out of court for $200,000.

Yet another teenager murdered three of his fellow students and seriously injured two others in 2012 at Chardon High School in Ohio. He had a criminal history including domestic violence and disorderly conduct, and posted death threats on social media accounts prior to the shooting.

Also in 2012, a 20-year-old murdered 20 children between six and seven years of age at Sandy Hook elementary school. The shooter had been diagnosed with multiple mental health issues. A report from the Office of the Child Advocate noted his “severe and deteriorating internalized mental health problems … combined with an atypical preoccupation with violence… [and] access to deadly weapons … proved a recipe for mass murder.”

“It is fair to surmise that, had Lanza’s mental illness been adequately treated in the last years of his life, one predisposing factor to the tragedy of Sandy Hook might have been mitigated,” the report concluded.

Each and every one of these perpetrators manifested traumatized, psychotic, or psychopathic behavior in the weeks, months, and years leading up to their crimes. And each one was surrounded by people who failed to report or intervene when they witnessed disturbing red flags. Whether the people surrounding them were parents who were negligent, absent, or abusive; teachers, counselors, and school officials who ignored warning signs; law enforcement who failed to press charges or follow up on reports; or bystanders who failed to notice or report troubling behavior and threats, the people who surrounded these shooters enabled tragedy by either neglecting to speak or failing to act.

The Parkland shooter’s friends and acquaintances had the courage to report him to the authorities. They recognized the danger and they did exactly what they should have done. The fact that law enforcement failed them so miserably is something that will haunt every abuse victim who is thinking about picking up the phone. The damage that the FBI and Broward County Sheriff’s Office have done to the psyche of crime witnesses and victims across the nation through this catastrophic lapse is incalculable.

The words of Sheriff Israel and his repeated denial of blame for the inaction of his department, typifies an unfortunate culture of irresponsibility. “Deputies make mistakes. Police officers make mistakes. We all make mistakes,” Israel told Jake Tapper on CNN. “But it’s not the responsibility of the general or the president, if you have a deserter … Jake, I can only take responsibility for what I knew about. I exercised my due diligence. I have given amazing leadership to this agency.”

How many times have we seen stories of teens eating Tide Pods, but instead of asking where their parents are, people blamed Tide for looking too much like candy? How many times have we seen people blaming television, video games, or social media for the bad behavior of children, rather than examining that child’s parental figures or educational environment?

Most people don’t want to intervene into the mess of another person’s life. Most of us are happy gossiping and gawking at celebrities, but don’t even know our next-door-neighbor’s name. Most of us, when we see evidence of familial or mental dysfunction, think, “Oh well. Somebody else will do something about it. It’s not my responsibility or place, and I’m sure everything will turn out fine.”

But too often, we see that everything does not turn out fine. If we want to stop the next school shooter, there are a few practical things we must do.

1. Foster a culture that of emotional investment in relationships

We must foster a culture where people are aware and involved in each other’s lives. We must branch beyond Facebook and Twitter and talk to friends face to face. When we’re involved with each other on a personal level, we’re more likely to notice when things aren’t going well. We’ll see the black eye, the distracted stare, and hear the private worries of a stressed mind. People facing struggles will be more likely and better able to seek help, and children being neglected will be less likely to fall through the cracks. This is one area where small family-oriented churches play a vital role in keeping our culture emotionally healthy and physically safe.

2. Reestablish and reinforce a healthy family ideal

A large percentage of the violence in America would vanish within a decade if we focused on eliminating child abuse, child neglect, and domestic violence. Broken homes lead to broken communities, broken culture, and a broken nation. If we heal the family, we can fix the future. A large percentage of school shooters and violent criminals in general, report having had dysfunctional childhoods.

3. Diligently prosecute criminals

We must enforce existing laws that combat crimes, such as child abuse laws and the unlawful possession of guns. With few exceptions, it is illegal for a person convicted of a felony (such as domestic violence or drug possession) to purchase a gun. If criminals are prosecuted for their crimes, and entered into the national database, it will become much more difficult for them to acquire guns. The recent school shooting in Parkland could possibly have been averted had the shooter been prosecuted for domestic violence or assault. Had he been convicted, he would never have been able to purchase a gun.

4. Take care of the weak and the sick

We must make sure that people suffering from mental illness and emotional challenges receive the care they need. When a teenager calls the police to tell them he’s disturbed, that teenager should never be ignored. We must maintain a system that efficiently and comprehensively addresses the needs of people exhibiting depressive, delusional, psychotic, or psychopathic behavior. This is vital for their own happiness and health, as well as for the safety of our communities.

There is no question that every criminal owns complete responsibility for his or her actions. However, we as a society must also take responsibility for protecting each other, supporting one another, and providing for the very weakest and underserved among us. Our boys and girls deserve safe schools. Our kids deserve whole families. Our young adults deserve mental health care. Our teenagers deserve our love. We must promote a culture that fosters strong families, reinforces healthy marriages, nurtures tightly knit communities, encourages involvement in church and other familial organizations, treats individuals as dignified and valuable, and supports stay-at-home parenting and involved moms and dads.

We need to get back to the basics and love our neighbor. That is how we stop the next school shooter.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/01/4-things-learned-abusive-father-can-stop-next-shooting/,2018-03-01
VIDEO: Mary Katharine Slams Media Coverage Of Parkland Students,"In a segment on CNN’s “Inside Politics” that aired Wednesday afternoon, Federalist senior writer Mary Katharine Ham slammed the 24/7 media coverage of the Parkland survivors pushing for increased gun control while ignoring students who have other opinions.

“We also have had 24/7 coverage of these students who have asked for those things,” Ham said, of students many news outlets have featured prominently for their pro-gun control stance. “And not nearly as much coverage of those students who have other thoughts on this. That is part of what is pushing this.”

Ham said the national conversation, driven by media coverage of the tragedy, has deluded people into thinking there will be a huge change on gun laws.

“A lot of people are being sold a bill of goods, that there’s going to be some giant national change,” Ham said. “There may be changes. I think the bump stock legislative fix as opposed to regulatory is something the NRA is not super fond of, but most people in Congress would be A-Okay with. Dick’s Sporting Goods, for instance, is getting a lot of credit for something it basically did after Sandy Hook. It’s the same decision basically announced again with 35 more stores.”

She explained the attention Dick’s Sporting Goods received for its policy change on gun sales is because gun control advocates didn’t pay attention to their policy until now.

“People who are in favor of gun control don’t follow these things as closely as people who are in favor of gun rights,” she continued. “So people who are in favor of gun rights knew that Dick’s Sporting Goods did this a long time ago. Many of them stopped shopping there as a result. So they were not allowed to make that fly with them. But that intensity problem is the problem that gun control advocates face every time. It may be evening up for the moment. The question is whether that is sustainable.”",https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/01/video-mary-katharine-slams-media-coverage-parkland-students/,2018-03-01
Why Dick’s Decision To Ban Some Rifles (Again) Might Backfire,"Dick’s Sporting Goods announced Wednesday the company will no longer sell assault-style weapons in response to the Parkland high school shooting in Florida, winning accolades from the media.

Maybe the higher-ups at Dick’s did have some kind of change of heart, perhaps after learning the gunman had purchased a shotgun in one of their stores (though he didn’t use it). The CEO also called for “common sense gun reform” this week. But a closer look at the decision indicates it was little more than cheap political posturing that could very well backfire.

After all, the store isn’t banning shotguns. And Dick’s previously suspended assault-style weapons sales in December 2012, after the Sandy Hook school shooting, ostensibly “out of respect for the victims and their families.” But in August 2013, Dick’s quietly returned to selling them in a spinoff chain called Field & Stream (no relation to the magazine). CEO Ed Stack had to pinky-swear on Good Morning America that Dick’s would stick by the ban this time.

Let’s put this into perspective. Dick’s grabbed applause from the anti-gun crowd by ridding most of its some 600 stores of assault-style weapons in 2012, while continuing to sell the guns in a few dozen stores. Now Dick’s is reaching back into the jar for another handful of praise, because the store is actually banning the weapons it claimed to have banned years ago.

As in 2012, Dick’s new announcement comes at a time when its stock is struggling. Over the past year, while the S&P 500 has risen by roughly 14.5 percent, Dick’s stock price has slid approximately 38 percent.

As Washington Free Beacon writer Stephen Gutowski noted, many gun owners began boycotting Dick’s after the first ban, so it might be the case the store doesn’t lose much (more) business over this new iteration.

Most gun owners I know already refused to buy from Dick's over their last AR-15 boycott. Others must still buy from them, though, so I don't know what kind of effect any of this will have. — Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) February 28, 2018

But the Field & Stream stores are largely located in areas where coming out against the right to bear arms is probably unpopular. And there have been rumblings on Facebook and Twitter from Second Amendment supporters about boycotting Dick’s, so it’s unclear what the impact will be.

Stack’s declaration that “we don’t want to be a part of this story” indicates that Dick’s hopes to benefit from the publicity among consumers who are uninterested in or hostile to firearms. The company may at least avoid the social media swarms and boycotts organized by left-wing organizations that are throwing their weight behind the current gun control campaign, regardless of whether the issue has been a central part of their mission.

Dick’s appears to be betting the move won’t lose the stores a ton of gun owners, and could win some favor among the anti-gun crowd. A Morning Consult poll conducted Feb. 23-25 might on the surface have offered companies like Dick’s some support for these types of decisions. More than 70 percent of Americans polled said it is important for companies to take a stance on social issues, and nearly 60 percent said it’s appropriate for companies to take part in the gun control debate.

But the poll also found significant increases in negative ratings for companies that cut ties with the NRA. Enterprise Rent-a-Car’s favorables dropped by approximately half, while a number of other major brands declined by approximately one-third. Only the lesser-known Simplisafe went essentially unscathed. Increased favorable opinions from Democrats were unable to arrest these substantial declines.

So, while it is plausible that Dick’s hopes to appeal to politically-engaged, generally left-leaning Millennials will work, it’s not clear the store will actually benefit. We have seen this sort of play recently from Patagonia. Again, it is unclear that these sorts of strategies work, as evidenced by ESPN’s rocky pursuit of cord-cutting youngsters through politicized programming.

The Morning Consult poll suggests that Millennials report having firearms in their households at roughly the same percentage as other age demos. Moreover, even in the immediate aftermath of a school shooting, Millennials said they were less interested in gun control than older age demographics.

Dick’s also may not have considered the law of unintended consequences. After Delta Airlines decided to end its affinity marketing campaign with the NRA, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle of Georgia and GOP lawmakers threatened to drop efforts to restore a lapsed $50 million tax break on jet fuel. That threat represents the latest turn in the growing controversy of large corporations attempting to use their economic power to coerce state and local governments into advancing a progressive political agenda, under the guise of “corporate social responsibility.”

Dick’s may have thought they could buy themselves some good publicity — or political relief — by deciding to stop selling so-called assault rifles … again. But this cheap move likely won’t bring them the sort of youth-oriented business they may have sought. And in the medium-term, the company could just as easily run afoul of politicians who decide to make them a punching bag for taking sides in cultural disputes against the wishes of their constituents.

NYMag: Don't Say ‘Gun Control' So We Don't Scare People With The Truth,"A piece in New York Magazine last weekend pressed the case for abandoning the term “gun control” in favor of the less frightening “gun reform.” Writer Benjamin Hart calls the former an “unhelpful phrase.” He says it “has long been the default for well-meaning citizens who want to curb the killings that are a fact of American life. But it’s well past time to retire it and come up with something more effective.”

Doing so is necessary, he says, because “Republicans have long understood the power of language more intuitively than Democrats … they have helped frame abortions as ‘pro-life,’ tarred Obamacare with talk of ‘death panels,’ transformed the estate tax into the ‘death tax,’ and so on. The NRA is equally adept at this trick – most famously with ‘Guns don’t kill people, people kill people.’”

Considering it was the Left that re-framed abortion as “choice” and “health insurance” as “health care,” and introduced the notion that we have to “pay for” tax cuts, this is extremely rich. But Hart does give credit where credit is due.

“It can be argued that the United States’ bedrock cultural individualism is the wellspring of the country’s history of innovation,” he concedes. “But it has also been a persistent obstacle to the kind of comfortable, regulated lifestyle that is the norm in many other developed nations.”

He deserves credit for this frankness, though it says volumes about the mindset of a readership that apparently doesn’t blink at something called a “comfortable, regulated lifestyle.” A certain sensitivity to such frank language is what is to be worked around, he suggests. “There is no need to alienate the many Americans who might be receptive to what is generally a popular cause, but who fear – rationally or not – that some of their rights will be stripped away.”

He recognizes that “guns are simply too embedded into the culture, too much a fabric of everyday life for too many people.” There have been moves to moderate the language, he says, quoting Mark Glaze, former director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, who after the Sandy Hook school shootings in 2012 told NPR, “We talk about gun violence prevention, because that’s what it is.”

It seems fair to question that formulation, though, since the vast majority of guns in America will never come close to being used in anything resembling violence. Mayors Against Illegal Guns later joined the gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety, which was recently criticized for pushing a very misleading count of school shootings. Glaze left the organization prior to this latest controversy.

It also seems fair to criticize efforts to make gun-control seem less alarming, as the long-term goal seems to remain the same. “Progress will be incremental, slow, and frustrating,” Hart says. This is exactly what worries gun-rights advocates, who are accustomed to hearing gun opponents say they only want “A,” only to turn around and find them passing “U” and going hard for “Z.”

After the previous round of gun control that followed the assassinations and high crime rates of the 1960s, I had to log my driver’s license with the state to buy a box of .22 shells to hunt squirrels with. You couldn’t get a carry permit without explaining in considerable detail to the superintendent of the state police why you thought you needed it. This was in the gun-friendly state of Indiana. In other jurisdictions it was practically impossible to even own an assembled, functional firearm.

It is the long game taking us back to those bad old days that is concerning, especially when anti-gun forces start talking about massaging the language to disguise the final goal while waiting for some of us to pass on.

“Millennials and the generation below them seem more amenable both to government and Western Europe-style social democracy than their elders,” writes Hart. “This tendency points to the possibility of a different kind of conversation, and perhaps more wholesale changes, in the future. But for now, reform is a good place to begin – and it can start with the way we talk.”

It seems only polite to say thanks for the warning.

Country Music Execs Slammed NRA In Push To Oust Huckabee,"Country Music executives Jason Owen and Whitney Pastorek led a push to oust former Gov. Mike Huckabee from the Country Music Association Foundation board of directors, citing his support for the National Rifle Association and his views on LGBT issues. Huckabee, now a TV host, was out within a day of his appointment to the board.

Owen, whose agency manages artists including Faith Hill, Kacey Musgraves, and Midland, railed against Huckabee’s support for the NRA in a letter of opposition, calling his association with the pro-gun group “harmful and damaging,” and declaring, “I will not participate in any organization that elevates people like this to positions that amplify their sick voices.”

Owen also criticized Huckabee’s views on gay marriage and other LGBT issues, making it clear he was personally insulted by the “grossly offensive” appointment. He and his husband are fathers to one boy and are expecting twins. Owen said his companies and clients would withdraw all support from the CMA Foundation if Huckabee was not removed.

The CMA Foundation is a nonprofit that supports music education programs nationwide. Huckabee was appointed to the board based on his prior experience with education reform in Arkansas. He has also lobbied with the National Association of Music Merchants Foundation for music education programs and backed funding the National Endowment for the Arts based on programs that assist kids in poverty to learn a musical instrument.

Pastorek, a CMA member best known as the manager for Sugarland’s Kristian Bush, also cited Huckabee’s pro-gun views in a broadside against him. After nothing his background in education, she concluded: “I find his choice to spend the past ten years profiting off messages of exclusion and hatred (not to mention the gun lobby) to be disqualifying.”

As with Owen, Pastorek’s opposition is not shocking. A former journalist from Los Angeles, Pastorek — in addition to her day job — is the Democratic Party social media strategist in Davidson County, TN (encompassing Nashville). Until March 1, she was a candidate for a state house seat; her announcement asked people to donate to Planned Parenthood Action and the ACLU instead of her campaign.

Huckabee pulled no punches in his resignation letter: “If the industry doesn’t want people of faith or who hold conservative and traditional political views to buy tickets and music, they should be forthcoming and say it.”

Huckabee’s letter elsewhere overstates the case that politicization of the arts is a new development, as a glance at any Hollywood awards show would reveal. But he is correct to note that country music is becoming a victim of larger societal trends.

For virtually all of its history as a popular music, country has been a voice of cultural conservatism. Unlike the bohemian sensibility of rock music, country was more likely to extol the virtues of God, family and America.

Country springs from places with an affinity for gun culture — not only hunting, but also military service. Indeed, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and George Jones are just a few of the country legends who were also veterans.

Country music, however, was not always a voice of political conservatism. After all, country music was often the preferred choice of Southern Democrats, who were not always the political conservatives that the lazy conventional wisdom would suggest.

Johnny Cash opposed the Vietnam War (while playing for and sympathizing with the troops), supported Native American causes and was renowned for playing prison concerts and supporting prison reforms. Merle Haggard wrote counter-counterculture classics like “Okie from Muskogee” and “Fightin’ Side of Me,” but celebrated an interracial relationship in “Irma Jackson” and criticized the Nixon Administration. Loretta Lynn may be a supporter of President Trump, but she penned an ode to “The Pill” in the mid-1970s that was largely blacklisted by country radio. Willie Nelson is famously and habitually pro-marijuana.

Nevertheless, country was pushed rightward by the larger forces polarizing American politics. After the New Left gained traction in the late 1960s, it set about alienating cultural conservatives from the Democratic Party. Although Democrats will say this was a mater of racial and sexual politics, it was also evident in their increasing hostility to religion and their dovishness on foreign policy.

Institutions that were once more heterodox and bipartisan would be driven toward one ideological pole or the other over time. This is what happened to country music, because this is what happened to its audience. This is also what happened to the NRA, which was a far more bipartisan group prior to the Democrats’ big embrace of gun control in the 1990s.

Accordingly, it is not surprising that the Dixie Chicks’ career could have been derailed by their opposition to the invasion of Iraq. Nor is it surprising that the NRA created an organization called NRA Country, which supports sponsors concerts and promotional campaigns on behalf of a raft of country artists as part of the association’s efforts to expand its membership.

While country music continues largely as a voice of cultural traditionalism, it is again being tested by the recent rash of mass shootings.

Kasey Musgraves (an Owen client) received the social media mob treatment for suggesting more firearms as a possible answer following the Pulse nightclub shooting. Rosanne Cash, a long-time gun control activist, has claimed that the NRA “funds domestic terrorism.” Tim McGraw (an Obama voter) and Faith Hill (as noted, an Owen client) have voiced support for “common sense” gun control measures. Brad Paisley led an effort to get the CMA Awards to drop guidelines telling journalists not to ask about last year’s Las Vegas shooting.

Moreover, a number of up-and-coming artists in country and Americana have become more overt supporters of gun control, including Sturgill Simpson, Margo Price and Will Hoge (whose “Thoughts and Prayers” is an ill-advised sneer unlikely to persuade the unconverted). Like McGraw and Hill, Simpson and Price usually note that their issue is with the availability of “weapons of war” and that they are gun owners (Simpson is also a veteran).

This sort of talk suggests that like many in showbiz, they may not understand an AR-15 is not a uniquely deadly weapon and that its military history makes it a tested and reliable technology. Simpson declares “nobody needs a machine gun,” in apparent ignorance that virtually no one in America owns one.

It also suggests that these artists may be too naive to realize that increasing polarization may well force them over time into one of those painful “binary choices” we have heard so much about recently. This will be much less of problem for an artist like Brantley Gilbert, who may not partner with NRA Country, but has the Second Amendment tattooed across his entire back. He already seems committed.

Country music faces a particular challenge today, because of its historical concern with traditionalism. Should country ever completely capitulate to social progressivism, it will lose not only its core audience, but also its distinct sense of self. It will travel further down the road to becoming pop music with a fiddle — a road that ostensibly drives even someone like Simpson to wish he could follow Watchmen’s Dr. Manhattan to Mars.

"Dear Parkland Kids: We Gave You An Awesome World, Don't Mess It Up","All the reasons for refusing to allow ourselves to be led by children were summed up in the latest coronation of the Parkland kids, this time by ancient leftist Bill Maher. He invited David Hogg and Cameron Kasky on his show so Hogg could boast about hanging up on the President of the United States, and so Kasky could give us this sanctimonious little lecture: “I mean this sincerely, I really do, to all the generations before us, we sincerely accept your apology. We appreciate that you are willing to let us rebuild the world that you f—ed up.”

This sums up everything that’s wrong with these kids’ astroturfed ride to fame. They get flown around the country, they get invited on TV, they get puffball interviewers like Bill Maher, all because they are willing to repeat in a cloyingly self-righteous manner the message favored by their adult handlers. But not because they actually know what they’re talking about.

Let’s look at their arrogant presumption that previous generations messed up the world, so that today’s kids, in their superior wisdom, have to “rebuild” it.

Start with the issues most directly at hand here. School shootings are actually down over the last 20 years. Northeastern University Professor James Alan Fox analyzed the data and concluded that mass school shootings are “extremely rare events” and that “there is not an epidemic of school shootings.” Here’s what the data look like.

Moreover, Fox adds that “over the past 35 years, there have been only five cases in which someone ages 18 to 20 used an assault rifle in a mass shooting,” meaning that the most common proposed new gun control measure would have little effect.

Speaking of guns, you might think that without gun control, we’re living in a lawless post-apocalyptic hellscape. In fact, crime is down. Murders are down. Violent crimes committed with guns are way down.

This is the period in which restrictions on gun ownership have been substantially rolled back — the assault weapons ban of the 1990s was allowed to expire, and Supreme Court rulings invalidated gun bans in cities like Washington and Chicago. Americans now own about 300 million guns. So clearly, gun ownership is not causing an increase in crime rates. In fact, statisticians who looked closely at gun deaths concluded that none of the frequently suggested gun control measures would do much to reduce these numbers.

But cite these statistics and you will be told that you cannot contradict the Parkland kids because being present at the scene of a mass shooting makes them unquestionable experts on the topic. No, really. Kasky tells us, “We’ve seen our friends text their parents goodbye. We are the experts.” I can hear Tom Nichols grinding his teeth from here. Obviously, being an expert on guns, crime, and mass shootings requires actual knowledge and research, including the ability to read and understand crime statistics.

This presumption that we adults have ruined the world has wider roots. Today’s young people are bombarded with a lot of doom and gloom that tells them everything is getting worse, pushed onto them by people who have an interest in recruiting them as activists.

They may be surprised to learn, for example, that in addition to crime being down, war has decreased across the globe. The number of wars and the number of deaths in wars decreased dramatically after World War II, of course, but it decreased dramatically again when the Soviet Union collapsed, almost as if Communism was an engine of global conflict.

Along with war, extreme poverty across the world is down significantly over recent decades and especially since the Industrial Revolution.

America has done especially well. Median family income in America is nearly triple what it was in 1950. The rich have gotten richer, and the poor have also gotten richer.

Surely, all of this economic growth is ruining the environment. Yet according to the EPA, U.S. GDP has grown by 253 percent since 1970, while emissions of “six common pollutants” — things like lead, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide — are down 73 percent. Our air and water are about as clean as they have ever been.

And so on. The world we older generations have given today’s kids is actually pretty awesome. We can’t protect them from every danger and every risk, and we can’t stop every tragedy like the Parkland shooting. But by historical standards, our kids will be safer, healthier, and wealthier, and they can expect to live longer and more untroubled lives than we did, or than our parents did, or than our grandparents did.

I can see, though, why they wouldn’t realize any of this, because there are some who have a political interest in making things look worse. If you want young people to think capitalism is the cause of war — a view they hear often — you don’t want them to find out that the triumph of the capitalist countries in the Cold War led to a decrease in war. If you want them to rail against “global capitalism” — I can’t decide if this is a cause of the left or of the right these days — you can’t have them realizing that capitalism and trade are wiping out global poverty. If you want them to think free markets are inferior to socialism, you don’t want them to understand the massive increases in prosperity in free market societies, or to question the latest environmentalist panic. And if you want them to become televised activists for gun control, you have to create the impression that there is an epidemic of gun crimes and mass shootings.

The Parkland kids have swallowed all of this, and hence their ignorant ranting to us about how the older generations have messed everything up.

To be sure, the kids we’re seeing on TV are not representative of their peers. We don’t hear much about the Parkland students who don’t fit the left’s narrative. Instead, we’re mostly getting a couple of the high-school debate club types. Once I found out that detail, it all fell into place, because we all remember the guys from high-school debate club. They weren’t the smartest kids, just the most preening and self-important.

The important point is that too many of today’s young people are not being taught to see and appreciate what has made the world as good a place as it really is for them. They have no idea who designed the large and complex systems that produce the peace and prosperity they enjoy, no idea how those systems work, and no idea how much they can foul them up by knocking out pins and levers and constitutional amendments just because they’re angry.

The fastest way to mess up the world the older generations gave them is to think that they are all experts at age 17 because they read some lefty rhetoric and got “woke.” You know who also thought that? The Baby Boomers. People my age — technically, I’m Gen X, but early enough in it that we never thought of ourselves that way — grew up with this. We grew up with smug Boomers like Phil Collins assuring us that, “My generation will put it right. We’re not just making promises that we know we’ll never keep.” Spoiler alert: they didn’t keep those promises, and everything turned out just fine. But now the same people who were wrong about war, wrong about poverty, wrong about capitalism, and wrong about guns want to get the grandkids to give one more shot at fixing what isn’t broken.

Then again, they also thought lame hand-puppet parodies of Ronald Reagan were really clever, so the lesson from this is to show a little humility, kids. You’re still learning, and you would be well served not to be content to repeat what you learn at school, but to go do your own reading and research and listen to people who disagree with you. It’s not as traumatic an experience as you have been led to believe. When you can show that you understand what’s good about the world we are giving you, and you have some idea of how it got to be that way — then we’ll listen to your ideas for changing it.

Then again, the previous generations are not blameless. We did create cable news, and for some reason none of us can really remember, we made Bill Maher famous. Sorry about that.

"Liberals: Teens Can't Buy Guns, But Can Play With The Constitution","Gun control proponents are pushing to raise the age for purchasing a gun to 21 in response to the Parkland shooting. These same people want the teenagers traumatized by the shooting to set our country’s gun laws. Make up your mind, America.

Liberals have fallen in love with the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The willingness of the survivors to use the national spotlight to advocate for more gun control has transformed them from merely sympathetic victims of a tragedy to teen idols of a mainstream media eager to find a tipping point in the gun debate.

Some of the kids’ new fans are so in love with them, they’re claiming the voting age should be lowered to 16 so their wisdom on gun control doesn’t go to waste, and they can punish the state and national legislators who don’t obey their demands.

That was the conceit of a Sunday op-ed in The New York Times by Laurence Steinberg, a Temple University psychology professor. Liberal radio talker Dean Obeidallah echoed the sentiment in a gun control debate with me on Headline News. Both seem to think the kids deserve the right to decide the fate of the lawmakers who are allegedly endangering them by not voting for more gun laws.

Yet at the same time, gun control advocates are nearly unanimous in their view that the legal age for purchasing a weapon — especially rifles such as the AR-15 — should be raised from 18 to 21. The inconsistency here is staggering. Then again, are these ideas any more disconnected from reality than most of the liberal patent nostrums about guns being put forward as “common sense” proposals? Not really. More to the point, the focus on the kids tells us a lot about the way the Parkland survivors are being treated as abstract political symbols rather than flesh and blood children who deserve everyone’s sympathy and support.

The context for this question is the outsize role the Parkland students have played in the gun debate since their school was attacked. Gun control advocates and the media immediately recognized that as both survivors and attractive kids, there were no better spokespersons for their point of view than these students. They played a key role not only in a CNN town hall on the issue in which they bullied Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and seemed ready to burn NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch at the stake, but also in marches on Tallahassee where they sought to stampede the Florida state legislature into banning rifles labeled as assault weapons.

Their gun control push has earned them the praise of liberals but, of course in our culture, insults from those who disagreed. Some on the right leveled outrageous charges that they were actors or otherwise fake. Also outrageous was criticism of kids who were seen at marches or during their return to school laughing or otherwise doing things teenagers do because it supposedly gave the lie to their grief. In our bifurcated political culture, all too many of us seem incapable of disagreeing with opponents without delegitimizing or otherwise demonizing them.

That some of the Parkland kids were doing the same thing about defenders of gun rights, calling the NRA “a haven for child killers” or Nazis, is a product of their coming of age in the era of Twitter and is equally lamentable. So are their claims that any legislator who won’t do their bidding is a political prostitute in the pay of the NRA and other evil forces.

Yet while both the Parkland kids and their critics ought to behave better, the discussion about voting, as opposed to the one about raising the age for purchasing a weapon, is based on a myth about the young.

Steinberg argued in TheNYT op-ed that lowering the voting age is based on psychological arguments about the “cold cognitive” decision making abilities of teens to make rational voting choices — as opposed to the “hot cognitive” skills involved in using firearms. But that false distinction notwithstanding, it’s painfully obvious that he, Obeidallah and the others echoing their stand in the Twitterverse, are only making this case because they think the overwhelming majority of youngsters they wish to enfranchise will agree with them about guns.

This is based on wishful thinking, but is also a product of media coverage during the last three weeks in which the only youthful voices being heard are those teen survivors who have taken anti-gun stands. There was no effort from the mainstream media to find teenagers who might have different views, so perhaps its understandable that those credulous consumers of the liberal media believe such kids don’t exist.

But while the Parkland kids have seemed to speak with one voice about their revulsion for guns and a desire to restrict them, it bears pointing out that they live in a deep blue Florida district, not in a part of the country where opposing views would be as likely to be heard from teenagers as from adults.

Prior to the last lowering of the federal age for voting from 21 to 18 in 1971, liberals and Democrats thought this would be a huge advantage for them. That belief fueled some of the delusions behind George McGovern’s disastrous presidential campaign. But the youth of America didn’t rise up to defeat Nixon and, rather than being the prelude to a political Age of Aquarius, the amendment’s enactment was followed by a period during which Republicans won four of the next five presidential elections.

As anyone who follows mock election votes among students of all ages knows, school kids tend to vote as their parents do. That’s as true for the youthful liberal firebrands vowing vengeance on Republicans in the Florida legislature as it is for teenagers who probably worry as much about the state taking away their right to bear arms in areas where gun ownership is a way of life. That’s why all of the arguments about teenagers being as fit to vote for our leaders as their elders are disingenuous.

The 26th Amendment to the Constitution that gave the vote to 18-year-olds was largely rooted in a belief that Americans in that age bracket who were fighting and dying for their country in Vietnam ought to have a right to decide who would send them to war. Unlike that era, no one is currently being compelled to serve, though many below 21 are wearing their country’s uniform and are in harm’s way. Yet because of the murderously insane actions of 19-year-old Parkland shooter, much of the country is ready to deny gun rights to the same age group they enfranchised nearly a half-century ago.

Is that reasonable? An argument can be made that young people aren’t as responsible as their elders, even though many of the mass shooters have been over 21. Like virtually every other “common sense” new law proposed by opponents of gun rights, this is unlikely to prevent the next mass shooting.

But if we were to follow this line of reasoning to its logical conclusion, then perhaps what we really should be doing is raising the driving age to 18 or 21, since we know that teenage drivers are far less safe than more experienced ones and are responsible every year for more deaths and injuries than all the mass shooters of the latest twenty years combined.

If we were to do so — and I speak as the father of a 16-year-old — that, rather than the debate about guns would be something that would send millions of teens to the barricades demanding political change.

The Parkland kids have a right to their say and those who abuse them should be ashamed. But those who draw conclusions from the activism of liberalism’s new teen idols about guns or voting age are equally deluded about the innate wisdom of youth and the impact they might have on future elections and the restrictions on the right to bear arms.

"If You’re Trying To Ban Guns, The Least You Can Do Is Learn The Basics","Can anyone imagine a major newspaper running an op-ed justifying public ignorance on public policy? Actually, not merely justifying the ignorance, but rather arguing that facts only help smother discourse rather than enhance it. It’s improbable. Then again, this is the gun debate. And one side benefits from policy illiteracy.

The Washington Post ran an op-ed by former Gawker writer Adam Weinstein arguing that Second Amendment advocates use “jargon” to bully gun-control supporters. “While debating the merits of various gun control proposals,” he contends, “Second Amendment enthusiasts often diminish, or outright dismiss their views if they use imprecise firearms terminology.”

How dare Second Amendment advocates expect that those passionately arguing to limit their constitutional rights have some rudimentary knowledge of the devices they want to ban? To point out the constant glaring technical and policy “faux pas” of gun controllers, he argues, is to engage in “gunsplaining,” a bad-faith argument akin to intimidation.

“If you don’t know what the ‘AR’ in AR-15 stands for, you don’t get to talk” explains the sarcastic subhead. If you don’t know what the “AR” in AR-15 stands you still get to talk. But if you want to ban or confiscate AR-15s and you haven’t taken the time to learn what the AR stands for, then gun owners have every right to call you out.

Weinstein bemoans the unfairness of gun controllers “being forced to sweat the finest taxonomic distinctions between our nation’s unlimited variety of lethal weapons.” This statement is illustrative of the emotionalism and hyperbole of the debate (the notion that there’s an “unlimited variety” of firearms is absurd) but also, at the same time, it’s an exaggeration of the Second Amendment advocate’s expectations.

Like with any contemporary disputes over public policy, there will always be those who attempt to dismiss opponents who possess less expertise. It’s certainly not unique to this debate. And no, simply because a person refers to a “bullet” rather than a “cartridge” or “clip” rather than a “magazine” should not mean exclusion from conversation.

Then again, much of gun-control policy is driven by the mechanics of a firearm. So while not knowing what a “barrel shroud” is should not prevent anyone from pondering gun policy (well, unless you’re a politician who goes on TV to advocate the banning of barrel shrouds without knowing what they are), failing to understand the distinction between a semi-automatic and automatic weapon tells us you’re either dishonest, unserious or unprepared for the debate.

So, for instance, Michael Bloomberg.

In a debate imbued with emotion, gun-control advocates rely on this ignorance. When Barack Obama tells a crowd that a mass shooter used a “fully automatic weapon,” he’s not concerned with the finest taxonomic distinctions of a gun, he’s depending on the yawning obliviousness of a cheering crowd. When CNN featured an alleged gun expert explaining that the AR-15 he’s about to fire is “full semi-automatic,” he’s making the functionality of firearm sound scarier to those who are ignorant about guns.

“Jargon” are words and expressions that are difficult for a layman to understand or use. Rather than use jargon, Second Amendment advocates are usually mocking those who use jargon-y sounding words in efforts to fearmonger viewers and constituents. When you claim that the streets are rife with “high-capacity, rapid-fire magazines” or “jumbo clips” you’re trying to fool your audience with a veneer of expertise you don’t possess. When you claim that we need to ban “gas-assisted, receiver firearms” you’re trying to make a semi-automatic weapon sound like a machine gun for a reason.

It’s not always the mechanics, either. When Joe Scarborough misrepresents the Heller decision, he’s preying on policy ignorance that has little to do with gun culture. When Steve Schmidt goes on television and passionately tells an audience that it’s more difficult to buy cough medicine than an “AK-47 – or 50 of them,” he’s either lying or he has absolutely no grasp of how gun policy works. Either way, he shouldn’t be talking to grownups about firearms.

All these people use a moralistic fallacy, which is often predicated on the ignorance Weinstein rationalizes. Not that it stops him from embracing the appeal to authority he condemns elsewhere.

For example, Weinstein takes Fox News personality Tomi Lahren to task for failing to mention that “the family” of Eugene Stoner, the AR-15’s designer and champion, claimed in 2016 that the inventor would be “horrified and sickened to see his military rifle pattern become so common in civilian households and school shootings.” You’ll notice the conflation. Of course Stoner would be horrified that his gun was used in school shootings. But Weinstein fails to note that there’s no evidence anywhere on the record that Stoner was “horrified and sickened” by the notion of civilians owning his gun. Since he was selling proto AR-15s to civilians a decade before his military model was adopted by the United States, we have no reason to believe he would be.

Perhaps that kind of discussion spurns conversation in favor of condescension. But at least it’s a debate that revolves around the veracity of facts. Which is a lot more I can say for the rest of the “gunsplaining” grievance.

"The US Has Hardened Other Targets, Why Not Schools?","As I’ve scrolled through my social media feeds these past few weeks, all I’ve seen are various iterations of people lamenting that they and their children are subjected to active shooter drills, that the National Rifle Association is evil, that it is unacceptable for their kids (and they themselves) not to feel safe 100 percent of the time anywhere they go, that all or some guns should be banned, etc. I’ve also seen ridiculous demonstrations of general ignorance about existing gun laws, ignorance about guns in general (someone actually thought an AR-15 would obliterate a deer and thus defeat the purpose of hunting for meat), ignorance about gun deaths and gun violence statistics, and, well, I’m sure this audience can add a few more missives to the list of typical knee-jerk reactions and sometimes outright vitriol they’ve observed.

I’ve refrained from commenting and have generally just shared this Washington Post article, in which the author, to her credit, admitted she started out on a three-month research venture to prove every gun control measure would be helpful, only to learn her premise was, in her words, wrong.

It is unfortunate that people, especially young people, feel they are no longer safe anywhere (though in some cases we’re talking about snowflakes who already need their designated “safe spaces” to begin with). But what’s also unfortunate is they have no historical, global, and even domestic context for their concerns.

My parents had “bomb shelter” drills all the time in school. Yes, hiding under a desk was stupid, as if that could protect from a NUCLEAR bomb, which, at the time, was a legitimate fear. Keep going back through the generations, and you’ll find each one had to face their own grave threats (you know, just your garden variety world wars in which hundreds of thousands of Americans, including teenagers, sacrificed their lives because our country’s very existence hung in the balance, for example).

After Columbine, many schools, including mine, had active shooter drills. Schools also have natural disaster drills (at least mine did). Many schools brought in resource officers, some armed, some not. Many schools changed their policies to have all the doors lock automatically (or manually) a few minutes after school starts, save for the main entrance that was manned at all times with strict sign-in procedures.

After Sept. 11, 2001, so many targets were hardened. I live in a city that is arguably one of the top two national targets. After Sept. 11th, barricades were put up everywhere outside all federal buildings that didn’t have them. If they didn’t exist already, metal detectors, security guards, and bag inspections were put in place to enter any and all significant targets, including museums on the National Mall that school children frequent on class trips. For all inaugurations, you cannot even bring an umbrella. To get into most commercial and residential buildings in Washington, D.C., typically requires at least two key fob swipes — one to get in the building, often one to gain access to your floor, and then a third to gain access to your specific company’s office. And that’s just a regular office building — not a government agency that requires any type of security clearance.

I remember visiting D.C. in college during the 2005-2006 school year before I moved here, and one time every single white van and small truck was pulled over by multiple police and other agency vehicles as I drove down Constitution Avenue. Someone obviously vetted a credible tip about a white van or small truck carrying something dangerous — my guess is a bomb or biological or chemical weapon of some sort.

After the anthrax deaths and illnesses that started soon after Sept. 11th, all mail is still screened, with further precautions taken for federal government mail before reaching its destination.

The same scrutiny and security measures for D.C. landmarks also apply to sporting events (including at the college level), concerts, and other large gatherings across the nation, some of which only allow a clear plastic bag with a few small essentials.

The other top target, New York City, was also on a full lock down after Sept. 11th. The NYPD carried around those “scary looking” AR-15s or M4s. I was in NYC shortly after Sept. 11th, at the site of Ground Zero, just as we happened to be dropping the first bombs in Afghanistan. In a matter of minutes, the city went into an even more stringent lock down mode: more heavily armed police officers and other armed forces everywhere, more barricades, ID required to enter everywhere, including hotels, which also closed all entrances except the main ones, etc.

Large celebrations in NYC, such as the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade and New Year’s Eve ball drop, were already restrictive pre-Sept. 11, but the security was ramped up exponentially after. There are still so many security redundancies built into place, some seen and some unseen, for our protection.

Even still, a bomber managed to get into Times Square in May 2010, and the only reasons no one was injured were he didn’t assemble the crude bomb properly, and civilians who thought the situation was suspicious alerted the police.

FEMA, the Department of Homeland Security, law enforcement, our armed forces, and many other government agencies routinely conduct emergency practice drills for every scenario imaginable all over the country. If you live in or near D.C. and sign up for text alerts about such exercises, your phone is always beeping.

Flying after Sept. 11th became a completely different experience. Bomb-sniffing dogs, plainclothes air marshals, full-body X-rays, no-fly lists, the 3-1-1 rule, taking off your all your accessories, and having the TSA rifle through your luggage and pat you down were all implemented.

Chances are, your children have experienced at least one of these things — flying, going to a sporting event, concert, or museum, visiting NYC or D.C. They’ve never lived in a pre-Sept. 11 world.

Not to mention that while suburban America may not be used to metal detectors and security guards, this is not novel to many schools in inner-city areas, where children are more likely to have to deal with violence, gangs, and feeling unsafe wherever they go in their neighborhoods (all while receiving a lower quality of education than children in suburban areas, generally speaking).

Now, to put this in a global context, we might think these measures are extreme and were an extreme reaction to violence and terrorism. However, in many countries (particularly Israel and other developed countries in the Middle East), it is perfectly normal to face infinitely more scrutiny when going about a normal day — going to school, to work, to the mall, to the grocery store or local market, and especially to an airport. This includes not only metal detectors, armed guards, and bag searches at all the above mentioned locations, but refusal of entry if security personnel trained in behavioral science suspect even an iota of potential danger (e.g. Israeli airports).

Even still, we see violence overseas and here in America that involve suicide bombers, people plowing trucks and cars into crowds, people who would love to weaponize deadly diseases; obtain chemical, biological, or radiological weapons; cause chaos and ultimately death with cyber warfare; and the list goes on — all without firing a shot. The horrific attacks on Sept. 11th — with the largest civilian casualty count in U.S. history — occurred without firing one round from any gun. The 2013 Boston bombers killed and maimed with a pressure cooker stuffed with sharp objects. They also managed to shut down all of Boston and the surrounding areas for almost a week with a shelter-in-place request from the governor, along with the halting of mass transit, rendering Beantown a ghost town.

There have been countless other attacks using various methods both pre- and post-Sept. 11 and countless thwarted attempts of which we may never know, both in America and abroad. I only cite a few because people have short memories or may not have been alive or old enough to remember them and the fear, loss, gravity, and overwhelming sense of insecurity in the aftermath of each shattering event.

Dangerous people have a difficult time attacking hardened targets. So they opt for soft targets — like suburban schools and other soft locations like some religious facilities. This is nothing new. The Colorado shooter who murdered at a movie theater in 2012 and rigged his apartment with catastrophic explosives did so at a theater that was a gun-free zone, even though it was farther away from him than many other theaters that weren’t gun-free zones. The same goes for the 2015 shooting at a South Carolina church, which was not the shooter’s reported original hardened target, a college.

Would you put up a gun-free zone sticker or yard sign in front of your house? No, you put up signs indicating you have a security system. We can debate specific measures to adopt, and for each school district and community the answer may be different. But if our children are invaluable, and obviously they are, wouldn’t we want them to be just as safe, if not even safer, where they spend a significant portion of their days versus the occasional field trip to already hardened targets like a museum or a city like D.C.?

Right now, humans in soft targets are vulnerable sitting ducks — and that is why these locations are ripe for dangerous and deranged individuals. Evil exists and has existed from the beginning of time, and that won’t change. What we can do is build our schools on — as the Biblical adage goes — foundations of rock, not sand.

Anti-Gun Activists Could Help Their Case By Learning How They Work,"After every mass shooting in our country, left and right engage in a cyclic and counterproductive debate about gun control policies. All that changes from the aftermath of one tragedy to the aftermath of its successor is the level of vitriol in our public discussions. (These are, for the record, the most depressing introductory sentences I have ever written.)

Discussions about gun terminology have become particularly acidic, specifically in the context of gun control proposals. Many journalists and elected representatives on the left believe gun owners’ insistence on accurate gun terminology is a distraction at best and willful obfuscation of the debate at worst. These men and women believe that “gunsplaining” (to borrow a term from Adam Weinstein’s Washington Post Tuesday Op-Ed arguing against the need for informed opinions) is an unwinnable game of “Gotcha” played by the right.

In certain instances, they may be correct. Human nature being what it is, no party has a monopoly on intellectual dishonesty within its ranks. For the vast majority of gun-owners, however, journalists’ and representatives’ willingness to understand the policy specifics is a sign of good faith and honest engagement. And their persistent refusal to do so signals bad faith.

To be clear, this position does not extend to the average person — but it certainly applies to those whose jobs are to change public policy, explain public policy, or advocate for public policy. For the average person wholly uninterested in firearms, dedicating little attention to learning about the differences between various guns and their respective capacities is rational — to borrow from Kevin Williamson, it is “rational ignorance”— there are only so many hours in a day, and every hour dedicated to learning gun specifics you will likely never use is an hour not spent playing with your kids or building your business. For the average person with no interest in guns, this is a rational, understandable decision.

For those tasked with creating national laws or explaining the potential impacts of those laws to the average Americans, however, such ignorance is not rational. This ignorance is, in fact, an indication that the speaker is not serious about discussing the issue. To gun owners, lawmakers demanding immediate bans on “gas-assisted receiver firearms,” or “machine gun magazines” sounds as absurd as the late Sen. Ted Stevens famously opposing net neutrality by describing the internet as “a series of tubes … those tubes can be filled and if they are filled, when you put your message in, it gets in line and its going to be delayed.”

In short, why should citizens trust the judgment of lawmakers who cannot even describe the basic attributes of the items they want to ban?

I am not arguing for or against the wisdom of a specific policy — I am attempting to identify one of the reasons why both sides of the gun debate speak past each other with such frequency during the gun debates. We are speaking different languages. Or at the very least, we are are placing our emphasis on different terms.

An argument I frequently hear from those who find gun knowledge irrelevant is, in various forms, “I don’t need to learn about a carburetor to be able to advocate for seatbelt laws.” I will happily concede this point, because it has absolutely nothing to do with the gun-terminology debate. Seatbelt laws have no effect on which types of carburetors citizens can own. A more apt analogy is whether a lawmaker or journalist should have a passing understanding of carburetors before he or she passes, explains, or advocates for laws regulating which carburetors Ford can put in its vehicles.

Gun law, it seems, is the only public policy arena in which journalists do not demand expertise from policy makers.

I am not arguing that lawmakers or journalists must purchase and become proficient with firearms before covering them, but as with any other public policy area, it is not unreasonable to expect those in positions of authority to display a passing familiarity with the topics they explain to millions of their fellow citizens. So, when CNN anchor Chris Cuomo says “in my experience, engaging in gun vocab is mostly a distraction,” those who actually understand “gun vocab” hear him say “it isn’t important for me to know the particulars of the policy debate I am taking a side in,” and they tune him out.

When a sitting congresswoman and former chair of the Democratic National Committee wants to outlaw “high-capacity, rapid fire magazines,” gun-owners who are aware that such things do not exist (i.e. every gun owner) write off her position as that of someone who wants to “do something” without knowing exactly what that something will look like. When another member of Congress introduces a measure to ban barrel shrouds — which simply cover the barrel of a rifle or shotgun to keep the user from getting burned and do not alter the weapon’s function — but then describes the allegedly-dangerous item during an interview as “the thing that goes up” before finally admitting ignorance about its actual function, gun owners rightly question whether there had been critical thought behind the proposed bill.

It is not enough to say “I want to ban the type of guns that can kill lots of people,” or “I want to outlaw military-style assault weapons like the AR-15” (which, for the record, does not meet the military’s definition of an assault weapon — a succinct explanation from the Washington Free Beacon’s Stephen Gutowski can be found here). Those who understand guns realize those types of sweeping sentiments are impossible to implement without banning all semi-automatic weapons entirely (as Marco Rubio pointed out at the Parkland town hall). And if banning all semi-automatic weapons is one’s position, I respect their intellectual honesty and their right to that opinion, even if I disagree with it. That is, at least, a position that has a specific meaning that I can engage with and discuss.

I sincerely hope to find common ground in this debate — one thing every person in America should be able to agree on is that these types of tragedies cannot continue to happen. And, perhaps counterintuitively, it is easier to begin that process with someone who says “I think all semi-automatic weapons should be banned” (and understands the implications of their statement) than with someone who says we need to outlaw “high-magazine clips.”

So, yes, if you are a policymaker or policy-explainer, being able to speak intelligently about guns is important. It’s not “gunsplaining,” it’s responsible civil discourse.

"No, The Government Is Not 'Banned' From Studying Gun Violence","A popular fiction circulating around the gun debate these days contends that “the government” has been “banned” from studying “gun violence.” This prohibition, I’m regularly assured, has led to a dearth of reliable science on firearms, and only when it’s lifted can America start alleviating the “epidemic” of mass shootings.

“Why Can’t the U.S. Treat Gun Violence as a Public-Health Problem?” asks one major publication. “Gun violence research by the government hasn’t been funded in two decades. But that may soon change,” says another. “The CDC can’t fund gun research. What if that changed?” ponders a third.

And on and on and on.

The most obvious problem with this assertion is that it’s untrue.

In 1996, a few years after the Center for Disease Controls had funded a highly controversial study that has since embedded itself into the “scientific” case for gun control, Arkansas Republican Jay Dickey* added an amendment to a funding bill that dictated “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control” should be used to “advocate or promote gun control.” That same year, Congress also cut $2.6 million from the CDC’s budget, the amount it spent on gun control efforts. Bill Clinton signed it into law.

Absolutely nothing in the amendment prohibits the CDC from studying “gun violence,” even if this narrowly focused topic tells us little. In response to this inconvenient fact, gun controllers will explain that while there isn’t an outright ban, the Dickey amendment has a “chilling” effect on the study of gun violence.

Does it? Pointing out that “research plummeted after the 1996 ban” could just as easily tell us that most research funded by the CDC had been politically motivated. Because the idea that the CDC, whose spectacular mission creep has taken it from its primary goal of preventing malaria and other dangerous communicable diseases, to spending hundreds of millions of dollars nagging you about how much salt you put on your steaks or how often you do calisthenics, is nervous about the repercussions of engaging in non-partisan research is hard to believe.

Also unlikely is the notion that a $2.6 million cut in funding so horrified the agency that it was rendered powerless to pay for or conduct studies on gun violence. The CDC funding tripled from 1996 to 2010. The CDC’s budget is over six billion dollars today.

And the idea that the CDC was paralyzed through two-years of full Democratic Party control, and then six years under a president who was more antagonistic towards the Second Amendment than any other in history, is difficult to believe, because it’s provably false.

In 2013, President Barack Obama not only signed an Executive Order directing the CDC to research “gun violence,” the administration also provided an additional $10 million to do it. Here is the study on gun violence that was supposedly banned and yet funded by the CDC. You might not have heard about the resulting research, because it contains numerous inconvenient facts about gun ownership that fails to propel the predetermined narrative. Trump’s HHS Secretary Alex Azar is also open to the idea of funding more gun violence research.

It’s not banned. It’s not chilled.

Meanwhile, numerous states and private entities fund peer-reviewed studies and other research on gun violence. I know this because gun control advocates are constantly sending me studies that distort and conflate issues to help them make their arguments. My inbox is bombarded with studies and conferences and “webinars” dissecting gun violence.

The real problem here is two-fold. One, researchers want the CDC involved so they can access government data about American gun owners. Considering the rhetoric coming from Democrats — gun ownership being tantamount to terrorism, and so on — there’s absolutely no reason Republicans should acquiesce to helping gun controllers circumvent the privacy of Americans citizens peacefully practicing their Constitutional rights.

Second, gun control advocates want to lift the ban on politically skewed research because they’re interested in producing politically skewed research. When the American Medical Association declares gun violence a “public health crisis,” it’s not interested in a balance look at the issue. When researchers advocate lifting the restrictions on advocacy at the CDC, they don’t even pretend they not to hold pre-conceived notions about the outcomes.

It’s also worth noting that concerns over the politicization of the CDC were, then as now, well founded. If you read this 1994 New York Times piece, titled “New Tactics Urged in Fight Against Crime,” you’ll find Mark Rosenberg” — then director at the CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which oversaw the “gun violence” research — urging America “to revolutionize the way we look at guns, like what we did with cigarettes … It used to be that smoking was a glamour symbol — cool, sexy, macho. Now it is dirty, deadly — and banned.”

There’s no reason to allow activists — then or now — to use the veneer of state-sanctioned science for their partisan purposes. For example, we now know that Rosenberg and others at the CDC turned out to be wrong about the correlation between guns and crime — a steep drop in gun crimes coincided with the explosions of gun ownership from 1996 to 2014.

The Dickey Amendment might keep the CDC from funding activism. What it doesn’t do is stop the CDC from funding good-faith rigorous research into violence.

*Jay Dickey later changed his position on the amendment. It’s certainly a fact worth noting. Yet, simply because Norma McCorvey changed her mind about abortion doesn’t alter the facts surrounding the debate. Nor does Dickey’s change of heart.

School Spins National Walkout For Gun Control As Parkland Memorial,"Parents across the country are being urged to let their children participate in the National School Walkout on March 14. Yet, few parents (and kids!) understand the walkout’s true mission. At my children’s elementary school in Northern Virginia, school officials are telling parents the walkout is meant to memorialize the 17 victims of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

Yet, according to the National School Walkout website, the real mission of the walkout is to demand Congress pass more restrictive gun laws. The website specifically states: “Students and allies are organizing the national school walkout to demand Congress pass legislation … Congress must take meaningful action … and pass federal gun reform legislation.”

So, the children walking out of the classroom on March 14th won’t be spending the time in quiet prayer or reflection. Instead, school kids (even those in elementary school) are going to be used as props by professional anti-gun activists to push for specific legislation.

Some schools are even aiding in the effort by coordinating with the walkout organizers, providing “safe spaces” for kids who participate in the walkout, promoting the event on school Facebook and Twitter accounts, and allowing school buses to transport kids to and from gun control rallies.

Considering that many public schools are helping to rally more kids to the cause and are even supplying school resources and personnel time to the effort, tax payers should ask: Is this an acceptable use of school funds? More importantly, why is a publicly funded school supporting one side of a very contentious and complex constitutional matter?

Some might even wonder: What other political causes can I expect my public school to promote? Should conservatives in politically red areas of the country expect schools to help transport kids to next year’s March for Life? Or how about for the inauguration on the Mall when Trump is reelected in 2020?

Educators should also be concerned that the politicization of this issue avoids the nuance of what went wrong in Parkland that allowed the terrible shooting to occur, and what policies might actually help prevent the next one.

For instance, we now know that between 2008 and 2017, the Broward County sheriff’s office received 45 calls from concerned citizens related to the Parkland shooter and his brother. Social workers visited the his house multiple times. Yet, none of these reports (which included threats of violence and warnings that these troubled boys had access to weapons) were entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). If these many incidents had been logged into NICS, the shooter wouldn’t have passed a background check, and he wouldn’t have been able to purchase a firearm.

This isn’t just a problem in Broward County. According to a 2016 audit by the Justice Department, all 50 states are guilty of not properly submitting records to the database. Even mental health information largely goes unreported. Considering this, parents might want to ask if their own police departments and social service networks are consistently reporting incidents to the NICS.

They also might want to consider that at Parkland, three Broward County Sherriff’s deputies stood down outside the school, which allowed Cruz to continue his killing spree. Pushing for better police training and more effective communication with local schools is another area where parents should focus.

And there are more important areas to explore, such as the actions of the armed school resource officer employed by Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Instead of trying to keep students safe (as he was trained to do), he huddled in a stairwell with his gun holstered. In light of this, parents might want to ask questions about the level of training their school’s resource officers are receiving.

Americans ought to vigorously debate these issues, but we should also recognize that new laws won’t make a difference if they go unenforced. Moreover, there are already 300-plus million guns in the United States. That means regardless of how we restrict gun ownership, we need to be prepared to respond to acts of violence in the future.

Sadly, many parents have decided to pass on these hard questions and instead join a movement that is using children as props in a complex policy issue. We can all agree that children deserve safety and security at school. There are ways to help move toward that goal, but taking advantage of our kids for political ends isn’t one of them.

"America’s Gun Violence Represents A Failure Of Leadership, Not Laws","Everything that happened in Florida that led to the horrific shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is a lesson in leadership, or the lack of it. And solutions that focus on laws instead of leadership are bound to fail. The disgraced Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, whose office repeatedly ignored pleas to arrest the killer before the massacre and told officers at the scene to stand down, deserves much of the blame for the mishandling of the Parkland shooter.

The school resource officer who refused to do his duty and protect the children in that school when he heard them being gunned down was Israel’s responsibility. But Israel passed the buck. The deputy sheriff who told officers not to charge into the building to stop the shooter was Israel’s responsibility. He passed that buck, too. His office was repeatedly told prior to the shooting that the individual responsible was a violent threat to the community. Israel ignored that as well.

When Israel appeared on a CNN town hall after the shooting and was given the opportunity to take responsibility for his actions, he blamed the National Rifle Association. And when it was suggested that perhaps teachers be allowed to defend themselves and their students with firearms in the event that police failed to properly respond to an active shooter, the coward from Broward panned the idea, saying that was the job of the police, not teachers. If that’s the case, why did his police officers fail to do their jobs?

Israel sang a different tune when it came to mosques. He personally approved the hiring of Nezar Hamze, who moonlighted as a paid representative of the Council on Islamic-American Relations (CAIR), an unindicted co-conspirator in a sprawling federal law enforcement investigation of Hamas and other terrorist organizations. With Israel’s blessing, Hamze reportedly encouraged mosque-goers to carry concealed weapons and return fire if necessary. Israel never explained why preachers should have special self-defense rights that aren’t available to teachers.

And if all that weren’t enough, several SWAT officers were reprimanded for running toward the sound of gunfire in order to help save lives. That’s right: They were punished for doing what Israel and his team refused to do. Israel’s office even told reporters that the SWAT officers who rushed to help were “not needed.”

Our nation’s violence problems, however, are bigger than the leadership failures of one person.

America Isn’t facing An AR-15 Crisis, It’s Facing A Leadership Crisis

This brings us to some of the proposals to change various laws to address what happened in Parkland. One of the ideas circulating is to “fix” the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). If I thought it was possible to wave a magic wand and fix the illegal gun violence problem overnight by tweaking NICS, you could count on my support. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Would the NICS bill end gun violence in the killing fields of Chicago, or Baltimore, or Washington, D.C., where legal gun ownership is strictly limited by law? Of course not. Since 2001, more Americans have been killed in Chicago alone than in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan combined.

Yet for some reason, we’ve convinced ourselves that gun-free zones and legal tweaks like the bill to “fix” NICS are the solution to the nation’s violence problem. When I was in the Army, we used to say that “friendly fire isn’t.” The same is true of gun-free zones: gun-free zones aren’t. People who don’t respect life aren’t suddenly going to respect a sign that bans guns.

This nation doesn’t need gun control, or legal tweaks, or feel-good marches on Washington. We need leaders in government, in our communities, and in our families who are willing to do and say what’s right. We all need to take responsibility for our failures to raise a generation that values the sanctity of human life. This nation isn’t facing an AR-15 crisis; it’s facing a family and community and leadership crisis.

We need to pay attention when little Johnny seems to have mental health issues, or anger issues, or has immersed himself in the imaginary gaming world where killing is so easy. As men and husbands and fathers, we need to stand up and lead our families by example. We need to teach our sons to be accountable for their actions. We need to teach our boys to explore the outdoors, to hunt and fish, to play sports, to be involved in their communities. We must take them to church and teach them to love God and their neighbors. We have to encourage them to learn history, to talk with us at the dinner table. We have to turn off the television and put down our phones and be present with our kids. We have to raise our boys to be men who understand what it means to be responsible and accountable.

A new law or two cannot accomplish that task. Only moms and dads working together can accomplish it. Better leadership, not new laws, is the only thing that can stop this epidemic of violence. The solution isn’t a fixed NICS. The solution is getting America back to being America, where we look out for each other, defend the weak, and help the needy. We need to focus on teaching right from wrong, loving each other, and treating each other with respect. This nation doesn’t need new laws. We need better leadership.

"Respect Your Elders, And Our Passion For The Second Amendment","On March 24, student activists will gather in Washington, DC and other cities across the country as part of March for Our Lives, organized in response to the tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School with the mission to “end the epidemic of mass shootings.” Their enthusiasm is admirable. But their trivial knowledge of firearms and the Second Amendment is not. Before they try to change every Americans’ constitutional rights forever, perhaps these eager young men and women might want to learn something from their elders on these matters.

I represent an older generation of Americans who grew up in a time when many people still lived on farms. Unlike this generation, which seems determined to denigrate the roles of men and fathers, many of us had dads who taught their sons and daughters the proper use of shotguns and rifles, and how to shoot. Even my suburban high school in New York had a gun range and a junior Rod & Gun club. We were all expected to learn how to shoot a firearm. After the Second World War and Korea and amidst the threat of Soviet totalitarianism, we were taught to defend our families, ourselves, and our country. Liberty, self-armament, patriotism, and citizenship were inextricably bound.

The right to keep and bear arms has become even more crucial to those of us heading into our sunset years. The elderly are especially vulnerable to violent crime and, as a result, the number of senior citizens carrying firearms is on the rise. Nearly 23,000 people over 65 took basic firearm training courses from NRA-certified instructors in 2015, four times the number five years earlier. Since 2010, seniors’ demand for firearms training climbed 400 percent.

These are realities of life that the vast majority of the young people clamoring for gun control do not appear to grasp.

In fact, given their many media appearances, it’s clear that student activists are largely unfamiliar with the mechanics of firearms. Most believe the “AR” in “AR-15” stands for “assault rifle.” (It actually stands for ArmaLite, the manufacturer who designed the gun in 1956.) Moreover, few know the simple difference between a round and a clip. These aren’t trivial matters. They have already vastly impacted public policy.

American ‘Gun Culture’ Is In One Sense A Total Myth

Millennials also ought to grapple with the fact that American “gun culture” — in the sense that everyone is walking around with a firearm or has one at home — is a myth. Just about 3 percent of the population owns half of the civilian guns in this country. That’s the lowest rate of gun ownership since the late 1970s. Indeed, three decades ago, half of all American households had a gun, while just around one-third did in 2010. Yet gun violence has become more and more of a problem, despite fewer and fewer people possessing firearms.

Even more worrying, student activists don’t get the moral dimension of the Second Amendment, a failure of education that will likely devastate our democracy.

The right to keep and bear arms is about self-defense, of course. But it’s more than that, which should be obvious, because the overwhelming majority of guns in this country will never — thank goodness — be used in act of self-defense. It’s about responsibility, and lack of ownership (not only of firearms, but of anything) breeds irresponsibility. And it’s young Americans who especially would benefit from getting to know a right that’s primarily about obligation, obligation to oneself as well as to one’s neighbors.

As Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) demonstrated in his bestselling and aptly-titled 2017 book, “The Vanishing American Adult: Our Coming-of-Age Crisis,” our country’s coming-of-age rituals (graduating from school, leaving home, starting a family, buying a home, etc.), are now being delayed or omitted entirely. In that vein a new report from the National Institute on Retirement Security shows that 66 percent of millennials have nothing saved for retirement. And according to testimony by General Robert B. Neller, the 37th Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, less than 30 percent of young men and women are qualified to join the military.

These recent revelations are indicative of a broader and extremely alarming trend. And yet those born between the early 1980s and the mid 1990s constantly complain that they’re unfairly accused of being selfish and short-sighted.

Alas, millennials pass off personal responsibility to government and demand a greater amount of care through social welfare. And they still can’t figure out why older Americans can’t take them seriously as fully-formed adults. It’s not entirely their fault though. With the pervasive influence of progressivism, they are indoctrinated in school to believe there’s very little, if anything, to be learned from the past. Each generation is wiser than the previous one. So history is merely a saga of bigotry, racism, hatred, misogyny, and xenophobia. That by extension means that those who lived before us are not be trusted, as they are products of an enlightened era.

Indeed, to previous generations, “respect your elders” meant appreciating that those who have been on this planet longer than you have probably know things that you don’t. To millennials, however, the saying seems to mean little more than “be nice” to your parents and, especially, your grandparents, as in don’t scream at them when they ask you for the fifteenth time how to send a text message. If millennials were willing to accept that they could learn something from their grandparents, they would learn a lot about firearms, about which they claim to care passionately.

At least in the short term, there’s little chance we’ll be able to convince millennials of the virtues of the Second Amendment. Their generation floats. It has few roots. Its members are more likely to rent property, to regularly switch jobs, and to move from city to city. A greater appreciation of our nation’s history and founding principles will require a significant cultural shift. But there’s still reason to try to move the needle, for it’s our duty as citizens.

So I applaud the student activists for getting off the couch, putting down their iPhones, and getting involved in the public square. But if saving lives as well as our democracy is genuinely their aim, their time would be better spent more effectively reading a civics textbook or sitting down with their grandparents for an afternoon.

"10 Common Arguments For Gun Control, Debunked","School shootings have dominated the news cycle and the common theme anti-gunners express is how gun control can somehow solve the problem.

The most common gun-control arguments of today go something like this: “These shootings would stop if we banned AR-15s or other semi-auto rifles; raised the minimum age for firearm ownership; and/or created tougher gun laws.”

These are emotion-based arguments and will do nothing to solve the problem. In fact, they can even make the problem worse while infringing on the liberties of Americans. Let’s explore, and debunk, 10 of the most common gun-control arguments.

1. The Second Amendment Only Gives the Right to Own Guns for Use in a Militia

Our Second Amendment reads: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

Our Constitution does not give us any rights. Rather, it affirms rights that we already have in order to safeguard them. Note that the “right of the people to keep and bear arms” isn’t given by the language above. Instead, our right to keep and bear arms, which exists outside of the Constitution, is protected from infringement.

The militia is mentioned as the goal for the protection of our right to keep and bear arms — it is not a requirement. A helpful analog from an unknown author goes like this: “A well-educated electorate, being necessary to the preservation of a free society, the right of the people to read and compose books, shall not be infringed.”

In this example, it should be easy to see that the right to read and compose books is not reserved only to those that are registered voters or well-educated. Instead, the goal is a well-educated electorate, for which tools of education are needed. Likewise, our right to keep and bear arms is protected in the event a well-regulated militia is needed to defend our country.

2. The Second Amendment Only Applied to Muskets

Anti-gunners often claim that “modern/rapid-fire” arms are not protected. This argument assumes that muskets were the only type of arms in existence when the Second Amendment was written, and therefore our founding fathers never intended our protections to extend to modern firearms.

First, repeating rifles were in existence for more than 100 years before our Bill of Rights were included in our Constitution. Second, muskets were military-grade firearms. Our founding fathers wanted to protect our ability to overthrow a tyrannical government, which would include the capability to match whatever arms an opposing military possessed.

Third, if this argument were valid, then smartphones and social-media would not be protected as forms of speech under the First Amendment, because these “modern/rapid-fire” forms of communication were not around back then.

3. Criminals Won’t Have Guns if We Ban Them

Simply, law-abiding citizens will obey the law and criminals won’t. That’s how life works. After all, that’s the definition of a criminal: someone who doesn’t obey a law. Keeping guns out of criminal’s hands because they’ve been banned will be just as successful as our ban on crystal meth.

If the crime of, and penalty for, murder doesn’t stop criminals from conducting mass shootings, neither will another law. As an example, bombs are already illegal. However, neither the penalty for murder nor the penalty against making bombs has stopped the Oklahoma city bombing, the Boston marathon bombing, or the serial bomber in Austin.

Not only will a gun ban not work, it will ensure that the only people with guns are criminals.

4. AR-15s/Certain Semi-auto Rifles Should Be Banned

Again, criminals won’t obey laws. The France mass shooting mentioned above was carried out where those types of rifles were already banned.

Also, rifles, although popularized by the media, are not regularly used in violent crimes. In fact, according to the FBI, hammers and blunt instruments are used in more murders than rifles are.

Rifles have been used in some recent mass shootings. However, the shooters at Maryland, Ft. Hood, and Virginia Tech did not use rifles. Even if they did, rifles are merely a tool used by a murderer, much like box cutters by the terrorists on 9/11.

Likewise, vehicles are most commonly used by drunk drivers and those texting while driving to kill people. No, these people don’t have a murderous intent, however, many more deaths are caused in this manner and it is still the fault of the person and not the tool used.

5. We Must Raise the Rifle Purchase Age to 21 Years Old

Currently, under federal law, an 18-year-old can legally purchase a rifle or shotgun, but a purchaser must be 21 years old for a handgun. Either 18-year-olds are adults or they aren’t. If an 18-year-old is not responsible enough to purchase a rifle or shotgun, then he or she isn’t responsible enough to vote, join the military, drive a car, or be treated as an adult in crimes.

Raising the minimum age to purchase firearms wouldn’t have changed 29 of the 30 worst mass-shootings in U.S. history. Twenty-six of the 30 were committed by someone 21 years of age or older, one (No. 4) was committed by a 20-year-old who stole his mother’s firearms, another (No. 7) was committed by students who used a pistol they couldn’t legally purchase, and a third (No. 22) was committed by a 16-year-old who couldn’t purchase any firearms legally.

The most recent shooting in Maryland was committed by a student with a handgun and who was 18 years old. It is yet another example of a minimum age law not working.

6. Gun-Free Zones Are Safe Spaces

No. In fact, the opposite is true. Gun-free zones are a magnet for mass shooters — almost every mass shooting we have experienced has occurred in a gun-free zone.

It is logical that these monsters prefer unarmed victims. In fact, most of the shooters are stopped once they are confronted with armed resistance. If politicians believe that gun-free zones work, why do they hide behind armed security themselves?

7. Places With Strict Gun Laws Don’t Have Shooting Problems

Not true. Take a look at Chicago, a city with some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation. In the year 2016 alone, Chicago saw 762 gun deaths and experienced 4,331 shootings.

Or France, where there were 532 casualties from mass-shootings in 2015. As a comparison, America, experienced 527 casualties from mass-shootings over an eight-year period from 2009 to 2016.

Those numbers mean that France, which has incredibly strict gun control and is one-fifth of our population, experienced eight times the amount of casualties from a mass shooting in one year. Clearly, 2015 was an anomaly for France. However, the comparison is used to show that gun control does not prevent gun violence.

Also, note the rampant violent crime in much of Europe, which generally maintains very restrictive gun laws.

8. Reducing Guns Will Reduce Gun Violence

For the reasons above, we know that this isn’t true. However, even if it were true, our goal should be to reduce all violence. Completely eradicating gun violence wouldn’t have stopped the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Boston marathon bombing, the serial bombings in Austin, Texas, or other violent crimes.

According to FBI crime stats, in 2004, after the 1994 federal “assault weapons” ban ended, violent crime actually fell. In fact, violent crime has fallen by more than 50 percent since 1997, when the ban was in effect. Since 2004, sales and ownership of AR-15-style rifles have skyrocketed. Thus, contradicting claims made by gun control components, violent crime fell when the number of guns owned by the population significantly increased.

Often Australia is used as an example for how banning guns works. Yes, their firearm-related crime went down, but their violent crimes, to include sexual assault, kidnapping, manslaughter, and robbery, have all stayed the same or increased.

Also, gun restrictions can lead to an increase in violence when law-abiding citizens are unable to protect themselves. Everywhere would be a gun-free zone.

9. Only Law Enforcement Should Have Guns

When seconds count, law enforcement is often minutes away. According to the Department of Homeland Security, “the average duration of an active shooter incident at a school is 12.5 minutes. In contrast, the average response time for law enforcement is 18 minutes.”

A firearm is the best method of self-defense for a single mother defending her children from a home intruder. If police officers need firearms because of the violent people they encounter, then surely average citizens need firearms even more. We’re the ones who must face the violent people without backup and while the crime is being committed.

Additionally, the argument that only the government should have guns defies the purpose behind our Second Amendment protections. It is baffling how many of the people who vilify law enforcement are also the same ones insisting that only law enforcement should have guns.

10. High-Capacity Magazines Should Be Banned

In addition to trying to ban guns, anti-gunners also try to vilify another inanimate object: “high-capacity magazines.” Typically, the most popular target of their ire are magazines with the capability to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, especially AR-15-style magazines. They claim that by stopping to reload, a mass-shooter can be stopped.

The facts don’t support this. One of the Columbine shooters used 10-round magazines, and the Virginia Tech shooter used mostly 10-round magazines. The shooter from the recent Florida school shooting, although he had an AR-15-style rifle, used 10-round magazines to commit the crime. And Maryland, where the most recent school shooting occurred, already has laws banning the purchase of “high-capacity” magazines.

The common theme among most of these arguments is that more laws will make us safer. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. Criminals don’t obey laws. Instead, maybe it’s finally time to realize that gun-free zones don’t work and that we are our own best defense against being a victim.

"YouTube Suspends Gun Manufacturer, Bans Instructional Gun Videos","YouTube has updated its policies on content featuring firearms, leading to the suspension of a large gun manufacturer and forcing popular gun content creators to remove videos from their channels.

“While we’ve long prohibited the sale of firearms, we recently notified creators of updates we will be making around content promoting the sale or manufacture of firearms and their accessories, specifically, items like ammunition, gatling triggers, and drop-in auto sears,” reads a statement from a YouTube spokesperson.

The list of prohibited content now includes links to sites that sell firearms, videos that teach installation of certain accessories, and videos that teach the entirely legal acts of manufacturing guns and reloading ammunition. Here are the specific guidelines from YouTube:

YouTube prohibits certain kinds of content featuring firearms. Specifically, we don’t allow content that: Intends to sell firearms or certain firearms accessories through direct sales (e.g., private sales by individuals) or links to sites that sell these items. These accessories include but may not be limited to accessories that enable a firearm to simulate automatic fire or convert a firearm to automatic fire (e.g., bump stocks, gatling triggers, drop-in auto sears, conversion kits), and high capacity magazines (i.e., magazines or belts carrying more than 30 rounds).

Provides instructions on manufacturing a firearm, ammunition, high capacity magazine, homemade silencers/suppressors, or certain firearms accessories such as those listed above. This also includes instructions on how to convert a firearm to automatic or simulated automatic firing capabilities.

Shows users how to install the above-mentioned accessories or modifications.

Spike’s Tactical, a Florida-based manufacturer of guns and accessories, posted on their Facebook and Instagram on Tuesday that their YouTube account has been suspended for violating community guidelines.

This is not the first time YouTube has tightened its firearms policies. After the Las Vegas shooting, YouTube ruled that videos instructing how to install bump stocks fell under the category of “harmful and dangerous content.”

“We have long had a policy against harmful and dangerous content,” a YouTube spokesperson told The Telegraph. “In the wake of the recent tragedy in Las Vegas, we have taken a closer look at videos that demonstrate how to convert firearms to make them fire more quickly and we’ve expanded our existing policy to prohibit these videos.”",https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/21/youtube-suspends-major-gun-manufacturer-bans-instructional-gun-videos/,2018-03-21
How Climate Pressure Tactics Paved The Way For Gun Control Bullying,"The gun control lobby is borrowing the playbook from one of the most effective propaganda campaigns in history: anthropogenic global warming.

From engaging celebrity activists to bullying private industry to portraying opponents as murderers, the well-funded and highly-orchestrated gun control lobby is copying the same approach that has been successfully deployed by the international climate change movement to sell the dubious claim that humans are causing global warming.

Indoctrination and Exploitation of Children

Textbooks are filled with bogus scientific “studies” about global warming and dire warnings about its consequences. Schools commemorate environmental holidays like Earth Day, so they can push climate dogma. Teachers are encouraged to tag climate change in every subject area from science to health to history. And whoever disagrees, or even mildly objects, is portrayed as a child-hating monster. After all, who wants to deny a safe future for our kids? Climate crusaders are even using children as litigants in lawsuits to sue the federal government for violating “the youngest generation’s constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property, as well as fail[ing] to protect essential public trust resources.”

Gun control activists are now seizing on that strategy. They are shamefully capitalizing off the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last month, turning teen victims into celebrities and peddling these kids to news outlets as if they were candidates for public office. Just like the climate change cabal, powerful gun control interests will hide behind the façade of children to promote their policy agenda.

Despite early assurances that the Parkland students’ uprising was purely organic, we now know that it was not: Deep-pocketed powerbrokers including former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the country’s largest teachers’ union began funding and coordinating the campaign mere hours after the massacre ended.

Last week, millions of schoolchildren — with the approval of their parents and educators — defied normal rules and walked out of class in an act of fealty to the gun control lobby. The walk-out was strongly supported by the National Education Association:

Since the horrific shootings in Parkland, Florida, students across the country have launched an inspired movement to demand long overdue action on school safety and gun control. NEA, its affiliates, and members throughout Florida and the nation, support these calls to prevent further school massacres. Educators may also wish to discuss school safety and gun violence issues with their students.

The pile-on continues this weekend. Children will gather this Saturday in Washington, D.C. and around the country to participate in the March For Our Lives, the latest protest purportedly organized by kids to demand that adults enact strict gun control laws: “March For Our Lives is created by, inspired by, and led by students across the country who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar. School safety is not a political issue. The mission and focus of March For Our Lives is to demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be immediately brought before Congress to address these gun issues.”

Marc Morano, the head of Climate Depot, a website devoted to exposing the climate cabal’s phony science and shady tactics, writes about how children are weaponized by adult activists in his latest book, “The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change:

If you can’t convince adults, who is a more willing and pliable audience than children? Kids from kindergarten through college are prime targets for the climate change fear promoters’ propaganda. Politicians, academia, Hollywood, and global warming activists have focused on kids, feeding them a steady diet of fear and doom, using vulnerable children to promote climate fears. The media amplifies these tactics.

Sound familiar?

Since Feb. 14, the gun control lobby has closely emulated the winning game plan of the climate change movement. Here are a few examples:

Recruiting A-list Celebrities

Several Hollywood titans are supporting the March For Our Lives. George Clooney and his wife, Amal, contributed $500,000, an amount that was quickly matched by Oprah Winfrey. Other benefactors include Steven Spielberg and wife Kate Capshaw, and producer Jeffrey Katzenberg. Celebrities such as Reese Witherspoon, Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber, and Jessica Alba are busy one-upping each other on social media with posts and tweets demanding gun control legislation.

And, just like the hypocritical climate celebrities who fly private jets and cruise on pricy yachts powered by fossil fuels, these folks all benefit from armed bodyguards and live in gated mansions. As Morano writes about climate celebrities: “Stars regularly harangue Americans to sacrifice in order to save the planet. They call for more austerity for the rest of us, but are they willing to walk the walk in their own lives? I think you already know the answer.”

Would Oprah, Clooney, et. al. be willing to forsake their private security detail? No chance.

Threatening corporations: The climate mob has long targeted fossil fuel companies for their alleged role in causing global warming, filing nuisance lawsuits to inflict debilitating financial damage. (A hearing in the nation’s first climate science lawsuit was held on March 21 in San Francisco. The defendants are being blamed for rising sea levels.)

Since gun makers don’t have the same deep pockets as Exxon-Mobil, the gun control lobby took a different route. Almost immediately after the shooting, activists began coercing companies to abandon their support for the National Rifle Association; several did. Dick’s Sporting Goods, United Airlines, and Enterprise Holdings were among the businesses bullied into submission. The move backfired on one company: The Georgia legislature revoked $40 million in scheduled tax credits for Delta Airlines after it publicly ended a discount program for NRA members.

Reviling the Opposition

If you oppose either gun control or climate change, you are a killer. Republican lawmakers, NRA members, and regular citizens who oppose stringent gun control laws are accused of having “blood on their hands.”

Alleged comedian Chelsea Handler summed it up with this tweet:

We have to elect candidates that are not funded by the NRA in November. We have an opportunity to elect candidates who won’t allow kids to go to school and get shot. It is disgusting how many times this has happened and Republicans do nothing. You all have blood on your hands. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) February 14, 2018

Climate change deniers and gun control detractors are also denounced as industry shills, bought off by special interest groups. Activists routinely post the amount of money politicians have accepted from the NRA or fossil fuel companies and attempt to intimidate lawmakers into rejecting those blood-soaked contributions. Parkland student-activist David Hogg warned: “We’re going to hold these sick politicians who prefer the murder of children to [losing] their reelection. We’re going to hold them accountable. And that’s what we’re doing.”

Their animus for anyone who disagrees with them goes so deep that they hope the Grim Reaper will lend a hand. Bill Nye the Science Guy last year said the only way for the climate change movement to advance is for older climate deniers to die. Twitter tough guys have heinously targeted the children of NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch:

https://twitter.com/cptjaneway2017/status/974696792737681408?refsrc=email&s=11

Their venality has no boundaries.

The end-game of both the climate change and gun control movements are the same: subverting individual rights and choices while empowering the state. It has nothing to do with “the children,” no matter how many phony marches and scripted interviews they organize.

Why Banning Abortion Will Save Millions More Lives Than Banning Guns,"Over the weekend there was a massive march in Washington and other cities to demand new laws, ostensibly on behalf of innocent lives being endangered. That sounds like another giant protest march that takes place once a year in Washington, except this one is being reported coast-to-coast, buoyed by celebrity endorsements, and hailed as the dawn of a revolution, rather than being studiously ignored or downplayed.

It should be obvious that I’m speaking of the March for Our Lives and the March for Life, two ostensibly similar marches advocating ostensibly similar views. Yet comparing the two positions reveals illuminating fundamental differences.

Ownership Versus Action

Of course the most obvious distinction is in the subject matter: one favors limiting or ending gun owners, the other limiting or ending abortion. Let’s consider the two subjects, for here the crux of the matter rests.

Gun rights deal with a person’s right to own a particular tool for a particular purpose. Put briefly, a gun is a weapon; weapons are used in fighting. People want to own guns so if they ever need to fight to defend themselves, their families, or their rights, they can do so effectively. There are obvious and legitimate reasons why they would want this, ranging from violent attackers to civil unrest.

But, although they have legitimate uses, guns by nature are open to abuse. They allow a person with evil intent to inflict more damage than he would otherwise. Gun-control advocates argue the potential for abuse is greater than the legitimate need for private firearms, at least with regards to certain weapons. In other words, gun control advocates wish to limit access to guns in order to limit their potential for abuse.

Abortion rights deal with a person’s right to do or have done a particular procedure. This procedure, by definition, destroys a human life: specifically the human life the people in question created by having intercourse, whether consensually or violently. They desire this because, to one degree or another, the life to be destroyed is unwanted or inconvenient and was not intended to be created.

Although the reasons for wishing to destroy this life may be understandable, abortion still destroys an innocent human life. Moreover, in most cases that innocent human life was created by other people voluntarily engaging in an act they knew could lead to this outcome. Pro-life advocates argue that deliberately killing an innocent human being simply cannot be justified, save in cases of direst need such as when the life of the mother is at stake.

In other words, pro-life advocates wish to forbid a particular action that, by definition, destroys a human life.

Note the difference: one involves a right of possession, the other of action. To own a gun says nothing of how it is used, and there are clearly legitimate reasons someone would want to own one. To perform an abortion, on the other hand, means to kill a human life, and the only question involved is whether such an act can be justified. Gun-control advocates argue that the undeniable potential for abuse outweighs the undeniable goods derived from gun ownership, while pro-life advocates argue that abortion itself is an unjustifiable action.

Responsibility Versus Irresponsibility

This difference points to another: private firearm ownership presupposes a degree of self-control and responsibility. Owning a weapon demands treating it with respect for the power it conveys. If we permit a person to own firearms, we assume he is a reasonably mature, independent moral agent who is able to act rationally and responsibly.

Those in favor of gun ownership seek to take responsibility for their own lives and actions, rather than being pre-judged incapable of doing so. Now, whether or not a given individual is capable of this is a legitimate question, but ultimately beside the point. The point is that to seek gun ownership means to ask for greater responsibility for one’s life and to be judged accordingly.

Furthermore, the reason behind gun ownership is for the individual to be able to defend himself, his family, and his property without having to depend upon official institutions for protection. It demands that he not only treat his gun with respect but also be able to judge when it ought to be used and be able to use it. The right to gun ownership, therefore, means the right to take responsibility for one’s own life. Whether you believe in gun ownership or not, that is what the position objectively is.

On the other hand, abortion presupposes a lack of responsibility and moral agency. It is precisely a means to escape from the consequences of one’s choices: to be able to enjoy sexual intercourse without having to care for any children that result. It demands the power to destroy developing life that one’s own choices created, meaning the power to escape moral responsibility.

To this, of course, some raise the issue of rape. So should abortion should only be legal in cases of rape and similar crimes? Those who think so essentially agree with the principle being discussed, and we may leave that issue for another time.

Those who think not haven’t added anything to the conversation by raising this issue. Rape and similar matters account for a very small number of abortions, and we may take such cases as a separate question. When people advocate against abortion, they are primarily thinking of the vast majority of cases, in which abortion follows consensual sex as a means of birth control.

I am not here making any statement about that consensual sex, as that’s a different discussion. I’m merely saying abortion means destroying a human life that sex created. The creation of human life is an entirely predictable result of engaging in intercourse. Therefore, abortion, by definition, means removing the consequences of what is, as a rule, a voluntary act. So it is a means of escaping responsibility. Whether or not you think abortion can be justified, that is what it objectively is.

Thus, a pro-gun position demands personal responsibility. A pro-abortion position demands an escape from it.

Clarity of Vision

Finally, there is the difference in goals and vision. The pro-life movement’s goals are straightforward enough: end abortion, or at least end common, voluntary abortion not involving rape or serious health issues. Pro-lifers argue this would save millions of innocent lives, which is simply fact, since abortion by definition means killing a human life. The goal of the pro-life movement is thus so straightforward as to be a tautology: don’t kill people and those people won’t be killed.

On the other hand, the gun-control movement’s goals and reasons are far more vague and dubious. For instance, the immediate issue of the Washington march seems to be another assault weapons ban (although the rhetoric seems to be demanding much more, further pointing to the vagueness of their position).

The goal of the pro-life movement is thus so straightforward as to be a tautology: don’t kill people and those people won’t be killed.

This first raises the question of what constitutes an “assault weapon,” and second the issue of whether this would actually help. Even assuming the broadest definition of assault weapon, and assuming the ban were effective, this would only mean a change in weapon choice for the next mass shooter, and more mass shootings have been committed with handguns than with rifles. It seems reasonable to assume that, if rifles were not available, potential mass shooters would simply use handguns, and so on and so forth down the list of weapons until we come to knives and bombs.

This is the elephant in the room for gun-control advocates: all this effort, all this anger, and all for something unlikely to actually help. If the pro-life movement manages to ban all abortions after a certain developmental stage, that means a clear limit to the number of people killed because what is being banned is the act of killing itself. There is a clear expected benefit to their advocacy, and that benefit (fewer people killed by abortion) rises the further the position is pushed.

But if the gun-control movement manages to ban semi-automatic rifles, that won’t save a clear number of lives that those rifles would have killed, because what is being banned is simply a tool that may or may not have been used to commit murder, and whose absence certainly will not prevent the attempt. The expected benefit (fewer murders and mass killings) is dubious at best, and remains dubious no matter how far the position is pushed.

If you ban all abortion, then nobody is legally killed by abortion. It is a simple one-one exchange. If you ban all guns, it doesn’t mean no one is legally killed by guns (since that has never been legal). It only means the general populace is denied the right to defend themselves and becomes further dependent upon government institutions while becoming more vulnerable to violent aggressors.

In other words, one movement demands greater responsibility for individual citizens and less institutional control. The other demands the reverse. One argues man is a moral agent who is responsible for his own actions. The other argues that man cannot be trusted, only institutions.

Behold the American political divide in a nutshell.

Bataclan Survivor Jesse Hughes Condemns Gun Control March,"One of the singers who survived the 2015 Bataclan massacre in Paris spoke out Sunday against the students who participated in the gun control march, calling their policy solutions childlike and referring to them as “disgusting vile abusers of the dead” in a lengthy Instagram post.

“As the survivor of a mass shooting I can tell you from first-hand experience that all of you protesting and taking days off from school insult the memory of those who were killed,” Jesse Hughes wrote, “and insult me and every other lover of liberty by your every action.”

Hughes is a member of Eagles of Death Metal, the band that was playing at the Bataclan concert venue when Muslim extremists shot 89 people to death in November of 2015. He posted an anti-gun control cartoon along with the comments, in which a woman tells a man she turned in her gun to stop violence, and he says he chopped off his own dick to stop rape.

Students advocating for strict gun control measures marched in Washington, D.C. on Saturday in response to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 students.

“The best thing to do to combat chronic abusers and disregarders of the law(like the law against Murder) is to……..pass another Law!…..Genius!!!…… ” he wrote. “But before we pass this law we’re going to denigrate the memory and curse ourselves by exploiting the death of 16 of our fellow students for a few Facebook likes and some media attention….and look how well civil rights abuses as it concerns firearms helped to protect me and my friends in Paris!!!!! This almost sounds like the plan of like a kid maybe like a high school student….!. Oh wait that’s right…. ”

Here’s the full Instagram post:

Hughes has previously spoken out against gun control as a proper response to mass shootings. “Did your French gun control stop a single person from dying at the Bataclan?” he asked on a French TV network in the wake of the attack. “If anyone can answer yes, I’d like to hear it, because I don’t think so. I think the only thing that stopped it was some of the bravest men that I’ve ever seen in my life charging head-first into the face of death with their firearms.”

He was reportedly turned away from the Sting concert that reopened the Bataclan, after suggesting security at the venue played some role in the attack. He later apologized for making the “baseless” accusation.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/26/bataclan-survivor-jesse-hughes-condemns-gun-control-march/,2018-03-26
Gun Controllers Argue For Banning The Wrong Half Of A School Shooting,"School shootings aren’t shocking any more. Of course they’re tragic, heinous, impossible to understand and painful to experience, even from afar. But can anyone really claim to be shocked by them anymore?

My initial reaction to hearing of an active-shooter situation is “Oh no, not another one!” Our familiarity with the narrative of a child killing his peers is a tragedy in itself. And, in today’s world of instant opinion, each instance is used within minutes to prove a point, or even to push for a certain public policy. Sadly, these shootings aren’t just tragedies, they’re data points. And they’re trending upwards.

So, mostly well-intentioned people on both sides, including yours truly, find the nearest keyboard. “We have to do something!” we say. Before we know it, we’ve divided ourselves into two sides on the issue, each opposing the other passionately. It is easy to forget that both sides are passionate because they want to see themselves and their loved ones safe.

Classical Versus Romantic Thinkers

A website once told me every man should read a book called, “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.” I like motorcycles, so finding a free download of the book, I started to read it. I don’t recommend it, as it had some disparaging things to say about religion, for one thing. But one concept the author articulated has stuck with me, and I think it helps define both “sides” of this argument respectfully. The author, Robert Pirsig, separates human understanding into two forms: Classical and Romantic. He explains,

A classical understanding sees the world primarily as underlying form itself. A romantic understanding sees it primarily in terms of immediate appearance. If you were to show an engine or a mechanical drawing or electronic schematic to a romantic it is unlikely he would see much of interest in it. It has no appeal because the reality he sees is its surface… But if you were to show the same blueprint or schematic or give the same description to a classical person he might look at it and then become fascinated by it because he sees that within the lines and shapes and symbols is a tremendous richness of underlying form.

In the book, the narrator uses his friend John as an example of a romantic thinker. When his motorcycle breaks down, he takes it to the experts. When the narrator suggests he fix it himself, using a tin can as a shim, he’s insulted that a can could be used to fix his expensive motorcycle.

The book’s narrator is a classical thinker, partly because he’s seen the “experts” do more harm than good to his machine. If his bike is running rough, he mentally catalogues the systems in the machine and considers which part of which system could be causing the problem.

Maybe you can see by now where I am going with this. The disagreement on what to do about school shootings can also be explained by the same categories: romantic thinkers want the “experts” to do something about it. Classical thinkers fear they will be deprived of the tools to do something about it themselves.

That’s a legitimate fear, because, in almost every case, that’s exactly what the “experts” want to do: ban guns, or a certain kind of gun, or a certain accessory to a certain kind of gun. If those weapons aren’t available, people won’t be able to use them on each other, they say. But let’s exercise a classical way of thinking on this problem. Let’s break down the problem into its distinct systems and look at what’s malfunctioning.

What Every School Shooting Has in Common

Every school shooting has two factors in common: guns and a violent person. So, let’s pretend we can get rid of one of those things and see how the other works on its own. If we get rid of guns, what do we still have? A person who wants to kill other people and can find other means to do it. But if you get rid of the violent person, what do you have? An inanimate object. A paper weight, so to speak.

Every solution the “experts” suggest leaves classrooms at risk from those still-violent students, but, yes, it’s possible that banning guns will stop the segment of potential shooters who are too lazy or stupid to come up with other means of violence. But in stopping that segment of violent people, we’d also hamper the ability of peaceful people to defend themselves against creative and motivated killers. Or, in other words, we’d take away the tool that would let people deal with the remaining problem themselves.

Of course, “Guns don’t kill people,” but they do make it easier to kill people. They make it easier for bad people to kill good people, and for good people to kill bad people. The lethality of firearms is the basis for both sides’ arguments.

As we can see in our little diagnostics exercise above, however, banning guns doesn’t fix the problem. The guns are doing exactly what they’re designed to do: firing when the trigger is pulled. It’s the people pulling the triggers who are malfunctioning.

How to Make Violent People Disappear

We could fill reams of paper digging into what “weaponizes” these students: is it violent movies, TV, and video games? Is it the loneliness brought on in part by social media? Is it growing up without a role model? Not having friends?

Is it a parent who never bothered to get a gun safe or never spent time with his kid? Is it a police department that never followed up on reports? A federal program that directed them specifically not to follow up on reports? A news media that ensures every mass murderer’s name and face is imprinted on the mind of every viewer and maintains a hall-of-fame-like list of killers and their body count for the mentally disturbed to aspire to surpass? Is it the fact that they were never taught that every person has dignity as an image bearer of God?

All of these may indeed be factors, but there’s something else, too. I grew up watching old reruns of “Bewitched” on TV Land. Imagine you were a student sitting in a classroom with a gunman aiming down his sights on your class and you could wiggle your nose to make either him or the gun disappear, but not both. Which would you get rid of to guarantee safety for your class?

Of course, we can’t do it by wiggling our noses, but our goal should be making the violent student disappear, hopefully by improving our culture and giving him a healthy, happy, and fulfilling life. But when we can’t ensure that our society is not producing killers, we must be sure that the “experts” do not take away the remaining tool to keep our loved ones safe.

"In High School, I Supported Gun Control. Now, I’m An NRA Member","When I was 16 years old, I would have voted to take your right to own a gun away. The Columbine massacre happened in April 1999, when I was a junior in high school. While not the first school shooting, it was the first to rage across the country and the world instantaneously in the new digital age.

The news was omnipresent, and I remember watching the reports unfold live on TV in homeroom. As with 9/11, we watched the news in shock and growing fear. Being in school was tangibly frightening as the hallways slowly closed in on us and each classroom felt like a cage. I watched the door as shadows passed by, fantasizing about what I would do if it happened here.

I grew up in a rural town where so many students and teachers took off for the first day of hunting season, school closed. My grandfather kept a gun in his side table by the TV and a rifle over the doorframe in the kitchen. He got his first gun when he was eight years old, and loved telling me stories of receiving rifles and handguns each birthday and Christmas.

He and his childhood friends took their guns with them to play in the woods. They shot cans, trees, and the occasional squirrel. My dad received his first gun when he was 12. Part of his physical education class was shooting practice on the football field, where he and his classmates brought their own guns to school.

My grandfather bought me a BB gun when I was eight years old. He taught me how to use it. I remember standing in the backyard aiming at anything I thought wouldn’t ricochet back and firing until I ran out of BBs. My dad didn’t like guns, and didn’t want me to use one for fear I might hurt myself. But my grandfather insisted I learn, at the very least, how to aim properly.

Shooting a Pigeon Turned Me Off Guns

After shooting a pigeon at the request of my grandmother and feeling guilty for hurting it, I decided I didn’t really like guns either. In my class, this made me kind of weird. Most of the boys my age had killed their first deer by age 10 or 11, and handguns and rifles were common.

By the time I entered college, I had become an active anti-gun advocate. I thought there was absolutely no purpose to having a gun. I joined the anti-war movement during the Bush years and viewed gun ownership as a symbol of the backwards, redneck, military culture George W. Bush represented that I and all my friends despised.

I wrote papers arguing against the Second Amendment on the grounds that it was outdated and, like so many other things in our culture, rooted in hatred and insecurity. I chanted all the slogans and repeated all the same arguments, and my professors glowed with approval. I genuinely believed I had the answer to the problem.

My grandmother’s second husband carried a gun with him, had a few hung over doorways, and even had a specially made belt with a tiny pistol on the front. During my anti-gun years, he was my evidence for why gun ownership equated with intolerance and ignorance. I looked at him as a relic of a time long since overwritten by progress, and I smugly smirked at the idea he and his generation would soon be gone and this madness would end. I saw him as dangerous, irrational, afraid, and putting other people’s lives at risk, all for the sake of his need to feel secure.

Then I Became Strong Enough to Examine Myself

A few years into conservative thinking, reading, and arguing, I recognized my opposition to guns came from social snobbery more than reason. I genuinely believed all we needed was a government declaration that guns were no longer legal. None of those ideas were challenged in a way that changed my mind. To this day I am uncomfortable around guns and do not have an interest in owning one. What changed was my view of my rights.

My grandfathers and dad held a deep understanding of their right to own and carry firearms. It was so normal to them it seemed absurd to suggest otherwise. My dad chose not to have a gun around, although he never let go of a childhood rifle he kept locked away “just in case.” His desire to protect me from harm motivated his restriction on my gun education as a child, but he never forbade me from pursing it as an adult. It was always my choice.

But I saw gun ownership from a position of emotional danger. Other people owning guns felt like a direct threat to my safety. The fear originated from sitting in class in 1999 and simply grew over time as I imagined what danger I could be in everywhere I went.

I changed my mind when I realized the Second Amendment was a recognition of an inherent right rather than something the government allowed us the freedom to enjoy. Like speech, it became clear to me that this right had more to do with liberty than personal security or interest. Restricting gun ownership is an act of government infringement on our civil rights.

The Root of Gun Control Is Irrational Fear

Progressives are afraid. The media has developed in our culture a sense of tangible fear in much of the population of potential harm to their families. While gun advocates see this particular weapon as a defense against the violence of our world, progressives view it as a singular source of that violence. They have developed a phobia so profound that they cannot rationally assess the actual danger involved and simply lose themselves in hysteria.

Guns are scary because they represent every social stereotype progressives fear in America solidified into a single, direct threat to their safety. They believe the only solution is government intervention to protect them from that threat.

Parkland students have been emotionally traumatized from the shooting at their school, regardless of their proximity to the actual violence. I was thousands of miles away, watching the aftermath on television, and it deeply affected my sense of security. But these students also demonstrate a profound intellectual separation from how my grandfather’s generation viewed gun ownership, or rights as a concept, and they are not alone.

A generation of progressive activists have grown up with the same fear, paranoia, social disdain, and prejudice that I did, and they are leading massive advocacy groups today. They organized the March for Our Lives event and reach young people who have experienced the threat of gun violence from the media their entire lives.

This is not a rational argument. No amount of insistence that my grandfather had a right to do what I felt threatened my safety mattered to me. No statistic or comparison to other forms of violence persuaded me, because the gun represented an America I wanted erased from history. The gun itself is an object of tribal association and a psychological token of both freedom and helplessness.

Our Culture Has Changed, and So Must the Arguments

I became a pro-gun advocate and joined the National Rifle Association because I so strongly value liberty and deeply oppose government infringement on my civil rights for any reason that I realized I had no other choice. When my husband excitedly tells me he wants to learn to use guns, I smile knowing he is free to do so.

Everyone my age and younger has had a dramatically different experience than those who lived in a time when gun ownership was simply part of daily life.

Yet progressives want relief from their own terror and believe further restriction of rights they do not value or even recognize as valid will provide that relief. We can recognize that emotional experience without submitting to the hysteria. No restriction, background check system, or limitation will ever be enough, and no gun ban will ever satisfy the need to regulate violence out of humanity.

But we have to carefully look at our messaging. We cannot preach to the same choir and assume there is enough momentum to cancel out the media narrative. I am 35 years old, and everyone my age and younger has had a dramatically different experience than those who lived in a time when gun ownership was simply part of daily life without consequence.

The answer will come from security and prevention without restricting rights. A generation of children must grow up knowing that good guys with guns keep them safe, personal protection is the best defense against violence, and guns are simply a tool one can learn to master.

The choice to opt in, like my dad gave me, is insufficient. Gun owners need to make sure their kids are comfortable using guns now and taking an active part in local schools and government to ensure guns are not automatically viewed as a threat.

We cannot rely on public education to properly teach the principles of the Constitution or the value of liberty. This is going to take collective action and a recognition that we are not just fighting for a right, we are fighting for future generations to appreciate why inherent rights are needed in the first place.

"No, Remington Isn't Filing For Bankruptcy Due To Gun Control Push","Remington, the country’s oldest firearms manufacturer, has filed for protection from bankruptcy. Although they announced their intentions to file for bankruptcy through Chapter 11 in February, many activists pushing for gun control are celebrating as if this filing was a direct result of their marches over the weekend.

“I have chills,” one user tweeted, along with a link to a report on the filing. “We are watching history right now.”

Remington, which just filed for bankruptcy protection, is the parent company of Bushmaster, makers of the AR-15 assault rifle.

Unfortunately for these folks, Remington’s decline has been long and obvious to anyone paying attention to their development of new firearms, falling standards in quality control, and gross corporate mismanagement.

This Was A Long Time Coming

In 2007 Remington was purchased by the Freedom Group and their giant backers, Cerberus Capital Management, a massive private equity firm. Cerberus spent the early aughts purchasing popular, big name brands in the firearms industry like Bushmaster, DPMS Panther Arms, and others. Unfortunately for Remington, Cerebus’ claim to fame happened to be driving companies into the ground, notably Chrysler.

Failure To Launch

Remington has suffered the same fate and the writing was on the wall. Over the last decade, rather than develop innovative new products, Remington largely rested on their laurels.

In 2014 Remington launched a “new” pistol, the R51. The R51 was based off the original Model 51, a nearly 100 year old pistol with a fairly unique action called the Pedersen “hesitation lock.” It was received with some fanfare in the gun press until reviewers actually got their hands on the R51. Unfortunately, it was an unmitigated disaster. The pistol is absolutely infuriating to disassemble and clean, it’s recoil is painful, and even worse: it fails to function reliably. Reviewer after reviewer, from paid professionals to normal gun owners, found that it failed to properly feed the next round, it failed to fire when the trigger was pulled, and even fired out-of-battery, endangering the shooter and those nearby.

Remington manufactured this pistol so poorly that they were forced to recall every single R51 pistol they produced so that they could be repaired. Even their updated Gen 2 versions suffered from unnecessarily complicated design and poor quality control. Remington’s complete failure to launch a new product sunk not only a huge amount of research and development dollars, but also further eroded gun owners’ trust in the brand.

Destroying The Classics

Remington’s Model 700 is a bolt action rifle that comes in just about any caliber that’s available. When you think grandpa’s hunting rifle, there’s a good chance you’re thinking about the Model 700. Back before releasing the R51, Remington settled a class action lawsuit that found that every single one of their Model 700’s with the Walker Fire Control Trigger Mechanism could accidentally fire a round, even if the safety was engaged and nothing ever touched the trigger. This lawsuit even affected rifles made before Cerberus took over ownership — more than 5 million rifles in total.

Remington was forced to offer replacement trigger systems for millions of defective rifles and they even placed advertisements during Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity talk shows to let gun owners know they needed to replace their Model 700 triggers.

Remington’s quality control blunders not only on these rifles, but also on their popular shotguns, has led to an increase in the price of used pre-Freedom Group rifles and shotguns in the secondary market. Many classified ads will actually highlight the firearm was made before Freedom Group took over to entice prospective buyers.

Activist Lawsuits Nipping At Their Heels

Any time you have to ask “which lawsuit,” you know a company is in trouble. While the trouble from Remington’s Model 700 still swirled around the company, they were hit with another lawsuit from families that lost loved ones at Sandy Hook. In November of 2017, the Connecticut Supreme Court heard arguments pinning responsibility for the actions of Adam Lanza on Remington. Many of the activist left would have you believe this lawsuit threatens the future of the company and gun manufacturing in the United States, all but forcing Remington into bankruptcy.

Unfortunately, this assessment not only ignores all recent history with this kind of legal action, but also the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. In 2005, Congress passed legislation that would block frivolous lawsuits against firearms manufacturers and dealers. This meant politically motivated groups like the Brady Center and Everytown can’t sue gun dealers or makers out of business for the simple act of engaging in lawful sale and manufacture of firearms.

This hasn’t stopped the Brady Center from convincing families to hopelessly sue the gun industry in the hopes of some kind of misguided vengeance. In 2015 a judge dismissed a lawsuit against Lucking Gunner, an ammunition dealer, a lawsuit very similar to the one Remington currently faces. Likely, the lawsuit against Remington will be thrown out for similar reasons. Just like you wouldn’t hold Ford or Jack Daniels accountable if a driver gets drunk, drives, and hurts people, you don’t get to sue companies for the unrelated actions of deranged individuals.

This Isn’t The Story The Left Wants It To Be

While Remington threw out unfinished products on the market that failed to serve the desires of their customers, new gun companies across the country expanded to meet their needs. In the same time that Remington has acquired debt and lawsuits, other companies expanded their offerings and brought new innovations to the gun market.

Don’t believe the false narrative that Remington’s bankruptcy filing is a result of gun control protests or slack on the demand curve for new firearms. The only people boycotting Remington are gun owners that are demanding a higher quality product and are buying it elsewhere. Remington’s story is a tale as old as time; the legacy behemoth grew stale lazy and was overtaken by younger startups.

People Who Worry Activists Want To Take Guns Away Aren't Paranoid,"We hear it ad nauseum every gun-control debate: “No one is talking about taking away your guns. Stop being so paranoid!” But one of the more admirable traits of this post-Parkland round of gun-control debate is activists have been willing to be quite honest about their desire to take drastic measures to take guns away from their fellow Americans.

Just this week, a former Supreme Court justice wrote an op-ed in the pages of The New York Times suggesting we should repeal the Second Amendment as a “more effective and more lasting reform” to “minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society.” Just to prevent any misunderstanding of his intent, the op-ed was headlined, “John Paul Stevens: Repeal the Second Amendment.”

Make no mistake about it. This op-ed, its author, and its placement are a very clear signal that this idea should be taken seriously. In fact, I can think of few clearer signals to and from liberal and elite culture that something should be taken seriously than a Times op-ed by a retired Supreme— the justice who wrote the dissent in the landmark Second-Amendment affirming Heller case, no less!

Yet today, engaging his followers on Twitter as he often does on this subject, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo responded to a follower concerned about repeal of the Second Amendment with this:

he is a retired justice who was talking about ways to get quick legal change on access to weapons. he is not an elected official or part of any effort to repeal 2A. it is a bogeyman to keep people scared and as such resistant to ways to stop the shootings. https://t.co/GpHXVwjcjf — Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) March 28, 2018

This is emblematic of an argument I hear all the time, but Stevens is not a bogeyman. He’s a prominent, respected advocate for a position who cannot be accused of naivete or careless misspeaking. His op-ed in the country’s most prominent publication is part of an effort to repeal the Second Amendment. This is the third op-ed the New York Times has run on this exact topic in the last year, the first two by conservative contributor Bret Stephens. In other words, it counts.

It is not the first of its kind, nor is The New York Times the only place from which such calls emanate. The message was pretty clear at times from the National Mall Saturday, from the March for Our Lives’ most prominent speakers— Parkland survivors, who were plenty frank about the rights of gun owners and their intentions.

“All for that assault weapons ban, to keep these weapons of war out of the hands of civilians who do not need them…All for the prohibition of high-capacity magazines because no hunter will ever need access to a magazine that can kill 17 in mere minutes,” said prominent survivor Delaney Tarr. “When they give us that inch, that bump-stock ban, we will take a mile,” she said (emphasis added).

Student activist Sarah Chadwick: “I say one life is worth more than all the guns in America…To the politicians that believe their right to own a gun comes before our lives, get ready to get voted out by us.”

This was not the only message at the march, but if we are to take the arguments of Parkland activists seriously, then they count. They can’t be brushed away as mere figments of our imaginations.

There was the raucous cheering from the crowd assembled at a CNN town hall mere days after the Parkland shooting when Sen. Marco Rubio pointed out some “assault weapons” bans would “literally ban every semi-automatic rifle that’s sold in America.”

Banning all semi-auto weapons may have been popular with the audience at #CNNTownHall, but it is a position well outside the mainstream https://t.co/18rMDwEfGs — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) February 22, 2018

Again, if the arguments of the Parkland community are to shape our policies—and much of the coverage suggests their moral authority makes their ideas not only an option, but an unassailable plan of action—this counts.

There are the legislative attempts banning some 100 types of semi-automatic weapons in various states and federally. There are the calls on media for blanket bans of semi-automatic handguns and long guns, some of which I’ve personally encountered from my liberal counterparts on air. They count, too.

There are the 39 percent of Democrats polled who would support repealing the Second Amendment. To their credit, a majority of them do not, but this discouragingly high minority counts.

In the past, it’s been possible to say that calls for repeal of the Second Amendment or widespread gun bans and confiscation were crackpot calls outside the mainstream of American liberalism. But during the Parkland response, that has become progressively less plausible. Certainly, the combination of all of these things cannot be dismissed as mere right-wing paranoia.

How many Supreme Court justices have to publicly support repeal of the Second Amendment for gun owners to take them seriously without ridicule? For gun-control activists, the right number is probably about five of nine sitting justices. We won’t be waiting that long.

Merriam-Webster Changes Definition Of 'Assault Rifle' To One That Matches Gun Control Pusheres,"Merriam-Webster’s online dictionary changed its definition of “assault rifle” to one that matches what gun control advocates are pushing for.

The entry for “assault rifle,” which says it was last updated on March 31, 2018, reads as follows:

noun: any of various intermediate-range, magazine-fed military rifles (such as the AK-47) that can be set for automatic or semiautomatic fire; also : a rifle that resembles a military assault rifle but is designed to allow only semiautomatic fire

After 17 people were shot and killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February, activists have been using the tragic events to make the sale of so-called “assault weapons” illegal. This push by gun controllers to regulate guns based on a gun’s cosmetic features has been ongoing for decades.

An Internet archive search shows the Merriam-Webster entry for “assault rifle” appears to be different not that long ago. A cached version of the same entry from June 13, 2016 has this definition:

noun: any of various automatic or semiautomatic rifles with large capacity magazines designed for military use

“Assault weapon” and “assault rifles” are malleable terms often used in public discourse to scare people. After all, all guns are designed to “assault” something. The usual proper use of this term is to describe fully automatic machine-gun-style weapons, which in the United States have been banned from civilian use for years. Notice that the Merriam-Webster change stretches this definition to include anything that looks like such a gun regardless of whether it shoots like one.

Yet media and politicians often use this term inaccurately, as doing so furthers their desire of getting Americans to support gun-control policies. As Sean Davis pointed out on our pages last year, when the United States had a federal “assault weapons” ban, lawmakers defined the term cosmetically instead of by function and, contra Merriam-Webster, had nothing to do with a military-esque design (whatever that means):

The 1994 assault weapons law banned semi-automatic rifles only if they had any two of the following five features in addition to a detachable magazine: a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor, or a grenade launcher. That’s it. Not one of those cosmetic features has anything whatsoever to do with how or what a gun fires. Note that under the 1994 law, the mere existence of a bayonet lug, not even the bayonet itself, somehow turned a garden-variety rifle into a bloodthirsty killing machine. Guns with fixed stocks? Very safe. But guns where a stock has more than one position? Obviously they’re murder factories.

To learn more about other firearm myths, you can listen to Sean discuss guns on an episode of The Federalist Radio Hour. There, among other things, he discusses “assault rifles” and “assault weapons” and language the media and other ignorant people use to inaccurately describe guns.

“’Military-style’ means it looks black and scary. Either something is an assault rifle — a military-issue rifle capable of select fire– or it’s not, and if it’s not, it’s not ‘military style,’” he points out in the podcast.

UPDATE: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the timeline of when the online dictionary had altered it’s definition. It has since been edited for accuracy.

Why The Left Will Admit They Want To Repeal The Second Amendment,"As Reason magazine noted last week, a cross-section of student protesters at the March For Our Lives rally in Washington believe security is more important than constitutional rights. Now, none of the measures they claim to support would prevent crimes such as the Parkland massacre, and American kids have a better statistical chance of winning Powerball than of being a victim of a mass shooting. Yet their position that Second Amendment rights can and should be sacrificed to assuage their fears is still essentially embraced by many Americans, even if gun control advocates rarely state their views so bluntly.

The problem with the gun debate in this country after Parkland is the same as it’s been over the last generation every time some horrendous crime involving a firearm reignites the discussion. Liberals keep decrying gun violence and demand “common sense” laws — to use President Obama’s favorite phrase —to remedy the situation. In response, gun rights advocates say none of the Left’s proposals, be they anodyne measures like background checks that even most gun owners support or other ideas like bans on classes of weapons like an amorphous category such as “assault rifles” and age restrictions on the purchase of some guns, would have done a thing to prevent any of the mass shootings.

That assertion is correct, but it makes little difference to those who make far-reaching claims for ideas that only nibble around the margins of the issue. In a nation awash in guns and where the individual right to bear arms is protected, there isn’t much point to any of the proposals aimed at making firearms purchases more onerous, whether rooted in common sense or not.

That is all the more troubling now that the chief spokespersons for gun control are teenage Parkland students like David Hogg. Hogg and his colleagues deserve credit for exercising their rights to speak up on issues they care about. Yet their willingness to demonize the National Rifle Association and anyone who opposes them with foulmouthed accusations about being killers of children means this dialogue of the deaf continues in a race to the bottom.

Stevens Pierces the Fake and the Fog

The good news is that former Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens has a proposal that could at least make for a more honest discussion. In a New York Times op-ed, he re-upped his idea that we should be discussing the repeal of the Second Amendment, not more “common sense” laws that can’t be passed.

Stevens says the majority decision in Columbia v. Heller that reaffirmed an individual right to bear arms was wrong. That is unpersuasive. So, too, as is the claim of former Chief Justice Warren Berger he quotes that it is a “fraud” to believe that the Second Amendment places severe though not absolute limits on the right of the government to restrict gun ownership.

The majority opinion written by the late Justice Antonin Scalia makes it clear that the purpose of the amendment was always to ensure the rights of individuals. Stevens, who wrote the dissent in the case, still thinks he’s right. By talking about repeal rather than re-arguing the case before a Supreme Court that still has a conservative majority, he is conceding that Heller will stand for the foreseeable future.

But whatever one might think about his cribbed view of the amendment’s meaning or his desire to discard it, he’s right when he says this is exactly what the student protesters, both those who are behaving in an exemplary fashion and demagogues like Hogg, should be talking about.

Yes, They Really Do Believe in Banning Guns

While Democrats and others who push for more gun control rarely admit it, guns and gun culture appall most liberals. Many make little secret of their disgust at the idea of collecting guns or even hunting. Their social media feeds are full of comparisons to countries where gun ownership is limited.

The ultimate goal of many, though far from all, on the Left is to essentially apply the same kind of restrictions to gun ownership that exist in many major cities that make it difficult if not impossible to own or carry guns. That’s why the split in this country is not so much generational as it is regional with those — young and old — who live where gun ownership is normative backing gun rights and those who live areas where it is unusual opposing them.

That’s why the debate about guns always ends in stalemate no matter what the polls say about public support for particular proposals. The incendiary rhetoric the students employ only deepens that divide and increases the bitterness and suspicion on both sides.

Democrats avoid talk about repeal for good reasons. Up until now there has been little public support for tampering with the Constitution. Even liberals pay lip service to the notion of gun rights and, as Obama often did, mock the notion that their goal is to take away the guns of law-abiding citizens.

More Honesty Is Around the Corner

In the aftermath of Parkland, the anger of student protesters and their intolerance for the views of the National Rifle Association and those linked to it is growing. Under these circumstances, the Left’s coyness about the Second Amendment may change.

More to the point, as we head toward the 2020 presidential election in which the Democratic nomination will be largely decided by which potential candidate is able to secure the affections of the party’s left wing, the time may soon be approaching when liberals will be able to own up to their desire to drastically restrict gun rights in a way that was unimaginable only a few years ago.

Although that sort of debate sounds horrific to conservatives, they should actually welcome it since it would at least provide an opportunity to talk about something real rather than the disingenuous discussion about proposals that do nothing but make the lives of law-abiding citizens more difficult.

So should the rest of the country. If gun control remains an issue that most Americans care about one way or another— and that will continue to be the case if mass shootings continue to happen every few months — then they should be debating core questions about rights and the government’s responsibility to ensure the safety of its citizens rather than diversions politicians create to convince the public they are doing something when they’re not.

It is a debate conservatives should continue to win. But whether they do or not, it is high time we stopped wasting our time fighting about things that don’t matter rather than those that do.

Does Gun Control Reduce Murder? Let’s Run The Numbers Globally,"Watching the recent emotional speeches and marches supporting gun control, I can’t shake a question that nags me: Would we be safer with fewer guns?

Gun control advocates have an intuitive argument. Guns are an efficient way to commit murder. If we reduce the number of guns in society, we axiomatically will reduce murders.

Reducing gun violence is a desirable goal, particularly when one sees shooters mowing down children. After I thought about it, I realized the question of whether reducing guns in a society will lead to fewer murders is a testable hypothesis. You can measure gun ownership and murder rates. No two countries have the same gun laws or the same murder rates.

So I jumped on Wikipedia to answer a question: Do countries with higher murder rates have more guns, and vice versa?

This question can be evaluated in a ratio: the number of legally owned guns per 100,000 versus the number of murders per 100,000. According to the theory, the ratio should be relatively stable. So countries with fewer guns will have fewer murders (a small number divided by a small number) and a country with more guns should have more murders (a big number divided by a big number).

I took the countries with the 100 highest murder rates. I added to the sample countries that compare to the United States culturally such as European countries, Australia, Japan, etc. I deleted countries for which I could find no gun ownership stats or countries that were small or obscure. My profile looked at 98 countries, or a pretty solid slice of all the countries in the world.

America is by far the country that owns the most guns per 100,000. In America, there are actually more guns than people. Our murder rate is much higher than that of our European counterparts. So far, the gun control hypothesis seems to be holding up.

But guns in America are very unlikely to be involved in murders. Our ratio of guns to murders is 20,696 guns privately and legally owned for every murder. Not every murder involves a gun. But the gun-control hypothesis suggests guns still make murder easier and more common.

The murder capital of the world is El Salvador. El Salvador has done a relatively good job rounding up legal guns. There are only 5,800 guns per 100,000 residents (compared to over 101,000 in America), yet El Salvador’s ratio of guns to murders is a staggering 53. Every year, there’s a murder for every 53rd gun in El Salvador.

The countries that have been most successful at limiting private, legal gun ownership are 1. Ethiopia, 2. Eritrea, 3. Haiti, 4. North Korea, and 5. Rwanda. Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Haiti all have higher murder rates than that of the United States. North Korea and Rwanda have slightly lower murder rates (4.4 and 4.5 per 100,000 respectively versus the United States at 4.88).

Let’s look at the countries with the highest concentrations of gun ownership (excluding Yemen and Iraq as active war zones). Guns per murder in those countries are,

United States at 20,967, Uruguay at 3,777, Norway at 55,893, France at 19,747, Austria at 59,608, Germany at 35,647, Switzerland at 35,435, New Zealand at 24,835, and Greece at 26,471.

Norway is a particularly interesting example. It has 10 times the gun ownership rate of the United Kingdom, but only half the murder rate.

When one excludes Iraq and Yemen, not one of the countries on the list of the 10 highest rates of gun ownership also appears on the list of the top ten highest murder rates. In fact, the countries with the highest murder rates have markedly low gun ownership rates.

El Savador (108.64 murders per 100,000/5800 guns per 100,000) Honduras (63.75/6200) Venezuela (57.15/10,700) Jamaica (43.21/8,100) Lesotho (38/2,700) Belize (34.4/10,000) South Africa (34.27/12,700) Guatemala (31.21/13,100) Trinidad (30.88/1,600) Bahamas (29.81/5,300)

It really doesn’t matter how you slice this data. The conclusion is inescapable: High concentrations of private, legal gun ownership do not correlate positively to increased murders. Indeed, you can look at almost any slice of data and conclude the opposite: Higher private ownership of guns can be strongly correlated to lower murder rates.

The data also exposes some myths I have heard about gun control. For example, I’ve heard activists tout Australia, which supposedly banned all guns. Australia has advanced a number of gun control measures over the years. Nevertheless, according to the data, Australia has a rate of private ownership of guns of 13,100 per 100,000 and a murder rate of .98.

Australia has almost twice as many guns per capita as the United Kingdom, for example, and a comparable murder rate. New Zealand has almost twice as many guns per capita as Australia but a lower crime rate.

Countries with both a low rate of private gun ownership and a low murder rate exist, but they are clearly data outliers. These include the Netherlands (3,900 guns per 100,000, for a murder rate of .61) the United Kingdom (6,200 guns per 100,000, for a murder rate of .92), Japan, and Portugal. Places like Norway, Austria, Switzerland, and Germany overwhelm those examples because they all have high rates of gun ownership and enviable crime rates.

An owner of a private legal gun in America measures as one of the most responsible in the world.

This isn’t a perfect study. I didn’t take the effort to include every country in the world, and I did skip many Asian countries. Nevertheless, it’s worth considering why so many countries that have relatively successful programs of limiting private lawful ownership of guns are so dangerous and why countries with such high rates of private gun ownership are relatively safe. Even in a place like the United Kingdom, where the gun control seems to be effective (with a low murder rate of .92 per 100,000), it’s arguable that the UK’s peer countries such as Germany and Austria have had more success controlling crime in spite of allowing greater freedom of gun ownership.

The ratio of murders per gun works as a decent measure for how responsible a country’s citizens are with their firearms. Measured in this light, an owner of a private legal gun in America measures as one of the most responsible in the world. A gun in America is 387 times less likely to be used in a murder than in El Salvador. Even in Japan, which has one of the lowest murder and gun ownership rates in the world, there are ten times as many murders per gun than in America.

Before U.S. governments makes anything illegal, it should be demonstrated that gun restrictions will have the desired effect. The perverse effect of increasing murder rates by reducing private gun ownership has been demonstrated in numerous studies. Places like Chicago, Washington DC, and New York have repeatedly experienced unintended consequences of aggressive gun control laws.

When marchers scream to ban guns, they’re pushing to make America more like El Salvador (1 murder for every 52 guns), Ethiopia (1 per 53), Honduras (1 per 88). All of these countries have succeeded in limiting gun ownership even if they can’t keep their citizens safe. The numbers are clear: murders are less common when the victim might be armed.

How Gun Ownership Protects Citizens From An Abusive Government,"Whenever the gun control debate returns to the national stage after another horrific shooting, media outlets and social media accounts lob the same few talking points at one another. Among the most puzzling and misunderstood arguments for less gun control is this: Gun ownership protects people from a potentially authoritarian government.

Those on the Left tend to scoff at this proposition. What could one person in a rural town with an AR-15, say, do to combat a military equipped with tanks, drones, and fully automatic weapons? Admittedly, not very much. But those who are unconvinced that civilian gun ownership protects against authoritarianism would do well to give the argument some more thought.

If well-armed citizens could not defend themselves against the U.S. Army, terrorist groups such as ISIS should have shriveled and died long ago. Instead, the U.S. government has been operating in the Middle East since 1990 trying to stamp out whichever comparatively low-budget terrorist group or rogue state was causing chaos. Still, the United States has not succeeded.

If the U.S. government did try to force its citizens into an authoritarian governing system, it would not be wise to use its vast arsenal to bomb cities and destroy infrastructure like it has in places like Raqqa, Syria. The government would be spending money to blow its own assets to pieces.

Who would be carrying out the government’s attacks? Many members of the armed forces would be appalled at the idea of unleashing U.S. military force upon their own country–especially an armed country. Although some members of the military would undoubtedly be loyal to an authoritarian government, many would side with the civilians.

Domestic organizations like the Oath Keepers, a group of past and present military, police, and first responders who swear allegiance to the Constitution rather than current politicians, are a current example of armed Americans who would not side with a tyrannical regime. The first three orders the Oath Keepers swear never to obey are demands from the government to disarm American citizens, demands to conduct searches on Americans without a warrant, and demands to treat Americans as “unlawful enemy combatants.”

The organization has come under fire for some alarmist views, and it is by no means a perfect (or particularly tasteful) group. Several of its members have expressed opinions that international terror attacks and illegal immigration are somehow orchestrated to destabilize America and revoke freedoms. Its overarching goal, however, is to keep the federal government from seriously infringing upon the constitutional rights of all Americans.

Although any one armed organization or individual owning an AR-15 would likely have no effect against a government takeover, a coalition of millions of armed civilians standing against an authoritarian regime would have tremendous power. Much like the effect of one vote, one gun will not stop tyranny. But many together can enact change and protect citizens.

History provides many examples of an armed populace keeping its government in check. Peter Leeson, a professor of economics and law at George Mason University, contends that the ownership of longbows among non-nobles likely led to the Magna Carta’s final reissue. Once documents establishing universal rights bound the aristocrats and royals, politics became more stable and monarchs abused power less frequently. Society respected the rights of the lower classes much more broadly.

Stripping people of self-defense is not only a violation of rights, it spits in the face of America’s own beginnings. The American Revolution itself could not have happened without an armed populace. The U.S. Army was outgunned and often outmaneuvered, but Americans aren’t singing “God Save the Queen” before sporting events because individuals had the agency to protect themselves from an overbearing government.

Many more examples of armed civilian resistance to unwanted government authority exist: America’s failure in Vietnam, the 1989 overthrow of Romanian Communist Nicolae Ceausescu, and the ongoing Syrian Civil War, to name a few.

The Bielski partisans, a small group of Jewish guerilla World War II fighters, were able to protect more than 1,200 Jews from dying at the hands of the Nazis. The group’s main focus was to protect women, children, and the elderly. The Weimar Republic had disarmed its citizens in 1931, and Adolf Hitler’s party seized power in 1933.

It would be foolish to claim an armed German populace would have somehow stunted Hitler’s rise to power, but from their forest headquarters the Bielski partisans were able to run “one of the most successful rescue efforts during the Holocaust,” according to the U.S. Memorial Holocaust Museum’s website. That’s obviously a positive benefit to an armed populace.

Armed civilians have the power to resist a bad government, and the collective force of millions of armed Americans absolutely acts as a deterrent to increased authoritarianism from its own leaders.

Legislators and pundits who claim the United States would be safer without guns are extremely short-sighted. The country may see a slight downtick in deaths per year, but the cost is much larger than the payoff. Self-determination through civilians’ ability to fight authoritarian regimes is much more vital to preserving rights and freedom than is the illusion of safety.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/04/04/guns-help-americans-protect-abusive-government/,2018-04-04
Read This To Understand Why It’s Rational To Support Gun Rights,"I’ve never owned a gun. In fact, I’ve never fired one. But like millions of other Americans I experience a frisson of anxiety with each lurch of public sentiment against gun rights.

The most recent paroxysm, sparked by the mass murder at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has filled the sails of the gun control movement with the winds of teenage anguish. This last of three mass murders perpetrated with semi-automatic rifles since last fall has catapulted gun control to the forefront of public discourse.

It’s brought to mainstream discussion such measures as comprehensive semi-automatic rifle bans and national gun registries, which MSD students proposed in The Guardian, as well as a repeal of the Second amendment, as endorsed by retired Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens.

At one point in my life, I would have supported all three proposals, and I understand why they seem so urgent to so many. An honest observer cannot ignore that even when accounting for population differences the rate of gun murders in the United States far exceeds those of our international peers, nor that our legal permissiveness of guns does as well. In the minds of a vocal proportion of our society, the case is open-and-shut: our permissive laws beget carnage and therefore must be tightened. The question this faction seems unable to answer is how any good person could disagree.

As someone who has seen the debate from the gun control perspective and lacks any personal history that might create a bias toward permissive gun laws yet nevertheless disagrees with the ban, register, and repeal triad, I think I can help, not to illuminate the proper gun policy, but in explaining how the other faction thinks.

Ban, Register, Repeal Threatens Our Self-Determination

What eludes the advocates of the sorts of gun control under discussion, and what they must understand they are challenging, is that for millions of Americans the gun embodies the social and political value of independence—a value I have come to appreciate greatly and that has changed my orientation on this issue.

What I mean by independence is the capability of directing one’s own mind and acting upon it without any authority’s approval. The gun can be seen as embodying this value, because it serves as a tool to maintain such independence when all else fails.

This view animates gun-rights advocates’ thinking on fundamental issues that human beings face, such as how individuals should orient themselves toward others and what are the capabilities and limitations of the state. For gun-control advocates, the gun is an instrument for inflicting harm, but to gun rights supporters the gun represents freedom from predation. It stands as a last personal line of self-defense against brutality. It delivers peace of mind. The bans, registries, and repeals being discussed threaten the most fundamental conceptions many Americans have of what it means to live in liberty.

For these Americans, mass murders (and all other acts of aggression, for that matter) do not weaken their convictions, but reinforce them. No one else’s abuse of the tool, it is held, lessens the personal value it provides to the gun advocate. A central, though often unspoken, tenet of this view is that aggression—whether by nature or entrenched social construction—is a fact of life.

It is in this context that gun owners and advocates assess questions of a person’s right to self-preservation. Is self-preservation an immutable right, or is it subordinate to statistical considerations that may suggest ban, register, and repeal could reduce the murder rate? On the independence view, the question answers itself.

Will permissive gun laws unfortunately clear the path for some bad people to enact harm? Quite possibly, but if I am to be the target of aggression, the gun qua tool of independence view holds, I want every means available to survive. That is what the gun provides.

The Point of Insurance Is to Not Need It

To those on the gun control view, this sounds like utter paranoia. Violent crime is committed at lower rates than it was during the latter half of the twentieth century and our government, although imperfect, is not authoritarian. “Why is a gun necessary?” we frequently hear.

A reasonable answer is that a reliable, effective gun is akin to an insurance policy. Am I going to be the beneficiary of my monthly renter’s insurance premiums? I hope not. But I rest easily knowing that I can draw upon my policy if disaster strikes. In this sense, gun ownership can be viewed as an expression of personal risk philosophy. Just as we needn’t all buy insurance in a uniform way, we can each evaluate whether a gun can serve as a personal safety policy.

Interestingly, the statistics often don’t tell the story the gun controllers think they do. As mentioned earlier, advocates for tighter laws frequently highlight the murder rate discrepancy between the United States and our international counterparts, as if to show that our cultural fixation only harms us.

But in doing so, they ignore that within America there is neither a correlation between gun ownership and gun murders across varying state laws, nor between the strictness of gun laws and gun murders. Might it be that the statistics suggest it isn’t gun advocates who have an irrational fear, but the gun controllers themselves?

Aggression Versus Independence

An unaddressed question thus far is, aggression by whom and independence from whom? On the surface there are two answers: criminals who seek plunder, rape, or murder; and the state itself. At essence, however, there is but one answer: the gun provides a last line of resistance against any initiator of force, whether the context be that of simple crime, an ineffective state allowing marauders a wide berth, or the state metastasizing into the gravest threat to personal wellbeing.

For millions of Americans, the right to a gun is the right to live independently, and now a mass movement is threatening to dismantle it.

For millions of Americans, the right to a gun is the right to live independently, and now a mass movement is threatening to dismantle it. Gun controllers’ ostensible aim is to live in a safe society, but from the perspective of the gun advocate the measures being proposed would make individuals dependent on and at the mercy of the state for safety and thus rob them of the fundamental right to preserve their own lives.

What gun controllers want is safety. What gun owners and gun-rights advocates want is to be at the mercy of no one else. To not be mistaken as a proponent of anarchy, I must stress that I consider the state a vital institution for employing retaliatory force. But the state is not omnipresent. A personal weapon fills the void in emergency situations of defense until the arrival of authorized state force, thus preserving independence while respecting that of others.

The safety versus independence gulf is pronounced in this context, but is demonstrated in many others, too, as Jonathan Haidt describes in “The Righteous Mind,” which lays out six moral foundations. These include a care/harm foundation and a liberty/oppression foundation, the two contrasting principles around which I believe this debate hinges. This paradigm offers great insight into the differing perspective for persons on either side.

The gulf between the gun control view and the gun qua tool of independence view is wide and deep—perhaps even unbridgeable—and only when we recognize this will we realize why calls for “commonsense” gun reform yield only acrimony.

Student: School Won't Treat Pro-Life Walkout Like Gun-Control Walkout,"The student who kicked off Wednesday’s pro-life walkout on campuses across the country says administrators at his high school aren’t giving him the same accommodations they gave to pro-gun-control students who participated in the National School Walkout last month.

Brandon Gillespie, a student at Rocklin High School in Rocklin, California, said he was inspired to organize the pro-life walkout when his history teacher, Julianne Benzel, was put on administrative leave after she encouraged discussion in her class about whether there is a double standard on school walkouts that promote gun control versus pro-life values.

“If schools, not only just our school and our administration, but across the country are going to allow one group of students to get up during class and walk out to protest one issue, would they still give the same courtesy to another group of students who wanted to protest abortion?” Benzel said in an interview with “Fox and Friends” on March 19.

Gillespie was curious to see if his teacher was right — if there really is a double standard on how media and school administrators treat pro-life students versus pro-gun-control students. He says school administrators slow-walked responses to his requests for accommodations. When he finally did get a response, they essentially told him students participating in Wednesday’s walkout wouldn’t get punished, but also would not receive any of the special perks the March for Our Lives supporters got last month.

“I asked for the same accommodation as the anti-gun protest, that teachers would be flexible in their lesson planning, and also for the availability of equipment that the anti-gun protestors were allowed to use,” Gillespie said in a statement. “I really was not surprised when they told me that they were not going to give me the accommodations and that they were not going to sanction this walkout as they did the previous one. It just confirms for me that there is a political double standard, at least in my school district, but I’m still going to be out there.”

Pro-life students from at least 144 high schools and 53 colleges across the country will walk out of their classrooms this Wednesday for 17 minutes of silence and prayer to mourn the loss of the 10 babies who will be aborted at Planned Parenthood facilities in that span of time.

This pro-life walkout was inspired by the National School Walkout in March, in which students walked out of class for 17 minutes of silence to push for more gun control laws and to honor those who lost their lives at a school shooting in Parkland, Florida earlier this year.

“Every day, Planned Parenthood violently ends the lives of 880 children,” said Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins. “Every day, Planned Parenthood targets this generation in school and online to trap us in their predatory business cycle. And for many of us, every day, we are silent, but Enough is Enough.”

"Britain’s Knife Control Is A Bad, Real-Life Parody Of Gun Control","If you set out to write a parody showing the folly of gun control, it might look something like this.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced a crackdown on knives Sunday in response to the rising levels of violence in London, which recently surpassed New York City’s homicide rate for the first time. ‘No excuses: there is never a reason to carry a knife,’ Khan tweeted. ‘Anyone who does will be caught, and they will feel the full force of the law.’… Guns are strictly regulated in the United Kingdom and the rising homicide rate in London is directly attributable to a rise in knife-related crimes, with stabbings claiming at least 31 lives to date in 2018. By contrast, New York—which has a population roughly the same size as London—has seen a steady decline in violent crime. There were 15 murders committed in London in February and another 22 in March, while New York saw 14 murders in February and 21 in March, according to murder rate statistics provided…by London’s Metropolitan Police and the New York Police Department.

But this is not a parody. It’s a real news report, which goes on to describe Britain’s existing knife control laws.

In Britain, it is currently illegal to carry a knife longer than three inches in public ‘without good reason’ and illegally carrying a knife can be punished with up to four years in prison and an ‘unlimited fine.’ Self-defense is not listed among the examples of ‘good reasons to carry a knife.’

If we outlaw knives, only outlaws will have knives—which might explain commonplace news reports like this one, which sounds like a weekend crime report from Chicago but with “stabbing” substituted for “shooting.”

Let’s not look at this as a parody, but as a kind of scientific experiment. On the one side, we have a nation in which the availability of guns has been increasing while violent crime has been going down, consistently, year over year, not just in one big city but across the country. On the other side, we have a nation that is famous for its strict gun control and confiscation of firearms, yet we see violent crime increasing. Clearly, the availability of guns is not the primary driver of crime. But we should have known that already.

I don’t know enough to say exactly what is causing Britain’s crime wave. The reports say that “much of the violence is tied to gangs,” which just kicks the question back a step: why are there more gangs and why are they more violent? But we do know enough to say what is not causing it. It is not some material factor—not poverty, because Britain is a wealthy country, and not guns, because they have taken virtually all of them away.

To look at the actual causes of crime, you would have to look at human causes, at changes in the culture and in public policy. To borrow another pro-gun cliché that turns out to be true: guns don’t kill people, people kill people. Take away their guns and they will do it with knives.

But what happens when people resolutely refuse to learn from this experiment? They will continue to follow their examined assumptions to the point of absurdity—and beyond. As we should all know by now, there is no limit to self-parody. Once you cross the Poe Horizon, there is no logical stopping point. So along comes this follow-up.

Dr. John Crichton, the new chairman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Scotland, wants the sale of pointed kitchen knives to be banned to help reduce the number of fatal stabbings. He first suggested the move three years ago, but his proposal did not win enough support from policy-makers. Since then dozens of people, including schoolchildren, have lost their lives as a result of attacks involving bladed instruments. Dr. Crichton, who took on the role of chairman in June this year, is championing a switch to so-called ‘R’-bladed knives, which have rounded points and are far less effective as weapons…. ‘We are very quick to be critical of our American cousins and the prevalence of guns but this is an issue which doesn’t even occur to us.’

As a friend put it to me, “You can’t parody this anymore. If I said next on the list will be a ban on rope to prevent suicides and strangulation, they would take it up.” But only after we finally defeat the National Cutlery Association and purge our politics of the corrupting influence of the rope manufacturers’ lobby.

Dick's Sporting Goods Just Hired A Bunch Of Gun Control Lobbyists,"Dick’s Sporting Goods, which announced in February it would no longer sell rifles to anyone under the age of 21, hired three Beltway lobbyists to lobby Congress for gun control, according to federal records reviewed by The Federalist.

The lobbying records show Dick’s hired two Democrats and one Republican from Glover Park Group, a DC-based government affairs firm, for “[l]obbying related to gun control.” No other policy issues were listed in the disclosure form filed by the firm. The disclosure forms show Dick’s pro-gun control lobbying effort began official on April 27, 2018. The official registration form noting Dick’s retention of Glover to push for gun control was filed on Monday morning.

The three lobbyists tapped by Dick’s to push for gun control are listed by name in the federal disclosure forms, which are required by the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to be filed quarterly: Joel Johnson, who worked for both President Bill Clinton and Senate Democrat leadership; Andrew King, who worked for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.); and Christina Brown, a former staffer for Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.).

Prior to retaining Glover Park Group to push for gun control, Dick’s Sporting Goods retained the services of CSA Strategies LLC, which pushed for issues such as tax reform, cybersecurity, and patent litigation reform on behalf of Dick’s during the four-year relationship between the two companies. Both firms are headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

CSA is helmed by Alex Urrea, a former Republican staffer on the House Financial Services committee. Dick’s relationship with CSA was terminated effective January 31, 2018, but was not made public until early April, lobbying records show.

Firearms Trade Group Bans Dick's Sporting Goods Over Anti-2A Lobbying,"The nation’s largest firearms trade association expelled Dick’s Sporting Goods on Friday morning, citing the retailer’s decision to hire multiple gun control lobbyists. The vote to expel Dick’s from the National Shooting Sports Foundation, or NSSF, was unanimous, the group said in a press release issued Friday morning.

“The National Shooting Sports Foundation® (NSSF®), the trade association for the firearms, ammunition, hunting and shooting sports industries, Board of Governors today unanimously voted to expel Dick’s Sporting Goods from membership for conduct detrimental to the best interests of the Foundation,” the group announced.

NSSF cited the hiring by Dick’s of lobbyists to push for gun control as a major impetus for the decision to expel Dick’s from NSSF’s membership.

NSSF’s vote to expel Dick’s Sporting Goods follows news first reported by The Federalist that Dick’s hired three lobbyists to push exclusively for gun control. Federal lobbying disclosure records show that the lobbyists were hired on April 27, 2018, for the sole purpose of “[l]obbying related to gun control.” The previous lobbyist for Dick’s, a Republican who formerly worked for the House Financial Services committee, was fired in late January. Instead of pushing for gun control, that lobbyist had focused on tax reform, cybersecurity, and patent litigation reform on behalf of Dick’s, according to federal lobbying records.

NSSF previously expressed disappointment at decisions by Dick’s Sporting Goods to no longer sell modern assault rifles or to sell rifles to anyone under the age of 21, despite there being no federal prohibition against such sales.

“Nonetheless, we are disappointed by the decision of Dick’s Sporting Goods to stop selling modern sporting rifles at its 35 Field & Stream stores, to cease sales of certain magazines and to raise the purchase age to 21 for all firearms at all its stores,” the group stated in a press release issued at the time.

NSSF reiterated its support for constitutional solutions to reduce gun violence and encourage responsible gun ownership in that same release.

“On behalf of our industry, NSSF supports effective solutions to achieve that goal, which is shared by all Americans. NSSF strongly supports and calls upon Congress to immediately pass the Fix NICS bill – named after our program of the same name – to increase the reporting of all disqualifying criminal and applicable mental health records to the FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) database to increase the effectiveness of the system on which our nation’s retailers depend.”",https://thefederalist.com/2018/05/04/national-shooting-sports-foundation-just-expelled-dicks-sporting-goods-gun-control-lobbying/,2018-05-04
More Proof The Left Really Does Want To Abolish Legal Gun Ownership,"Supporters of increased gun control claim they want “common sense gun laws.” Yet, the left’s goal is and always has been the abolition of legal gun ownership by civilians.

The left knows that they cannot ban civilian firearms ownership directly. The U.S. Supreme Court put an end to that fantasy with the D.C. v. Heller decision in 2008. That ruling acknowledged that the Second Amendment was an individual right. It struck down the District of Columbia’s handgun ban. But that did not put an end to the left’s desire to abolish civilian gun ownership.

The left and gun control advocates usually hide behind the rhetoric of “common sense gun laws.” Take this statement from the Hollywood-backed “No Rifle Association.” We apologize in advance for any sudden drop in IQ points it may cause.

But the mask sometimes slips off and their real goal of gun confiscation comes out in the open.

The most high-profile case of this is former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens’s call to repeal the Second Amendment. Stevens claims that it will make it much easier to enact gun control laws without. “It would eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States — unlike every other market in the world.” wrote Stevens.

But Stevens is not the only one who has called for the repeal of the Second Amendment. Several writers on both the left and the center-right have called for it as well. But repealing the Second Amendment only enjoys the support of 20 percent of the population.

The left and its anti-gun allies are following Saul Alinsky’s “Rules for Radicals” and attacking gun ownership. They’re launching a legal, cultural, and economic war on guns.

Anti-gunners can only legally attack gun ownership to a point. But that is not stopping them from doing what they can. Make no mistake, the left’s goal is not just to reduce gun violence, but to end legal gun ownership. The goal of their legislation is to make gun ownership as inconvenient as possible for gun owners.

Many gun control advocates claim they do not support confiscating any guns already in circulation. But Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell ripped that mask off with an op-ed in USA Today. Swalwell calls for the forced buyback of all “assault weapons.” If you don’t comply with the buyback, Swalwell thinks you should be prosecuted.

But the anti-gunners won’t just stop at “assault weapons.” They don’t want you to own any type of firearm. That’s why they’re proposing restrictions on everything from ammunition to even how you can buy a gun.

One of the left’s big talking points is “guns should be licensed and insured like cars.” They have proposed making liability insurance mandatory for gun owners. But what happens when gun owners cannot legally get gun liability insurance? New York State just shut down NRA Carry Guard, a liability insurance program for gun owners. Gun control advocates have also been targeting Carry Guard’s underwriters with boycotts.

The next front of the anti-gun movement’s attack on gun ownership is ammunition. Every gun fires it so it makes sense for gun banners to heavily restrict it. Democrats are pushing for background checks on all ammunition purchases. The problem with them is that the costs of background checks, anywhere from $20 to $40, can make a trip to the range a costly venture. It would price working class gun owners out of exercising a constitutional right.

But the anti-gun movement is not stopping there. They want to zone gun stores out of existence. Alameda County, California, has an ordinance banning gun stores within 500 feet of areas that include a residentially zoned district. There’s one catch to that ordinance, not a single lot in the county meets that rule.

Gun rights groups have sued the county, but the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with county. They have appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court sides with Alameda County, local and county governments could virtually outlaw the sale of firearms.

The anti-gun movement isn’t content to just attack gun ownership legally. Following Alinsky’s rule of “freezing, polarizing, and personalizing the target,” they’re also using the culture to attack gun owners. Gun owners are portrayed as racist and violent. Young people who learn how to shoot are interrogated by police and even suspended from school. Parents who teach their kids gun safety are demonized on social media.

A scene from the @NRA annual meeting in Dallas. 5,790 American children receive medical treatment each year for a gun-related injury; 21% of those injuries are unintentional. About 1,300 children die annually from a gun-related injury in the US. #NRAAM pic.twitter.com/6ONVhlJytG — Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) May 6, 2018

Finally, there is the economic war on guns. Gun manufacturers and their investors are being targeted for boycotts. YouTube has banned many gun videos on its platform.

New York State officials are pressuring banks and insurers to sever all ties with the gun industry. Already, Bank of America and Citigroup have announced new restrictions on gun dealers. Credit card companies are exploring ways to track gun purchases. Finally, several gun dealers, such as Dick’s Sporting Goods and Wal-Mart have announced plans to raise the minimum age to buy a gun to 21.

These attacks add up to the goal of abolishing legal civilian gun ownership. It is a way to achieve that goal without that pesky Second Amendment getting in the way.

Gun owners and supporters of the human right to self-defense need to fight back. Not only should any gun control measures be defeated, but also we need to go on the offense in the cultural and economic spheres. We should be highlighting examples of legal self-defense with firearms. Gun owners should celebrate things such as National Shooting Sports Month in August and encourage non-shooters to try shooting. We should work to eliminate some of the fear guns cause in society.

There has to be a price paid for businesses and others who work against gun ownership. The expulsion of Dick’s Sporting Goods from the National Shooting Sports Foundation for its advocacy of gun control is a good start. The refusal of Hornaday to sell ammunition to New York government agencies is also another positive step.

The power of the boycott has to be used by gun owners and gun rights supporters. There is already a boycott list of anti-gun companies that should be followed by anyone who believes in self-defense. It’s time to use our enemies’ tactics against them.

What Some Teachers Think About Carrying Guns Doesn’t Match Reality,"Last Friday evening, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick spoke on radio about the horrific school shooting that day in Santa Fe, Texas. He affirmed his commitment to Texas’ open carry laws, explaining the decision to let teachers arm is left to individual school boards and superintendents.

Students told lawmakers they wished some of the faculty had been armed. Admirable as were the officers on site, the massacre could have been limited sooner had the teacher in the next classroom—an ex-Marine—been permitted a gun. As Patrick observed, guns have not changed. The sea change was in our culture, and its effect on our young.

Monday’s New York Daily News reported, “Texas lieutenant governor blames everything but guns after Santa Fe school shooting.” After every mass shooting, gun control advocates demand tighter regulation of firearms. School shootings in particular prompt the question: Should teachers pack heat?

What Art Teachers Think about Arming Teachers

The College Art Association (CAA) wanted to know. In the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting, it polled members to find out so it could better “advocate on behalf of educators nationwide.” Given academia’s dramatically higher percentage of liberals—anti-gun by definition—than other professions, its straw poll was pro forma. The CAA’s emailed query, posted beneath a photo of a makeshift memorial outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, cued the response it was looking for.

President Trump and the National Rifle Association have suggested a proposal to arm teachers in order to protect their students against another tragedy. . . . There has been significant pushback against the idea. Law enforcement groups and teacher organizations have expressed opposition and it has been singled out as a politically motivated distraction on the part of the NRA.

Whether a classroom teacher can carry a gun warrants serious debate. Arguments must be judged on the merits, not media-generated hysteria. The CAA might have prefaced its survey with a dispassionate summary of the pros and cons. It might have clarified widely misunderstood terms (e.g. assault rifle or semi-automatic) to ensure informed responses.

Instead, it misled by omission. Offered as significant pushback is one brief HuffPost gathering of predictable opinions, all conjectural. The other is a single vitriolic diatribe in the Washington Post by columnist Eugene Robinson. Damning the proposal as “a deliberately outrageous idea” and “a ploy by the gun lobby,” he confuses name-calling (“shrill,” “desperate,” “unhinged”) with argument.

We Already Know These Ideas Don’t Work

Stay with the CAA’s first link for a moment. It takes readers to “Cops and Educators Agree: Arming Teachers is a Terrible Idea.” The objecting cops are not plural but singular: Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association for School Resource Officers (NASRC). Defending his turf, he insists schools employ SROs. What he omits is crucial.

SROs are officers-up-to-a-point, armed in jurisdictions that permit guns on campus, unarmed in others. Quasi social workers, they aim to keep off the books as many as possible names of disruptive students, especially black and Latino ones.

NASRC works to block the so-called school to prison pipeline: “SROs help troubled students avoid involvement with the juvenile justice system.” They observe the “restorative justice” mandates in President Obama’s 2014 “Dear Colleague” letter, which pressured school districts to reduce suspensions and expulsions of minorities in particular.

The Parkand, Florida school shooter would have had a juvenile record (and hence been ineligible to purchase guns) but for NASRC’s commitment to “equity in justice.” And the armed officer employed at Parkland took cover, avoiding the action he was trained to use. Neither the CAA nor its membership indicated awareness of the facts of the very shooting that sparked the poll.

These Art Teachers Went Crazy At the Idea

CAA News published roughly 150 responses. The overwhelming majority were from women (114 women to 18 men, the rest indeterminate). All but one stridently opposed the idea. Most misinterpreted Trump’s limited proposal, seeing it as a federal mandate to turn faculty into self-appointed avengers.

One woman summed up the dominant mindset: “The idea that law-abiding citizens should take on the role of vigilantes . . . is fundamentally at odds with the kind of society I want to live in.” A professor of art history wrote: “I would look for another job if I were required to carry a weapon to do this one.”

Respondents followed the prompts from the poll’s introductory paragraph. Typical responses were brief assertions of anti-gun zeal, more attitude than argument: “I am so tired of a small faction of gun fanatics and the greedy gun industry . . . . ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!WE MUST STOP GUN VIOLENCE!!!”

Disdain for President Trump merged with hostility to the NRA’s perceived stranglehold on America and its “culture of armed violence”: “Everything Trump does is ridiculous and dangerous.” “Another harebrained Trump idea.” “A Disgrace, like everything proposed by this administration and its enabling voters and congressional member, which are gutting our formerly effective government and its institutions.”

“This is a scheme by the NRA (with Trump being complicit) to push responsibility for these kinds of tragedies on to the backs of teachers.” “NO—this is a terrible plan by the NRA and the gun makers to make their coffers yet more profitable.” “This is an NRA driven idea . . . . It only serves to increase sales for gun manufacturers.” “None of this [mass shootings] will change until we remove money from elections. It’s time to stand for public-funded elections.”

Missing was any recognition of guns as a means of protection, a defensive tool that hopefully would never have to be used. Instead, there was an implicit sense that guns are not neutral objects. They have only “one purpose and that is to kill.” They are an intrinsic evil, to be hated and done away with.

One comment sums up the prevailing mood: “Guns are either irrelevant as tools for freedom, or obsolete as tools for safety.” Another adds: “When I received my terminal degree in design, I never thought terminal would refer to taking someone’s life.”

Guns Used to Be All Over Schools With No Extra Danger

Apparently gone from memory is the uneventful existence of shooting clubs in public high schools through the 1960s, later in some regions. In New York City students competed for college scholarships in citywide marksmanship contests. They brought their guns to school, leaving them with teachers until time for target practice. While growing up in the Bronx, I rode the Lexington Avenue subway with boys carrying rifle cases. It was a common sight. There was no carnage, no dread of an NRA “campaign to turn the entire country into an armed camp.”

Respondents called for abolishing “military style weapons,” semi-automatic weapons, and assault rifles but gave no indication that they understood the terms. The vast majority of modern guns sold in the United States are semi–automatic, meaning they fire a single shot with every pull of the trigger, but automatically reload between shots. A ban on semi-automatics comes close to total abolition. Also, an AR-15 is not an assault rifle. The AR is short for ArmaLite rifle, after the manufacturer.

While growing up in the Bronx, I rode the Lexington Avenue subway with boys carrying rifle cases.

Some worried that teachers might fly off the handle, or were simply incompetent. Fear of accidents and faculty inadequacy or caprice threaded through replies: “Arming teachers will only raise the level of danger in classrooms, as teachers are not mentally/psychologically infallible . . .” “Teachers are not equipped to handle the emotional strain of shooting another human being.”

“I asked students in my class what they thought about their principal having a gun. They were shocked by the idea, saying he already has anger management issues.” “Students may not feel safe in a classroom where an individual in an authoritative position could ‘retaliate’ at them and use lethal force.” “If people understood the politics of academia you don’t want us armed. I’ve sat in too many meetings where tempers flared.”

“Risk Management won’t let faculty climb ladders in my campus, but we are supposed to carry guns?” “Every student has seen their [sic] professor struggle to get the projector in the classroom to work – do you want that person to have a gun?”

In sum, clear-headed grasp of the variables of a complex issue was universally absent. Making sense of things was not a priority. Fear and revulsion are self-justifying, more like doctrinal positions than the results of critical assessment: “Guns exacerbate racism also.” “Teachers of color would become instant targets.” “We need to find a way to redefine what it means to ‘act like a man.’”

“Imagine qualified individuals being turned down for a teaching position on account of poor marksmanship.” “Arming teachers is the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard. This is one of the reasons I now teach ONLINE ONLY!!!” “Teachers need to be contemplative, to see all sides of the issue. These qualities do not serve police well.”

The CAA ruled facts out of court. It stacked the deck against the president’s tentative proposal by posting references guaranteed to stir hostility in the faculty lounge. Any discussion of gun possession by trained, willing teachers needs to take into account the exhaustive work of John Lott. His “More Guns, Less Crime” has brought thoughtful, scholarly analysis to a hot-button issue. But the CAA had its mind made up before polling members.

Prior to the 1995 Safe School Zone Act, states with right-to-carry laws let teachers carry concealed handguns at school. Lott was unable to find a single instance when faculty improperly used a permitted handgun at school. Neither could the National Education Association nor the American Federation of Teachers point to any real-life episodes of the what-if kind current CAA members fear.

"Guns Don’t Kill People, But Gun Bans Do","On May 18, another tragic school shooting occurred, this time in Santa Fe, Texas. Like always, far-left liberals across the country immediately began clamoring for the federal government “to do something” to stop future shootings, which is merely code language for “take everyone’s guns away because gun owners are too reckless, stupid, or violent to have them.”

Perhaps the most ironic part of the gun control debate is that most of the time and energy spent arguing over whether people should be permitted to keep their God-given right to defend themselves and their families focuses almost exclusively on instances in which people are murdered by criminals who legally possess guns, and almost never on those much-more-common occasions when law-abiding citizens stop murderers or are the victims of gun violence perpetrated by people who don’t possess guns legally.

For instance, the gun-grabbing Left mostly ignored and downplayed the heroism of National Rifle Association instructor Stephen Willeford, who in November 2017 rushed barefoot from his home to save countless lives at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Armed with an AR-15 rifle, Willeford fended off the murderer, shooting him twice. The murderer fled in his vehicle, but Willeford hopped in a truck driven by good Samaritan Johnnie Langendorff and the two men chased him down. The evildoer eventually crashed his vehicle and took his own life before Willeford and Langendorff could get to him.

If all guns, or even most guns, were banned, how would Willeford have been able to fight off the mass murderer? How many more lives would have been lost?

The Left also ignores the overwhelming evidence that every year, tens of thousands of people use firearms to defend themselves against attackers. According to data from the Department of Justice, “In 2007–11, there were 235,700 victimizations where the victim used a firearm to threaten or attack an offender.” In another 103,000 instances, people used a firearm to defend their property against an offender.

That means over the five-year period from 2007 to 2011, there were more than 338,000 instances in which people defended themselves with a firearm, about 67,000 instances each year. Many researchers believe those figures are too low. A far-reaching survey conducted in the 1990s by Gary Kleck, a professor at Florida State University, found there are 2.1 to 2.5 million defensive gun uses annually.

By comparison, in 2011, the most recent year available in the Department of Justice data cited above, there were 11,101 firearm homicides, and in the overwhelming majority of those cases, the offender possessed the weapon illegally. Even if you add all instances in which a person was injured but not killed by an offender, there are more instances of guns being used to defend lives and property than to illegally harm people.

The data are clear: Legal firearms owners do not pose a public threat to safety. In fact, they save countless lives every year. Why don’t these lives matter to the far-left?

Firearm bans and restrictions designed to make it harder for law-abiding people to possess guns make it less likely people will be able to protect themselves against violent offenders. This is particularly disconcerting for the countless women who own guns to protect themselves against stalkers, violent ex-boyfriends or ex-husbands, or other men who might feel inclined to attack women.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports more than 29 million women have experienced “contact sexual violence, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime and reported some form of [intimate partner violence]-related impact.” How many of these women would have been able to stop an attacker had they possessed a firearm at the time of the attack? Why don’t these women matter to the far-left?

Gun laws don’t have to be egregious and burdensome, and states have passed or should pass plenty of laws to keep guns out of the hands of violent men and women. But most “common-sense” gun proposals aren’t about keeping people safe; they are about taking freedom away from gun owners who could or have saved lives.

Proponents of gun bans argue the reason statistics show gun bans don’t work is because they aren’t enforced in every state equally. In other words, criminals purchase weapons in states where it’s easy to buy firearms then use them in states where it’s more difficult to do so.

Despite being widely repeated, this argument is devoid of reality and can’t be supported by any available evidence. Many of the states with the fewest gun restrictions are exponentially safer than states with numerous regulations and mandates. Even if you could argue states with restrictions aren’t safe because criminals are buying guns in states without restrictions, why aren’t those states without restrictions even more dangerous?

Additionally, evidence shows over the past two decades, the number of gun-related crimes has dropped dramatically, even though the number of guns bought and sold, as reflected by government-reported firearms background checks, has increased. If the presence of additional legal guns in society leads to more violence, there should have been more gun crime over the past two decades, not less.

It’s also worth noting that when applied logically, effective gun control plans necessitate massive border walls and other forms of security, because even if you could ban and destroy America’s 270 million firearms (an impossibility), guns could easily flow across America’s expansive borders. So, why aren’t the same leftists calling for gun bans and the end of the Second Amendment also calling for huge border walls?

Many evil people use guns illegally to commit crimes against innocent people, including children, but many more good people protect their friends, families, communities, and states with guns. Why should we punish them with absurd gun restrictions? It’s foolish to think doing so would magically stop people willing to commit mass murder, rape, or other horrific crimes from harming others. If a murderer doesn’t care about the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison or being executed for murdering others, how will an army of paper-pushing government bureaucrats convince him to do otherwise?

By taking guns away from innocent people, the government would not only be violating people’s basic human rights, it would also be putting everyone at greater risk. America doesn’t need additional gun bans, it needs more law-abiding gun-owner heroes like Willeford. The sooner the public realizes that, the better off we’ll all be.

Emails: Obama Team Plotted To Exploit School Shooting For Political Gain,"A freedom of information request from The Baltimore Post’s Ann Costantino has revealed an exchange between two former top Obama administration officials that sheds light on the Left’s coordinated effort to push gun control after every heartbreaking school shooting.

The exchange, which took place between then-Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and “never let a crisis go to waste” Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who had been President Obama’s chief of staff, shows the two men trading suggestions on how to use the tragedy that claimed the lives of 26 Sandy Hook Elementary School students and teachers to “tap peoples emotion [sic]” and further their goal of stricter gun control.

Just two days after the Newtown, Connecticut school shooting in 2012, and before any bodies of the dead were laid to rest, Duncan and Emanuel talked political leverage. From Costantino:

At 6:57PM EST on December 16, 2012, Duncan wrote to Emanuel in a message titled ‘CT shootings.’ Duncan asked the Chicago mayor, ‘What are your thoughts?’ Five minutes later, Emanuel responded, ‘Go for a vote this week before it fades. Tap peoples emotion. Make it simple assault weapons.’ Duncan responded immediately, ‘Yup- thanks.’ ‘When I did brady bill and assault weapons for clinton we always made it simple. Criminals or war weapons,’ Emanuel said in the email to Duncan. ‘Gun show loophole?’ Duncan responded. ‘Database? Cop-killer bullets? Too complicated?’ he said. ‘Cop killer maybe,’ Emanuel responded. ‘The other no.’ The exchange ended when Duncan concluded with, ‘Got it.’

These revelations come just after Duncan, who spent much of his career urging kids to stay in school, said in an interview and on Twitter this month that he supports a school boycott until gun laws are changed.

That the Left uses grief in the immediate aftermath of school shootings to start (and restart, and restart) the gun control debate is nothing new to conservatives, but these emails highlight that push is coordinated from the top. Compliant media outlets play along by focusing only on the “solution” that infringes on the rights of law-abiding gun owners, to the exclusion of covering any other lessons from Parkland, Santa Fe, and other recent school shootings that could point to real, common-sense ways to reduce this kind of devastation.

The exchange looks even worse in light of evidence that the discipline policies Duncan pushed as Obama’s education secretary have contributed to increased violence in America’s schools and helped the Parkland shooter avoid the arrest record that could’ve prevented him from purchasing weapons. Just two years after Duncan sent these emails about using Newtown as political fodder for gun control, his Department of Education issued a guidance letter. Through threats of expensive federal investigations, it forced dozens of large school districts to implement discipline policies similar to those in Broward County, Florida, that contributed to another school shooting.

These policies of not recording and lessening consequences for violent behavior ensured that the shooter, who committed multiple potential felonies prior to the February 14 Parkland tragedy, had a clean record. He was thus free to purchase the gun he used to kill 14 students and three school staff.

Aside from making it possible for the Parkland shooter to purchase his murder weapon, Duncan’s policies have created havoc and dangerous situations for students in districts where they have been implemented, with stunned parents being told that the policies come from on high only after their children were hurt by the consequences.

Baltimore mom Nicole Landers, who heads the Facebook support group Parent2Parent Network with her husband, and whose horrific experiences with the discipline policies at her children’s school I documented for The Federalist last month, had this to say to Duncan: “It appears that former Secretary Duncan was and is using the gun control platform to deflect from his failed educational policies which have negatively impacted nearly 51 million students and over three million teachers nationwide.”

The whole chain of events surrounding school shootings for the past decade or more showcases yet again why it’s so important that conservatives invest political energy in breaking liberal monopolies over cultural institutions. Two high-ranking Democratic officials can concoct a campaign to steer the natural response to a vicious mass murder towards a tenuously connected policy only because the ideological left controls the media and, increasingly, K-12 education.

It is critical that the Right both calls out the hollowness of these left-controlled institutions, and strengthens our own parallel organizations. Americans are increasingly waking up to fact that the institutions they have thought of as neutral or unbiased are anything but. Applying that understanding should mean supporting competition to legacy media outlets and implementing broad school choice to free families from sending their children—and tax dollars—to a public school system captive to special interests at odds with their values.

Why Gun Owners Shouldn’t Be Shut Out Of The Gun Safety Conversation,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deserves immense credit for his leadership in the immediate aftermath of the attack on students and teachers at the Santa Fe High School by one of their own community. In calling for conversations between a variety of interests and community representatives, Abbott showed he knows there is no single answer to preventing such criminal assaults. There are many perspectives. All voices should be heard.

After the attack on the church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, my organization representing the firearms and ammunition industry worked with Sen. John Cornyn to advance the Fix NICS Act, which was passed by an overwhelming majority of both houses of Congress and signed into law by President Trump. This important bipartisan legislation fills in the gap in the records that allowed that murderer to pass a background check and illegally purchase firearms, despite having felony convictions and an involuntary commitment to a mental health facility.

We need to do more to safeguard our communities. We know the Santa Fe murderer was underage and prohibited from purchasing firearms. To commit his horrific crimes, he stole the type of guns that tens of millions of law-abiding Americans own. He illegally carried the firearms into a designated gun-free zone and horrifically murdered several of his classmates and a teacher.

No single piece of legislation can address the underlying societal issues that might encourage a teenager to commit such an unspeakable act of violence. Our society must discuss mental health resources, juvenile crime, enhanced school security, and training for educators willing to take responsibility for protecting themselves and their students.

We must discuss the role of the media and the effects gratuitous on-screen violence has on young viewers. We must discuss stiffer penalties for those who steal and commit crimes with firearms. We must have an honest discussion about our responsibilities to our children as parents. We must discuss gun owners’ responsibilities that come with the exercise of our Second Amendment rights.

Members of the firearms industry believe in effective solutions that will help make our communities safer. Our industry is focused on working to prevent the unauthorized access to firearms by children, criminals, the dangerously mentally ill and others who cannot be trusted to handle firearms in a safe and responsible manner. We believe that preventing unauthorized access to firearms of any kind at any time can help prevent accidents and deter thefts, suicides, and the criminal misuse of firearms.

Run on behalf of the firearms industry, the National Shooting Sports Foundation’s Own It? Respect It. Secure It initiative was built on our industry’s long-standing commitment to safety and developed to encourage firearm safety and responsible storage. It also amplifies the firearm safety message of our ongoing Project ChildSafe campaign, which has distributed more than 37 million free firearm safety kits, including gun locks, through partnerships with more than 15,000 law enforcement agencies in all 50 states.

We recognize safely storing firearms is only one part of the solution to this vexing problem. The vast majority of gun owners are law-abiding and responsible. We know they love their children and their communities and want safe schools.

Abbott is offering an honest new approach to solving the problem. Shouting, shutting out, and insulting those with whom you disagree hasn’t worked. We’re ready for the difficult conversations our kids deserve, the ones where we all come together with our best ideas for the benefit of all.

5 Greatest On-Screen Humor Moments From NBA Finals Broadcasters,"As the NBA finals begin, basketball fans await the fourth straight championship matchup between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors. But in televising the finals, the ESPN broadcasting trio of announcer Mike Breen and color commentators Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy will offer entertainment of their own.

Known for their colorful asides, the trio’s banter can—and often does—make blowout games as amusing, if not as compelling, as last-second nailbiters.

Crazy Uncle or Amateur Comedy Team?

Although technically not anchoring the announcing team, Van Gundy serves as the centerpiece of the broadcast action. A former head coach for the New York Knicks and Houston Rockets, Van Gundy’s greatest moment of NBA “fame” came when he clung to the leg of Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning during a fight on the floor of Madison Square Garden in New York:

To say that Jeff Van Gundy has no filter in the broadcast booth would imply that he ever has one—a dubious proposition. While Van Gundy will say anything that pops into his head, former NBA All-Star and coach Jackson provides a laid-back vibe that contrasts with Van Gundy’s slightly neurotic personality.

Meanwhile, lead announcer Breen generally keeps the focus on the on-court action—or tries to, at least—playing the father-like figure to Van Gundy’s “crazy uncle” role.

Van Gundy’s Greatest Hits

Some of Van Gundy’s colorful analogies deal directly with basketball. For instance, during the Eastern Conference finals, he highlighted the Cleveland Cavaliers’ dysfunction: “The Cavs eyeroll each other more than a couple in a bad marriage.”

But many of Van Gundy’s comments have little to do with the action on the court. Here are just some of the detours Van Gundy took his announcing colleagues on over the past few months of NBA broadcasts.

Second Cousins: “What does second cousins mean?” “Well, it’s not, it’s not…I…I can’t…I don’t want to go into it.” “When people say that, I never know what they mean—or what you’re allowed to do when you’re a second cousin.” “What are you talking about?…I am so grateful for this commercial right now.”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_WSwsL-drQ

Car Washing: “It’s a ripoff…everybody in America knows it’s a ripoff…No, I’m not going with the ripoff of the undercarriage, like, they charge you eight more bucks, and then—the—you know, whatever wax they rip you off for. You start with a five dollar wash—by the time you walk out of there it’s 23 bucks. It’s ridiculous—I’m not doing it.” “I’m not playing the car wash game. I know after years of study that it’s an absolute ripoff.”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEAv-oblgig

The Royal Wedding: “How about that royal wedding today? That was nice—that was a great wedding.” “How about you setting your alarm clock to get up at 5 AM to watch it?” “I did! I’m telling you—everything was stunningly beautiful. The queen is awesome. Lime green dress—rocking the lime green. I loved it.” “If people only knew how sentimental you were.” “Oh, I mean—I was in tears!”

Jackson generally plays the straight-man role, needling Van Gundy about waking up at 5 a.m. to watch the royal wedding, or refusing to get his car washed, or suggesting that rules expert Steve Javie was “creating a monster here” by envisioning a scenario where Van Gundy became an NBA referee. The interplay between Jackson’s mellow yin and Van Gundy’s hyperactive yang provides comedic value even in the most lopsided contest.

During a 30-point Cavaliers win during the Eastern Conference finals, announcer Breen admitted “I get so nervous when we get blowout games,” because Van Gundy could go off-topic and talk about anything.

But while such a scenario would mean boring basketball, it also means good off-court entertainment from the broadcast crew. I wouldn’t mind seeing a blowout or two in the finals if it means more amusing episodes such as those listed above.

Rihanna Redux?

During the opening game of last year’s finals, Van Gundy helped create his own Twitter meme, when he focused more on the appearance of Rihanna—with whom he has a history—than a monster slam dunk by Cavaliers forward LeBron James: “I don’t know about this, but Rihanna just walked in front of me! Are you kidding me!”

Will a similar moment happen during this year’s finals? There’s only one way to find out.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/05/31/5-greatest-screen-humor-moments-nba-finals-broadcasters/,2018-05-31
Why Publix Shouldn’t Have Tried To Pander To Gun Control Protesters,"Publix is a Florida-based grocer known throughout the southeast. They treat their employees well, maintain a wholesome image, and sell what are known to us native Floridians as the best sub sandwiches on the planet. In late May, though, they found themselves arbitrarily thrust into a national gun debate in which they had no stake and seemed to want nothing to do with. They hopefully learned that there is no winning in stupid battles.

One might wonder how a purveyor of foods and dry goods got wound into a gun debate. Publix sells no guns or ammunition. Its shelves will leave you with no impression of what how the newest Austrian duty pistol handles or what you should attach to your AR. It started when David Hogg noticed that the chain, who regularly donates to political candidates irrespective of party, had made donations to state Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Putnam. The issue? Putnam was guilty of making non-particularized pro-National Rifle Association comments on Twitter, or something.

To call attention to Publix’s alleged three- or four- times removed support of the NRA, Hogg and his co-conspirators organized a “die-in” at the Florida supermarket. The idea was to lay down in the aisles of the store, inconveniencing and confusing customers, with the goal of ending Publix’s support of Putnam, and thus their apparent support of gun rights. Or something. It’s hard to pin down the purpose of the protest in light of the fact that Publix suspended all political contributions days before the protest.

Publix’s move was tactically sound. They knew a particularly rabid group of protestors had trained on them, poised to stage a PR disaster. Knowing their support of Putnam was at the core of the issue, Publix decided to temporarily suspend all political contributions and “re-evaluate” their giving process, and release a statement ahead of the protest.

It was a clever move, to noncommittally give the protesters what they were asking for in hopes they would be satisfied. The issue is, though, that the protesters didn’t actually care. Even though the decision was made ahead of the May 25 “die-in,” protesters weren’t aware of the decision until after their display, so they considered it a victory. Some reports incorrectly claimed the decision came after the protest, with protesters and journalists alike failing to do their research, further confusing the matter.

In hindsight, it is clear that there was nothing Publix could have done to prevent the protest. With only a few days of lead, they managed to suspend the donations. Hogg made an additional demand immediately ahead of the protest for $1 million to be donated to a victim’s fund and that the company “never support an A rated NRA politician again.”

There was obviously no time for Publix to respond to this. Hogg’s statement would be made and Publix would have to deal with it. Even though the company seemed to respond by ceasing political contributions, they still faced anger from the anti-gun crowd for not acquiescing to subsequent extortive demands for money and that the protesters be allowed to dictate the privately held corporation’s giving philosophy. Simple demands, really.

Anti-gun protesters were not the only ones upset about Publix’s actions, though. The pro-gun crowd viewed the company’s suspension of political donations, despite being non-committal, as too easily “giving in” to the demands of the Hogg trouppe. Naturally, this spurred yet more boycotting. Of a grocery store. Regarding guns.

The moral here is that there was nothing Publix could have done in response to the protests that would have satisfied anyone. This should come as no surprise given how ludicrous the concept of protesting guns at a grocery store is from the get-go. We know that Publix “did not intent to put [their] associates and the customers they serve in the middle of a political debate.” They were thrust into one, regardless. This comes in the midst of several other examples of nonsensical organizational involvement in political issues like Disney’s Rosanne calamity and the NFL’s various fits.

These controversies show the true absurdity of “corporate wokeness.” It’s stupid to attempt to force divisive political change through business. A business needs to watch out for its shareholders. Sure, there are circumstances in which shareholders are benefited by the company taking a stance on an issue that has the nation divided. One would probably find it pretty odd for a gun company to publicly denounce gun owners, for example.

With a grocer, however, it’s clear Publix had no interest in the gun debate, and attempting to force them into such a debate yields no winners. When businesses are forced into political battles, the question stops being about what individuals think, and becomes about cementing tribalism and reinforcing battle lines. What is the end goal? To wage ideological wars, the winners of which earn the privilege to shop at the battleground stores in which they prevailed? For us to have our stances on guns, drugs, or abortion dictate where we buy our chicken? These are stupid battles, with no winners.

Publix would have been right to ignore the protesters outright and let the event blow over. Debates at Publix should surround more comprehensible issues, like whether it is their chicken tender or Italian sub that truly reigns supreme.

Cuomo’s Idea To Let Teachers Decide When To Yank Guns Is Dumb,"In 1974 a teen walked into a New York public school with a smoke bomb, gas mask, and a rifle loaded with hollow-points. He killed three and wounded eleven. How do we address these kinds of crimes? Shall we turn to philosophers who say “Liberty cannot be established without morality,” or to our founders, who tell us “Liberty, once lost, is lost forever”?

When representatives make laws, the rational among us hope those laws do not erode fundamental rights and actually benefit the people. Often the only hammer our political representatives have is legislation. See a nail, swing the hammer. See a shooting, pass a law.

Passing a law seems to be New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s current attempt to ameliorate the pain of his people and create safety in the classroom. The Republican side of the political aisle has suggested arming teachers. Cuomo thinks arming teachers is a dumb idea.

He believes he has “a sensible, positive, helpful alternative” to arming teachers in the Empire State. It’s tough to disagree with things that are sensible, positive, and helpful. But his proposed legislation is certainly not sensible. The New York Daily News reported that Cuomo said: “[t]he President has said the answer is to give teachers guns. To me, that is a bizarre concept.” Okay, but why?

Do we think teachers would be irresponsible while carrying guns? Would teachers shoot kids who are not threats? Would bad kids tackle and kill their teachers? Cuomo has not raised substantive arguments like these against the policy he opposes. Supporting Cuomo’s position, American Federation of Teachers union President Randi Weingarten stated “[a]nyone who understands schools understands the insanity of arming teachers.”

I went to one of these “schools.” Perhaps, you, reader, even went to one of these schools. So you understand the self-evident insanity of this idea without needing to hear an actual argument? I do not. Nevertheless, we have a new idea from the governor that is apparently not dumb or bizarre.

Cuomo proposes to take guns from the homes of troubled students by government fiat. That is, if the student’s teacher senses there is a problem with the student, he or she would contact the authorities to have the family’s weapons removed. Specifically, if there is a “problem student” teachers would be able to petition a court to remove guns from the student’s home.

Cuomo says “many times, teachers are aware when there is an issue.” With knowledge of a problem child, teachers would be able, by the exceedingly swift hand of the New York judicial process, to take guns out of the kid’s home.

As a New York litigator, I am intimately aware of New York court congestion, not to mention the pragmatically slowing effect of due process when attempting to take citizens’ rights. Somehow, this proposed legislation safeguards constitutional due process, although we’re not told how. Seems like double speak.

Last year, I filed a motion on a single case that still lives in the Manhattan County Supreme Court even after seven years of litigation. The judge said it was the longest case she had on her bench. The case is still active this year.

Further, Bronx County averages two to four years before adjudication, with a staggering 5,000 felony trials in process. There have even been lawsuits filed in the Bronx saying the court’s slowness runs roughshod over the constitutional right to a speedy trial.

While the details of Cuomo’s proposed legislation haven’t been released, there is no way guns would be removed quickly under our current constitutional system through New York’s courts. The student showing alleged warning signs would be working on his master’s degree before enforcement ever took place.

Okay, so it’s unlikely guns would be taken from homes quickly, but would this proposed legislation actually help protect New Yorkers? I looked into the history of school shootings in New York state, and tragically there was one mass shooting in 1974 in the small town of Olean, New York. The student was certainly a troubled kid. But I don’t think any teacher would have known it. Anthony Barbaro never had a disciplinary problem. The shooter was ostensibly a good 17-year-old kid from a good home.

Anthony spent his entire life in Olean, not bouncing from town to town, as many a troubled kid does. He worked with his family at a local fast food restaurant, and wasn’t unemployed like your average criminally oriented kid. On top of that, Anthony was an honor student, ranking eighth-highest in his senior class. He was inducted into the National Honor Society. Anthony even won a Regents Scholarship to New York University. Anthony was not, on face value, a troubled kid.

How are teachers to know whose homes government agents should intrude upon? Perhaps, in our time, kids who are unruly in class should be first on the list. Perhaps today is much different than the 1970s.

Let’s find out. In 2004, the Secret Service and U.S. Department of Education issued a report analyzing school shootings. Of the litany of findings, some are relevant here. First, the majority of attacks were by students who had never been in trouble or who were rarely in trouble in school. About 25 percent of attackers didn’t have guns in their own homes—they acquired them another way. Third, there was only a single case in which the counselor or teacher was so concerned about a student that that person actually considered contacting a parent.

If the primary axiom in Cuomo’s syllogism is that teachers will know if kids are going to commit an egregious act, we have a broken axiom. If we are defining “troubled” as kids who actually get in trouble, then it’s not true statistically that “troubled kids” commit these crimes. Why would a teacher know more about a child’s emotional state than a parent does? Further, while of course any are horrific, New Yorkers have not faced a school shooting in more than 40 years.

Finally, Cuomo isn’t considering a web of collateral damage. What would the effect be on the kid if the teacher misdiagnosed him? Could that turn a relatively good kid south? What if he was just going through the tumultuous emotional landscape of puberty, had just been dumped by his girl, or had not made the team?

What about parents’ shame for raising a potential mass shooter? What if the parents hide their weapons? Will there be depositions, a criminal investigation, and felony penalties before anyone has done anything wrong? Will the parents be forever banned from purchasing weapons, or just until the kid gets through high school? Hindsight is 20/20, but foresight with the statistics at hand is prognostication.

I want safer schools. I want kids who need help to get it. I’d also like to imagine the best of the governor, but I’m not sure how this legislation can actually protect students in a way that’s sensible, positive, or helpful.

Economist Thomas Sowell says politicians have two main things on their minds at all times. The first is getting re-elected, and the second, whatever it is, lies far behind the first.

Since the New York legislative body is led by Republicans, this legislation will not go anywhere. But why have staffers write up legislation, why declare your proposal in news conferences, why spend tax dollars on drafting unconstitutional policy that is doomed to failure? Other than political posturing, I’m not sure. The idea seems both dumb and bizarre.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/06/18/cuomos-idea-to-let-teachers-decide-when-to-yank-guns-from-peoples-homes-is-dumb/,2018-06-18
The Purge Series Tries To Be Anti-Gun But Accomplishes The Opposite,"This Fourth of July will see the fourth entry in the financially successful dystopic franchise “The Purge,” entitled “The First Purge.” It’s a pretty good bet this latest installment will fail on a key aim of the film makers: The demonize guns and weapons. In fact, the series does the opposite.

JANICE JUST COMPARED 4TH OF JULY TO THE PURGE 😩😩😩😩😩 pic.twitter.com/DG42fr4SdY — Best of Nextdoor (@bestofnextdoor) July 3, 2018

The premise of the series is that the United States gets a new government called the NFFA: New Founding Fathers of America. Poverty and violence had reached intolerable levels, and this new regime institutes a single policy that apparently fixes everything: Every year on March 21 to 22 from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., nothing is illegal.

The idea is that human frustration gets bottled up and needs a night to completely “unleash the beast.” The resulting psychological cleansing has allegedly solved every social evil. Of course each film takes place during this macabre 12-hour period, so they’re full of violence, action, and moral chaos.

Movie producer Jason Blum told Bill Simmons about the series’ origin and meaning:

James DeMonaco, who wrote and directed all three movies…he and his wife are driving on some throughway in New York someone cut him off and he’s like, ‘I want to kill that guy,’ and the other one [spouse in the car] said ‘What if you could?’ And that was the birth of ‘The Purge.’ …’The Purge’ is really a movie about gun control gone haywire in the United States. The French translation of the title is ‘America’s Nightmare’ … In Europe and in other countries where they have a different relationship to guns they really understand ‘The Purge’ 100 percent as a cautionary tale. In this country, about half of the audience gets it as a cautionary tale and the other half the audience thinks ‘The Purge’ might not be a bad idea, which is a little disturbing.

At this point it seems Blum will eventually be recognized alongside Hollywood giants like David O. Selznick. He’s like a happy medium between the extremes of Walt Disney and Roger Corman. He makes a lot of money on shoestring budgets by focusing on quality, creativity, and originality. But like those legendary figures, when Thetis dipped them into the river she left one area of their bodies uncovered: the Achilles heel of political reality.

Recently Blum told Variety: “If every time there’s a shooting in the United States, the government’s answer is put more guns in people’s hands then what ‘The Purge’ is showing doesn’t seem all that crazy. Donald Trump keeps saying ‘give teachers guns.’ I could see him saying, ‘let people shoot whoever they want to for 12 hours a year.’”

It’s been known for a while that the latest film in the series would go after the Trump administration and the “deplorables” who made it possible. The marketing gets its point across with no frills: A white background and a solitary red cap. The words ‘The First Purge” sit where the words “Make America Great Again” should be. Not exactly subtle.

As Blum made clear, however, this series was always political. Those elements are mostly muted in the first film. It works very well as a piece of dystopia. It’s also a tightly told home invasion film, one of the more underdeveloped subgenres of horror.

It focuses on a relatable family unit centered on Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey as a happily married affluent suburban couple forced into a night of violence. Hawke’s character sells security systems and has gotten rich off protecting people from the purge night. His home is a veritable fortress, but the neighbors aren’t happy about how he’s profited from their protection. The climax has the neighborhood brutally turn on them in what is assuredly intended to be some biting critique of bourgeois values.

This film is clearly loaded with cultural and psychological symbolism for our times. The isolation Americans increasingly experience, due in part to the lack of necessity to even leave our homes, is palpable. The film actually works much more as a commentary on the breakdown of religion and the mediating institutions of Tocquevillian America than it does the Second Amendment. Unfortunately, the Left continually seems ignorant of these fundamental parts of classical liberalism and instead continually falls into Marxist tropes.

This is most powerfully highlighted in the second film, “The Purge Anarchy,” because a French Revolution-style Marxist rebellion takes place on this purge night. It’s supposed to be this critique of gun culture, but throughout the entire series the bad guys with guns are always stopped by good guys with guns. So the commentary on so-called “gun culture” falls miserably flat.

If the NFFA were truly the tyrannical fascists they’re made out to be, the first thing they would have done would be to disarm the populace. That’s what fascist and communist regimes do, to prevent the very circumstances that occur within the narrative of the second Purge film. So in a bizarrely Marxist manner, the second film actually makes an argument for Second Amendment as a guard against tyranny.

As a conservative, I found this both intellectually obnoxious and slightly hilarious. But as a cinephile it’s an utter travesty. If they were politically consistent, then the populace would have been disarmed and the franchise would have been radically different, something more akin to Dark Age warfare. This would have made for much moodier films and given them space to deal with more profound, less sanitized issues concerning violence and the darkness of the human heart.

But of course the symbolism and supposed critique of “gun culture” would be completely lost. Sadly the series fell prey to the message film fallacy, because the sermon that director James DeMonaco wanted to preach got in the way of the film he should have made.

Check out two other horror films that are superior to the Purge franchise in virtually every way: “You’re Next” and “The Green Room.” “The Green Room” is a landmark of contemporary cinema deserving of a wider audience and its own article.

“You’re Next” was made on an even tighter budget than the original Purge and eclipses it on every level except for box office return. “You’re Next” was completed in 2011 but not distributed until 2013, so “The Purge” beat it to the box office by two months. The films are similar enough that “You’re Next” seemed like a rip off.

Guns don’t really feature in “You’re Next.” The antagonists and protagonists are forced to engage with found weapons such as hammers against aggressors with crossbows. But that film also isn’t really trying to preach any message. There are some satirical elements connected to the traditional family, and Sharni Vinson’s wonderful performance is meant to have feminist resonance. Ultimately if it has any greater meaning, it’s as a commentary on these kinds of horror films by flipping expectations.

“The Purge” was handicapped by its anti-gun message, which has caused each Purge installment to become increasingly cartoonish in an attempt to satirize “gun culture.” The third film even features a midnight Mass where a priest orgastically kills a vagrant in front of an entire church of elites. It feels like it should be a joke, like some kind of perverse Monty Python sketch.

Yet while it is supposed to be satire the filmmakers certainly are not joking, which is the greatest irony of all. Having not seen the newest one I can’t comment on it yet, but given the way the series is headed “The First Purge” will be even sillier and therefore easier to ignore.

"Left Cries Extremist, But Kavanaugh Favors ‘Common Sense Gun Control’","Even before President Trump named federal appellate judge Brett Kavanaugh as his choice to replace Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, Democrats had already begun to paint whatever nominee would eventually receive the presidential nod as an extremist on abortion “rights” and gun control. Kavanaugh is neither. In fact, his dissenting opinion in Heller v. District of Columbia (Heller II), proves quite the contrary: On the Second Amendment, Kavanaugh supports “common sense gun control,” while the Left remains out of the mainstream.

The Left, however, will attempt to mislead the public on Kavanaugh’s views, by pointing to Kavanaugh’s conclusion in Heller—that Washington DC’s ban on semi-automatic rifles is unconstitutional—while ignoring his analysis. Kavanaugh’s analysis is key, however, because he not only sought to properly apply Supreme Court precedent (as lower federal judges should), he also detailed a balanced approach to the Second Amendment, consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Here’s how.

Kavanaugh Said Heller Allows Gun Restrictions

Heller II involved the follow-up lawsuit brought by DC resident Anthony Dick Heller following his victory in Heller v. District of Columbia (Heller I). In Heller I, the Supreme Court held the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms and struck DC’s ban on handguns. In Heller II, the plaintiffs challenged the revised gun laws DC adopted in the wake of Heller I. As relevant to Kavanaugh’s dissent, those laws banned the possession of most semi-automatic rifles.

On appeal to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, a two-judge majority upheld DC’s ban of semi-automatic rifles by conducting a balancing test and asking whether the law was “substantially related to an important governmental objective.” Lawyers know this test as “intermediate scrutiny.” Applying intermediate scrutiny, then, the majority upheld the local law banning possession of semi-automatic rifles, concluding that the ban was substantially related to two important governmental objectives: protecting police officers and aiding in crime control.

Kavanaugh dissented. In his dissent, Kavanaugh began by stressing what Heller I did—and did not do:

It bears emphasis that Heller [I], while enormously significant jurisprudentially, was not revolutionary in terms of its immediate real-world effects on American gun regulation. Indeed, Heller [I] largely preserved the status quo of gun regulation in the United States. Heller [I] established that traditional and common gun laws in the United States remain constitutionally permissible. The Supreme Court simply pushed back against an outlier local law – D.C.’s handgun ban – that went far beyond the traditional line of gun regulation. As Heller [I] emphasized: ‘Few laws in the history of our Nation have come close to the severe restriction of the District’s’ law.’

So, as Kavanaugh explained, while constitutionally Heller I proved significant, practically the high court’s holding had limited impact: “Traditional and common gun laws in the United States remain constitutionally permissible.”

Kavanaugh next turned to the question of how, under controlling Supreme Court precedent, courts should evaluate the constitutionality of gun laws. His analysis, which spanned some 50-plus pages, thoroughly scrutinized Heller I and McDonald v. City of Chicago. The latter held the Second Amendment also protects individuals from state and local governments infringing upon their right to keep and bear arms. From this precedent, Kavanaugh concluded that the majority erred in applying intermediate scrutiny to judge the constitutionality of DC’s semi-automatic gun ban, writing:

Heller [I] was up-front about the role of text, history, and tradition in Second Amendment analysis – and about the absence of a role for judicial interest balancing or assessment of costs and benefits of gun regulations. Gun bans and gun regulations that are longstanding – or, put another way, sufficiently rooted in text, history, and tradition – are consistent with the Second Amendment individual right. Gun bans and gun regulations that are not longstanding or sufficiently rooted in text, history, and tradition are not consistent with the Second Amendment individual right.

Applying Heller I’s “text, history, and tradition” test, then, led Kavanaugh to conclude the D.C. gun provisions at issue were unconstitutional. “[L]ike the ban at issue in Heller [I],” Kavanaugh wrote, the DC ban on semi-automatic rifles represents “outliers that are not traditional or common in the United States.” And “[a]s with D.C.’s handgun ban, therefore, holding these D.C. laws unconstitutional would not lead to nationwide tumult,” Kavanaugh added. “Rather, such a holding would maintain the balance historically and traditionally struck in the United States between public safety and the individual right to keep arms.”

Characterizing Kavanaugh As a Gun Nut Is Wrong

The Left, however, will ignore this entire analysis and instead present Kavanaugh as outside the mainstream, claiming the jurist would overturn bans on “assault weapons,” putting school kids at risk. Look for liberals to further this extremist narrative by highlighting decisions from other circuit courts which, like the DC circuit’s majority opinion, have upheld semi-automatic weapon bans. However, as I explained previously, those decisions blatantly ignore the Supreme Court’s analysis in Heller and McDonald, yet the justices have inexplicably refused to intervene. A Justice Kavanaugh may soon change that.

But striking semi-automatic rifle bans is not “extreme” from a constitutional perspective given the prevalence of semi-automatic rifles and that they are “commonly use[d] by law-abiding citizens and [have] traditionally been lawful to possess.” Further, Kavanaugh rejected the more extreme view the plaintiffs in Heller II argued, that DC’s semi-automatic gun ban must be judged under the “strict scrutiny” standard. To satisfy “strict scrutiny,” the government must prove a law “furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.” Kavanaugh recognized that “fewer gun laws might pass muster under strict scrutiny than under a history- and tradition-based approach,” which is “no doubt why the plaintiffs in Heller and here have advocated strict scrutiny.”

Kavanaugh did not end there. He made clear that “just because gun regulations are assessed by reference to history and tradition does not mean that governments lack flexibility or power to enact gun regulations. . .. After all, history and tradition show that a variety of gun regulations have co-existed with the Second Amendment right and are consistent with that right, as the Court said in Heller [I].” For instance, bans on short-barreled shotguns and automatic weapons, concealed-carry laws, and laws barring possession by felons all remain valid.

Further, “when legislatures seek to address new weapons that have not traditionally existed or to impose new gun regulations because of conditions that have not traditionally existed, there obviously will not be a history or tradition of banning such weapons or imposing such regulations,” Kavanaugh added. But “[t]hat does not mean the Second Amendment does not apply to those weapons or in those circumstances. Nor does it mean that the government is powerless to address those new weapons or modern circumstances. Rather, in such cases, the proper interpretive approach is to reason by analogy from history and tradition.”

Democrats won’t like this approach, but then again, the Left don’t seem to like the Constitution much these days, and that is the real reason they oppose Kavanaugh.

"Sacha Cohen Tried To Trick Gun Store Owner, Who Wasn't Having It","A gun store owner in Riverside, California is “100 percent positive” actor Sacha Baron Cohen tried to trick him into filming an interview for his fake docu-series on Showtime called “Who Is America?”

A number of politicians and political activists have been duped into participating in humiliating interviews as part of Cohen’s series under what they say were false pretenses. In the show’s debut episode, a heavily disguised Cohen tricks a gun-rights advocate into pointing guns decorated as stuffed animals at the camera in an effort to make the weapons appear kid-friendly.

Norris Sweidan, owner of Warrior One Guns and Ammo said a man heavily disguised and speaking with a thick, fake accent walked into his store with a camera crew in tow in February 2017 under the pretense that the man was a Hungarian immigrant seeking to buy a gun, according to an exclusive report by Fox 11.

‘I’m looking at the producer and I’m just like am I being fooled right here?’ Sweidan said. ‘And I just kept looking at the guy and I was like ‘you’re Borat,’ as soon as I said that his eyes just looked at me like, and he did a turn right out the door.’ He says after Cohen left the store, he left his crew behind. ‘We’re talking to the people they don’t wanna give us an answer, we basically told them to get the f*** out, you guys are all full of s***, have a great day, get out,’ Sweidan said. He said it’s obvious what Cohen’s intentions were. ‘Once I knew it was Borat, we already know his game and his bull*****, so we knew he’s here to make a mockery, and of what? Gun owners? The gun business, gun shops,’ Sweidan said.

You can watch the whole interview and bits of footage of Cohen’s reported visit to the Riverside gun store in the video below.

Last week, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin said she was tricked by Cohen, whom she says was heavily disguised as a wounded veteran, into an interview. She says she ended it after the interview took a bizarre turn. She also said Cohen’s production team dropped her off at the wrong airport on purpose, causing her and her daughter to miss their flights home to Alaska.

Cohen denied Palin’s accusations, tweeting a statement written in character from a Twitter account purported to belong to his character, Dr. Billy Wayne Ruddick.

“I did NOT say I was a War Vet. I was in the service ― not military, but United Parcel, and I only fought for my country once ― when I shot a Mexican who came onto my property,” the statement reads.

“The challenge is to Cohen, CBS and Showtime: donate all proceeds to a charitable group that actually respects and supports American Vets,” Palin wrote in a lengthy Facebook post about the incident. “Mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want, if that lets you sleep at night, but HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country.”

Showtime has stood by Cohen’s tactics regarding the rumored interview with Palin and did not respond to requests for comment from Fox 11 about the February, 2017 interaction at Warrior One Guns and Ammo.

The ACLU Has Basically Quit Defending The Constitution,"The American Civil Liberties Union, an organization that once so rigidly adhered to the neutral principles in the Constitution that it famously defended the right of a neo-Nazi group to march through the Jewish-laden Chicago suburb of Skokie, has been increasingly rejiggering its positions to correspond with the Left’s hard lurch towards cafeteria constitutionalism.

This week, for example, one of its senior policy analysts came up with an imaginative rationalization for limiting gun rights. “The wide availability of guns and their misuse is leading to restrictions on Americans’ freedom,” the organization tweeted this week, “and that needs to be part of the firearms debate.” The piece the tweet links to makes a, “A Pro-Liberty Case for Gun Restrictions,” which, though it’s become a tediously misused cliché over the years, can only be described as Orwellian.

It’s one thing to offer a “collective rights argument” regarding the Second Amendment — the wrong thing, according to the Supreme Court, but still an argument tethered to a legal concept — and another to nakedly rationalize the limiting the rights of law-abiding citizens because bad actors are creating anxiety among voters and politicians who, in turn, abuse their power.

“But we do care about freedom,” writes Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, “and I have noticed a growing trend: the wide availability of guns and their misuse leading to restrictions on Americans’ freedom.”

So even before we get to underlying “pro-liberty” case for limiting the rights, it should be pointed out that the foundation of Stanley’s contention is already questionable on two fronts. For one thing, there are already limits on gun ownership over safety concerns. Tons of them. In fact, there isn’t another foundational constitutional right that’s restrained nearly as often or as widely as the right to self-defense. It’s already part of the debate.

For another thing, there is no “growing trend” of gun violence nor does the piece even offer any evidence that that such a growing trend exists. Rather, it rests its case on the supposed unprecedented societal anxiety over gun violence — which often relies on hard-to-quantify measures of emotion, media coverage or shifting attitudes about guns.

In reality, gun crimes have fallen drastically over the past 35 years (mass shootings are also less frequent), while ownership of firearms has spiked. In most respects, the “trend” is a positive one that doesn’t correspond to the idea that props up the ACLU’s case. We don’t know that fewer guns would ease anxieties, because there is no evidence it would even ease crime.

It’s also highly debatable that Americans are more anxiety-ridden over gun crime today than they were in, say, the mid-30s or even the mid-70s. (Shameless plug!: I take a deep dive into this question in my forthcoming history of the gun in America.) Even if it was the case, however, the idea that societal unease — and the actions of a third party reacting to that anxiety — is an appropriate reason for restricting constitutional rights has to be an unique position for a group that still claims to have “worked to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States.”

So the “pro-liberty argument” is basically that more guns create more apprehension which creates more searches and surveillance and armed security. Though most of the factors the ACLU points to as problematic (and some, I agree are problematic, in general) happen on private property and/or do not infringe any constitutional rights, anyway. For instance, there is no constitutional guidance on how many police officers a community needs to hire. Schools are within their rights to search for weapons. The ironic thing, though, is that most of the anxiety-induced intrusions into the lives of Americans listed by the ACLU are driven by liberal policies, like, for example, “background checks that set the government rummaging around in our personal lives.”

Would the ACLU ever offer a “Pro-Liberty Case for Fourth Amendment Restrictions?” Would it argue that “the wide availability of modern communication have been misused by terrorists and that’s created a pervasive sense of insecurity and anxiety that politicians and policymakers will inevitably seek to address?” Seems unlikely.

I would ask if the ACLU would ever offer a “Pro-Liberty Case for First Amendment Restrictions,” but the organization has already answered that call, advocating a new brand of “free speech” defense that is dispensed differently for “marginalized” groups and others. “Speech that denigrates such groups can inflict serious harms and is intended to and often will impede progress toward equality,” says the ACLU in its guidelines governing case selection. For the ACLU, some speech is equal, but some speech is more equal than others. I won’t even get into religious liberty protections, which the ACLU has continually opposed in recent cases.

Though it still does some important work, the problem is that the hierarchy of concerns dictating the ACLU’s real mission have nothing to do with constitutional rights. The Constitution, it seems, only matters when the underlying political issue is worthwhile. And increasingly, the ACLU is inventing justifications that allow it to embrace comfortable contemporary leftist cultural positions — which is to say, positions that devalue the importance of the Constitution.

Debunking The Misleading Panic Over 3-D Guns,"The newest bugaboo of the gun control crowd is the bloodcurdling “3-D printer gun.” Or, as Alyssa Milano, a self-styled expert on these matters, might call it: “downloadable death.” Reporters at CNN ask, “3-D guns: Untraceable, undetectable and unstoppable?” Even President Donald Trump tweeted that “he’s looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!”

It makes plenty of sense.

First of all, “3-D Plastic Guns” aren’t being sold to the public. Nor are “downloadable firearms” or “ghost guns.” These things don’t exist. Data, code, and information is being sold to the public. There is no magical contraption that creates a new gun on demand. Sorry.

Even if such a machine existed, however, the Trump administration hasn’t suddenly begun “allowing” Americans to fabricate guns in the comfort of their homes, as so many stories have intimated. It’s never been illegal to make your own (non-NFA) weapons in the first place.

The pretext for this freakout is news that the State Department reached a settlement with Cody Wilson and his company, Defense Distributed, which offered digital designs for 3-D printed guns, not guns. The Obama administration had maintained that the company’s printer code violated the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which had little to do with a law-abiding hobbyist milling a lower receiver for a commercially popular civilian firearm in his suburban Pennsylvania garage.

(As of this writing, a federal judge in Seattle has issued a temporary restraining order stopping release of downloadable blueprints for 3-D-printed guns. This prior restraint on speech won’t last long if the First Amendment still means anything.)

Milano may not be aware that Americans have been building their own three-dimensional guns since before the revolution. The Kentucky rifle was created by German and Swiss blacksmiths living in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and not one of them owned a computer.

Today, life has become far more convenient, and schematics that offer hobbyists plans for assembly or creation of firearms can be found across the Internet. Although a person might need a high degree of proficiency to pull off making one, they certainly don’t need a 3-D printer. Here, for instance, is a video of an industrious fellow turning hundreds of cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon into an AR15. All of it, already permissible.

Still, Milano contends that the administration’s decision now means that “felons, domestic abusers, terrorists, those adjudicated too mentally ill to own guns and any other person unable to legally purchase firearms will be able to print one at home.”

Guess what? If you’re unable to legally purchase firearms, you are already prohibited from making a gun in your home, just as you are prohibited from buying a gun through a straw purchase or stealing one from your neighbor or smuggling one into the country. That’s settled law. Good work.

Censoring code on the Internet simply because you find guns objectionable, though, is another story. As Wilson notes in Washington Post, code “is the essence of expression. It meets all the requirements of speech — it’s artistic and political, you can manipulate it, and it needs human involvement to become other things.” How can the state ban the transfer of knowledge used to help someone engage in an activity that is completely legal? Scratch that — to engage in an activity that is constitutionally protected?

As a practical matter, the perception created by Ed Markey and the anti-Second Amendment organizations pushing this 3-D-printer code scare—that Joe Criminal can now merely push a button and “print one at home” with his 3-D applications and PC-connected milling machine—is purposely misleading.

You might wonder why criminals would bother spending thousands of dollars to create a one-shot plastic gun (that probably won’t work) when they can walk into a store and buy a reliable shotgun for a few hundred dollars, or procure a weapon illegally for far less?

Well, I’m assured by Milano these 3-D-printed plastic guns are undetectable and easy to make. Neither of these things are true. It’s already illegal for Americans to possess weapons that are undetectable to metal detectors (even if metal detectors aren’t used at airports anymore). So don’t make one. But the Defense Distributed plans for a complete AR-15 include 72 parts, some of which are comprised of metal to prevent catastrophic malfunctions. Is a mastermind criminal going to 3-D-print or mill all those parts himself, a task that requires not only considerable knowledge, skill, and experience, but also a costly printer and custom machine shop? This technology has been available for years. Has there been a crime wave of undetectable AR15s?

What Markey wants to do is pass legislation that curtails the rights of law-abiding citizens by fearmongering over a settlement that had nothing to do with the legality of homemade guns in the first place. As always, he—and other gun restrictionists in states contemplating increased oversight of a nonexistent problem—are interested in adopting incremental steps towards more obstructive gun laws. In this case, they are aiming to limit hobbyist manufacturing, in general.

The entire case against 3-D guns is propelled by the notion, normalized over many years, that access to firearms is problematic, even though the presence of guns doesn’t equate to increased violence. And who knows, perhaps one day, as machines evolve and become more reliable and powerful, it won’t be prohibitively expensive or inaccessible for the average law-abiding person to make his own AR15 or 1911. Whether that’s a positive or negative development is debatable. But gun-control activists are trying to dictate what that future looks like now.

3-D Printed Guns Are A Reminder That Gun Control In America Is Futile,"In case you missed it, Americans are up against yet another imminent doomsday scenario. If you weren’t already killed off by the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, or by the Trump tax cuts, or by the repeal of net neutrality, or by Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court, we’re now told that you will certainly be killed by 3-D printed firearms.

In 2013, Cody Wilson and an organization called Defense Distributed released plans for the first fully 3-D printable gun: The Liberator. The design was named after the eponymous sheet metal pistol that the Allies airdropped behind enemy lines during WWII to arm resistance fighters. That gun was crudely made and unreliable, but it was far more successful as a propaganda point. In Nazi-controlled France, where private gun ownership was illegal, anyone could secretly have a gun. Even worse, they could use that gun to get their hands on a better gun.

Wilson’s plan was similar. Outside the Defense Distributed headquarters, Wilson is installing a tombstone etched with the words “American Gun Control.” The point is well taken. As gun control advocates look for new ways to chip away at the protections guaranteed in the Second Amendment, the Liberator undermines all of that. How can gun control possibly work when Americans can use a 3-D printer — now available for as low as $100 — to build their own firearms in the comfort of their homes?

The Obama administration used an obscure regulation governing military arms exports to force the Liberator designs off the internet. They reasoned that sharing the blueprint to build a gun online, where it could be downloaded by anyone on earth, was just as dangerous as exporting a machine gun or missile launcher overseas. But the fact that not one Liberator has been used in a crime, despite being downloaded over 100,000 times, should tell you all you need to know about the “risk” these designs pose.

The thought of Americans building their own guns may seem terrifying, but the truth is that homemade guns are as American as apple pie. When the American colonists declared independence against Great Britain, they faced a serious shortage of firearms. They scrambled to seize as many caches in the early days of the war as they could, but quickly found themselves outgunned by Britain’s well-oiled supply chains. That is, in part, why the colonies relied so heavily on militiamen. The militia was expected to show up for service with their own personal muskets or rifles, so there was no need for the colonial army to arm them.

The Continental Army would capture weapons and import them from overseas when they could, but they needed to source them domestically. The Continental Congress founded the Springfield Armory in 1777 and relied on a network of smaller gunsmiths scattered across the colonies to meet the army’s needs. Without that gunsmithing knowledge, the American Revolution could not have succeeded.

When the Founders wrote that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, they ratified it knowing that this basic blacksmithing and gunsmithing knowledge was key to defeating the British. Notice that the Second Amendment doesn’t limit Americans to simply buying firearms.

Firearm technology during the American Revolution was severely lacking by today’s standards. While there were rifles in production, most of the output was for the cheaply produced smooth-bore muskets.

Right now, anyone can walk into a Home Depot or Lowe’s and spend $20 in the plumbing aisle to build their own single-shot firearm that would put a Revolutionary musket to shame (both in accuracy and fire rate). Apparently, it wasn’t that hard for gun enthusiasts to figure out that a 12 gauge shotgun shell fits perfectly within a three-fourth inch pipe.

Take any elementary machining course at your local community college, and after just a few classes, you will come away with the knowledge needed to weld and rivet together your own WWII-era repeating firearm from a parts kit. Just to prove he could do it, one man even built an AK-47 out of a rusty shovel he bought at a garage sale for $2.

If you have a hand drill and an afternoon to kill, you can literally mill-out an untraceable AR-15 lower receiver by hand using nothing but online instructional videos for guidance. Or, you can spend a couple hundred dollars on a 3-D printer and have a plastic gun ready to fire in a matter of days. An American’s ability to build a firearm is limited only by his or her ingenuity, and we are an ingenious people.

After the Trump Administration reached a settlement with Wilson and Defense Distributed, the Obama-era regulations blocking 3-D printable gun blueprints from being shared online were lifted. It didn’t take long for gun control advocates to start the fearmongering. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer came out and declared that “America is going to get a lot less safe” because 3-D printable gun designs would let anyone build a gun with “the look and the capacity of a hardened, fully semi-automatic weapon.”

Aside from the fact that there’s no such thing as a “fully semi-automatic weapon,” I’ve yet to hear Schumer complain about the polymer-framed pistols that his security detail or police escorts carry to defend him. But, apparently the thought of an average citizen simply knowing how to build a polymer firearm is too much for him to handle.

The British Army tried to confiscate the colonists’ guns and failed. Today’s gun control advocates have already revealed they share the same endgame. When Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s assault weapon ban went into effect in 1994, she admitted during a news interview that if she had the votes, she would have said “Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.”

Now that the barriers to entry to build a firearm have all but disappeared, complete civilian disarmament is literally impossible. While the Founders never could have envisioned 3-D printing technologies, they understood the importance of being able to arm oneself. There is no right to keep and bear arms without a right to manufacture your own firearm, just as there is no First Amendment without the right to print a book or start your own religion.

Despite talking points to the contrary, there’s nothing to fear from 3-D printed guns. Criminals will continue to steal or illegally buy their crime guns, not build them out of plastic. Anyone truly bent on committing a crime with a plastic gun has already had the ability to do that for decades.

Any elected official who governs in the interests of the American people and preserves the Second Amendment’s protections has nothing to worry about an armed populace. Likewise, the fearmongering coming from the likes of Schumer should tell you all you need to know about his intentions.

Gun Controllers Turn To Virtual Book Burning In Anti-Gun Crusade,"Gun control activists aren’t just targeting the Second Amendment anymore. They now have their sights set on the First Amendment as well, arguing that the mere knowledge of how guns work should also be banned by the federal government.

In an MSNBC segment on Wednesday, retired astronaut Mark Kelly called for criminalizing 3-D printed gun designs to discourage people from disseminating the computerized code.

“You can make it illegal to possess ’em and that’ll discourage a lot of people,” Kelly said. “It’s illegal to own an untraceable and undetectable firearm at this point,” he said, citing the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988. 3-D printed gun pioneer Cody Wilson, the genesis of the recent flare-up over the concept, was complying with that law when he posted a design for this type of weapon online in 2013.

Kelly, whose wife is former Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, cited the Las Vegas shooting as reason to ban bump stocks and outlaw computerized code that’s been disseminated online for many years already.

“Public safety is important,” he said.

On Tuesday, a federal judge ruled that posting designs for 3-D printed guns online is illegal — a decision that will likely be challenged — after the State Department dropped its five-year-long case against Wilson in July. As The Federalist’s David Harsanyi notes, however, it’s not illegal to build your own gun so long as the firearm complies with federal gun regulations.

“Americans have been building their own three-dimensional guns since before the revolution,” he wrote. “The Kentucky rifle was created by German and Swiss blacksmiths living in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and not one of them owned a computer.”

This Hawaiian Veteran’s Win For Gun Rights Would Be A Perfect Movie,"If conservatives are looking for a hero on gun rights, behold George Young, who recently won a significant victory before the notoriously liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Hawaiian taught himself law and with help from a lawyer managed to take his case into federal court, after years and years of dismissals, and won. The Ninth Circuit ruled Hawaii has to allow open carry or else try its luck at the Supreme Court.

Read Stephen Gutowski at the Free Beacon for a really good story and interview with Young. He is an Army veteran, served in Vietnam, worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, and then in airport security, where he was again armed. But then when he wanted to get a gun permit in his native Hawaii, where he’s lived all his life, he was denied, again and again.

When he started calling lawyers to get representation, none would take his case. He eventually decided to represent himself—and that was the beginning of the struggle that led to his July 24 victory, when the Ninth Circuit ruled Hawaii’s ban on open carry unconstitutional (while declaring a ban on concealed carry still constitutional).

Aside from this personal success and advancement in the cause of gun rights for all citizens of Hawaii, Young’s story is an occasion for conservatives and gun rights advocates. This is something Hollywood should love, since the man is a walking, talking embodiment of the best of diversity in America. He’s half-Japanese, a quarter Hawaiian, and a quarter Chinese, married to a Japanese woman. There’s a lot for conservatives, too, beyond gun rights, since he’s a veteran and served his country in Vietnam.

This Is the Perfect Story for the Small Screen

Young’s story would make a good drama about what 21st century America could learn from previous generations and how an aging patriot conceives of his legacy. His struggle for gun rights also has a personal meaning, since it was a promise he made to his daughter, who died in a terrible car accident before he got his lawsuit in a court.

So family love is also tied to this story of the dignity of citizenship and the pride a man can have in carrying guns. It is uniquely suited to dispel the idea that gun rights are a National Rifle Association conspiracy with crazy white people who are not fit to live in places ruled by sophisticated, defenseless liberals.

Conservatives, patriots, and friends of the Constitution should think seriously about how to tell such stories, if they are to affect our culture. This would not be a superhero blockbuster, nor a Disney princess story. No one will make a billion dollars on this. It wouldn’t likely get the press that transgressive stories usually do, nor the coverage of glamorous celebrity vehicles. It would likelier be a movie with a small budget, an interest in the festival circuit, and an eye on the prestige conferred by awards.

It would require real talent both behind and in front of the camera. It would above all require writing that’s attentive to the man’s true story, and require the wit to discern in his story how America has changed in this man’s lifetime. It would illuminate how he conceived of doing his duty, since he worked all his life to protect the public. Such a movie would provide a real example of duty and citizenship, something different than complaining that civics education has gone the way of the dinosaurs.

Moral Meaning Doesn’t Require Moralizing

Moral exhortation is necessary in all societies, and nowadays hysterical progressives have a monopoly on it. That’s not good for America, or for progressives themselves. Stories and storytelling are a better education about how to be patriotic. Young is one such example, and it’s up to us to recognize in his story so many things we need to talk about that are almost absent from our public speeches, pop culture, and education.

We all know conservatives do not have a grasp on American culture. Where they have natural allies, like the young men who love computer games, conservatives often cannot even bother to pay attention. Ask yourself: Is there any massive industry the size of gaming less discussed in conservative media than computer games, but for the occasional piece decrying men for playing them?

Conservatives do not do much better with film. They do not recognize that every year very good movies, all-American and friendly to conservatives, get made. It’s much rarer still for conservatives to try to make movies.

Telling Young’s story well would not fix this problem with the culture, of course. But there are no easy fixes, and telling this story would be a great step forward. This is a moment of serendipity, when life in America hands conservatives a true story that’s also very inspiring and fits some of the constitutional quarrels about citizenship in our times.

Citizenship, character, justice, and the Constitution are all tied up in this story. It would be worse than a shame to lose this opportunity.

"If Amazon Can Ban My Best-Selling Gun-Blueprints, It Can Ban Anything","Today, for a fee, you can purchase some of the most dangerous books known to man on Amazon.com.

For $3, you can buy Karl Marx’s “Communist Manifesto,” a book that indirectly led to the deaths of upwards of 100 million people worldwide. You can also purchase a copy of the “U.S. Army Improvised Munitions Handbook,” which promises “step-by-step instructions on how to assemble weapons and explosives from common and readily available materials.” Amazon sells hundreds of books teaching readers how to build guns (and the website even sells many of the tools necessary to do it).

Seeing this precedent, I uploaded a 3D printable gun file to Amazon … as a book.

In late-July, a federal judge signed off on a temporary order banning all Americans from sharing Defense Distributed’s 3D gun design files online. The Washington State Attorney General’s Office is arguing in court that it is “highly questionable whether files that instruct a 3D printer to produce a gun at the push of a button are protected ‘speech’ at all.” Even worse, the judge believes this argument has a high likelihood of succeeding at trial.

This should terrify liberty lovers everywhere. The left is now arguing that, while Americans may have a right to keep and bear arms and a right to free speech, We the People have no right to speak about how to manufacture a firearm.

Any computer code is, in essence, nothing but a string of alphanumerical code instructing a program how to perform a certain task. In the case of 3D gun files, these .stl files instruct a computer program how to depict a firearm as a three-dimensional rendering. With that information, someone can write code to tell a 3D printer or CNC machine how to manufacture the image depicted in the file.

I took Defense Distributed’s Liberator pistol — a design that has been placed into the public domain — and rewrote the code into an ascii .stl file. In addition to making it easier to represent on the written page, this was done to protect me from any potential copyright claims. I then uploaded the text as a 2,500-plus page e-book and listed it for sale.

I never expected anyone to purchase the book and, frankly, I didn’t care if anyone did. This was simply to prove a point. Code is free speech, and if the left doesn’t understand that, maybe they would if it was published as a book.

To my surprise, my “book” not only sold, but it sold like hotcakes. After its first day of sales, it was listed as the “#1 New Release” in the Computer and Technology Education section. By day three, it became the “#1 Best Seller” in that section. By day five, it had peaked at the #3 Best Selling e-book in Amazon’s entire Education and Teaching section.

I was eager to prove a point, and hundreds of people out there wanted to help me prove it. But on day six, Amazon banned the book for violating their “content” standards, specifically for sharing “illegal” content.

Private companies undoubtedly have a right to decide which types of content to host. The First Amendment protects us against government-led assaults on free speech, not from private companies. I think it is a little disingenuous, however, for a company like Amazon to say that a string of unintelligible alphanumerical code is too dangerous for public consumption, but the U.S. Army’s guide to building improvised explosives is safe.

The question is, what happens when a federal judge’s unconstitutional injunction or a state attorney general’s unconstitutional lawsuit pushes a private company to ban specific types of content?

My book, “The Liberator: An .STL File Published as a Book,” was banned because it allegedly contains “illegal content.” Amazon believes that a text file that tells a computer how to render a 3D image of a gun is illegal because, well, state attorneys general convinced a federal judge to implement a nationwide injunction against them.

I live in Colorado. In addition to the rights afforded to me under the First Amendment, Colorado’s state constitution declares, “Every person shall be free to speak, write or publish whatever he will on any subject, being responsible for all abuse of that liberty.”

I bring this up because the Colorado Attorney General’s Office has now joined the lawsuit that, after receiving the temporary injunction, compelled Amazon to change its publishing guidelines and take down my book.

What good is the First Amendment if government officials can pressure or compel private corporations into banning speech that the government would otherwise be prohibited from banning on its own?

This isn’t the first time we have seen something like this. During the Obama administration, the Justice Department labeled gun stores as “high risk” businesses under what they called “Operation Choke Point.” The goal was to pressure banks into dropping gun stores as clients. Fully-licensed gun dealers engaging in constitutionally protected commerce were dropped from their banks because of the federal government’s pressure. Obviously, banks have every right to decide with whom they want to do business. But for the government to encourage or compel them to drop licensed gun dealers is a clear affront to the Constitution.

While Amazon isn’t responding to my request for an appeal, they have responded to other users who were banned from using their services to share 3D printable gun files. In early August, Amazon Web Services — the part of the company that hosts client websites — issued a takedown notice against CodeIsFreeSpeech.com that cited the judge’s order. Amazon demanded that the website’s 3D gun files be removed “to prevent access to the reported content in order to comply with the received temporary restraining order.”

This becomes even more harrowing when you look at Democrat politicians’ plans for regulating the internet. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner has been circulating a white paper proposing broad new internet regulations designed to crack down on “disinformation” online.

Already, we are seeing tech giants like Facebook, YouTube, and Reddit start to self-regulate to avoid these heavy-handed regulations. Government officials have these tech companies at virtual gun point, but we are being told that the people have no recourse under the First Amendment because the Constitution doesn’t apply to private corporations.

If the First Amendment precludes government officials from silencing Americans, what about when an official demands that companies self-regulate, or else? While my e-book was listed for sale, dozens of people left hilarious reviews. One of them sticks out in particular: “I tried to burn this book, but I couldn’t since it was on my Kindle.”

Nazi Germany called its book-burnings säuberung, meaning cleansing. Technically, those infamous book burnings were run by the German Student Union, not the Nazi Party. Officials set the standards for which types of literature were to be banned, but the actual burning was done by private organizations.

The modern säuberung is taking place right in front of our eyes. Not at the hands of government, but by monopolistic tech companies eager or forced to do its bidding. Yet, instead of using a tall pyre, today’s cleansing comes in the form of government-encouraged terms of service crackdowns and the online ban-hammer. The only question left is whether we’re going to sit back and take it.

"No, Anti-Gun States Do Not Have The Fewest Gun Deaths","Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren recently tweeted a misleading statistic about school gun violence, in another example of Democrats skewing the facts to support an anti-gun narrative.

“Massachusetts has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the county [sic] & can serve as a model for the federal gov’t to develop policies to keep schools safe,” she tweeted. “@RepKClark & I surveyed MA educators & have a series of recommendations for @BetsyDeVosED to help stop gun violence in schools.”

Warren clearly meant “country” instead of “county.” But “covfefe” typo aside, Warren’s letter to Secretary Betsy DeVos is powerfully written, including evocative references to Columbine, Parkland, and “public attacks in which the shooter and victims were generally unknown to each other.” In other words, senseless murder.

Understandably, nothing tugs on the heartstrings more than the murder of those who never placed themselves in harm’s way. But when discussing these awful killings, some gun control advocates opportunistically inject statistics that border between subsidiary and negligible to the issue of homicide.

This is what Warren does here, in a manner some would disdainfully view as liberal elitist. If one state’s leader is going to preach, “We know best,” thereby tacitly discounting the policies and belief-systems of the people in all other states, the data behind the hubris had better be sound. However, Massachusetts does not possess the lowest rate of gun homicide in the country or some magic formula that specifically curtails gun murder.

According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Massachusetts’ age-adjusted firearm homicide rate has never ranked lowest in any year since CDC began recording this metric in 1981. From 2008 to 2014, Massachusetts ranked a commendable 37th in firearm homicide but an exceptional 46th in non-firearm homicide, indicating factors other than gun laws for the Bay State’s relatively low murder rate.

The only way Warren’s statement is true is by including gun suicides, a topic not mentioned in her letter to DeVos. Nearly two-thirds of gun deaths are suicides, of which 2.5 percent are associated with murder-suicides (approximately 530 of 21,386 CDC-reported firearm suicides in 2014). Massachusetts should be proud of leading the country in fewest gun suicides, and suicide is certainly a frightful epidemic. But there is little equivalence between killing someone and taking one’s own life.

Perhaps Warren’s unintended use of “county” is a Freudian slip. As some gun control advocates exclaim, local gun laws matter more than state gun laws. At the county level, comparing CDC’s age-adjusted gun death rates to the 2016 presidential election results demonstrates polar differences between homicide and suicide, and the available political gain to exploit.

Excluding third-parties, Hillary Clinton captured 84 percent of the vote in the top ten counties with the highest homicide rates 2008-2014, 67 percent in the top 100 counties, and 60 percent in the top 300 counties. By contrast, President Donald Trump garnered 80 percent in the top ten counties with the highest suicide rates over the same period, 75 percent in the top 100 counties, and 72 percent in the top 300 counties.

Side-by-side charts of the top 40 counties with the highest homicide and suicide rates nearly depict an inverse image:

Despite the lion’s share of firearm homicide clearly affecting Democratic-controlled districts, gun control advocates slyly add that one-third of murders to the two-thirds of suicides are from mainly rural Republican areas. Voila: the misleading political talking point.

Although Warren does not disclose her rhetorical factoid as driven by suicide data, at least she confines her talking point to Massachusetts. The more sweeping generalization among gun control advocates is deep blue states with strong gun laws have the fewest gun deaths, while red states with weak gun laws have the most gun deaths.

As proof, the advocates often point to the Annual Gun Law Scorecard by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. While flunking most red states, the Scorecard routinely crowns California class valedictorian, followed by the northeast quintuple of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland each receiving at least A- grades annually since 2014. Predictably, these six states voted Clinton over Trump 63-37 percent combined (excluding third-parties).

Next to each state’s grade is the Scorecard’s “gun death rate rank.” In 2014 California ranks 42nd, Massachusetts 50th, Connecticut 45th, New York 47th, New Jersey 46th, and Maryland a peculiar but seemingly benign 33rd. Conversely, the red states rank high: Idaho 16th, Montana 6th, and Alaska 4th.

Poor Wyoming is deemed the most unsafe state, a “fact” the Scorecard particularly denigrates: “Wyoming, a state with an F in 2014, has few laws regulating firearms and the highest gun death rate in the country. Wyoming and other states can improve their grades—and public safety—by, amongst other things, requiring background checks on all private gun sales and allowing local governments to regulate firearms.”

But according to CDC, Wyoming ranks 39th in age-adjusted firearm homicide rate 2008-2014; Alaska 29th, Montana 36th, and Idaho 45th. Meanwhile, California ranks 22nd, Massachusetts 37th, Connecticut 30th, New York 32nd, New Jersey 25th, and Maryland 7th. Seventh!

The difference, of course, is that the Scorecard includes firearm suicides. Like Warren, the Scorecard does not clearly disclose this fact. While the 2014 Scorecard is littered with references to Sandy Hook, assault weapon massacres, and domestic violence, there is not one mention of suicide anywhere. The same goes for the 2015 and 2016 Scorecards.

Warren and the Scorecard are hardly alone in promulgating this political chicanery. Even mainstream fact checkers have pinocchioed former President Barack Obama, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, and other gun control advocates for similarly misleading statements.

But with all the focus on homicide, the fact checkers ignore the suicide portion of the question. Why do some states have low gun homicide rates but high gun suicide rates? Correlation is not causation, but part of the answer likely relates to the bravest and most dutiful group of Americans.

Veterans comprise 8 percent of the adult population yet commit nearly 20 percent of the suicides. Those numbers are shocking considering veterans are generally superior physically, economically, and educationally compared to their civilian counterparts. Service members are required to undergo basic gun training, and 45 percent elect to own a gun in civilian life versus 20 percent of nonveterans.

According to the Department of Veteran Affairs, veteran males are 19 percent more likely to commit suicide than civilian males, and veteran females a staggering 250 percent more likely than civilian females. In 2014, the veteran suicide rate of each individual state was higher than the national suicide rate: California’s was almost double.

Unsurprisingly, veterans tend not to come from deep blue states. According to the Census Bureau’s American FactFinder, the “A” states of Massachusetts (47th), California (48th), New Jersey (49th), and New York (50th) trailed the pack in veterans per capita in 2014, with Connecticut (44th) and Maryland (32nd) not faring much better. By contrast, Alaska ranked 1st, Montana 4th, Wyoming 7th, and Idaho 12th.

This striking dichotomy becomes even more pronounced starting in 1973 when the United States ended the draft. For example, New Jersey ranks 49th overall but 1st in percent of veterans from the World War II era, 3rd from the Korean War era, 29th from the Vietnam era, 50th from the First Gulf War era (1990-2001), and 49th from the post 9/11 era (2001-2014). Similar extreme trends are seen in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York.

The national suicide rate has especially skyrocketed since 9/11. Almost half of post-9/11 veterans served with a comrade who had been killed. Sixteen percent of veterans were seriously wounded. And more than half personally know a fellow vet who has attempted or committed suicide.

As if that isn’t sobering enough, the true veteran suicide rate is likely much higher. Several statistics only include members honorably discharged from service. Sometimes coroners are not supplied proof of veteran status. Others are pressured by families not to record a death as a suicide out of a false sense of shame, an irony considering there are few acts more honorable than serving one’s country.

This is not to question civilians’ patriotism, including those in deep blue states. While some unscientific sources make specious conjectures about the patriotism of entire states, there are countless ways to show one’s patriotism besides joining the military. To suggest anything otherwise is insulting: Just ask the New Yorkers who lived through 9/11.

Likewise, there are countless economic, geographic, and sociological reasons why homicides and suicides occur in more states than others, and those reasons exponentially extend beyond gun laws. Our leaders should not misleadingly simplify the most complex issues, conflate statistics, and scare the public for political gain. To purposely cheapen the most important of issues isn’t just insulting, but divisive and immoral.

With Veterans Day approaching, let’s set aside the political gun control rhetoric, acknowledge our civilian privilege, and honor those who fought for the freedoms Americans uniquely enjoy. More importantly, reach out to the veterans in our social circles, especially the introverts we may see less often, personally thank them for their service, and check in on their well-being.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/09/27/no-elizabeth-warren-anti-gun-states-not-fewest-gun-deaths/,2018-09-27
Dems' New Anti-Gun Laws Are Also An Attack On Due Process,"The notion that certain Americans are preemptively guilty of wrongdoing, whether there’s any corroborating evidence to back up an accusation or not, isn’t reserved for conservatives who happen to be in contention for a Supreme Court seat. In the hierarchy of progressive values, due process is a bottom dweller.

Over the past decade, you could see the illiberalism evolving on college campuses, where Democrats subverted basic standards of justice. It was the Obama administration that demanded schools judge cases of alleged sexual assaults under a “clear and convincing evidence” rather than on a “preponderance of evidence,” allowing accusers to appeal “not guilty” findings, and permitting punishment to be meted out before any investigation was even conducted, among other big problems. Democrats are simply shepherding those corrosive standards into the real world.

Another area of American life where we continue to see egregious attacks on the presumption of innocence is gun ownership. You might remember that a couple of years ago Democrats engaged in a much-covered congressional “sit-in” to support legislation that would have stripped Americans who’d been placed on secret government watch lists — hundreds of thousands of people who had never been convicted, much less accused, of any crime — of their constitutional right to bear arms.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, in fact, proposed legislation that would not only have restricted American citizens who found themselves on faulty watchlists today, but anyone who had been on any watchlist at any time during the past five years and anyone who had traveled to select Middle Eastern countries. Apparently, Democrats believe limiting the number of refugees from Syria is unconstitutional, but explicitly restricting the constitutional rights of legal immigrants who happen to be from Syria is just fine.

Then again, the entire effort was a frontal attack on about half the Bill of Rights. At the time, even the American Civil Liberties Union, which has increasingly turned away from its guiding principles, argued that policies based on flawed terror lists would undermine civil liberties.

In much the same way they are attempting to sink the Brett Kavanaugh nomination, Democrats relied on theatrics, bombastic rhetoric, and a compliant media, which framed the issue exactly how they had hoped. You can imagine such bills will reappear when they’re back in charge. Until then, though, Democrats have doing some gun grabbing—and I don’t mean it figuratively—on the local level.

California, a state that already features the strictest gun control laws in the country, just passed a bill that raises the allowable age to buy a shotgun or rifle from 18 to 21. The United States might be willing to hand weapons to young men and women who volunteer to protect their country, but Gov. Jerry Brown doesn’t believe those young men and women to be able to protect their own property or families.

An even more outrageous new law bans Californians who’ve been hospitalized more than once in a year for mental health issues from owning a gun.

Federal law already prohibits the sale of a gun to anyone who “has been adjudicated as a mental defective.” Until now, a person had an option to appealing the ban and showing “a preponderance of the evidence” that he would use firearms in “a safe and lawful manner.” Now, California bans one-time patients from owning firearms “for the remainder of his or her life.” This is an excellent way to stigmatize people who suffer from maladies that often have nothing to do with violence or criminality.

Now, I was going to ask the reader to imagine an alternative scenario, where Republicans pushed a bill prohibited those who have been in hospitals—for, say, nervous exhaustion or an addiction–from being able to freely express their opinions in public ever again. If a law-abiding American can be stripped of his Second Amendment rights, then why not the First? But then, these days, I imagine many Democrats would simply answer: “it depends on what the person is going to say.”

Another California law allows police to verbally ask to confiscate a guns, rather than making their case in a written request. Under “red flag laws,” guns can be confiscated from citizens who’ve never been charged, much less, convicted of breaking any law. And it’s getting easier and easier to do it.

Depending on the state, and many have them, all it takes is a family member, neighbor, or coworker to accuse you of a pre-crime. One of Maryland’s many new laws (signed by Republican Gov. Larry Hogan) allows the police to confiscate weapons for up to a year— or until the next person accuses you of a crime you are only yet to commit.

There is risible evidence that any of these new regulations will stop mass shootings or lower gun crime. But as William Rosen, deputy legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety, explains, “red flag laws” are needed to “step into that gap.” What gap? You know, the pesky space between the protecting ideals like the presumption of innocence and completely ignoring it when you feel like it.

Why California’s Gun Ban For People With ‘Mental Illness’ Is A Bad Idea,"Aurora movie theater shooter James Holmes was in treatment for schizophrenia when he opened fire and killed 12 people. Newtown school shooter Adam Lanza “struggled with basic emotions,” and as a child wrote a disturbing short story about a grandma who wanted to taxidermy a little boy to place on her mantel. He later killed 28 people. So it doesn’t seem like a stretch to claim that many of America’s most notorious mass shooters suffer from severe mental illness — and that perhaps with a little more oversight we could have stopped them from accessing weapons.

California legislators apparently agree. Gov. Jerry Brown signed AB 1968 into law on Friday — gun control legislation that would ban any Californian twice-hospitalized in a given year for mental illness, in suspicion of harm to them self or others, from buying a gun for the rest of his life. Conservatives and libertarians should take note, since this might be a new piecemeal strategy in play, increasingly used by liberals to restrict gun rights under the guise of safety and surface-level logic.

The bill was introduced by Democratic Assemblyman Evan Low, who said, “People at risk of harming themselves or others should not have easy access to firearms,” and that, “Research shows that suicide with a firearm is the most common and by far the most lethal suicide method.”

Low’s concern about suicide is fair and shared by many, but the ban he’s instituted will inadvertently and fallaciously link mentally ill people with mass shooters — groups many in the general public already conflate. According to Pew, 89 percent of Americans agree that people with mental illnesses shouldn’t be allowed to purchase firearms.

Unfortunately, gun bans like California’s will strip away the rights of millions of Americans, while doing very little to make us safer. California’s new legislation should not be heralded as an example of forward-thinking, common sense policy. It’s anything but.

Although the bill will only ban those who have been hospitalized for mental illness, that’s still an unreasonable standard. Common antidepressants, like Prozac or Cymbalta, can cause or exacerbate suicidal thoughts that might require someone to be hospitalized, even though the danger they pose is only temporary, and usually is not directed toward others. Californians who then seek hospitalization should not be stripped of their Second Amendment rights for life just because they’ve taken necessary precautions to keep themselves safe as their minds are addled with unpredictable side effects and macabre thoughts. Besides, being hospitalized for a mental health issue isn’t necessarily linked to violence — to conflate the two is foolish.

In fact, consider that one in six people nationwide takes some form of psychiatric drug — that’s roughly 15 percent of Americans who could be deprived of their Second Amendment rights, depending on how loosely we define “mental illness” in future iterations of gun bans, especially if one were pursued on a federal level. Who’s to say such a policy will remain narrow in scope and sparingly enforced?

Still, established California law already bars hospitalized mentally ill people from purchasing a gun for five years post-admittance. Surely the current law is sufficiently cautious that there’s no need to limit self-defense for life. And for devout firearm enthusiasts, such as sports hunters, could California’s new stringent policy be a deterrent from seeking mental health help? It’s worth considering that regulations like these might disincentivize some people from pursuing treatment for very real psychological conditions which should not go unaddressed.

The notion that mental health status alone is enough to justify the restriction of gun rights is especially appalling because most people with mental illnesses aren’t actually dangerous — they’re just an easy presumed culprit to fixate on.

Less than five percent of crimes in the U.S. involve people with mental illnesses, and they’re actually less likely than those not diagnosed with mental illness to commit a gun-related offense. So although this form of gun regulation does sound good on the surface, it will only rob already-disadvantaged people of their constitutional rights to very little effect.

Even the liberal American Civil Liberties Union often opposes gun control measures that restrict which type of person purchases firearms. Generally speaking, they deem “laws that regulate or restrict particular types of guns or ammunition, regardless of the purchaser” as permissible, raising few legal red flags, but regulations which “restrict categories of purchasers” like immigrants or people with mental illness are suspect, because they’re based on flimsy evidence, and raise both due process and equal protection concerns.

This makes sense: Imagine putting people suspected of erratic behavior, due to mental illness, on no-buy lists, similar to no-fly lists. Far too many innocent people could be swept up in such a witch hunt, and it’s inevitable that some of these choices would be made based on stereotypes and faulty analysis, as with no-fly lists. Not every mental illness is the same, and not every person who suffers is likely to be violent (in fact, quite few are). Standards like the one proposed in AB 1968 are too broad, with potential to do harm to large swaths of the population.

Louise Melling, the ACLU’s deputy legal director, wrote in the wake of the Parkland shooting: “This moment calls on us to act not only to ensure that massacres like Parkland do not recur but to end the everyday gun violence that takes exponentially more lives from our communities. It also demands that we do so in a manner consistent with our most cherished civil liberties and constitutional rights.”

Permanently stripping Californians of their Second Amendment rights for seeking mental health support isn’t consistent with the ostensibly progressive value of protecting civil liberties for the vulnerable. AB 1968, like so much liberal-backed legislation, started with good intentions, but will create harmful outcomes that woefully undermine basic constitutional principles. We must do better to protect all people from gun violence, but we shouldn’t do so by subjugating people who are mentally ill.

Why Brett Kavanaugh Is The Justice Gun Owners Have Been Waiting For,"Since the Supreme Court’s Heller v. DC (2008) and McDonald v. Chicago (2010) rulings, gun owners have been waiting for the court to expand on its interpretation of the Second Amendment.

Heller ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual right of the people to keep and bear arms. McDonald overturned a Chicago public housing ban on firearm ownership and affirmed that the Second Amendment’s promise of “shall not be infringed” applies equally to federal, state, and municipal governments.

However, since those two landmark rulings, the Supreme Court has refused to expand on what the Second Amendment actually protects. Rumor is that both the conservative and liberal wings of the court were unsure of where former justice Anthony Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh replaced, would fall on new gun rights cases. Without knowing how he would vote, neither side apparently wanted to open the door for a case with nationwide implications.

Activist appeals court judges took advantage of the Supreme Court’s inaction and have spent the past decade dismantling Heller’s protections. Heller may have protected a right to own a handgun, but the Ninth Circuit upheld California’s de facto ban on newly manufactured handguns. The Heller decision may have protected firearms in common use, but that didn’t stop the Fourth Circuit from upholding Maryland’s ban on assault weapons. While the Second Amendment might promise protection for the right to bear arms, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled that California’s bans on both concealed and open carry did not violate that right.

But with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, American gun owners know that a majority of Supreme Court justices now support the Heller interpretation of the right to keep and bear arms. Kavanaugh is the Supreme Court justice gun owners have been waiting for.

Fundamentally, that means Americans have a right to keep and bear bearable arms, meaning arms that can be carried on someone’s person. That includes handguns, rifles, and shotguns. While it is often forgotten, gun control advocates came one vote away from a Supreme Court ruling dictating that Americans have no right to own guns at all.

Beyond that, Kavanaugh’s addition to the court opens new possibilities for nationwide rulings on issues like gun registration requirements, assault weapon bans, and concealed carry bans. When Dick Heller brought a second suit in 2010 against the District of Columbia’s assault weapon ban and registration requirements, as a judge on that court Kavanaugh dissented with the panel and wrote a logical dissent challenging the constitutionality of the District’s statutes.

In Heller, the Supreme Court held that handguns – the vast majority of which today are semi-automatic – are constitutionally protected because they have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens. There is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semiautomatic rifles. Semi-automatic rifles, like semi-automatic handguns, have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting, and other lawful uses. Moreover, semiautomatic handguns are used in connection with violent crimes far more than semi-automatic rifles are. It follows from Heller’s protection of semi-automatic handguns that semi-automatic rifles are also constitutionally protected and that D.C.’s ban on them is unconstitutional.

This is important because every circuit court that has heard challenges to state-level assault weapon bans, and their registration requirements, has upheld their legality and constitutionality. Kavanaugh will be the first Supreme Court justice ever to opine that the Second Amendment protects the ownership of so-called assault weapons.

Kavanaugh reached this decision by finding that semi-automatic rifles and shotguns are “in common use” and have not historically been banned. His dissent specifically cites the history of semi-automatic rifle ownership dating all the way back to the early 1900s. But one sentence goes farther than any other appeals court judge has been willing to go: “Semi-automatic rifles are commonly used for self-defense in the home, hunting, target shooting, and competitions,” Kavanaugh wrote.

Here, Kavanaugh not only cited the common ownership, but also the utility of these weapons as self-defense firearms. Instead of attacking the statutes themselves and their focus on accessories and attachments, such as flash hiders or pistol grips, Kavanaugh unapologetically affirms the constitutionality of the semi-automatic action itself.

When Washington D.C.’s concealed carry ban was challenged, a panel for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the complete refusal to issue concealed carry permits to the public was unconstitutional. At the time, D.C.’s statute said applicants must prove they had a “good fear of injury.” In reality, this standard was impossible to meet. No matter what someone said, the local police refused to approve the applications.

A three-judge panel overturned the statute and the D.C. attorney general appealed for an en banc ruling (where all the circuit’s judges weigh in). Kavanaugh voted to reject the en banc appeal, signaling he supports that concealed carry is a constitutional right.

Justice Clarence Thomas has been begging the Supreme Court to take up the issue of concealed carry, even going so far as to accuse his colleagues of relegating the Second Amendment to a second-class right. When the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to California’s concealed carry ban this past year, Thomas wrote in his dissent that “as evidenced by our continued inaction in this area, the Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this court.”

With Justice Brett Kavanaugh on the bench, that is going to change.

"Trump Is Right: Chicago Should Start Using Stop, Question, And Frisk","President Trump came under fire this week for suggesting that Chicago, which has an off-the-charts murder rate, should implement stop, question, and frisk, a policy that helped drastically reduce New York City’s murder rate. This police tactic came into practice under former mayor Rudy Giuliani, then more widely under his successor Michael Bloomberg, but has been accused of being ineffective, unconstitutional, and racist.

None of these attacks are reasonable or fair, but what nobody can disagree with is that Giulani and Bloomberg’s methods made Gotham one of the safest big cities in America. Chicago, on the other hand, has remained a gangland in which murder is far too commonplace.

The city’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, was not impressed by Trump’s suggestion. He said, “The failed policies he’s talking about have no place for a city that’s working together with communities about how to build — not only trust, but a collaborative and cooperative relationship.”

This is lovely to talk about, but the fact is that Chicago had 650 murders in 2017 while New York City had fewer than 300. Chicago has far fewer than half the population of New York. It makes all the sense in the world for the president to suggest that Chicago at least try a method of policing that coincided with dramatically reduced gun violence despite wrongheaded objections from liberal critics.

Yes, Stop, Question, and Frisk Worked

The ridiculous argument that stop, question, and frisk was irrelevant to the dramatic drop in gun crime in New York City is that when current Mayor Bill de Blasio ended it, the downward trend of gun violence continued. Well, of course it did. After decades of a policy that made criminals, especially gang members, wary of carrying illegal guns, it is only natural that they carry fewer illegal guns and thus commit fewer shootings.

It seems odd to speak about criminal culture, but gang members who make up a large part of shooting assailants and victims are a young cohort. They grew up in a New York City where carrying a gun could get them randomly locked up. Thus they are less likely to do so. When they do feel they need a gun, they go home, or to a communal gun-holding place to get it. That time cools things down and makes shootings less likely.

Yes, It’s Constitutional

We often hear that a federal judge found stop, question, and frisk unconstitutional. This is true. One judge in New York City did find this, although the controlling Supreme Court decision, Terry v. Ohio, finds the practice within constitutional bounds. So why hasn’t the Supreme Court weighed in to settle this? It’s because the de Blasio administration declined to appeal the decision.

This canard that the practice has been proven to be a civil rights violation is an absolute joke. All too often the liberal media presents this decision as somehow dispositive, when nothing could be farther from the case. Police absolutely have a right to stop and question a person they believe to be engaged in criminal activity. When they decide to frisk a person, they also have that right. That New York embraced this and Chicago didn’t goes a long way towards explaining why so many more young black men are shot to death in Chicago than in New York.

No, It’s Not Racist

In New York City in 2016, more than 80 percent of people arrested for murder were black or Hispanic. About 7 percent were white, and 4 percent were Asian. So the New York Police Department, not surprisingly, spends more time trying to check gun violence among blacks and Hispanics than they do among white or Asian people. This is not racism, it’s just identifying where the problem is and trying to address it.

The stop, question, and frisk policy is directly intended to stop the murders of minorities, since very few white people are murdered in New York. That is not racist, it’s practical, and it saves lives — mostly the lives of people of color. Chicago seems disinterested in this. Thus it appears this city’s liberal mayor would rather see black men die than challenge progressives’ ill-informed assumptions about proactive policing.

Bloomberg, who unlike Emanuel can point to a dramatic decrease in gun violence during his tenure, has become a Democrat and is looking at a 2020 presidential run. He told the New York Times this week in no uncertain terms that stop and frisk works. This will likely be a problem for his Democratic presidential nomination chances, but thankfully he isn’t throwing his own good work and that of the New York Police Department under the bus.

Giuliani and Bloomberg got results. Chicago’s corrupt Democratic political machine has not. Trump is right to call for employing in our new murder capital the methods that made Gotham the envy of the country regarding gun violence. And the lives he wants to save will mostly be lives of black and Hispanic men and boys.

The cynical opposition to this approach is wrongheaded and dangerous. Chicago needs stop, question, and frisk if it is ever to reach the level of safety and security we enjoy in New York City.

"The Left Doesn’t Just Want To Take Your Guns, But Also Your Ammo","One of Ted Cruz’s interns was arrested in September for the unspeakable act of leaving a shotgun shell in his vehicle. In most of the country, some shell casings in the trunk would be no big deal. In D.C., however, unless you have a permit for a firearm connected to that particular type of ammunition, you can be arrested for mere possession of it. This story comes in the midst of several pushes across the country for “ammunition control” by the anti-gun Left.

Ammunition laws are provided in several different flavors, all of which leave a bad taste in the mouth. Some, like those in D.C. and New York City, criminalize the actual possession of ammunition. Others, like legislation that just survived legal challenge in California, either tax ammunition or attempt to track it through microstamping–think tiny, engraved numbers. Although billed as measures to curb violent crime, the reality is that these laws are practically incapable of doing anything but raising costs and giving headaches to lawful gun owners.

The ammunition control discussion constantly conflates cartridges with bullets, making that discussion nearly incomprehensible. A “bullet” is the actual projectile that flies out a gun’s barrel when fired. A “cartridge” is a unit of fixed ammunition composed of a bullet, shell casing, gunpowder, and primer.

This distinction is either ignored or overlooked by gun control advocates. It is important because bullets are one of the most fungible components of firearm ammunition. They can be purchased in bulk almost anywhere and can be easily made at home with inexpensive equipment. With bullets, cartridges are also easily re-manufactured at home.

California lawmakers, in an effort to be outdone by only themselves, are leading the charge for more stringent ammunition control. Already home to the strictest gun and ammunition laws in the country, Californian gun control advocates want higher taxes on ammunition, microstamping technology, and sales limits in an attempt to blame gun violence on ammunition availability.

Microstamping technologies, like those required by California’s soon-to-be-enforced law, seem like something out of the sci-fi thriller “Minority Report.” The idea is that the gun leaves a tiny series of numbers on the cartridge case when fired, indicating the weapon’s make, model, and serial number. The only problem is that it’s not practically possible. The firing pin, which strikes the cartridge, is necessarily hard and brittle. Tiny lettering on a firing pin would be very fast to fracture and fail, or be easily ground off.

In light of this, California’s law was amended to require a microstamp in “at least two locations” on a spent casing. But how California expects this to be done is impossible to tell, as any method of microstamping cases is easily removable. Markings can be ground off just as easily on the firing pin as it can be anywhere else. Creating an effective law doesn’t seem to be the point, though, since even California recognizes microstamping to be easily defeated. It’s clear what the real point is: to make fewer guns available to Californians.

How? California requires the stamping technology on all new firearms to be sold in-state. So any “California-compliant” firearm would need to feature this stamping technology. Gun manufacturers will either forgo selling to Californians, or have to charge exorbitant prices to make up for the cost of the technology. The result–and quite possibly the object–of these laws will be to restrict the availability of new firearms. Compliant guns will be expensive, unavailable to those who need them most–disadvantaged people in crime-ridden neighborhoods–and non-compliant guns will expose owners to criminal prosecution.

Other laws, like those popping up in Michigan’s Wayne County, impose limits and conditions on ammunition sales. The idea is to prevent crime, but criminals don’t need boatloads of ammunition. Most crimes involving mutual gunfire with police average fewer than three shots fired. People need ammunition in quantity for training. It is difficult enough to become competent with firearms as it is. Making it cost-prohibitive to practice will only make it harder.

The Wayne County law is incompetent for any purpose. It attempts to solve the training problem by excluding purchases at firing ranges, leaving those who train on private property out to dry, and failing to address readily available home-ammunition production. All these laws can really accomplish is driving up costs. D.C. and New York impose high training and licensing costs to own arms and ammunition, California requires technology that is expensive at best and nonexistent at worst, and ammunition taxes nakedly drive up costs.

These laws don’t affect criminals, who can plan ahead or go around the laws. They don’t affect hardcore hobbyists, who can rely on older firearms and make their own ammunition. Ultimately, these laws only discourage regular people—poor people especially—from owning the most effective tools for self-defense. The poor make up the majority of violent crime victims, which is why it is the poor who need guns and training for self-defense. Let’s not pretend California’s doing the right thing here.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/10/15/left-doesnt-just-want-take-guns-also-ammo/,2018-10-15
The Five Most Important Guns In American History,"This piece is adapted from David Harsanyi’s new book, “First Freedom: A Ride Through America’s Enduring History with the Gun” (Threshold Editions).

1. Kentucky Rifle

Martin Meylin has been credited with being the first great American gunmaker and inventor of the Pennsylvania long rifle—which was to become known as the Kentucky long rifle (“Kentucky,” in those days, being anything in the wilderness west of Pennsylvania). Meylin’s small cobblestone workshop still stands off a two-lane road in Lancaster. Local schools are named after him. Plaques have been erected in his honor. State politicians have even written legislation commemorating his contribution to American life.

Well, while we know that Meylin left his home in Zurich, Switzerland, around 1710, and ended up in the German-speaking area of Lancaster County—a place that would become the center of American gun innovation for more than a century—we don’t know much else. And while it is tidy to give a single inventor credit for the gun, it’s probably the case that numerous inventors and blacksmiths engineered the Kentucky rifle over a period of decades.

The invention created by these German-speaking immigrants and their children changed the way Americans hunted, fought, and explored. Captain John Dillin, author of a popular book about the Kentucky rifle in the 1920s, would claim that the gun “changed the whole course of world history; made possible the settlement of a continent; and ultimately freed our country of foreign domination. Light in weight; graceful in line; economical in consumption of powder and lead; fatally precise; distinctly American; it sprang into immediate popularity; and for a hundred years was a model often slightly varied but never radically changed.”

The rifle—the word derived from the German riffeln, meaning to cut grooves—was first developed in Europe as a sporting weapon for noblemen to hunt with more precision. The invention of gun barrels with spiral grooves on the interior was likely to have originated among a number of blacksmiths in southern Germany and Switzerland. The physics of spinning propulsion as a means of improving aim was known to weapons makers for thousands of years—ever since feathers were placed on arrows to make them spin.

Muskets of early America were smoothbore weapons, and ammunition was fired at relatively low velocity. Moreover, the musket ball, which fit loosely when loaded down the muzzle, would bounce off the inside of the barrel when fired, making the final landing place unpredictable. The rifle Meylin and other gunsmiths made, on the other hand, immediately offered shooters decent accuracy at 150 or more yards—or a hundred more than an average musket.

The first German gunsmiths of Pennsylvania produced traditional Jäger rifles. Expensive and often ornate, they were short, easy-to carry, large-ammunition flintlock guns built to be quickly reloaded so that the carrier could hunt big game in dense German forests. The Kentucky rifle would feature a more elegant and elongated design. The longer barrel would increase the distance between the rear and front sights, giving the shooter a better bead on his target. A gun typically weighed only around nine to ten pounds: much lighter than a musket and therefore much easier to carry. The bore size, or “caliber”—which represents the diameter of the barrel—was reduced to save on powder and lead. The .45-caliber long rifle could deliver three times the number of shots from the same amount of powder that was used in the typically .75-caliber musket. These improvements made hunting for game—the most important use of the gun at the time—much more successful.



There were downsides to the weapon, of course, as the American revolutionaries would soon learn. For starters, rifles could be incredibly difficult to load. Fitting a projectile into a bore tightly enough to engage the rifling sometimes required hammering it all the way down the barrel. This was fine for a frontiersman who was hunting deer, but it created a perilous situation for a soldier. Another disadvantage of rifled weapons was that the black powder burned dirty and the grooves gunked up with residue after a few shots. This fouling often made loading impossible until the barrel was cleaned with a damp swab.

Yet, the imagination and techniques mastered by Meylin and others like him offered the thousands of incoming settlers and explorers the opportunity to continue to push into the wilderness of the Cumberland Mountains and surrounding areas. It was a gun that involved reengineering and reimagining Old World technology and was adapted to the rigors and uniqueness of frontier life, playing a large part in the Western mythos and becoming a standard tool of the American woodsman.

2. Colt’s “Peacemaker”

Like the Kentucky rifle, the revolver was a distinctly American invention. Unlike the Kentucky rifle, however, the revolver’s development, production, and initial popularity can be largely attributed to one man, Samuel Colt. The Connecticut native was not merely a mechanical virtuoso but a promotional and manufacturing mastermind who would become a template of the nineteenth-century American industrialist, epitomizing the exuberance and possibilities of the populist era of mid-1800s American life.

A self-made man, Colt was prodigious, a tireless self-promoter, innovator, autodidact, and mythmaker. His nose for opportunity made him one of the wealthiest men of his day. With this success came a leap forward in firearm technology. Colt invented the first hands-on, workable, mass-produced revolving firearm. And with his gun, he became one of the first industrialists to take advantage of mass marketing, celebrity endorsements, and corporate mythology to sell his product—a success that laid the groundwork for twentieth-century businessmen, including Henry Ford. In practical terms, his gun was more deadly, more accessible, more dynamic, and more useful than any that had ever been designed before it. It would play a part in carving out the West, revolutionizing war, and transforming the role of the gun in modern American life.

Although he certainly perfected the idea, multi-chambered guns already existed when Colt came up with his first revolver. Pepperbox pistols, for instance, were widely owned and used by the time Colt was first carving out his wooden model for the revolver. Named after the pepper grinders they resembled, these handguns had to be manually rotated, and were notoriously unreliable and difficult to aim because of the front-loaded weight of the multiple barrels. In 1814, the year Colt was born, the Boston inventor Elisha Collier had taken out a patent on a five-shot flintlock model pistol. Collier’s development was to invent a gun that was “self-priming”: in other words, when the hammer of the weapon was cocked, a compartment automatically released a measured amount of gunpowder into the pan for another charge.

At the age of twenty-one, though, Colt decided to patent the idea he’d been toying with for years: the repeating revolver, It made a singular technical advance—what may seem obvious to us now: rather than relying on five barrels, Colt’s invention had a rotating cylinder that came into alignment with a single barrel. When cocked for firing, the next chamber revolved automatically to bring the next shot into line with the barrel. The gun included a locking pawl to keep the cylinder in line with the barrel, and a percussion cap that made it more reliable than any other gun available dominant mechanism of American weapons. The patent protected Colt’s fundamental ideas until 1857, by which time he was enormously wealthy and world-famous.

Colt would sell the Walker, Dragoon, and the Navy models. But it was the Single Action Army—more famously known as the “Peacemaker”—that would embody his legacy. An elegant gun with a practical and streamlined design, it took on near-mythological status not merely because of its easy use but because of the legendary men who claimed to shoot it. The first model gun had a solid frame that weighed around three pounds, a .45-caliber with a 7.5-inch barrel, blued steel, and an oil-stained walnut grip. It was soon one of the most popular guns ever made. In 1872, the Army’s Ordnance Board would adopt it for service.

It was likely Colt himself who came up with the moniker “Peacemaker” for his gun. It was not merely a stab at irony or an adman’s clever copy. Colt often, and vigorously, argued that this gun could empower the average American. The average man could order one through the mail for the somewhat affordable price of $17 and have a light but powerful weapon within weeks. And selling his guns to civilians—every civilian, if possible—would be Colt’s principal goal.

The weapon could be brandished for self-protection, of course, but it was a firearm so formidable that war was to become too destructive to be worth engaging in, Colt argued. The gun was, to him, an imperative tool in fulfilling the American dream on both a personal and providential scale. A Colt made one man six. “Place a revolver in the hands of a dwarf . . . and he is equal to a giant,” he said.

3. Spencer’s repeating rifle

On August 18, 1863, the inventor Christopher Spencer arrived at the White House to meet President Abraham Lincoln, who was fascinated by the mechanics of new guns, with his rifle in hand. The president would later refer to the inventor as “a quiet little Yankee who sold himself in relentless slavery to his idea for six weary years before it was perfect.”

The two men, surrounded by cabinet members and a smattering of other government officials, strolled to a spot not too far from where the Lincoln Monument now stands to have a shooting contest. “The target was a board about six inches wide and three feet high, with a black spot on each end, about forty yards away,” Spencer recalled. “The rifle contained seven cartridges. Mr. Lincoln’s first shot was about five inches low, but the next shot hit the bull’s-eye and the other five were close around it.”

“‘Now,’ said Mr. Lincoln,” according to Spencer, “ ‘we will see the inventor try it.’ The board was reversed and I fired at the other bull’s-eye, beating the president a little. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘you are younger than I am and have a better eye and a steadier nerve.’ ” It was in this moment that Lincoln finally decided these repeating rifle would be the gun of the Union.

While that last bit is almost surely mythology, the Spencer repeating rifle that Lincoln shot that day would take less nerve to use than any of the muzzle-loaded rifles being fired by the soldiers battling in the Civil War. Even in the best of conditions, the bravest and most competent soldier could fire a single-shot, muzzle-loaded gun—the dominant gun of the Civil War—perhaps three times in a minute. The Spencer rifle offered the soldier a spring-loaded, seven-shot tubular magazine in the butt of the gun. Its lever action ejected a spent cartridge and chambered a fresh one. A man could empty his entire magazine well within a minute and already be reloaded.

When an Army captain tested the Spencer rifle for the Union, he fired it more than eighty times without a single misfire. He then let the gun sit outside in the rain and sun. No problem. It still fired perfectly. Dyer buried the weapon in the sand, yet there was still no clogging of the mechanisms—even without cleaning. When he put the breech mechanism in salt water for twenty-four hours, it still worked.

General Ulysses S. Grant called Spencer’s rifles “the best breech-loading arms available.”

Like many later historians, Robert V. Bruce argued in his book Lincoln and the Tools of War that if the Union had adopted the repeating rifle earlier, “Gettysburg would certainly have ended the war. More likely, Chancellorsville or even Fredericksburg would have done it, and history would record no Gettysburg Address, no President Grant, perhaps no carpetbag reconstruction or Solid South.”

Bruce laid the blame for this calamity on the close-minded ordnance general James Wolfe Ripley. As a brigadier general in the Union Army during the Civil War, the rigid Ripley instituted a number of successful upgrades, including modernizing supply chains and artillery ordnance. Yet it was Ripley’s dislike of breech-loading repeating rifles—he called one a “newfangled gimcracker”—for which he is best remembered. Ripley had been witness to numerous allegedly game-changing inventions that failed during his time in American armory in Springfield, which made him skeptical of new loading techniques. Specifically, he believed breech-loading guns promoted waste and undermined discipline in battle.

But this, too, was likely revisionism. Though repeating rifles would dominate gun making in the coming decades and change the way Americans thought about shooting, even if the North had been able to ramp up production to arm enough troops to make a difference, it is unlikely the military would have been able to instill the principles and training necessary to make guns like the Spencer repeating rifle the dominant gun of the war.

Moreover, Lincoln had already directed Ripley to order Spencer repeating rifles by the time he fired the gun: more than 10,000 of them would be delivered to the Army and Navy by 1862, and another 37,000 had already been ordered. The gun, in fact, had already seen action by the time the Spencer and Lincoln were shooting at their targets. Union troops commanded by Colonel John T. Wilder’s “Lightning Brigade” had defeated the notably larger Confederate forces at the Battle of Chickamauga using some of the new repeating guns. One dazed Southern prisoner reportedly asked a Union officer, “What kind of Hell-fire guns have your men got?”

4. The Browning 1911

On June 28, 1914, Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb, pulled a Browning pistol from his coat and shot twice, killing Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife, Sophie, the Duchess of Hohenberg. Before the nineteen-year-old was able to turn the gun on himself, a group of bystanders standing nearby on the Sarajevo street tackled him and grabbed the gun. The scene was mayhem. Franz Ferdinand’s bloody undershirt and Princip’s gun would end up in the hands of a Jesuit priest named Anton Puntigam, a close friend, who had performed the blood-soaked last rites on the archduke and his wife.

The repercussions of this event, well-known and massive, would embroil millions and change the world forever. Yet we would be remiss not to point out that even a bumbling assassin with a half-baked plan needed only two shots from a Browning Model 1910 to plunge the world into conflict. The Browning pistol, after all, was one of the most reliable and sturdy handguns ever produced. What makes the gun even more amazing is that it was one of about a dozen game-changing inventions concocted by its inventor, John Browning.

In one way or another, Browning’s ideas played a part in nearly every conflict in the twentieth century as he invented and conceptualized the modern gun. The rest would merely be tinkering and streamlining his foundational ideas. Browning brought his creations to a host of gun manufacturers around the world, and those gunmakers who didn’t work with him would copy him. By the end of his career, the man from Utah had a say in virtually every category of firearms in existence: rifles, pistols, shotguns, machine guns, and cannons.

One of his most lasting guns would be the 1911.

Browning’s patents evolved into the Model 1900, the Model 1903, the Model 1910, and finally the Colt Model 1911, which would possess numerous components that are still widely used in semiautomatic pistols—including, most recognizably, the detachable magazines that could be loaded in the butts of the guns. When the U.S. Army put the gun to its standard 6,000-shot test (allowing cooling every 100 rounds and cleaning every 1,000), it accomplished the task without a single failure of any kind.

During World War I its reputation was further buttressed by stories of American bravery. Most famous was the case of Alvin Cullum York, better known as Sergeant York, one of the most decorated American soldiers of the conflict. York famously received a Medal of Honor for leading an attack on a German machine-gun nest, killing at least 25 enemy soldiers and capturing 132. York, a Tennessean whose blacksmith father still hunted with a flintlock rifle, was also pacifist who had petitioned for conscientious objector status. “Don’t Want to Fight” was his stated reason. He was denied.

In October 1918, York found himself in command of his unit after an ambush killed two of his commanding officers. He helped fight off more than a hundred Germans. After his Springfield rifle was exhausted of ammunition, York claimed to have repelled a German bayonet charge of six soldiers with nothing more than his 1911 pistol. An investigator would later find twenty-three .45 rounds fired from a Colt 1911 handgun on the site.

The gun York used would be the standard-issue sidearm of the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1986; in other words, American soldiers holstered the gun from before World War I nearly to the end of the Cold War. It would be widely embraced by American law enforcement and become a bestseller in the civilian marketplace. Colt produced more than 2.6 million military pistols based on the 1911 design and another 400,000 for civilians. All told, nearly 5 million were manufactured by various gunmakers.

5. Stoner’s AR-15/M-16

Eugene Stoner was nothing more than a gun hobbyist shooting off rounds of his strange homemade rifle on a local Southern California range during the summer, when executives for the struggling Los Angeles firm ArmaLite spotted the young man. Stoner, who was something of an aviation technology expert when the men first approached him in 1945, would become the chief engineer of the small gun manufacturer, embracing the kind of jet-age idealism that allowed it to break free of the constraints of traditional gun design.

ArmaLite had shown early interest in hybridizing technological advances of World War II airplane design, of plastics and alloys, with their small arms. Although it took a long time for Stoner to get it right, and an even longer time to convince military leaders it could work, his creation dominates the rifle market to this day. In 1955, when Stoner completed the first version of his AR-10—a light, seven-pound selective-fire rifle—the company began receiving some notice. But it wasn’t until the summer of 1960, when controversial Air Force general Curtis LeMay—the creator of the strategic bombing campaign in the Pacific theater during World War II and reportedly the model for General Buck Turgidson in Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove—attended an Independence Day picnic sponsored by Colt (which had bought Armalite), that the gun would become a military concern.

As the tale goes, General LeMay was handed an AR-15 by Colt reps (the “AR” stands for Armalite, not “assault weapon”), who placed three watermelons at distances of 50, 100, and 150 yards. The general shot two of them and handed back the gun. When asked if he wanted to shoot the third, LeMay replied, “Hell, no, let’s eat it.” So impressed was LeMay after only two squeezes of the trigger, it seems, that he ordered 80,000 rifles on the spot.

Like the Lincoln-Spencer moment, this moment is probably less than the entire truth. Whatever the case, after initial mechanical and maintenance problem had been rectified, the AR’s military iteration, the M16, would be adopted by the United States Army .

In 1997, Stoner died in his garage while tinkering with guns at the age of seventy-four, a wealthy and content man. The gun he invented would not bear his name, nor would most Americans even know who he was. His AR-15 would be manufactured by dozens of American companies, including major Bushmaster, Remington Arms, and Smith & Wesson, becoming the most popular rifle in America. The civilian AR-15, which had a military appearance if not military power, would become increasingly controversial because mass murderers would often use them. Stoner’s family would claim that the inventor never intended for his famous gun to fall into civilian hands. This seems unlikely, considering that both ArmaLite and Colt sold the gun directly to the civilian marketplace before they ever agreed on large military contracts. Never once during the many years the gun was sold to Americans is there any evidence that Stoner was troubled by the civilian sales—or his profession, for that matter.

The New York Times Botches America’s History With The Gun,"Over the past 50 years, a wide-ranging, well-funded political, cultural, and legal revisionism effort has been undertaken to erase much of the United States’ history and culture of the gun and the Second Amendment. The New York Times’s Nick Kristof’s recent column, “It’s Time To Talk About The NRA” (because no one’s been talking about them!) is a good example of this trend.

I’ll ignore Kristof’s partisan contentions about firearm violence, gun control, and the National Rifle Association’s lobbying, fundraising and scoring—much of it highly debatable—to point out three of the misleading historical assertions he embraces.

First, Kristof makes the claim that contemporary firearm advocates, in an effort to “reinterpret” the Second Amendment, had “expanded the gun-buying constituency by reframing the purpose of firearms from hunting to personal security.” As even a cursory reading of the Founders and American leaders through the 19th century can attest, this is untrue.

The predominant philosophical concern driving the creation of the Second Amendment was protection from domestic or foreign tyranny, or protection of personal property and life. As John Adams explained (quoting legal authority William Blackstone) when defending a British soldier who had fired into an American mob in 1770, self-defense was “the primary canon in the law of nature.”

In my book “First Freedom: A Ride Through America’s Enduring History with the Gun,” I detail how this ideal was widely embraced by the Founding generation. The right to defend your property, life and liberty girds the entire American project. Not a single Founder ever challenged the notion of individual firearm ownership. Most celebrated it. Individual ownership of firearms was so omnipresent in colonial days—and beyond—that Americans saw no more need to debate its existence. Debates over the Second Amendment involved a disagreement over who should control the militia: state or federal government.

Second, the idea that “Gun control laws were ubiquitous” in the 19th century is the work of politically motivated historians who cobble together every minor local restriction they can find in an attempt to create the impression that gun control was the norm. If this were true, Kristof wouldn’t need to jump to 1879 to offer his first specific case.

Visitors to Wichita, Kan., had to check their revolvers at police headquarters. As for Dodge City, a symbol of the Wild West, a photo shows a sign on main street in 1879 warning: “The Carrying of Fire Arms Strictly Prohibited.”

This talking point has been trotted out for years because it’s the closest thing anyone can find to resemble gun control in the Old West — a picture. But we don’t even know how rigidly the law was enforced, for how long, or if ever. We certainly don’t know that the guns were dropped off at “police headquarters.”

Dodge City-type ordinances—and those of some other towns—typically applied to the areas north of the “deadline,” which was the railroad tracks and a kind of red-light district. By 1879, Dodge City had nearly 20 businesses licensed to sell liquor and many whorehouses teeming with intoxicated young men. It was reasonable that these businesses wouldn’t want armed men with revolvers packed into their establishments.

However, the men voluntarily abandoned their weapons in exchange for entertainment and drink—just as they do today when entering establishments that prohibit the carrying of firearms. Those weapons were handed back to them when they were done. Not in their wildest imaginations would they have entertained the notion of asking the government for permission—getting a license or undergoing a background check—to own a firearm.

In the rest of the city, as with almost every city in the West, guns were allowed, and people walked around with them freely and openly. They bought them freely and openly. Even children could buy them. A man could buy a Colt or Remington or Winchester, and he could buy as many as he liked without anyone taking notice.

The fact is that in the 19th century there were no statewide or territory-wide gun control laws for citizens, and certainly no federal laws. Nor was there a single case challenging the idea of the individual right of gun ownership. Guns were romanticized in the literature and art, and the era’s greatest engineers designed and sold them. All the while, American leaders continued to praise the Second Amendment as a bulwark against tyranny.

Those who praised this right, incidentally, include numerous post-Civil War civil rights activists, who offered particularly powerful arguments for the importance of the Second Amendment. Most gun-control regulations that did exist, after all, were used for subjugating blacks and Indians.

From the Old West, we jump to the 20th century, about which Kristof says:

In the 1920s and 1930s, the N.R.A. favored tighter gun laws, and its president, Karl Frederick, said that the carrying of weapons ‘should be sharply restricted and only under license.’ In 1934, the United States helped pioneer modern gun laws with the National Firearms Act, with the blessings of the N.R.A., and came close to banning handguns. As recently as the 1960s, the N.R.A. supported — more grudgingly — some limits on guns.

The United States never came close, or even entertained, the idea of banning “all handguns.” I have no idea what Kristof is referring to, since he offers no citation for this claim. The National Firearms Act of 1934, of course, didn’t ban any specific category of gun. The National Firearms Act of 1938 didn’t ban any specific gun, either. In fact, the NRA—still a hobbyist group at the time—only supported the legislation, which allowed for regulating shotguns’ barrel length and instituted a tax on some fully automatic weapons, when Congress dropped a proposal to create a registry of fingerprints.

The first time any kind of gun ban was instituted regarding a category of weapon occurred in 1986, when the sale of fully automatic weapons was highly restricted.

The story of the NRA’s dramatic radicalization by a minority is another favorite yarn of anti-Second Amendment advocates—a misleading half-truth that is also largely irrelevant. It’s true that the NRA was not predominately political, since there was no need for such an organization in a nation where no one had seriously attempted to inhibit the ability of law-abiding citizens to own guns.

By the time the Gun Control Act of 1968 was proposed—a law that established a system for federally licensed gun dealers and set some restrictions on certain classes of firearms—the NRA was more involved. It successfully opposed the most invasive elements of that legislation: namely, a mandated federal registry for guns and licensing for all gun carriers. That’s the kind of legislation gun control advocates want today.

It was after this time that a slew of regulations were enacted that made it increasingly difficult for law-abiding people in crime-ridden urban areas to own a gun. The NRA went through an internal debate about its future. When in 1971 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms shot and paralyzed longtime NRA member Kenyon Ballew in a Washington suburb—it claimed Ballew was suspected of possessing illegal weapons (none were found)—many co-members saw it as a portent that government agencies would abuse gun control laws to target peaceful Americans.

So the organization had to make a choice. It could remain a predominately hunting, marksmanship, and safety group, or it could embrace the growing activist wing and push back against emerging regulations. By the mid-1970s it seemed as if the organization had made that choice when it ejected around 70 of the most vociferous gun rights advocates. In 1976 the NRA board decided to move the organization headquarters from Washington to Colorado.

At the 1977 NRA convention in Cincinnati, there was something of a coup as the politically minded advocates wrested the organization away from the apolitical wing. Many of today’s gun control advocates like to point to the “Cincinnati revolt” as the moment when a small group of radicals took over the movement, undermining true gun owners, who weren’t interested in politics. But the shift was merely a reflection of a growing inclination among gun owners at the time to protect themselves.

The NRA was best-positioned organization to take the lead on gun issues. If the NRA didn’t do it, there would have been another advocacy group—and many emerged during these years—that would have taken its place. The fact that the NRA hadn’t initially involved itself in politics didn’t mean most gun owners disagreed with its new positioning or that it had reinvented or tried to re-engineer the Second Amendment. Hardly. From the time of the 1977 “revolt” to 1983, in fact, the NRA more than doubled its membership. And membership rose even further in the subsequent years.

You can oppose the Second Amendment if you like. You can demonize the NRA if you want. But you can’t rewrite history to comport with your political positions.

"Yes, Doctors Should ‘Stay In Their Lane’ On Gun Policy","What kind of ignorant troglodyte would tell a doctor to mind his own business?

This was, in essence, the question an incredulous media was asking after the National Rifle Association disparaged the American College of Physicians (ACP) for promoting an array of gun-control regulations last week. “Someone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane,” the NRA tweeted. “Half of the articles in Annals of Internal Medicine are pushing for gun control. Most upsetting, however, the medical community seems to have consulted NO ONE but themselves.”

The reaction to the NRA’s reply was swift, overwhelming, and widely covered, giving the ACP exactly the attention they desired. (Did I mention these are doctors we’re talking about?) As it turns out, there are a number of very good reasons professional medical groups should “stay in their lane” on public policy. Many of these reasons were accentuated in this very debate.

For one thing, neither internists nor radiologists, by virtue of their career choice, have special expertise in public policy, gun ownership, or the relationship between firearms and the rights associated with them. Speaking about these issues with the authority of an expert is a transparent appeal to authority.

For another thing, the ACP uses its position to create the perception that “doctors”—virtually all of them—believe in one set of policy prescriptions. I have a feeling this isn’t true. Even if it were, though, doctors—physicists, engineers, teachers, business owners, truck drivers, and any other smart human being— are just as susceptible to partisan biases and agendas as anyone else is.

Most of the ACP membership’s reaction to the NRA, in fact, was propelled by emotional manipulation and depiction of the horrors of gun violence that does absolutely nothing to tell the public about the efficacy of its supposed solutions. And as soon as doctors received pushback, the veneer of science-based solution-seeking fell away.

“Do you have any idea how many bullets I pull out of corpses weekly? This isn’t just my lane,” tweeted a doctor named Judy Melinek (the tweet has now been “liked” more than 500,000 times). “It’s my f—ing highway.”

Perhaps it’s understandable that someone who regularly witnesses the horrific aftermath of shootings feels this way. It still doesn’t make her public policy opinions more valid or convincing than those of a columnist or a gun seller. Some doctors deal with ghastly vehicular injuries and the 37,000 car fatalities every year. Their work is also incredibly important, yet their experience does not imbue them with expertise on the mechanics of a steering wheel or best way to direct traffic.

In fact, those who are regularly exposed to the ugly side of a particular issue often become hyper-focused and invested in ways that make them unable to contextualize it. If we let nutritionists create food policy, we would never have another decent meal. If we let doctors who watch the 38,000 Americans who die from cirrhosis (and other liver diseases) every year make laws, we may well have prohibition. If we let climate scientists craft environmental policies, the world economy would crater into a massive depression.

The ACP argues that medical professionals have a “special responsibility” to recommend “a public health approach to firearms-related violence and the prevention of firearm injuries and deaths” and to speak out and support “appropriate regulation of the purchase” of guns. “It is not an ‘us versus them’ issue,” Heather Sher, a radiologist, told The Washington Post. “What we are truly asking for is a coming together of both sides to find a solution to this national health problem.”

In truth, “finding a solution” is a euphemism loosely translated as, “adopt our policies, either incrementally or fully, or you support a terrorist organization.” But the argument over the solutions is the debate. ACP wants to skip that part. Some of us, for example, believe that one answer (there is no panacea, of course) is to relax gun restrictions that inhibit law-abiding Americans from defending themselves, their families, and their communities. The explosion of gun ownership in the early 1990s, after all, corresponded with the precipitous drop in gun homicides—which no one reading the ACP’s literature would know are still at near-historic lows.

Most of the “appropriate” measures ACP floats were already on the books in California when the Thousand Oaks mass shooting occurred. Yet the ACP report is teeming with long-standing, highly debatable contentions about guns that have as much to with the wounds doctors treat as their angry reaction has to do with effective gun laws. That’s fine as a matter of activism, but there’s nothing rational or unique about this kind of positioning. And the NRA has every right to push back against groups that use science to conceal their political arguments.

The Only Way To End Gun Violence Is To Ban Guns Completely,"The tragedy at the heart of the gun control debate is that any firearm that can be used for good can also be used for evil. There are not good guns and bad guns. There are just guns, used by good and bad people. Any firearm that is effective for legitimate uses like hunting and self-defense will also be effective when used for evil purposes.

Nor can guns always be kept out of the wrong hands, for we cannot always know who will do evil, and those known to be hellbent on doing harm to others will often circumvent restrictions. Thus, the only realistic way to prevent mass shootings and end gun violence would be a total gun ban, ruthlessly enforced. Unfortunately, gun control advocates’ rhetoric is deliberately crafted to obscure this uncomfortable reality.

A ‘National Emergency’ Calls For Which Drastic Measures?

Knowing that Americans do not want to give up their right to keep and bear arms, many gun control supporters peddle a soothing lie wrapped in panic. As the Washington Post’s editors put it, “Gun violence is a national emergency and a public-health crisis—a crisis that could be ameliorated, without depriving anyone of their constitutional rights.”

Those in favor of ever-more gun control often try to walk this rhetorical tightrope. In order to rally support, they need to suggest that they have a real solution to gun violence––especially highly publicized mass murders––but they also need to reassure moderates and gun owners who do not want their guns to be taken away.

Anti-gun activists want the moral clarity and passion of a crusade against evil (“Enough is enough!”), but they also need to insist that their proposals are sensible reforms that will not infringe on our rights. This rhetorical two-step reveals the bad faith of the gun control movement. Their supposedly limited “common sense” policies would not end gun violence or stop mass shootings; they would not even do much to ameliorate them.

The “assault weapons” ban the Washington Post proposes might reduce the body counts of some mass shootings—maybe. The actual policy results (possible minor reductions in gun violence) are at odds with gun control supporters’ fervid, moralistic rhetoric and grandiose claims.

The disparity disappears, however, if it is assumed that ostensibly moderate proposals are part of an incremental strategy. The evidence supports this. The Washington Post has never seen a gun-rights restriction it disliked. Its editors have argued that government gun registries are the “most reasonable and benign of measures” and were horrified at private “ownership of semiautomatic handguns and rifles” and citizens lawfully “carrying weapons in public.” They wrote that it “makes no sense from a safety perspective to sanction the carrying of such weapons on city streets.”

The only example I could find of them opposing a DC restriction on gun rights was when it would have imperiled the national gun control agenda. They do not believe in a right to keep and bear arms; they believe that it should be a privilege, sparingly bestowed and heavily regulated.

No Need to Hide the Obvious Agenda

Some Post writers are even less circumspect about their desire to get rid of guns. Writer and pundit Elizabeth Bruenig suggests that reducing the supply of guns “is the solution to the United States’ nightmarish mass shooting problem.” Her colleague Helaine Olen writes that, “Minus firearms, these shooters have been angry, troubled people who think violent thoughts. It’s the easy ability to obtain firearms that turns them into killers.” There is logic to this: ban the tool, and the evil work it is used for becomes impossible.

But so does the good work, especially that of personal self-defense. So we are back to the tragedy of the gun control debate—guns that can be effective for good will also be effective for evil, and vice versa. This is true even for the so-called assault rifles that have been demonized by gun control advocates as mass murder machines. Semi-automatic rifles are often excellent tools for home defense, sport shooting, and hunting. There is no functional distinction between the guns used by responsible citizens for good and the guns used by criminals for evil.

Mass shootings are horrifying examples of this. Despite disproportionate media coverage, they account for a small percentage of shooting victims, and none of the usual gun control proposals would stop all, most, or perhaps even any, of them. The National Rifle Association (NRA) is condemned as a villain obstructing “sensible” and “common sense” proposals that would have prevented the latest tragedy, but as National Review staffer David French writes, we do not really know how to stop mass shootings.

They have been committed with every sort of modern firearm, from handguns to shotguns to various types of rifles, often in jurisdictions with strict gun control and in locales where guns were prohibited. Many perpetrators who should have been prohibited from owning guns slipped through the cracks of bureaucratic incompetence; restrictions and regulations are useless when they are inadequately enforced.

I sympathize with gun control advocates who look at the latest mass shooting or violent crime report and wonder why we cannot seem to stop these evils. But productive dialogue and effective policy must be built on truth, and it is not true that there is one simple trick to solve gun violence, that it would not infringe the rights of legitimate gun owners, and that it is only being blocked by the NRA’s wiles. This is childish fantasy, no matter how often it is repeated.

Dishonesty breeds distrust, so when gun control advocates demagogue over shootings that none of their stated policy proposals would have prevented, it is obvious that they are either cynically manipulating the ignorant or hiding their real policy goals––or both. “Enough is enough,” thunders the Washington Post. No doubt the editors will say the same again if their current policy proposals are adopted and inevitably fail. Presumably they would repeat it until the entire country resembles Washington D.C. before the Heller decision—disarmed, except for the government and the criminals.

Here's What The Media's Not Telling About That Criminal Justice Bill,"Last week, news broke that a bipartisan compromise on criminal justice reform had been tentatively reached, teeing up the First Step Act for passage before Congress’ lame-duck session ends next month. The House-passed version of the bill has been stalled for more than five months, but a behind-the-scenes agreement to add sentencing reform to the prison reform package has given new life to the legislation.

President Trump quickly embraced the news, telling lawmakers to get the bill on his desk. “Did I hear that word ‘bipartisan’? Did I hear that word? That’s a nice word,” Trump quipped at a White House event, surrounded by lawmakers from both parties and his son-in-law-turned-advisor, Jared Kushner, who had been pushing the legislation. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly told Trump there may not be enough time for the Senate to take up the bill before the legislative session ends on December 14.

Over the weekend, McConnell’s Republican colleagues, Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul, hit the Sunday circuit to pressure Senate leaders to move the legislation forward before the year-end recess. Advocates for the legislation, such as Justice Action Network, the nation’s largest bipartisan group pushing criminal justice reform, are likewise pushing the Senate majority leader to bring the First Step Act to the floor.

‘Big Government Run Amok’

“Our current criminal justice system is big government run amok,” said Lauren Krisai, a senior policy analyst with the Justice Action Network. Krisai calls the First Step Act a chance to “begin to correct that in a meaningful way,” adding that “with the support of President Trump, the Fraternal Order of Police, faith groups, advocacy groups, and legislators from both sides of the aisle, there’s really no excuse for Leader McConnell to not put this important bill on the floor.”

Not all Republican senators support this legislation. Last week, in an op-ed for USA Today, first-term Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton called the act “a misguided effort to let serious felons out of prison.” Rather than pass it, Cotton suggested Congress first clean out the overreaching federal code and federal regulations which together create as many as 300,000 criminal violations. The junior senator from Arkansas also argued that the criminal code needs harsher sentences for fentanyl traffickers to address the current opioid crisis.

With less than a month until Congress recesses, the fate of the bill likely depends on whether the feel-good criminal justice reform narrative takes hold or whether the “weak on crime” counter establishes a foothold in the public’s consciousness. Unfortunately, while the dueling narratives compete for media space, the substantive details of the proposed changes remain ignored, with the press providing only cursory coverage of the legal changes the compromise bill would adopt.

For instance, The New York Times reported: “the compromise would eliminate the so-called stacking regulation that makes it a federal crime to possess a firearm while committing another crime, like a drug offense; expand the ‘drug safety valve’ allowing judges to sidestep mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders; and shorten mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.”

Are Journalists Even Reporting This Correctly?

The first compromise listed in the Times write-up struck a strange cord: Why would Democrats, who push for more gun control, seek to eliminate a crime related to the possession of a firearm? And why would Republicans, who object to the government infringing on law-abiding citizens’ right to bear arms in the name of combating gun violence, seek to protect criminals from punishment for possessing a gun?

The answer took some time to discover but is simple enough: They don’t. Contrary to the Times’ superficial reporting, the proposed compromise does not eliminate the sentencing enhancement for possession a firearm while committing another offense. Rather, the floated change would add a minor tweak to the governing law to assure that first-time offenders are not treated the same as repeat offenders. Let’s break it down.

The statutory provision at issue, Section 924(c) of the federal code, provides for an additional five years in prison for a defendant who possesses a gun during a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. For the second (and each subsequent offense), 25 additional years of imprisonment is tacked on to the sentence for the underlying crime. These additional terms of imprisonment are mandatory.

As currently interpreted by the Supreme Court, the five-year and 25-year mandatory sentencing enhancements of Section 924(c) are accumulated or “stacked” in the same trial. Thus, if a defendant is convicted of multiple counts of possessing a gun during a crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense, the judge must add five years to the defendant’s sentence for the first count, then 25 years for the second and all future counts of conviction—even though the convictions all stem from the same trial.

The Reform Poster Boy Isn’t What He’s Been Portrayed

Weldon Angelos has become the poster boy for those pushing to change Section 924(c). In 2004, 24-year-old Angelos was sentenced to 55 years in federal prison for possessing a handgun when he sold a few hundred dollars’ worth of marijuana to an undercover informant on three separate occasions.

Under Section 924(c), possession of the gun during the first sale resulted in a mandatory five-year sentence, but the second sale triggered an additional 25-year sentence, as did the third sale. Thus, for possessing a gun while selling about $1,000 worth of marijuana, Angelos received a 55-year prison sentence, although he was later released from prison in 2016, apparently when the federal prosecutor failed to object to Angelos’ motion for a reduced sentence.

The statutory language of the proposed change to Section 924(c)—leaked to The New York Times—is minor, but would have significant consequences to those similarly situated. The relevant provision of the proposed legislation would clarify that second and later convictions would only trigger the 25-year mandatory sentencing enhancement if the first conviction had already become “final.”

A conviction becomes final only after the right to appeal has expired, so under the amendment a defendant, such as Angelos, would receive a five-year mandatory sentence under Section 924(c) for possessing a gun during a drug deal, assuming he had no prior convictions at the time of the trial. That five-year sentence would then be on top of whatever sentence stemmed from the underlying drug offense. But the additional 25 years of imprisonment would not be stacked on top unless the defendant commits another crime.

This proposed change seems imminently reasonable. As Brett L. Tolman, the U.S. attorney for the district of Utah at the time Angelos was sentenced, explained, “the draconian sentence mandated for Angelos seemed disconnected to the purpose of the law.” Now an advocate for criminal justice reform and an attorney in private practice in Utah, Tolman noted that Congress intended Section 924 to punish those with prior convictions more severely, but in practice first-time offenders, such as Angelos, receive sentences far exceeding those needed for retribution or rehabilitation.

While Angelos’ case highlights an apparent injustice with the functioning of Section 924(c), the unreported facts underlying Angelos’ conviction raise another question for Congress and the public to consider: How harshly should criminals who possess guns be sentenced?

Every time there is a mass shooting, gun control activists demand more gun laws, implying that if only the United States had commonsense gun laws, gun violence would not occur. But what of the criminals who possess guns? And possess them illegally?

There’s Much More to the Angelos Story

This is where “the rest of the story” comes in to play. Although the press loves to portray Angelos as a young family man—the father of two small children—and an up-and-coming record producer who inadvertently got caught up in a drug sting, the court records tell a different story.

First, in addition to the three Section 924 gun possession counts that triggered the 55-year sentence, a jury convicted Angelos on 13 other counts, including money-laundering, two counts of possessing a stolen firearm, and one count of possessing a firearm which had its serial number filed off. While Angelos technically qualified as a first-time offender, he would be better described as an offender caught for the first time as an adult.

Angelos had a previous juvenile conviction on a felony firearm charge and a long juvenile arrest record for a number of other offenses. Additionally, according to the appellate court decision, the drug sales that hit Angelos with the 55-year mandatory minimum were sales to a confidential informant who was “a fellow gang member.” Far from dealing drugs on the side, the evidence indicated that Angelos had sold drugs regularly for several years.

A search of Angelos’ apartment also resulted in the seizure of three pounds of marijuana, a Glock 17 9mm handgun, a Ruger P85 9mm handgun, and a Walther PPK .380 handgun, as well as a large cache of cash. A later search of a house Angelos rented uncovered several large duffle bags containing marijuana residue, a bulletproof vest, another handgun, and a Bushmaster XM15-E2S—an assault weapon in the parlance of the gun control crowd. The reality of Angelos’ background is much more troubling than the media and some proponents of this legislation would have you believe.

Yet while much of the media portrays Angelos’ history sympathetically, Tolman harbors no such illusions. “None of the prosecutors involved in the case viewed Angelos’ criminal conduct naively,” Tolman noted. “He was definitely on a dangerous road at the time he was arrested, but a 55-year sentence is crazy.” At the same time, Tolman admits that Angelos’ nearly lifetime sentence likely served as a wakeup call, prompting the young man to turn his life around following his release from prison.

As Tolman sees it, the suggested amendment to Section 924 and the other changes proposed in the compromise floated for the First Step Act strike a necessary balance: “All of the changes proposed address problems with the current sentencing code, while assuring prosecutors retain the tools necessary to obtain tough sentences for dangerous criminals.”

We will soon know whether Congress also sees the First Step Act as striking the appropriate balance between deterrence and punishment and justice. The bigger question, though, may be for Second Amendment advocates and gun control activists to debate: How can we, as a country, enforce the many commonsense gun laws already on the books without resorting to lifetime sentences for criminals?

The Second Amendment Has Always Been An Individual Right,"In a recent interview with The New York Times regarding his upcoming memoir, former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens shares what he contends are the three worst court decisions to come down during his long tenure. His first choice, unsurprisingly, is District of Columbia v. Heller, the 2008 ruling that finally codified the Second Amendment as an individual right.

Stevens told the Times that he even took “an extraordinary step in trying to head off the decision,” preemptively sending the other justices a probable dissent to convince them to change their positions. “The combination of its actual practical impact by increasing the use of guns in the country and also the legal reasoning, which I thought was totally unpersuasive,” he says, “persuaded me that the case is just about as bad as any in my tenure.”

Stevens doesn’t even attempt to hide the political motivation behind his argument. Earlier this year, in fact, Stevens implored Americans to do what he couldn’t while on the court, and repeal the Second Amendment. Stevens quotes former Chief Justice Burger, who in 1991 claimed that activists had perpetrated “one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.”

Both these justices rely on an expedient revisionist history to make their claims. This effort was spearheaded by left-wing historians who attempted to retroactively dismiss the ubiquitous presence of guns in American life and the role firearms played in the rise of a nation. It was taken up by anti-firearm activists and journalists who have used that revisionist history to dismiss the overwhelming evidence that the founding generation believed individual Americans had an inherent right to bear those arms.

All of these forces fostered a “collective right” theory regarding the Second Amendment that was normalized in legal and political circles for decades. Countless judges, like Stevens, latched onto this mythology in an attempt to disarm law-abiding individuals in the name of safety.

The singular purpose of the Second Amendment, they argued, was to arm militias, not individuals. For some reason, they contend, the Second Amendment, unlike most of the Bill of Rights, actually empowered the government rather than the individual. Any other interpretation was an antiquated and destructive reading of the past.

But history has never backed up this contention — not then, and not now. The notion of individual ownership of firearms was so unmistakable and so omnipresent in colonial days—and beyond—that Americans saw no more need to debate its existence than they did the right to drink water or breathe the air. Not a single Minuteman was asked to hand his musket over to the Continental Congress after chasing the British back to Boston. If they had been, the Revolution would have been short-lived, indeed.

The debate over the Second Amendment centered on who controlled the militias: the federal or state governments. Everyone understood that a militia consisted of free individuals who would almost always grab their own firearms—the ones they used in their everyday existence—to engage in a concerted effort to protect themselves, their community, or their country — sometimes from their own government. Many colonies enshrined an individual’s right to bear arms in their constitutions before the Bill of Rights was even written, most of them in more explicit individualistic terms. Not a single Framer objected.

“The right of self defense is the first law of nature,” wrote George Tucker in the 1803 Blackstone’s Commentaries regarding the American Second Amendment. “In most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits . . . and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.”

During the 19th century, there was still no need to debate whether the Second Amendment was an individual right. The right of an individual to bear arms had been so self-evident that on the rare occasions it was mentioned in any kind of political or legal context, it was brought up to compare American liberty with tyranny elsewhere.

In an 1823 letter to John Adams, William H. Sumner, a politician and general in the Massachusetts militia, noted that if the population of the United States, “like that of Europe, chiefly consisted of an unarmed peasantry,” it would be conquerable. “Here,” he went on, “every house is a castle, and every man a soldier. Arms are in every hand, confidence in every mind, and courage in every heart. It depends upon its own will, and not upon the force of the enemy, whether such a country shall ever be conquered.”

Adams concurred with this thinking. An armed citizenry would not be susceptible to tyranny.

“The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers,” wrote Joseph Story, an associate Supreme Court justice in the early 1800s, “and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.”

Contemporary liberals often view this form of anti-government rhetoric and reasoning at best distasteful and at worst an endorsement of treason. Of course, despite our many political battles, there is no need for armed insurrection today. What contemporary critics fail to comprehend, however, is that the founding generation believed those who would undermine the universal and inalienable liberties of the people laid out in the Constitution—whether they were in the government or not—are the ones committing sedition.

The individual right to bear arms wasn’t challenged during the Civil War era, when manufacturing capacity and industrialization of the Union—spurred in part by gun innovators like Sam Colt—not only helped create superior armaments and technology that helped defeat the Confederacy but also made guns more widespread than ever.

During the 1800s, firearm innovation permitted the common man to buy more powerful guns more cheaply. These were the guns Americans used to explore, tame, and ultimately populate the West. This project, with all its moral implications, both admirable and sometimes ugly, made the United States the most powerful economic power on earth. Never once did anyone contest the right of individual men (and plenty of women) to own guns.

It’s true, a number of municipalities in the West enacted the occasional local gun ordinance in their red districts. Gun controllers love to cobble together these rare, narrow and tepid prohibitions to create the impression that there was widespread gun control. Not one of these regulations ever challenged the idea of a man’s individual right to own a Remington, Colt, Winchester, or any other gun. Or as many guns as he liked.

When weapons were confiscated by authorities, it was typically in an effort to subjugate minorities — mostly blacks, Native Americans, and others who happen to get in the way of corrupt politicians. When one of the sponsors of the 14th Amendment made his argument for equal protection, it was no accident that he brought up vital “individual right” laid out in the Second Amendment. Not one person objected to say it was a collective right.

It wasn’t until the rise of criminality in the 1930s that there was any federal gun law—and even then, no one made the legal or political argument for the collective theory. It wasn’t until the late 1960s that the left adopted this imaginary understanding of a natural right.

“Putting all of these textual elements together,” wrote Justice Antonin Scalia in his historical, philosophical, and legal exposition of the Second Amendment, “we find that they guarantee the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation. This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment. We look to this because it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right.”

The fact that Stevens’ messy, historically challenged dissent couldn’t persuade Scalia, or anyone else, is unsurprising.

Stevens’ feelings about guns or gun violence do not erase the fact that, both in English common law and in American life, the individual right to self-defense goes back farther than our right to a free press and to freedom of religion. Yet, the fact that the Heller, a decision that invalidated a federal law prohibiting law-abiding citizens from owning a handguns in some of the most crime-ridden neighborhoods in America, bothers Stevens more than any other tells us plenty about his legacy.

5 Things Major Media Won’t Tell You About The Parkland Shooting,"It’s been almost a year since a young man entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and killed 17 students with a gun. After the media and Democrats pushed a narrative that the problem was merely a lack of gun control, much of the world moved on. But research, reports, and investigations that occurred this last year have proven it’s not that simple.

Not surprisingly, what we have learned about the tragedy in Parkland has nothing to do with a lack of gun control, nor does it even point to gun problems in the United States. The mainstream media will not admit this, or follow up on what we have learned since Parkland, because it does not align with their narrative.

So, here are some of the truths discovered since then — many in the last two weeks, and many of which are still unfolding.

1. The Broward County Sheriff’s Department Was Ill-equipped

If local journalists have learned anything, it’s that Broward County Sheriff staff were not equipped to handle such a tragic event, both due to lack of training and lack of courage. Several staff members have been fired or resigned due to this in the past month.

To start with, when the Broward County Sheriff’s Department received the 911 call, many members of law enforcement simply did not act quickly, either out of fear, lack of training, or cowardice. NBC News reports this could be in part due to the department’s active-shooter policy, which stated that deputies “may,” rather than “shall,” proceed into an active-shooter scene. Even so, some vague wording should not have kept armed, trained law enforcement from bombarding an area where a teenager was wielding a gun.

The Sun-Sentinel reports “seven Broward deputies, including the school resource officer, heard shots, but none ran into the school to confront and kill the shooter …” One of those people is Broward Deputy Josh Stambaugh. He arrived at the Parkland shooting and, via his body cam, the public can hear he could hear shots were being fired.

He arrived at the scene and took a full minute to put his vest on. Despite the fact that this happened nearly one year ago, video footage was only just now released to the public. If you really want to get angry, turn up your volume. As Stambaugh slowly prepares to do nothing, shots can be heard from his body cam.

Jan Jordan, the captain formerly in charge of the Parkland division, finally resigned this last month after recognizing her failure to act. In this clip, you can hear Sheriff Scott Israel describe that essentially Jordan was hired because she was a woman and would balance out the team’s mostly male staff.

Her lack of leadership led to kids dying, all because they wanted diversity! pic.twitter.com/oEB93ABF8E — Andrew Pollack (@AndrewPollackFL) November 29, 2018

Jordan has since been described as“overwhelmed,” “ineffective,” and “not engaged with the problem.” It should not have taken this long to begin to unravel the absolute ineffectiveness or cowardice of the Broward County Sheriff’s Department — and now that it has been, it should be front page news.

2. The Sheriff’s Department Continues to Refuse Responsibility

Although several members of the Broward County Sheriff’s department have resigned or been fired, many are still refusing to own up to their part in this tragedy. Scot Peterson is one of those people. He was the school resource officer on duty that day. Peterson has received incredible heat for his failure to react swiftly or to apprehend the shooter in any way.

In September, new surveillance footage surfaced of Peterson’s movements outside the school, which essentially show “he took cover and did nothing to confront the gunman.”

During the ordeal inside the freshman building, Peterson called over the radio for intersections to be blocked, which members of the commission said was precisely the wrong tactic when an active shooter is busy killing people. He failed to provide an initial radio report about the shootings to the Sheriff’s Office, letting minutes pass in silence. Peterson told officers to stay at least 500 feet from the building.

Peterson and others arriving to the scene should have charged in following the sound of gunshots. Investigations showed from the time shots were fired until the building was secured, Peterson staged himself about 69 feet from the building, where the shooter remained active, and never entered. Radio commands show he repeatedly told other officers to shut down traffic in the area and guard intersections. This is not what law enforcement should do when there is an active shooter at a school. Israel condemned Peterson’s lack of action days following the shooting.

Peterson gave one interview over the summer where he told families he was “sorry” and his inaction was not a result of a lack of bravery. Instead, he said he didn’t know which building shots were coming from (the campus is large). But that contradicts his own radio commands, where he tells incoming officers he hears shots coming from Building 1200.

Now, CBS Miami reports, “The disgraced Broward Sheriff’s Deputy who was the school resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School” — Peterson — says “he fears for his safety.” Andrew Pollack is the father of Meadow Pollack, a Parkland student who was shot nine times and killed. He filed a wrongful death law suit against Peterson. Since the shooting, Pollack has become an ambassador of school safety — and worked to uncover what went wrong that day.

Since Pollack’s filing, the deputy is trying to delay his Dec. 17th deposition. He is also asking that whenever the deposition is held Pollack and several others be kept away. He launched a GoFundMe account to pay for his legal fees and claimed he’s being harassed. Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was also killed that day, accuses him of simply refusing to take responsibility, yet again. It’s not hard to see why these parents would feel this way.

This pathetic peice of crap. He is trying to postpone the a hearing and keep parents like @AndrewPollackFL and I away. He blames cat calls from parents at the commission hearings. To be clear, there were no cat calls. https://t.co/WbnNiN5ps4 — Fred Guttenberg (@fred_guttenberg) November 30, 2018

Peterson is no longer with the sheriff’s department, but will reportedly receive a pension worth more than $100,000 annually.

Sgt. Brian Miller was initially the highest-ranking officer at Stoneman Douglas. He has been placed on paid suspension and was told to surrender his gun, badge, and car, pending further investigation. The Sun-Sentinel reports he also froze.

“He sat up on Holmberg Road for 10 minutes,” said Bob Gualtieri, the Pinellas County sheriff. “He heard gunshots and he didn’t move. He never got on the radio. He was the first supervisor on the scene, and he never moved, even after deputies and officers were going into that building.”

Like much of the other information regarding the entire department, these acts of cowardice and efforts to hide them are only just now coming out in November and December, nine months following the event.

3. Obama Policies Hid the Real Threat

Because of his very checkered past, the shooter was involved in a program called PROMISE, an Obama-era program that gives students a second chance after disciplinary problems. PROMISE — Preventing Recidivism through Opportunities, Mentoring, Intervention, Support, and Education — gives school administrators leeway in dealing with troubled kids. The Obama administration lauded it, and the school district was awarded $54 million in grants from the $4 billion ‘Race to the Top’ initiative.

Because of this leniency, despite dozens of red flags, the Parkland shooter was never arrested, but given second chance after second chance, and his punishments were reduced. He threatened kids, threatened teachers, took ammunition to school and the information was merely noted — no action taken. This was directly due to Obama administration policies that pushed schools to counsel, rather than punish, dangerous and misbehaving students.

Organizations are finally started to notice the detrimental effects. Here’s Politico: “Teachers said that such policies keep dangerous children in schools, posing a physical threat to students and staff and creating a disruptive learning environment.”

The fact that the shooter fell under the umbrella of PROMISE, a liberal program offering hugs rather than disciplinary action, means many parents from Parkland cannot hug their own child today. It’s disgraceful that following the shooting, practically the only thing the mainstream media discussed was gun control, not the fact that the shooter exhibited warning bells galore that were all ignored as a result of federal and local school discipline policies.

4. School Officials Also Continue to Refuse Responsibility

In November, the public is learning how little the Broward County schools are willing to step up and take responsibility for failing to keep their students safe. In fact, they’ve not only failed to, they have actively tried to hide their role.

In a truly mind-boggling article in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel headlined, “Hide, deny, spin, threaten: How the school district tried to mask failures that led to Parkland shooting,” the publication reported that following the shooting, Broward schools hired a woman named Sarah Brady for “crisis PR.” She not only disdained the press, saying they asked “wasteful questions,” but together, she and the schools also sought to “keep the people from finding out what went wrong.” The Sun-Sentinel reports:

After promising an honest assessment of what led to the shooting, the district instead hired a consultant whose primary goal, according to school records, was preparing a legal defense. Then the district kept most of those findings from the public. The district also spent untold amounts on lawyers to fight the release of records and nearly $200,000 to pay public relations consultants who advised administrators to clam up, the Sun Sentinel found.

The Broward County school system was so dedicated to hiding any information that might lead to clarity and truth of what led up to that fateful day, that journalists and parents of slain students had to sue to see bombshell documents that should have already been public.

Even now, almost nine months later, “few people have been held accountable — or even identified — for mishandling security and failing to react to signs that the troubled Cruz could erupt. Only two low-level security monitors have been fired,” the Sun-Sentinel reports. Four staff members, higher up on the totem pole — including three assistant principals — who knew more information and could be held accountable have been transferred out without any punitive measures or explanations.

Even after some staff were reprimanded, other staff — and even students! — tried to stage a “walk-out” so they could return, despite failing to do their duties.

My classmates are now trying to schedule a walk out for tomorrow to bring back the incompetent school employees that were put on administrative reassignment today, pending investigation. What a disgrace! These people were warned about 181958 and did NOTHING! #FixIt pic.twitter.com/NkQ2JeX58r — Kyle Kashuv (@KyleKashuv) November 27, 2018

School officials should not have to pay forever for this tragic day, but the ones responsible need to own up and take responsibility for their actions.

5. Schools Ignored Warnings about the Shooter

Just after the shooting, there were a few news reports of a few students trying to vocalize the fact that the shooter had a history of mental instability, an obsession with firearms, and had publicly voiced his deranged plans to kill his fellow classmates. These concerns were pushed aside by much of the mainstream media, which flocked to Parkland to cover the story in favor of the more convenient narrative that more gun control would have discouraged the shooter. Eventually, attention on the families and their healing became the focus and the days before the shooter were all but forgotten.

Superintendent Robert Runcie said the school district “has made no attempt to conceal information except when lawyers said it could not be released.” Following the shooting, the district’s law firm hired a contractor, the Collaborative Educational Network of Tallahassee, which did not assess security concerns, but simply analyzed whether Broward schools had satisfied the law in educating the shooter.

The Sun Sentinel obtained and published an uncensored copy of their report and found what anyone paying attention could have probably predicted: “Cruz was deeply troubled; the district improperly withdrew support he needed; he asked for additional services; and the district bungled his request, leaving him spinning without help.”

Additionally, the paper found more information, which was not included in the consultant’s report or shared by the school district, such as the following:

“I’m a bad kid. I want to kill,” Cruz ominously told a teacher in middle school.

“I would rather be on the street killing animals and setting fires,” Cruz told one teacher in October 2013 — more than four years before the rampage.

“I strongly feel that Nikolas is a danger to the students and faculty at this school,” Cruz’s eighth-grade language arts teacher wrote in a behavioral evaluation. “I do not feel that he understands the difference between his violent video games and reality.”

In just the last few weeks, journalists and the public have learned how many warning signs were in front of the eyes of the Broward County Sheriff’s Department, and the MSD High School — and just how many were ignored or hidden. If even one of these red flags had been heeded, the outcome might have been different.

The most compelling thing about all this information — other than how devastatingly tragic it is — is that none of this points to gun control as a problem or solution. If anything, law enforcement, school protocol, and government bureaucracy were strange allies in the push to avoid brave action, obfuscate the truth, and keep parents from finally discovering what happened, so they can heal. Hopefully, this information can begin to help school districts around the country avoid making the same mistakes.

President Trump’s Stealth Bump Stock Ban Is Illegal And Ignorant,"President Trump made up his mind some time ago to ban bump stocks, the woefully ineffective firearm accessory regrettably used in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. Recently, though, reports from CNN and the New York Times indicate that the Trump administration is poised to implement a ban on these devices in the coming days. There are two major issues with this: they can’t legally do it, and it’s dumb.

Still, you may remember the media storm around bump stocks last year. Deserved or not, a proposition to ban bump stocks seemed to have bipartisan support, but Congress couldn’t agree on a way to ban or regulate the devices, so the momentum petered out.

Perhaps in search of mythical bipartisanship points, Trump ordered the Department of Justice (DOJ) to craft a new administrative rule banning the devices. This might seem odd to anyone who has managed to stay awake through a single civics class or a third of an episode of “Schoolhouse Rock.” That’s because this attempt to bypass the legislature is completely out of line with the law.

Bump Stocks Are Not Machine Guns

For better or for worse, the DOJ was given the authority to regulate machine guns with the National Firearms Act of 1934 and Gun Control Act of 1968. These laws specifically define a “machine gun,” and over the last 10 years several administrations have reviewed bump stocks and repeatedly determined that they do not fall in that category.

But, when faced with an opportunity for political expediency in the wake of the Vegas shooting, President Trump basically demanded the DOJ pretend as if bump stocks—a shaped piece of plastic—somehow now fall within the legal definition of “machine gun.” This is absurd.

Imagine there were a law giving the DOJ the authority to regulate blue cars, and that for decades the DOJ agreed with the reasonable proposition that green cars were not included in the definition of “blue cars,” and thus could not regulate them. Then imagine that a tragedy involving a green car occurs, and the DOJ is suddenly of the opinion that green is actually a shade of blue.

That is exactly what is happening here. Under federal law , a “machine gun” is a device “which shoots … automatically more than one shot … by a single function of the trigger.” A bump stock, on the other hand, functions with repeated actuations of a trigger.

If the government really wants to regulate bump stocks (which they shouldn’t), they need to do it by passing a new law, not by assigning new meaning to an old one. This whole point should be moot, though, because of the fact that bump stocks are not actually uniquely dangerous compared to other guns. Hollywood and video games have convinced the American public that the faster people can fire, the more deadly they can be. Reality, though, is a bit more nuanced.

How Do Bump Stocks Actually Work?

A gun’s usable rate of fire is limited by its recoil. Unlike a truck, bomb, or knife, when a firearm is discharged, it deviates from its course and needs to be re-aimed before it can fire again effectively. A gun that fires 10,000 rounds per minute is no more useful than a regular rifle if the gun is pointing in the air after the first shot. This is why not even our military regularly uses fully automatic “machine gun” fire in standard rifles—they’re just not nearly as deadly or effective as they sound.

In reality, there is no gun that is more or less safe when misused against innocent people. The American people think it’s reasonable to ban something like a bump stock because it is “like a machine gun” only because of a fundamentally flawed conception of how firearms actually work.

We need to remember that any time we want to ban something, it comes at a tremendous cost. President Trump is wasting not only time and sidestepping the law with this proposal, he is betraying his promise to protect gun rights—with no benefit to public safety.

How Cuomo's War On Guns Turned Into A War On The Bill Of Rights,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo hasn’t been shy about making his disdain for the National Rifle Association public. During this past election, Cuomo’s campaign even sent out a mailer shouting in bold letters: “If the NRA goes bankrupt, I will remember them in my thoughts and prayers.”

But when Cuomo decided to use state regulators to threaten financial institutions that do business with gun manufacturers and gun-rights associations, he opened a new front that could have far-reaching consequences on First Amendment-protected speech.

The NRA filed a lawsuit last spring after it became known that Cuomo ordered the state’s Department of Financial Services to tell the banks, insurance companies, and other financial firms it oversees “to review any relationships they may have with the National Rifle Association and other similar organizations. Upon this review, the companies are encouraged to consider whether such ties harm their corporate reputations and jeopardize public safety.”

Despite this direct attack on First Amendment-protected freedom of association, Cuomo won reelection easily, in part because even a rebuke by the liberal American Civil Liberties Union on this issue didn’t get mainstream news outlets to investigate and report the consequences if Cuomo wins in court.

The ACLU, of course, doesn’t mind Cuomo’s attacks on gun rights, as they consider the Second Amendment a lesser right if one at all. The ACLU stepped in with a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the NRA in this case because Cuomo had gone after the First Amendment rights of associations like the NRA.

Last November a judge agreed to let the NRA’s lawsuit proceed. U.S. District Judge Thomas McAvoy of the Northern District of New York wrote: “The allegations of direct and implied threats to insurers and financial institutions because of these entities’ links with the NRA, and the allegations of resulting harm to the NRA’s operations, are sufficient to make out plausible First Amendment freedom-of-speech claims.”

Now, it’s worth noting that this entire line of attack on the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms and the First Amendment’s right to associate with whom we chose and to speak freely with others wouldn’t have even been politically possible for Cuomo if the mainstream media treated this issue with a little curiosity—honesty might be too much to hope for.

It’s also worth pointing out that if Cuomo gets away with this First Amendment infringement, these same media members might be next. It is not hard to imagine a politician deciding that, if gun owners and their associations can be silenced and harmed financially for political ends, then they are free to go after other marginalized groups that are problems for them politically. Politicians, so emboldened, have come after members of the media before.

But it isn’t even necessary to weigh the theoretical consequences of this constitutional overstep by Cuomo, as there are already real victims of Cuomo’s zealotry. Cuomo has long been after gun owners and gun makers, a manufacturing sector that still makes its goods in America. Even today, two-thirds of this industry’s products sold in America are made in America.

This isn’t some manufacturing sector that just assembles products in the USA to avoid tariffs, either. This industry cuts and pounds steel into intricate shapes right here in America. This manufacturing sector directly employs about 150,000 mostly blue-collar Americans who make products for more than 100 million Americans who now own over 300 million guns. In fact, more than 17 million of these people have concealed-carry permits for handguns—and that’s not counting the people who carry concealed in the 14 states that now don’t require permits for people to exercise their constitutional right to bear arms.

Cuomo’s impact on them hasn’t just been theoretical. The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the trade associate for firearms manufacturers (full disclosure: I’ve done some contract work for the NSSF), estimates that in 2013 some one million gun owners in New York State alone became potential felons thanks to Cuomo and other Democrats, as these people owned semiautomatic rifles or shotguns the state deemed “assault weapons.”

Only a small percentage of the residents of New York registered these firearms by a deadline. Many of these people are now living outside the law. Many local sheriffs have said they won’t enforce this law, but the threat still hangs over them.

Cuomo has shown no interest in sending his state police out to arrest and prosecute these presumably otherwise law-abiding people. Doing that wouldn’t be politically savvy. The state also might lose in court, especially on appeal, as these semiautomatic firearms are certainly in “common use” in America and, as the Supreme Court decided in Heller v. D.C. (2008), firearms in common use are protected by the Second Amendment.

All of this seems okay with Cuomo. He is following today’s liberal-progressive playbook of shunning and maligning the many Americans who own and carry guns, as it is far easier to attack and marginalize a faceless politically incorrect group than to deal with them one by one in court.

The mainstream media has given Cuomo political cover to do this. Their treatment of this issue has even emboldened Cuomo so much that he decided he could use state agencies to try to end the financial relationships of gun companies and civil-liberties groups, such as the NRA. The courts will hopefully stop Cuomo’s attack on First Amendment rights. Either way, many in the mainstream media are now complicit in direct assault on the First Amendment.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/12/18/if-cuomo-can-silence-the-speech-of-gun-owners-whos-next/,2018-12-18
Trump's New 'Bump Stock' Ban Is A Legal Abomination,"The Trump administration on Tuesday issued a sweeping new gun control regulation to ban bump stocks, which harness the recoil energy from semi-automatic rifles to increase the firearms’ rate of fire. The regulation was issued 14 months following the mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas in which 58 people were killed and hundreds more were injured. It was the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.

The shooter, who killed himself before police were able to take him into custody, added bump stocks to several of his rifles. Critics of the devices, including the Trump administration, claim that bump fire stocks illegally convert semi-automatic rifles, which are legal for civilians to possess, into fully automatic machine guns, which are not legal for civilians to possess absent explicit permission from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE). The new rule makes bump stocks illegal and turns their owners into felons if they do not destroy their bump stocks or surrender them to BATFE officials within the next 90 days.

The new rule represents the most sweeping federal gun control effort since the so-called assault weapons ban, which was passed in 1994 and expired in 2003. Even the Obama administration, which was overtly hostile to Second Amendment rights, rejected the logic of Trump’s bump stock ban.

As a matter of both law and physics, the Trump administration’s gun control rule banning bump stocks is an abomination. The Department of Justice (DOJ), which formally issued the rule, not only ignores underlying federal statutes that precisely define what constitutes a fully automatic “machine gun,” it also ignores the mechanics of how guns are fired and how bump stocks increase the rate of fire. Even worse, the faulty logic of the new gun control rule could eventually be used as a basis for a presidential administration unilaterally banning and confiscating all semi-automatic weapons.

To fully understand how lawless and uniformed the Trump administration’s new rule is, one must first understand the federal statutory definition of a “machine gun,” the process by which semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms function, and the precise means by which bump stocks increase the rate of fire of a semi-automatic weapon.

A fully automatic weapon, or “machine gun,” fires multiple rounds with a single operation of the trigger until the firearm runs out of ammunition. A semi-automatic weapon fires only one round per operation of the trigger. Both types of firearm use the recoil energy generated by the firing of a round to eject the spent shell casing, strip a new round from the magazine, place that round into the chamber so that it is ready to be fired, and reset the hammer so that it is in position to hit the firing pin and shoot another round.

In a machine gun, as long as the trigger is depressed, the hammer will keep cycling and hitting the firing pin and firing new rounds until the trigger is released or the firearm runs out of ammunition. In a semi-automatic weapon, the hammer cannot be released until the trigger is released and then operated again.

If you’re not a gun person, these differences may seem pedantic and semantic, but their importance cannot be overstated, either legally or mechanically. That’s because federal law, specifically the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934, the Gun Control Act (GCA) of 1968, and the Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA) of 1986, define and treat semi-automatic and fully automatic guns differently in significant ways. Absent explicit permission from BATFE, an invasive process that can take years, civilian possession of a machine gun manufactured after 1986 is a felony that results in significant prison time. Even the mere possession of a single distinctive part of a machine gun, such as a sear or hammer from the trigger assembly, is enough to make you a felon.

Here is the current federal statutory definition of a “machine gun”:

any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The term shall also include the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun, and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person.

The phrase “a single function of the trigger” is extremely important. As noted above, a fully automatic weapon fires multiple rounds with a single trigger operation. A semi-automatic weapon requires multiple trigger operations to fire multiple rounds.

A bump stock simply doesn’t change how a semi-automatic weapon fires; it merely increases the rate of fire by using the weapon’s recoil energy to increase the rate of single-trigger operations by the user’s finger. It is physically and mechanically impossible for an external piece of plastic with no moving parts, which is what a bump stock is, to alter the internal trigger mechanism of the actual firearm to fire multiple rounds with a single trigger operation. Bump stocks simply do not, in any universe, change the internal functions or eliminate the internal mechanical constraints that make a semi-automatic weapon incapable of fully automatic fire.

Unfortunately, neither the laws of physics nor the laws of the United States constrained the Trump DOJ from promulgating the latest rule. Notwithstanding the clear statutory definition of “machine gun” and the mechanics required for a firearm to be fully automatic, DOJ effectively declared in its new rule that up is down and hot is cold. It is essentially grabbing for itself Congress’s exclusive right to make laws. Here’s how the federal law enforcement agency defined “machine gun” in its new rule:

The term “machine gun” includes a bump-stock-type device, i.e., a device that allows a semi-automatic firearm to shoot more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger by harnessing the recoil energy of the semi-automatic firearm to which it is affixed so that the trigger resets and continues firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter.

“Clearly, bump-fire stocks were designed to allow faster rates of fire than most could attain without these devices and they were obviously designed around the current laws concerning machine guns,” federal firearms attorney and former Army Ranger sniper team leader Ryan Cleckner writes. “However, they do not make a firearm into a machine gun – that is until this new rule, at least.”

A bump stock does not allow a semi-automatic firearm to “shoot more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger.” It increases the rate at which a user’s finger pulls the trigger. DOJ’s new definition, which flies in the face of reality and outright ignores the statutory definition in law, is false. It is a lie. And it is a lie so absurd that not even the pro-gun control Obama administration was willing to countenance it.

In June 2010, BATFE’s firearms branch chief John R. Spencer noted as much when he ruled, following extensive examination, that bump stocks were entirely legal under the NFA because they did not alter the internal function of semi-automatic firearms.

“The stock has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic function when installed,” Spencer declared. “In order to use the installed device, the shooter must apply constant forward pressure with the non-shooting hand and constant rearward pressure with the shooting hand.”

“Accordingly, we find that the ‘bump-stock’ is a firearm part and is not a regulated firearm under [the] Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.”

Even though a bump stock has no moving parts, no barrel, no chamber, no trigger, no buffer tube, and no springs, the Trump administration declared it to be a firearm all by itself. And because the new DOJ rule contains no language requiring intent to be demonstrated in order to determine whether the object’s possession constitutes a felony, an individual who owns no actual guns and no ammunition but has an unopened box containing a bump stock in a closet somewhere will instantly be a felon under the new Trump rule.

The reasoning behind and the drafting of the rule is so bad that once it takes effect, an individual who owns no actual guns but is convicted of possessing an illegal bump stock would be subject to a maximum prison sentence of 10 years (18 U.S.C. 922(q)(2)(A) and 18 U.S.C. 924(a)(1)(B)), while an unauthorized individual who was convicted of bring a loaded rifle into an elementary school would be subject to maximum prison sentence of just 5 years (26 U.S.C. 5861 and 26 U.S.C. 5871).

The new bump stock ban ignores the current statutory definition of a machine gun, creates a new regulatory definition contrary to the existing statutory definition (and contrary to how the U.S. Constitution requires new laws to be passed and enacted), and falsely characterizes how bump stocks work in order to implement a nationwide gun control ban and confiscation regime.

If the government can get away with lawlessly declaring a piece of plastic to be a machine gun, then it can get away with saying your AR-15 is a machine gun, knocking in your door, confiscating your guns, and throwing you in prison.

President Donald Trump should be ashamed for allowing this to happen, acting Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker should be ashamed for signing the rule’s promulgation, and everyone at BATFE who enforces this blatantly lawless gun control power grab should be ashamed for taking part in the scam.

Having a pen and a phone is no excuse for President Donald J. Trump ignoring the U.S. Constitution and existing federal law.

Why Carrying A Gun Can Be An Act Of Love,"The wind whipped as I ran across the drill field, my blood pressure flying. I didn’t know exactly what was going on, but it was clear that something was terribly awry. While flocks of people sprinted through the drill field, I was running the wrong way, my eyes darting and scanning for my girlfriend (now wife). Police cars and ambulances swarmed a building about 100 yards to my right. Dozens of men in black ran in.

I found her. We turned and ran with the crowd. Only minutes before this I sat silently in the student center, journaling, watching small snowflakes dance their way to the ground. It was April 16, 2007––a late snow for Blacksburg, Virginia. That day, 33 people died, including the shooter.

It’s strange to count myself among those who have direct experience with these mass shootings, one of the most evil aspects of our modern life.

Constant Dread

Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Las Vegas, Orlando, Charleston, Parkland, Tree of Life Synagogue, Thousand Oaks. And on and on. We live under a constant cloud of dread of these shootings. Dread of opening up the news, only to hear of another, or even of being caught in one ourselves.

There’s no shortage of suggestions. Concerned citizens and politicians have proposed assault weapon bans, high-capacity magazine bans, bump stock bans, increased efforts to treat mental health issues, gun-free zones, more security guards, more concealed carry, and less concealed carry. Some of these efforts I agree with, others I don’t.

I’m a Christian, and I believe in the great prophecy of Isaiah––that one day all swords will be beaten into plowshares. Indeed, I long for that day. Problem is, we’re just not there yet. While the imagery of literally hammering guns into garden tools is powerful, it’s not an effective means of protecting our neighbors.

If guns aren’t going away, and if our efforts to keep guns away from the dangerous aren’t foolproof, how ought we live in the present? I think our best option is to be a responsible, well-armed citizenry. But the motivation, posture, and attitude of those who would carry a gun are unbelievably important.

The Burden We Carry When Carrying

Sometimes, I have a gun in my pocket. Some find that jarring to hear. I get that––I even find it jarring to do sometimes.

What we commonly hear about gun owners or those who carry is that they’re filled with fear, paranoia, or irrationality; obsessed with self-preservation. No doubt, this can be true. I know some gun owners I’d describe in such a way. But the fact that some carry out of fear doesn’t mean we ought tar the idea in and of itself.

I agree with Marilynne Robinson that “fear is not a Christian habit of mind.” But is it possible that carrying a gun could be not an act of fear-based, self-preserving paranoia, but in fact an act of sacrificial love for neighbor? I believe it can and should be. If we are to be effective in how we carry guns, and increase public support for carrying, then love must be our motivation, not fear, entitlement, or resentment.

When people have asked, often skeptically, about my decision to carry a gun, I assure them that the last thing I want to do is shoot anybody. It’s true, I loathe the thought. This should be true of anyone who acquires the requisite legal permits and puts that revolver in his pocket or that pistol in her holster. We should feel a weightiness, a heaviness, a burden of responsibility. And we should shutter at the idea of actually pulling that weapon on anyone.

The person who is hesitant to carry a gun, who loathes the thought of actually ever having to use it, but decides that he will take on the burden of carrying for the sake of potentially being in a position to protect his neighbor––that is the person who carries out of love. That is the type of person we should want to carry a gun. To carry with this mind of service is actually a way to follow the command to bear one another’s burdens.

It is indeed a burden to carry a gun. It requires significant thought and planning––what to carry, how to carry it, how to conceal it, where to go, where not to go. Carrying is a limit that the carrier puts upon themselves for the sake of others. If one is unwilling to take on this burden––the strain of forethought, self-restraint, and willingness to intercede if necessary, and only if necessary––then one should not carry a gun.

Protect Your Neighbors

While there are myriad good and right defensive uses of firearms, there are also the shameful incidents that we too commonly hear about. Some people overeager for confrontation unnecessarily start fights or meddle in others’ benign affairs . The community of gun owners and carriers must be the leading voices for responsibility and accountability. We must self-enforce the idea that a posture of love is necessary to carry a gun.

We who carry guns must be the first to tell the truth about these incidents , or else we’re not credible. For these terrible incidents, it’s often not so much the law that needs reforming as does the posture of those of us who carry guns.

With the right motivation and posture, one can bless her community by living life with a gun in her pocket. Violence may be stopped in its tracks. Neighbors may be protected.

If we who carry reek of fear, or fail to call out irresponsible gun use, then the public will always be skeptical of people carrying guns, and rightly so. But if we have an attitude of love and service toward others––willing to volunteer ourselves for harm’s way, for the sake of our neighbor––then we can be humble servants to our communities.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/12/20/carrying-gun-can-act-love/,2018-12-20
Duckworth’s AR-15 Screed Proves The Left Is Lying About Gun Control,"Last Thursday the Washington Post published an impassioned appeal from Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) imploring Americans to ban guns. You might think that hearing a senator from Illinois sing the praises of gun control laws to the rest of the country would border on high satire if only it weren’t so tragic a subject.

You’d probably be right, but you wouldn’t know from Duckworth’s editorial: she spends 700 words roping her audience into the agonizing realities of the problem and suggesting her detractors have been bought off. She expends zero effort to show how gun control laws are practical, effective, narrowly tailored, or apt—or that they work at all. She does not even allude to her home’s bleak but deserved reputation for gun violence even though a state-level analysis ranks Illinois as having one of the most draconian gun-control regimes in the nation.

Instead, Duckworth maligns those who disagree with her: “What I don’t understand is how some politicians can consider the National Rifle Association’s dollars more important than our kids’ lives.” This kind of accusation makes political persuasion and rational discourse impossible: bypassing every single argument, fact, narrative, and alternative course of action offered by your opponent, you make it clear that the well is poisoned. Their motive is self-interest that weighs their campaign dollars against children’s lives and finds the latter wanting.

Communicating that she considers serious arguments not worth addressing and her opponents wicked people, Duckworth makes it clear that trying to persuade her would be time wasted. A distinction recently articulated by stats maven Nate Silver comes to mind: “Some people are good at making it not worth your while to argue with them—which can be a useful skill. But I wonder how many of them operate under the delusion that they’re skilled at *persuasion*, which is a totally different and indeed somewhat opposite phenomenon.”

To be clear: Duckworth’s well poisoning can be effective at shutting up opponents and at disarming their persuasive abilities. People judge what they hear based on what they think the speaker is trying to accomplish, what they’re motivated by, and what they really want. So handing your audience that interpretive filter for everything they will ever hear from a pro-gun rights believer can taint it as disingenuous and untrustworthy. Duckworth’s kind of argument also strips her colleagues of every incentive to even participate.

Duckworth cages her language, of course, as something that applies only to “some politicians.” But of course this is disingenuous: if Duckworth’s real motive is to address the problem of children murdered by people using guns, then what’s necessary is to look at the strengths and weaknesses of the viable policy options. She chooses instead to malign proponents of the natural and constitutional right to self-defense, and considers their arguments not even worth mentioning.

But let’s consider this accusation of hers that “some politicians can consider the National Rifle Association’s dollars more important than our kids’ lives.” Perhaps Duckworth has some insight, just from being in Congress, about particular officials; if she does, she keeps silent about it and names no names. But can we analyze this accusation on the publicly known facts of the matter?

According to OpenSecrets.org, run by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, the National Rifle Association has contributed $22.6 million to political campaigns since 1990. This sounds like a lot of money until you realize it means they don’t quite break the top 100 campaign contributors. (And if we are talking about influence being sold to the highest bidder, then comparison is everything.)

For context: the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers both made the top ten, with contributions that total more than ten times what the NRA fielded. Yet there have been vanishingly few accusations that Duckworth (and the rest of the Democratic Party) might be “bought off” by public employees who, after all, are not infrequently accused of making education about “jobs for adults” rather than “learning for children.”

Here are more members of that top 100, all of whom have given more to campaigns since 1990 than the NRA did: Microsoft, Comcast, the University of California, the Walt Disney Company, Boeing, the Houston Texans, and the American Dental Association.

Duckworth also does not acknowledge the record of failure charted by Illinois, other states, and several major cities at “controlling” guns. She does not mention that government has shown it cannot enforce bans on drugs or protect lands from those with no right to be on them—all of this from a lawmaker whose party argues that because some women “would have abortions anyway” if they were illegal, then we should make them as convenient as possible.

If Duckworth’s opinion is designed to appeal to emotions while ignoring facts when discounting other options, we might expect her to give facts short shrift when she talks about the actual crisis at hand—and indeed she does. “[O]ur streets have become deadlier than war zones,” she declares, “with more Americans killed by gun violence over the past 50 years than in every war in American history combines.”

Except that “killed by gun violence” includes the ancient deception of counting suicides in that figure. Duckworth’s underlying data, from the Centers for Disease Control, report that nearly two-thirds of those “gun violence” deaths were suicides. (This is helpfully visualized, with some other analysis, on Silver’s site here.)

But Duckworth delivers this false impression of our nation’s streets like war zones then personalizes it with the imaginative line, “Imagine your own little girl or boy being forced to stare down the barrel of a semiautomatic.”

This is American political discourse at its worse: an elected official magnifying a public crisis with tortured data as an excuse to be given more power; to do so, she ignores arguments for other options and simply maligns detractors as bought-off and uncaring. All of this murky thinking and emotionally charged rhetoric is not at a campaign rally (its natural habitat) but in text written and published in a newspaper, the supposed home of rational inquiry.

All this actually betrays Democrats’ ulterior motive. As in so many other cases, Democrats have a single policy goal that they insist is the only option on the table—anyone opposing that option, they say, enjoys the problem in the first place. We see this fevered abuse of pars pro toto in the abortion argument: those in favor of the universal human right to life are said to be “against women’s health care,” no matter how long the list of components of women’s health care—Tylenol, Advil, breast cancer screenings, casts for broken bones, vaccines—that these same pro-life people favor without a second thought.

It is the same here: there is a rich conversation to be had about governmental and non-governmental ways to curb the gun violence that has historically plagued America at higher rates than elsewhere on earth. Ideas include implementing “gun violence restraining orders” that are, like the problem of gun violence, narrowly tailored; enforcing more strictly existing, already agreed upon laws like felons not being allowed to purchase firearms; allowing concealed carry on school grounds to deter and prevent future would-be mass shooters, as some Columbine survivors have proposed; talking about the statistically suggestive lack of good parenting seen in violent school shooters; arguing against the philosophical nihilism that motivates at least some such shooters.

But Democrats want one thing: to ban guns. To the extent that “we are complicit” in anything because “we keep doing nothing,” that is the reason why.

Trump’s Bump Stock Ban Adds New Chapter To BATFE’s Sordid History,"In December, at President Trump’s direction, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) issued a ruling that bump stocks “are ‘machineguns’ as defined by the National Firearms Act of 1934” (NFA). Furthermore, it declared that owners of the contraptions must destroy them or turn them over to the federal government without compensation, or be guilty of a federal felony. For now, I leave it to others to address the BATFE’s plan to deprive law-abiding Americans of lawfully acquired private property without compensation.

As Sean Davis noted, a bump stock is not a “machinegun.” The NFA defines “machinegun” to include several things, including a firearm that fires “automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger,” “any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun,” and “any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled.”

The BATFE claims that the second and, by extension, all three of these definitions apply in this instance. It says, “these devices [bump stocks] convert an otherwise semiautomatic firearm into a machinegun.”

The BATFE Knows It Is Lying

As Davis noted, in 2010 the agency said bump stocks weren’t “machineguns,” that a bump stock “performs no automatic function when installed. In order to use the installed device [the bump stock], the shooter must apply constant forward pressure with the non-shooting hand and constant rearward pressure with the shooting hand.”

Rejecting its 2010 determination, the BATFE now says that a bump stock causes a semi-automatic firearm to fire “in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter.”

In making this claim, the BATFE destroys its claim that a bump stock is a “machinegun.” Set aside for a moment the BATFE’s claim that with a bump stock attached to a firearm, the stock, not the person using the firearm, manipulates the trigger. If the trigger of a semi-automatic firearm resets between shots, the firearm does not fire “automatically,” it fires semi-automatically. “Trigger reset” and “fires automatically” are mutually exclusive.

As it applies to firearms, “automatically” means that a firearm will continue firing as long as the trigger is held down, prevented from resetting between shots, while other parts of the firearm allow the firearm to fire repeatedly. It is not a perfect analogy, but the difference between what happens with a semi-automatic firearm, whether or not it is equipped with a bump stock, and what happens with a machinegun is akin to the difference between a bicycle and a motorcycle.

With a bicycle, you have to step on the pedals repeatedly to rotate the wheels. With a motorcycle, you twist the throttle once, hold it in place, and the engine will continue sparking, pushing pistons, and so on, to rotate the wheels. With a bump stock attached, a semi-automatic firearm fires exactly like it does without the contraption, semi-automatically (i.e., with the trigger resetting between shots), not “automatically.”

Now consider the BATFE’s claim that with a bump stock attached to a firearm, the stock, not the person using the firearm, manipulates the trigger. As everyone knows, a person fires a firearm by pulling its trigger rearward. That’s why, in 2010, the agency said that when using a firearm equipped with a bump stock, the person using it must apply “rearward pressure with the shooting hand.”

The BATFE now says that with a bump stock attached, the user doesn’t pull the trigger, the stock pushes the trigger against the user’s finger. Again, this contradicts the agency’s earlier determination. However, regardless of who or what pulls or pushes the trigger, with or without a bump stock attached, the trigger moves rearward, separately, for each shot and resets after each shot, therefore the firearm fires semi-automatically, not “automatically,” and therefore it is not a “machinegun” as defined in the NFA.

Furthermore, even if a bump stock pulled or pushed a trigger, or made it do a somersault, it could not be a part “designed . . . for use in converting” a firearm into a machinegun. That’s because a part that converts a firearm into a machinegun does so not by affecting the trigger, but by altering the interaction of other parts of the firearm.

None of this is intended to defend bump stocks generally. The only two noteworthy things that can be said about them are that they were misused to commit a high-profile, multiple-victim murder and they contribute nothing to the defensive uses of firearms, defensive firearm training, hunting, marksmanship competitions, and almost all forms of recreational shooting.

But such is neither here nor there. The only thing that matters in this instance is that bump stocks do not meet any definition of “machinegun” under federal law.

Is the Ban BATFE’s Fault Or Trump’s?

Some might say the BATFE should not be blamed for its ruling. After all, President Trump ordered the agency to come up with whatever rationale it could for banning bump stocks. It appears that Trump ordered the contraptions banned after their use in a crime because his instincts are authoritarian, he isn’t particularly concerned with facts, and perhaps he listens too much to a certain liberal family member whose reaction to every unhappy turn of events around the world is “Do something.”

Trump ordered the BATFE to ban bump stocks because he didn’t want Congress to do it, or to try, because that would have put some Republicans in the position of having to vote against a ban and angering liberal and moderate voters, or voting for a ban and angering conservative voters, losing their next elections either way. Furthermore, if Trump, who previously promised to defend the Second Amendment to the hilt, signed a legislative ban into law, he would lose enough votes to forfeit his chance of winning reelection in 2020.

Regardless, BATFE should be blamed because this is only one of many times the agency has abused its power, sometimes with fatal consequences.

BATFE’s 50-Year History of Misconduct

In 1986, Congress passed a law to end BATFE misconduct related to its enforcement of the Gun Control Act of 1968. So egregious had the agency’s actions been over the previous 18 years, the name of the 1986 law tells the story: The Firearms Owners’ Protection Act.

The law should be amended so that a firearm’s usefulness for defensive purposes justifies its importation.

In 1989, at the urging of then-Drug Czar William Bennett, with the approval of President George H.W. Bush, the BATFE changed its interpretation of firearm importation law, 18 U.S.C. 925(d)(3), to ban the importation of 43 makes and models of semi-automatic rifles it had for years previously approved for importation.

The law should be amended so that a firearm’s usefulness for defensive purposes justifies its importation. But, even as written, it provides for the importation of the rifles the BATFE banned. The law states: “The Attorney General [by direction, the BATFE] shall authorize a firearm or ammunition to be imported . . . if the firearm or ammunition . . . is generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes.”

The rifles the BATFE banned are of the type used in defensive marksmanship competitions. So, to justify its re-interpretation of the law, the BATFE declared that while “organized marksmanship competitions” were “sporting purposes,” such competitions did not include those based upon defensive rifle skills, even though such competitions have governing bodies, rulebooks, sponsors, and prizes for winners, like other organized competitive sports, and they are the most popular rifle marksmanship competitions in the country.

In 1993, at the direction of President Bill Clinton, the BATFE ignored its long-standing “Handgun Factoring Criteria,” which the agency uses to ban the importation of the least expensive, smallest, lightest, lowest-caliber handguns, in order to ban the importation of particularly expensive, large, heavy, larger-caliber handguns.

‘We’re taking the law and bending it as far as we can to capture a whole new class of guns.’

In 1994, again at Clinton’s direction, the BATFE again changed its interpretation of “sporting purposes” to restrict several shotguns as “destructive devices.” In 1998, the BATFE changed its interpretation yet again, to prohibit the importation of rifles that were being manufactured to comply with its 1989 ruling. A spokesman for the Clinton White House said, “We’re taking the law and bending it as far as we can to capture a whole new class of guns.”

In 2009, the BATFE teamed with NBC-5 Chicago “fake news” reporter Kim Vatis to deceive TV viewers by talking about semi-automatics, then showing Vatis firing a machinegun, waving the gun around, spraying bullets wildly.

In 2015, presumably at the urging of President Barack Obama, the BATFE attempted to suppress the legitimate use of AR-15s by banning M855, the second most common ammunition used in the rifles, by reinterpreting another federal law, 18 USC 921(a)(17)(B) and (C). Years before, the BATFE had incorrectly declared M855 to be “armor piercing ammunition.” However, it had granted M855 the law’s exemption for ammunition “primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes.”

At a minimum, the law’s exemption should be extended to include bullets primarily intended for defensive purposes. However, in any case, in 2015 the BATFE tried to rescind M855’s exemption, falsely claiming that whether a bullet is exempt hinged not on the “sporting purposes” exemption prescribed in the law, but on whether the bullet could be used in handgun. M855 survived only because the Republican chairman of the House subcommittee that controls the BATFE’s budget read the agency the proverbial Riot Act.

BATFE Misconduct Also Gets People Killed

In 1992, in the Ruby Ridge incident, BATFE agents badgered an Idaho man into illegally shortening the barrel of a shotgun, which among other things led to FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi killing an unarmed mother who was holding a child in her arms.

The BATFE ran a gun-running operation called Fast and Furious, which funneled guns from America across the border to Mexican drug cartels.

In 1993, the BATFE provided false information to a federal judge to obtain a search warrant of a large Branch Davidian residence in Waco, Texas. As David Kopel and Dr. Paul H. Blackman noted in their report on the debacle, the BATFE, hoping to get positive publicity to compensate for adverse publicity the agency had received over sexual harassment and racial discrimination claims by BATFE personnel over the previous couple of years, allowed reporters to come along for the show when its S.W.A.T. team rolled up in a cattle trailer, jumped out, and assaulted the house.

A gun battle ensued, four BATFE agents were killed, and the rest of the agency’s assault force retreated. (A statuette inside the BATFE’s headquarters misleadingly depicts the killed agents standing in a circle, facing outward, as if they had died while defending themselves. In fact, they were killed while atop or inside the Davidians’ house.) Weeks later, the FBI attacked the house with military equipment and the house burned to the ground, killing scores of people inside.

During the Obama administration, the BATFE ran a gun-running operation called Fast and Furious, which funneled guns from America across the border to Mexican drug cartels, almost assuredly with the knowledge of then-attorney general Eric Holder. Some of the guns were used by the cartels to murder people in Mexico, and one was used to murder U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.

Some have argued that because of its repeated misconduct over the last 50 years, the BATFE should be abolished. Perhaps it should. However, the pressing issue for the moment is this: Presumably, the BATFE’s new ruling will be challenged in court. If judges allow the BATFE to ban bump stocks as machineguns, to lie about how firearms function mechanically, and to override laws passed by Congress whenever it wants, for whatever reason it wants, the historically corrupt agency will have a green light to go after semi-automatic firearms next. And that is what a Democrat successor to Trump could order the agency to do.

Two Democrat Gun Bills To Fight Like The Dickens,"As expected, within the first few days of the new Congress, Democrats announced legislation designed to eventually lead to the confiscation of firearms best suited for defensive purposes: semi-automatic rifles, such as the AR-15, and—if they can get District of Columbia v. Heller overturned, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has advocated— handguns.

Last Wednesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced her latest bill, co-sponsored by 27 other Democrat senators and Bernie Sanders, to ban new “assault weapons,” meaning mostly AR-15s and similar semi-automatic rifles. The bill would also ban ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Such magazines are designed for defensive purposes and are primarily used in semi-automatic rifles and handguns for that purpose.

Feinstein’s bill would allow existing owners to keep their firearms and magazines. However, no one should be fooled. As mayor of San Francisco, Feinstein banned handguns from that city entirely until her ban was struck down in court. Also, in 1995, talking about her first “assault weapon ban” on CBS “60 Minutes,” she said, “If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in, I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren’t there.”

Feinstein is playing the long game. She knows she doesn’t have the votes for gun confiscation now. However, on Tuesday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Democrats will resume their efforts to “expand” background checks on gun purchases and that is the first of several steps toward fundamentally transforming the background check system into a national gun registry that can be used to enforce gun confiscation, once Democrats have the votes for confiscation.

It’s Not About Crime

Even in a nation where Pollyannas believe facial recognition technology is designed to stop shoplifting, no one should be naïve enough to fall for Democrats’ pretenses that these bills are aimed at reducing crime. According to the FBI, rifles, of which AR-15s and rifles like them are a subset, are used in only two percent of murders, while roughly 30 percent of murders are committed without firearms of any type. More people are murdered with knives, more with bludgeons, and more by being beaten or kicked than with rifles of any type.

Also, studies by the Department of Justice (such as here, here, here, and here) have found that most criminals who use guns steal them, buy them on the black market, or get them with the help of a “straw purchaser,” the term for a fake buyer who passes the background check, buys the gun, and immediately hands it over to the criminal waiting in the parking lot.

There is an exception. Most mass murderers who use guns submit themselves to background checks. However, they pass them. As Northeastern University Professor James Alan Fox, the nation’s leading criminologist in the study of murder, has explained, “Most mass murderers do not have criminal records or a history of psychiatric hospitalization. They would not be disqualified from purchasing their weapons legally.”

Additionally, if Democrats cared about reducing crime, they would support President Trump’s effort to prevent violent criminals from illegally entering our country across our southern border. After all, more people are murdered by illegal aliens than by anyone using any of the firearms Feinstein, other Democrats, and Sanders are proposing to ban.

It’s About Control

Crime statistics are beside the point, however. Governments don’t infringe the right to keep and bear arms to reduce crime. They do it to maintain their power over the ruled.

In the old days, at least, they were honest about it. As David B. Kopel, of the Independence Institute, noted in The Samurai, The Mountie, And The Cowboy, the 16th-century Japanese ruler Hideyoshi decreed, “The people in the various provinces are strictly forbidden to have in their possession any swords, short swords, bows, spears, firearms, or other arms. The possession of unnecessary implements makes difficult the collection of taxes and tends to foment uprisings.”

Similarly, as George Mason University Professor Joyce Lee Malcolm has noted, “After the English Reformation [Catholics] were regarded as potential subversives, and as such were liable to have their arms impounded.” And just before the English civil wars, “Wails of despair were heard from city to city as the royal army confiscated public magazines and disarmed local residents. . . . Forewarned was forearmed, and from 1642 Englishmen learned to hide their firearms and to stockpile weapons.”

Closer to home, in 1775, English soldiers tried to confiscate colonists’ weapons in Concord not to reduce crime, but because the English had declared Massachusetts to be in rebellion. Similarly, in 1835, the war for Texas’ independence from Mexico began when the Mexican army, fearing rebellion against the dictator Santa Anna, demanded that the people of Gonzales, Texas, surrender their cannon, to which the Texians and Tejanos replied as did Spartan King Leonidas to Xerxes’ similar demand before the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C.

Trying To Ban Semi-Automatic Rifles and Handguns For 85 Years

The late Jeff Cooper, a former Marine, the founder of the Gunsite Training Academy, and the originating force behind the modern defensive handgun technique wrote in The Art of The Rifle that “a citizenry armed with rifles simply cannot be tyrannized.”

Democrats have known as much for a long time. In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the National Firearms Act (NFA) which, among other things, required the registration, with the federal government, of any “machinegun,” defined to include only fully-automatic firearms, most of which are rifles.

However, as originally envisioned, the NFA would have banned “machineguns” altogether and defined such guns as any fully-automatic or semi-automatic firearm that could fire more than 12 shots without reloading. Such a definition would have included any fully-automatic or semi-automatic firearm (rifle, pistol, or even shotgun) that could use a detachable ammunition magazine, because a firearm that can use any detachable magazine can use one of any size. The NFA would also have required the registration of handguns, presumably those not banned as “machineguns.”

Fortunately, the Department of Justice opposed a ban on the grounds that it would have violated the Second Amendment. The idea that banning fully-automatic firearms is constitutional would have to wait until 2008, when Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia would fabricate a rationale to that effect in District of Columbia v. Heller.

Also, the NFA’s definition of “machinegun” was changed to correctly exclude semi-automatics and the handgun registration requirement was dropped. Similarly, the Federal Firearms Act of 1938, also signed by FDR, would have required the registration of handguns and licensing of handgun owners, but the version passed by Congress omitted those two restrictions.

If You Can’t Register Handguns, Just Ban Them

Until a few years ago, even though it should be obvious that laws are designed to control people, not inanimate objects, disarmament activists used the term “gun control” to describe laws that infringe the right to keep and bear arms.

Hence, the massive set of restrictions President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law in 1968 was called the Gun Control Act. Johnson complained that it didn’t require the registration of all guns and the licensing of all gun owners, but in 1974 the activists, convinced that the time was ripe for even more severe infringements than Johnson had envisioned, formed two groups: the National Coalition to Ban Handguns (NCBH), the name of which indicated its goal, and the National Council to Control Handguns (NCCH).

Making clear what it meant by “control,” NCCH called for “a ban on the manufacture, sale, and importation of all handguns and handgun ammunition.” Realizing it had forgotten about people who already owned handguns, in 1976 it called for a law “to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition . . . totally illegal.” It also explained how it envisioned its goal being achieved:

The first problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns being produced and sold in this country. The second problem is to get handguns registered. And the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition . . . totally illegal.

However, disarmament activists had a rough time in the 1970s and 1980s. Congress and the states refused to ban handguns. Handgun ban referenda were defeated in California and Massachusetts. Congress repealed the Gun Control Act’s requirement that buyers of handgun ammunition sign ledgers documenting their purchases. And Florida became the 11th state to adopt a fair system for issuing handgun carry permits.

So, in 1988, a former NCBH staffer formed his own group, calling it the New Right Watch, to indicate that he was watching the “right-wingers” who had been responsible for President Ronald Reagan’s 49-state victory in 1984. He had also worked for Amnesty International, which has long been involved in international civilian disarmament efforts at the United Nations. (After the collapse of the Soviet Union, broken-hearted leftists in the West who had campaigned for nuclear disarmament by the United States, Britain, and France, but not by the communists, needed another cause, turning first to “land mines,” then to to civilian disarmament and global warming.)

If You Can’t Ban Handguns, How About Rifles?

Immediately after setting up shop, the New Right Watch proposed that disarmament activists give up on handguns for the moment and switch to a new issue. It said:

Assault weapons [will] strengthen the handgun restriction lobby for the following reasons: It will be a new topic in what has become to the press and public an ‘old’ debate. . . . Handgun restriction consistently remains a non-issue with the vast majority of legislators, the press, and public. . . . Efforts to restrict assault weapons are more likely to succeed than those to restrict handguns.” (Emphasis in the original.)

Democrats’ all-out war to ban semi-automatic rifles, calling them “assault weapons” to make them sound scary, began the following year and has since been promoted by even more fake news than has been thrown at President Trump.

Firearm Registration In The Making

The Gun Control Act requires firearm dealers to maintain records of all firearm sales, including the identity of the purchaser and the make, model, and serial number of firearms purchased. However, the government is not entitled to those records unless for purposes of a specific criminal investigation.

That presented a problem for disarmament-minded Democrats soon after California banned “assault weapons” in 1989 and New Jersey banned “assault firearms” in 1990. Both states’ laws allowed existing owners to keep their guns, if they registered them within an amnesty period. However, only two percent of California’s owners and a similar percentage of New Jersey’s complied with the registration requirements. Since the guns had not been registered to start with, the state governments could not be sure where to look for them.

It dawned on them that they might be able to incrementally morph NICS into a national gun registry.

In 1993 and 1994, the Democrat Congress imposed, and President Bill Clinton signed, the Brady bill, imposing a waiting period to “slow down” handgun purchases from dealers, and Feinstein’s “assault weapon ban,” which, fortunately, was written so incompetently that hundreds of thousands of rifles that she thought she had banned were manufactured and sold in a slightly modified form to comply with the law during the 10 years it was in effect. (Feinstein has since had someone rewrite her legislation to correct her initial deficiency.)

At first glance, the Brady bill might seem an outlier here, but it is instead central to the story. An amendment to the bill before final passage called for its waiting period to expire after five years and be replaced by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) with which we are stuck (until such time, if ever, we can get it abolished). Since 1998, a NICS check has been required on anyone who purchases any firearm from any federally licensed firearm dealer.

Disarmament activists, being slow on the up-take, initially opposed NICS, because they were fixated on the idea of a waiting period to “slow down” handgun sales. Most NICS checks are completed in a few minutes. Eventually, however, it dawned on them that they might be able to incrementally morph NICS into a national gun registry, the prerequisite the NCCH had envisioned for confiscation.

After two years of relative safety from Democrats’ disarmament agenda, the threat is back and it is serious.

Toward that end, they began proposing to extend the check requirement to people who buy firearms at gun shows, from people who are not firearm dealers. Then they proposed to extend the requirement to anyone who buys a firearm from a person who is not a dealer, regardless of where the purchase takes place.

Checks, in and of themselves, do not achieve registration, of course. So, in 2009, one of the most aggressive disarmament supporters in Congress, the late-Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), introduced legislation to allow the FBI to retain records of people who pass NICS checks. If checks were required on all purchasers, and all purchasers’ records were retained by the FBI, all that would remain for the system to become a national registry would be for the records to contain the make, model, and serial number of the firearm bought, the data currently kept by firearm dealers.

A bill like Feinstein’s and the one to “expand” background checks could easily pass the House of Representatives. Whether either would pass the Senate or be signed into law by President Trump would likely depend upon the circumstances. After two years of relative safety from Democrats’ disarmament agenda, the threat is back and it is more serious than it has been in a very long time.

Anti-Gunner's 'MeatEater' Purchase Poses Problems For Hunt-Focused Biz,"MeatEater, a popular hunter-focused entertainment company started by outdoorsman and writer Steven Rinella, was purchased by a rabidly anti-gun Democrat financier late last year in a move that has raised alarms among hunters and gun-rights activists. The Chernin Group, a California-based investment fund run by wealthy Democratic activist and Hollywood producer Peter Chernin, purchased a controlling stake in Rinella’s MeatEater in 2018.

The left-wing, anti-gun political activism of MeatEater’s largest investor, as well as political commentary and activity from some of its key partners and sponsors, complicates the company’s expansion plans given that such a large percentage of hunters in the United States — who comprise MeatEater’s core audience — staunchly support both gun rights and Republican political candidates. Chernin’s company announced the investment in MeatEater and its hiring of a new CEO for the company via a press release last October.

Chernin, who has donated nearly $500,000 to Democratic candidates and causes since 2015, has repeatedly attacked gun rights and Second Amendment activists over the last year. He retweeted comedian Michael Ian Black’s attack on the National Rifle Association as a “terrorist organization” and a separate Hollywood personality’s attempt to force FedEx and Visa to sever their ties with the NRA.

In addition to endorsing calls for a ban on so-called “trophy hunting,” Chernin also signed a petition backed by a Michael Bloomberg-funded gun control group demanding a federal ban on semi-automatic weapons.

MeatEater’s ties to left-wing causes and candidates don’t end with Chernin, however. Ben O’Brien, a former marketing manager for YETI Coolers who now serves as the editorial director for MeatEater, was behind YETI’s controversial elimination of discounts for NRA members, a move that blew up in the company’s face. Following YETI’s announcement, NRA members videotaped themselves filling the pricey coolers with explosives and blowing them up, shooting them to pieces, and crushing them in vises. O’Brien responded on his Instagram page by attacking the NRA, where he used to work as a web editor, characterizing the gun-rights organization as bullies.

O’Brien also all but endorsed Democratic Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) via the MeatEater podcast during the heat of the 2018 campaign. Tester defeated Republican challenger Matt Rosendale by just 18,000 votes.

“I found him to be credible and believable,” O’Brien said during the podcast. “I found Senator Tester to be credible, and to be pragmatic, and a straightforward dude.”

Matt Rosendale, the Republican candidate, was never featured on the podcast.

In his write-up of the controversial Tester podcast, O’Brien didn’t do himself any favors. After stating that “We like our guns,” O’Brien wrote that it was a “problem” that the NRA supports Republicans.

“The biggest problem here is that the NRA supports a large number of Republican congressmen and these folks can sometimes be predisposed to political stances that go against federal control of public lands, not to mention sound management of wildlife populations and their habitats,” he wrote.

O’Brien then shifted to a defense of pro-gun control Democrats who had received failing grades from the NRA.

“For those who received poor grades from the NRA, the gun control stances are nuanced,” he claimed.

Rinella was hit with a barrage of criticism about the interview on his Facebook page after he announced the podcast.

“So if you’re gonna have the Democrat, you’ll surely have the republican right?” one commenter asked. “Since you’re so unpartisan and all. Doubtful. Very sad to see you get in bed with people who are fundamentally against your beliefs.”

“I’m tired of all this crap,” another wrote. “I’ll be glad when this election is over. Steven Rinella… can we stick to the meat and leave the taters out of it?”

“All I see this as a publicity stunt,” wrote another. “Show me a hunt you all did together in a nonelection year.”

Chernin, whose fund now owns a controlling stake in MeatEater, donated $5,400 toward Tester’s re-election last year. On his Instagram page, O’Brien lashed out at those who criticized his handling of the Tester interview.

“[I]t seems that a number of folks didn’t think at all before commenting or attempt to read anything,” he wrote.

His detractors, however, may have had a point, given O’Brien’s close connections to long-time Tester political operatives. That’s because O’Brien also serves on the board of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers (BHA), a non-profit run by Land Tawney, a Montana Democratic operative and former Obama presidential campaign surrogate. In 2012, Tawney ran the Montana Hunters and Anglers PAC, which spent seven figures to defeat Tester’s Republican challenger at the time.

According to Federal Election Commission Records, 100 percent of the expenditures from Tawney’s PAC–nearly $1.2 million–were used to oppose Republican Rep. Denny Rehberg, Tester’s opponent. The BHA chairman, Ryan Busse, served as a formal Tester campaign surrogate during the Democratic incumbent’s 2018 re-election campaign. Critics of BHA derisively refer to it as a “green decoy,” an organization that presents as pro-hunter but actually exists to push conventional left-wing environmental policies.

“Backcountry Hunters and Anglers (BHA) represents itself as good-ole-boy outdoorsmen who simply want to hunt and fish and be left alone,” the Environmental Policy Alliance (EPA) writes on the website GreenDecoys.com. “But don’t be fooled. As evidenced by both its sources of funding and current leadership, BHA is nothing more than a big green activist organization pushing a radical environmentalist agenda.”

O’Brien’s BHA “claims to represent hunters,” a video from EPA states, “but gets most of its money from three liberal foundations and even supports massive federal land grabs.”

In contrast with Chernin and O’Brien, Rinella comes across as relatively apolitical and singularly focused on his passion for hunting. With a natural gift for explaining the history and importance of hunting and an infectious love of the outdoors, Rinella has tapped into a large and devoted niche of followers eager for content that celebrates their hobbies.

Whereas personalities like rock guitarist and outspoken hunter Ted Nugent often made hunters seem like blood-thirsty savages, Rinella has worked to soften the public perception of the activity, mixing it with a reverence for nature, a desire to protect the habitats of his prey, and a deep respect for the animals he harvests to feed himself and his family. The result has been a product that attracts both lifelong hunters from the sticks and urban hipsters.

“New and emerging hunters make up a big segment of our viewership,” Rinella told the Star Tribune last July. “The food aspect of the show speaks to them in a big way.”

A journalist by training, Rinella in 2008 published his first book, “American Buffalo: In Search Of A Lost Icon,” to much critical acclaim (it won the Sigurd F. Olson Nature Writing Award) and followed that up with several successful books on hunting and cooking. By 2011 he had his own show on the Travel Channel. In 2015, he launched the “MeatEater” podcast in what would eventually become the foundation of his most audacious and successful venture yet. He now has his own show on Netflix and a lifestyle and entertainment start-up flush with cash from a major Hollywood producer and investor.

While Rinella has generally avoided politics, he appears aware of the danger of going off the reservation regarding gun control while depending on Second Amendment enthusiasts for an audience. In a 2007 column for Salon.com, Rinella tackled the subject of Jim Zumbo, a once-beloved gun writer whose career was undone when he wrote on his blog that AR-15s, the most popular rifle platform in America, were “‘terrorist’ rifles.”

The response to Zumbo’s comments was devastating. In an instant, Zumbo lost his sponsorships with major gun manufacturers, his hunting show on the Outdoor Channel, and his audience of once-loyal fans. Despite profuse apologies, Zumbo was undone by the incident.

“It’s hard to overstate the gun-owning community’s backlash over Zumbo’s remarks,” Rinella wrote at the time. “Armed with blogs of their own, firearms advocates labeled Zumbo a traitor and generated rapid-fire e-mail campaigns that poured thousands of complaints into the inboxes of Zumbo’s associates and sponsors, ranging from High Mountain Jerky, a Wyoming mom-and-pop producer of specialty wild-game curing spices, to the firearms giant Remington Arms Co.”

But Rinella started tip-toeing toward the gun control danger zone in a 2011 interview with NPR, in which he refused to say whether he opposed a federal ban on so-called assault weapons. Instead, he told the host that not only does he not hunt with an AR-15, he doesn’t hunt with anyone who uses an AR-15. When pressed further, Rinella volunteered to the host that his own brother “just made a radical departure” from his ostensibly pro-Second Amendment views on the issue of a federal ban on semi-automatic rifles and was “rethinking this whole issue” in light of recent mass shootings.

In an e-mail back and forth with The Federalist, Rinella firmly stated that he has never supported any weapons bans.

“I support the Second Amendment and have never supported or endorsed any bans on classifications of weapons,” Rinella wrote while out on a hunt for Coues deer in Sonora, Mexico, that will be showcased on a future episode of his Netflix show. As to not hunting with AR-15s or other popular semi-automatic rifle platforms, Rinella told The Federalist that it was purely a matter of personal preference, rather than political principle.

“I personally don’t use them, as I prefer bolt-action rifles and probably always will,” he wrote, echoing his 2011 comments to NPR that his “definition of a hunting rifle is fixed on a specific image” of the old-fashioned yet reliable bolt-action rifle.

He also told The Federalist that Kevin Sloan, the former Sitka Gear president whose appointment as CEO of MeatEater was announced concurrently with news of Chernin Group’s purchase of a controlling stake in the company, both owns and hunts with AR-15s. In his conversation with The Federalist, Rinella also rejected calls for global bans on so-called “trophy hunting,” noting such bans would be “catastrophic to funding structures that are necessary for wildlife management and recovery.”

Rinella forcefully pushed back against suggestions that he would allow Chernin to hijack MeatEater in order to push his left-wing, anti-gun political agenda.

“While I may disagree with some of Mr. Chernin’s personal views on policy issues, the idea that he would try to exert influence on the content of MeatEater, Inc. strikes me as preposterous,” Rinella told The Federalist. “Any review of his track record would back me up.”

“By design, all our content is publicly available,” Rinella wrote. “There’s no need for anyone to wonder what we think or what we’re doing. It’s right there, in plain sight.”

As MeatEater expands — it now has primary content contributors plus Rinella — Rinella’s big challenge will not be in maintaining his own brand, which is well-established, but in building that of his new company and its slate of personalities in a way that speaks to both long-time and not-yet hunters without alienating the pro-AR-15, pro-Second Amendment base that forms the critical mass of his audience.

Building a successful business that bridges those cultural and political divides is a tougher undertaking than cultivating a personal brand, especially if new personalities decide their pet political issues are a bigger priority than the company’s standing among its listeners and viewers. How Rinella navigates that path, and whether he can avoid the political minefields surrounding it, may be the determining factor in MeatEater going the way of Jim Zumbo or establishing itself as the go-to place for everything hunting.

Assuming past is prologue, it would be foolish to bet against Rinella and MeatEater. If there’s anything he excels at as an avid hunter and outdoorsman, it’s looking downrange, keeping his sights on target, and reaping the harvest.

"At SHOT Show, Mike Rowe Shares Lessons Learned From Gun Owners","LAS VEGAS, NEVADA–Using lessons he learned from his time hosting the show “Dirty Jobs,” popular TV personality Mike Rowe promoted common sense and personal responsibility at SHOT Show 2019, the nation’s largest annual gun industry convention. Organized by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), SHOT Show attracts upwards of 60,000 people each year.

Rowe, who made a name for himself showcasing the work ethic of blue collar workers on the show “Dirty Jobs,” told the audience of three major lessons he learned from people he met on the show–lessons that all came from people who owned guns.

“So much of what matters most to me came from people who own firearms,” Rowe said.

The first lesson he noted, which he learned from a Nevada pig farmer who hunted to feed himself and used leftover Vegas casino buffet food to feed the pigs that he in turn used to feed the city, was that brown–not green– was the real color of conservation and planetary health, and the money needed to maintain it.

“Brown before green,” Rowe said. It is the dirt, the muck, the ground-up brown slop, that produces the greenery that denotes planetary health.

“Brown is best,” the pig farmer told Rowe. “Brown is fundamental. Green is symptomatic.”

This pig farmer, despite the fact that he was cleaning up the excesses of the city to feed the city, came under attack from various government agencies–the “army of angry acronyms” Rowe called them–at the urging of neighbors who didn’t like living near a pig farm that was there decades before they were.

Rowe’s message was that you don’t have to march with Al Gore or fly on fancy jets with Leonardo DiCaprio to be a conservationist. To be green, sometimes you have to be brown.

His next lesson, gleaned from crab boat captains he met as a narrator for the show “Deadliest Catch,” was a riff on moral hazard, a term economists use to describe how insurance increases the likelihood of the risky behavior it’s attempting to mitigate.

Rowe told the story of his one stint on a crab boat, in the middle of a raging, freezing storm capable of wiping out the boat and its entire crew. When he told the captain that maybe they should turn back, because safety comes first, the captain scoffed at him.

“Safety first? I’m the captain of a crab boat,” the captain, also a gun owner, told him. “My job is not to get you home safe. My job is to get you home rich.”

“If you want to get home safe, that’s on you,” the captain said.

His point? That when your safety becomes the priority of other people, it ceases to be your own responsibility, and the result is almost always less safety.

“Personal responsibility is your best defense against a potential calamity,” Rowe noted to a room full of gun owners who regularly exercise their Second Amendment rights to carry firearms for personal defense, a lesson they all knew instinctively.

His final lesson, learned from sheep farmers, was that sometimes experts don’t really know what they’re talking about. He learned this by watching sheep farmers castrate young lambs, but not in the way counseled by so-called animal humane experts.

When Rowe watched them castrate the animals using the method recommended by so-called experts, it was barbaric, as it caused several days’ worth of horrific pain for the animals. The preferred method of the farmers on his show, although revolting in appearance, was over in an instant and saved the animals from the lengthy pain of the method demanded by the experts.

“Be wary of experts,” he told the group. “Don’t dismiss them out of hand, but don’t always assume they know what they’re talking about.”

“A pig farmer might know more than an MBA. A farmer might know more about being kind to animals than a self-appointed expert.”

In recent years, Rowe has devoted significant time and attention to his non-profit mikeroweWORKS Foundation, which focuses on restoring appreciation for skilled trades and those who practice them. The centerpiece of mikeroweWORKS is its Work Ethic Scholarship Program, a scholarship that rewards tradesmen and tradeswomen who “demonstrate strong work ethic, a positive attitude, and personal responsibility,” according to the organization’s website.

Rowe is no stranger to gun rights battles, a topic near and dear to the hearts of those in the firearms industry. In 2016, he generated headlines when he nearly shot out of the sky a drone that was filming his home.

“Even though I didn’t pull the trigger and shoot the drone out of the sky…it was a great feeling to have the Mossberg 500 in my hands and looking up at a kind of intruder,” he told the Washington Times. “And I’m not comfortable giving that away.”

“[T]he NRA is not the reason that so many criminals and lunatics are able to buy guns today,” he wrote in a separate Facebook post.

As opposed to the annual National Rifle Association (NRA) convention, which attracts rank-and-file gun rights enthusiasts, SHOT Show is geared exclusively toward the gun industry rather than consumers. The centerpiece of SHOT Show is its massive 4-day manufacturer expo, which takes up the entirety of the massive Sands Expo Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. The exhibitors spend days, if not weeks, setting up mobile sales floors in the convention hall to showcase their latest and greatest products to eager retail buyers and outfitters within the industry.

From guns, to scopes, to ammunition, to clothing, to metal coatings, to room-sized CNC machines, the entire supply chain of the firearms industry is represented at SHOT Show.

Rowe used the opportunity in front of a roomful of entrepreneurs, engineers, and machinists to extol the virtues of working and building with your hands, instead of pushing paper or spending all day in front of a screen.

“The country has a skills gap,” he said. “We have seven million jobs available that can’t be filled because people in this country no longer have the skills to do them.”

“We have lent over $1.5 trillion to kids who can’t pay it back so they can spend four years trying to get jobs that don’t exist.”

He concluded his remarks by thanking the NSSF members in attendance for all their work, which is on display through the end of the week.

“You guys are awesome,” he said. “Thank you for what you’re doing.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/22/shot-show-2019-mike-rowe-shares-three-life-lessons-learned-gun-owners/,2019-01-22
African-Americans Have a Long History Of Championing Gun Rights,"“Today, the men and women of the NRA honor the profound life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,” the gun-rights group National Rifle Association tweeted on Martin Luther King Day. “King applied for a concealed carry permit in a ‘may issue’ state and was denied. We will never stop fighting for every law-abiding citizen’s right to self-defense.”

The tweet triggered widespread anger and condemnation from liberals, most of them pointing out that King was murdered by a gun. Just as guns themselves are not evil, they are not a panacea. Yet, whether intentional or not, strict gun control laws are often functionally racist. They deny the most vulnerable citizens in our communities, people who reside in urban liberal areas — in cities like Chicago and DC — the right to defend themselves, their families, and their property from criminality.

King, who remained the target of unceasing violent threats throughout his life, often relied on armed guards to protect his home and family. While King left no detailed position on the Second Amendment, he did indeed apply for a concealed carry permit after his house had been firebombed in 1956. Almost surely because of the color of his skin, Alabama law enforcement denied his application as “unsuitable.”

King’s inability to arm himself was merely another episode in a long history of attacks on the rights of African Americans. While early Americans often denied both Catholics and other intolerable Christian denominations their right to self-defense, black Americans were deprived of these rights for centuries longer. Many African-Americans are denied those rights today.

The early Americans had seen the right to bear arms as a means to counteract internal tyranny and the threat of invasion. African Americans understood those threats better than most. It was the abolitionist and champion of individual rights Frederick Douglass who reacted to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, authorizing local governments to seize and return escaped slaves to their owners, by editorializing that the best remedy might be “a good revolver, a steady hand, and a determination to shoot down any man attempting to kidnap … Every slave hunter who meets a bloody death in this infernal business is an argument in favor of the manhood of our race.”

By the first post–Civil War election in 1868, some southern blacks had begun to arm themselves. In one incident in Tennessee, by brandishing his gun a black man fought off a mob of terrorizing Klansmen who dragged him from his house. “I prevented [one of them] by my pistol, which I cocked, and he jumped back,” the man explained. “I told them I would hurt them if they got away. They did not burn nor steal anything, nor hurt me.”

This event was the exception for a population that was often left helpless. “Black Codes” would soon be instituted, making the ownership of guns illegal for most blacks, leaving them at mercy of their racist neighbors and governments. This is why Jacob Howard, the Michigan senator who introduced the Fourteenth Amendment to ensure that blacks in the South had their constitutional rights protected, noted that the amendment was meant to ensure “the personal rights guaranteed and secured by the first eight amendment to the Constitution” as in the freedom of speech and of the press and “the right to bear arms,” specifically.

Although some of the Founders never intended for the Second Amendment to protect all men, civil rights activists made the argument that those natural rights should extend to everyone. The late nineteenth-century civil rights leader Ida B. Wells noted that one of the lessons of post–Civil War America and “which every Afro American should ponder well,” is that “a Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black home, and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give.” T. Thomas Fortune, another black civil rights activist of the era, argued that it was with a Winchester that the black man could “defend his home and children and wife.”

In contemporary times, African Americans helped codify the Second Amendment as an individual right. Although many people are familiar with the name Dick Heller, one of the first plaintiffs of the case that evolved into 2008’s District of Columbia v. Heller decision that codified the Second Amendment as an individual right, an African-American single woman and Washington D.C. resident named Shelly Parker was one of the first plaintiffs to sign onto the case.

Fed up with the crime near her Capitol Hill home, Parker attempted to clean up the neighborhood, provoking the ire of local drug dealers, who began vandalizing her property and threatening her life. In Washington, DC, however, if Parker obtained a gun to protect herself, she would be arrested. “In the event that someone does get in my home,” she explained, “I would have no defense, except maybe throw my paper towels at them.”

It was Otis McDonald, a 76-year-old African-American retired maintenance engineer, whose name is on landmark Supreme Court McDonald v. City of Chicago decision, which compelled that city to allow citizens to have firearms in their homes for self-defense.

This isn’t merely about bump stocks or other ancillary gun questions. Many major cities effectively ignore the Second Amendment victories of Heller and McDonald. Today numerous new gun regulations that inhibit the right of citizens in high-crime areas to defend themselves are being contemplated and voted on by politicians in cities and states across the country. Whether they find the idea of citizens defending themselves “unsuitable” or not, we do not know. What we do know is that those who most need their constitutional right to bear arms are the ones who suffer.

House Dems Block Shooting Survivor From Testifying On Gun Control,"Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee refused to allow Rep. Steve Scalise, a target and victim of gun violence, to give testimony in Wednesday’s hearing on gun control. Scalise nearly lost his life in the congressional baseball practice shooting less than two years ago.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said the “Hearing on Preventing Gun Violence in America” planned to “hear from a broad array of witnesses, representing diverse perspectives on the issue of gun violence.” But when the ranking Republican Rep. Doug Collins asked if Scalise could give his testimony in the hearing, Democrats said no.

Nadler said majority members denied Scalise’s testimony because they had too many members who wanted to testify.

“The uniqueness of Mr. Scalise’s testimony, being denied this voice is a tragic for all who attend…and just because he probably disagrees with the majority should not have been a reason to keep him out,” Collins responded.

In his opening statement, Nadler said other witnesses in the hearing would, “Educate us on the scope of the problem, and they will inform our consideration of various legislative options, so that we may—at last—take real action to address this crisis.”

Despite being nearly fatally wounded and undergoing the trauma of gun violence himself, Scalise is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment.

“It was people with guns who saved my life and so many others that morning in June 2017,” Scalise told Fox News. “[Democrats’] answer to gun violence is to limit the rights of law-abiding citizens. Frankly, they ought to be focusing on punishing the criminals.”

In full testimony Scalise planned to give, which you can read here, he explains how the legislation Democrats are considering would not have prevented his shooting or any number of recent mass shootings.

“H.R. 8 would not deter a criminal from engaging in criminal activity, and it won’t decrease gun crime,” Scalise wrote. “Instead, it only succeeds in limiting the ways that law-abiding citizens could exercise their Second Amendment rights.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/07/house-democrats-block-mass-shooting-survivor-steve-scalise-from-testifying-at-gun-control-hearing/,2019-02-07
Real Goal Of Connecticut's Proposed Ammo Tax Is Less Gun Ownership,"The latest Democratic lurch to the left combines two of their greatest dreams: raising taxes and punishing gun owners. Connecticut Democrats want to impose a punitive 50 percent tax on ammunition sales.

This proposed law will not keep criminals from obtaining ammunition. What it will do is penalize gun owners who engage in sport shooting, or who practice with their firearms. But shooting, whether in simple target practice or as part of more intensive training, is an important part of being a responsible gun owner. Taxing ammunition will only make gun owners poorer and less prepared, without preventing a single crime

Jillian Gilchrest, one of the sponsors of the Connecticut law, asked, “I’m hearing pushback about the need to protect one’s home…but how much ammunition does someone really need to do that?” The answer, of course, is however much ammunition is needed to achieve and maintain shooting proficiency. That Gilchrest’s legislation includes exemptions for military and law enforcement reveals that she is, at some level, aware of this need for training.

The Realities of Gun Ownership and Shooting Practice

Becoming and remaining proficient with a firearm requires regular practice, and that uses a lot of ammunition. I shoot through at least one 50-round box in a quick trip to the range, and may expend hundreds of rounds during an afternoon shooting with friends. Competitive shooters can use much more.

This is why many gun owners stockpile ammunition and buy it in bulk. If I see a good deal on 10mm practice ammo, I will stock up and save, rather than buying one box each time I take my Glock 20 to the range. Responsible gun ownership requires training with your gun, but Democrats want to make it much more expensive and onerous.

Making effective self-defense harder will not reduce crime. Rather, the right to self-defense is one of the best anti-crime measures available, and violent crime plummeted as gun rights were expanded nationwide.

But Democrats have not abandoned their gun control goals, and Connecticut’s latest folly is not an isolated case. Seattle has already imposed extra taxes on firearms and ammunition. And there are many other ways left-wing locales make life harder for gun owners. Chicago spent years trying to regulate shooting ranges out of existence, for example.

The Supreme Court is currently considering the constitutionality of a New York City law that prohibits lawful gun owners from “transporting that gun (even in a locked container, separate from its ammunition) anywhere except for one of the seven shooting ranges within the city.” There is no point to this existing law, except to make it more difficult for people to exercise their Second Amendment rights.

Making Life Harder For Law-Abiding Citizens

This harassment of gun owners exemplifies much of the gun control agenda, which is about making life difficult for the law-abiding, rather than preventing and punishing crime. Presumably this nastiness is satisfying for the many Democrats who despise any guns not in the hands of government agents.

However, there is an agenda beyond harassment. Intelligent gun control advocates know that most of the measures they are pushing would do little or nothing to reduce gun crimes. Restricting magazine capacity or banning so-called assault rifles is pointless if the goal of doing so is to “end gun violence,” but they are useful tactics as part of a larger campaign, especially when paired with the sort of harassing laws proposed in Connecticut.

Combining progressively tighter restrictions on firearms with a multitude of laws complicating the right to keep and bear arms makes for a potent incremental strategy of discouraging gun ownership. The rights guaranteed in the Second Amendment are legally undermined and their exercise is discouraged by a bevy of burdensome regulations.

Because the Supreme Court will not let them ban guns entirely, Democrats are imposing costs and legal risks on gun ownership in order to make it too difficult for many to own a gun. The right to keep and bear arms is vitiated if only the rich, the connected, or the exceptionally determined can navigate through a thicket of expenses and regulations to exercise it.

Imposing Undue Burdens

Democrats intend this hassle. The leaders of a political party that shrieks over every restriction on invented constitutional rights are well aware of when they are imposing undue burdens on rights that are listed in the Constitution. Many of them just do not care to abide by the Constitution, which they consider an outdated relic to be twisted or discarded as they see fit. They consider the Second Amendment an embarrassing artifact, rather than an authoritative restraint on their power.

Their end goal is to severely restrict (or even prohibit) private gun ownership, and to enforce this through confiscation. And they have become bolder in saying so. Before he became infamous for supporting infanticide and wearing blackface, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, was pushing for a ban on nearly all semi-automatic firearms, with no exemption for those already legally owned. Rep. Eric Swalwell of California has even suggested that the government might nuke citizens for resisting gun confiscation.

This extremism illuminates why gun control proposals are rarely targeted at reducing violent crime, but instead seek to punish law-abiding citizens and pave the way for draconian restrictions of Second Amendment rights. The proposed Connecticut law is a classic example of this; it has no legitimate crime-fighting goals, but only burdens responsible gun owners.

It is a foundational dictum of American law that the power to tax is the power to destroy. That is the point of the Democrats’ plans to tax arms and ammunition.

Liam Neeson Loves Heroes With Guns In Movies But Not In Real Life,"Over the weekend, “Cold Pursuit” starring Liam Neeson was released. It’s a crime thriller set at a tourist destination in the Rocky Mountains. Based on a Norwegian film (“In Order Of Disappearance”), Neeson plays a snowplow driver whose son is killed by a drug cartel. The tragedy sends his character on a violent revenge spree familiar to fans.

This fall, Robert Redford starred in the Oscar-bait film “The Old Man and The Gun,” a title Neeson could apply to describe his latter career stage. Well into his 60s, the actor has become bankable as a lead in gun-laden action thrillers.

“Cold Pursuit” differs from recent Neeson efforts in that this one is focused on a middle-aged man using guns in the snow. This is a departure from his “Taken” series, a trilogy of films about a middle-aged man using guns across Europe. It is also distanced from “Run All Night” (middle-aged hit man with a gun) and “A Walk Among The Tombstones” (middle-aged private detective with a gun) and is unlike “Commuter” (middle-aged man with a gun on a train) and “Non-Stop” (middle-aged man with a gun on a plane), and nothing at all like “Unknown” (middle aged man with amnesia…and a gun).

“Cold Pursuit” is something of a satire, in many ways spoofing the very films Neeson has attached himself to in recent years. Since his hit “Taken,” the actor has churned out almost a dozen titles built upon a similar framework. Those center on a more than capable older character who is always more than comfortable employing firearms to dispense his form of justice.

Caliber-ating Who Is Permitted Guns

Ahead of the release of “Cold Pursuit,” Liam Neeson created stomach issues for producers when during an interview he made some racially charged comments that sent social media abuzz. Amazingly, this is not the first time the actor said things that make you question his character. Liam is not so adroit at sidestepping controversial landmines during interviews.

In the autumn of 2014, Neeson was on the press tour for “A Walk Among The Tombstones” when he made some rather daft comments. “I am totally for gun control in the U.S.,” he said to The Independent. This is a rather curious position to take, considering the millions he was pocketing for brandishing weapons on screen. But he proved he was not a deep thinker on the subject. “Every day we’re seeing some kid running rampant in a school,” the actor reported. Every day, that is happening. School shootings are a daily occurrence in America, says the Irish-born thespian.

If one wants to question the wisdom behind an actor demonizing guns while promoting a gun-intensive action film, it’s valid to do so. Unable to see this rampant contradiction in his comments, Neeson repeated this folly the next year, again while promoting one of his gun-porn ventures. While stumping for “Taken 3” Liam repeated his gun stance, but in an even more obtuse fashion.

“There’s too many [expletive] guns out there. Especially in America. I think the population is like, 320 million? There’s over 300 million guns. Privately owned, in America. I think it’s a [expletive] disgrace.” He made these comments in response to the Charlie Hebdo attacks that had just taken place. Neeson looks at a tragedy that played out in Paris, and he targeted the United States as a result?

Deconstructing his outrage further, he was referencing the acts of Islamic terrorists. Neeson wants to attack the wisdom of our Second Amendment, but justifies his stance by citing the actions of a group that wants to eliminate that very Constitution. The intellectual blindspot required to miss that detail becomes a full optical eclipse when you consider our right to defend ourselves protects us from that very mindset.

This is too deep of a concept for the action star. Just swallow his lecture on why guns are bad, while he implores you to attend a screening of his energetically pro-gun movie.

Only Those Who Despise Guns May Use Guns?

We saw a similar obliviousness last fall with the release of the rebooted horror classic “Halloween,” starring Jamie Lee Curtis. The actress has been outspoken about her opposition to our nation’s gun rights. She has every right to express that position. But to then star in a film where her character fends off evil forces by using guns to protect herself and others seems a bit more than a departure.

This idea that you and I should surrender our rights to use a gun in a sensible and legal manner, while these millionaire luminaries get to use guns in a sensible and legal manner, is undiluted elitism. See, they understand the vile nature of guns, so when they use them for personal gain it is perfectly understandable.

In a classic case of “biting the hand,” Neeson’s comments were not without backlash. After his ill-thought-out comments on the “Taken 3” press tour, one gun manufacturer took a stand. Para USA provided the weapons to the set of the movie, but following Liam’s anti-Second Amendment comments, the company pulled its endorsement (and all future work). The company released an official statement:

We will no longer provide firearms for use in films starring Liam Neeson and ask that our friends and partners in Hollywood refrain from associating our brand and products with his projects. Further, we encourage our partners and friends in the firearms industry to do the same.

These activist celebrities always fail to see that the biggest arguments against our weapons are the very same concepts their industry — and careers — relies upon. Look at how the National Rifle Association (NRA) is commonly demonized: According to detractors, they fetishize guns, promote guns for a profit, and rely on a culture of violence to sell their product. Now, replace “NRA” in those phrases with “Hollywood.” There is zero change in accuracy or impact.

Neeson has been confronted with his problematic contradiction. After saying things, such as “Everybody says it’s in the Constitution. I think the Founding Fathers would be turning in their graves,” once he’s challenged on the fact that he uses guns in his movies, his commentary becomes shaky. “You can slap me in the face with that and say I’m a liar. My defense is that it’s very much cartoon violence. That’s what I see it as.”

Except he sees it incorrectly. The overwhelming majority of gun owners will tell you they desire to keep their right to protect themselves, their families, and property from the incursion of illegal and violent entities. That is the exact same base concept for Neeson’s movies. He is using his weapon to combat evil. Gun owners want only the same, but for some reason they are in the wrong suddenly.

Gun Owners Want The Same Awesome Protection

In their minds, celebrity activists understand things the rest of us do not, and this self-described revelatory condition permits them to use guns for personal gain. Somehow this lets them elude the obvious contradiction, and responsibility. It is perfectly fine for them to promote gun use, and to profit immensely from the use of guns. It is perfectly wrong for any of us to buy into the very same message they are selling, however.

This summer, Neeson stars in “Men In Black International,” in which he will not be seen using a firearm on screen. His character will be able to combat other-worldly entities because he will have access to a reverberating carbonizer, with mutate capacity.

For once, his weapon will in fact be cartoonish, and not at all like real life. And for once he will not be appearing on a promotional poster with a gun prominently displayed in his gun-hating hands.

Mass Shooting In Aurora Shows Why Gun Control Doesn’t Work,"Last week, when an Illinois man killed five of his co-workers and injured several police officers, he did so with an illegal firearm. The shooter purchased the gun after lying on his background check about a past felony for aggravated assault. Like many other mass shootings, the criminal was able to carry out an act of violence not because of a lack of gun laws, but because of a bureaucratic failure to enforce the existing ones.

The Aurora shooter answered “No” to the question, “Have you ever been convicted of a felony?” He was then approved for his Firearm Owner’s Identification Card (FOID), which is required before purchasing a firearm or ammunition in Illinois. He then passed another background check before purchasing the .40-caliber Smith & Wesson he used on his killing rampage last week in Aurora. Both background checks failed to flag his felony conviction and prison sentence from the mid-1990s in Mississippi. Police reports say he hit a former girlfriend with a baseball bat and stabbed her with a knife.

It wasn’t until Gary Martin later applied for a concealed carry permit that his felony was flagged and his FOID card revoked. He was sent a letter with orders to surrender his firearm but never did so, and it’s unclear if any police agency ever followed up. The Illinois State Police has yet to explain how their database missed his past convictions, or whether any measures were taken to seize his firearm after his FOID card was revoked. The Chicago Tribune reports there is no record of law enforcement asking the court for permission to search for Martin’s gun.

In a statement on Monday, Aurora police Chief Kristen Ziman said a criminal background check would not necessarily detect a 20-year-old conviction. But The Chicago Tribune and news outlets were easily able to find Martin’s aggravated assault in public records.

All licensed gun retailers are required to run a background check through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) any time they sell a firearm to an individual. But a background check system is only as effective as its database. The federal government cannot force states to submit prohibited information, like criminal and mental health records, to NICS. Unfortunately, far too many states fail to participate, and Illinois ranks 34th of states submitting records to NICS.

In 2011, an audit of Illinois’ FOID card program found “significant deficiencies in the reporting of individuals with potentially disqualifying mental health conditions” to state police. At the time of the audit, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart asked, “How are people going to explain away the fact that a horrific event occurred, and it turns out this person had diagnosed mental health issues and their card was not (taken away or) the information was never forwarded to the state police, so they never had the ability to take the card away?” Nine years later, this exact scenario has played out too many times.

Since the 2011 audit, Illinois has received millions of dollars in grants specifically for fixing problems with their database and automating the process of submitting disqualifying records to the NICS database. In 2018, Congress passed the Fix NICS Act, which required all federal agencies to submit any of their prohibitory records, and provided funding and resources for states to do the same (although the federal government still cannot compel states to do this).

This leaves many unanswered questions as to why states like Illinois continue to allow criminals to skirt gun laws already on the books. Is their failure to run background checks, or to submit records to the NICS, because of a lack of funding? A lack of technology? Are they continually updating their submitted records, or are they submitted in a one-time dump to the federal government? In the case of the Aurora shooting, was it Mississippi’s failure to submit the information of the shooter’s felony, or was it Illinois’ failure to find it?

The Charleston church shooting, the Sutherland Springs church shooting, and now the Aurora shooting are just three of the many recent mass shootings that could have been prevented had the background check system been properly enforced. In each of these tragedies, the shooters obtained firearms illegally. They were criminals before they even claimed a victim. These criminals are evidence that gun control measures do nothing to address the reality that criminals will never obey the law, but expose bureaucratic failures to enforce it.

"Facts About Mass Shootings Support Gun Ownership, Not Gun Control","On February 14, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) marked the one-year anniversary of a horrific school shooting by threatening that President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for a border wall could be used as precedent for future gun control.

Calling the 2018 massacre of 17 students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida “another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America,” Pelosi remarked, “That’s a national emergency. Why don’t you declare that emergency, Mr. President?”

“A Democratic president,” she threatened, “can do that.”

By painting the tragic Parkland shooting as a failure of gun control, however, Pelosi disregards the indisputable fact that the shooter’s rampage was enabled by years-long, system-wide failures of policy and personnel.

Andrew Pollack, the father of shooting victim Meadow Pollack, is on a campaign to hold those who failed the Parkland victims accountable. This includes the resource officer and deputies whose inadequate response allowed the shooting spree to continue for 11 long minutes, the FBI officials who ignored a tip about the shooter’s intentions just over a month prior to the attack, the Broward County superintendent whose “Promise” program kept students’ criminal activities from being reported to police, and the school officials, mental health providers, and officials from the Broward Sheriff’s Office who ignored a series of red flags, not to mention murderer’s lengthy history of violence and mental health issues.

These Tragedies Happened Despite Legal Barriers

Judging by the sheer number of pending legal claims against Broward Country Public Schools (103 as of December 2018), Pollack is not the only parent of a victim or survivor to find that fault extends beyond the shooter and his weapon. The families of two Parkland victims are also filing suit against the manufacturer of Cruz’s AR-15, and the store where he purchased it.

On Friday, just one day after Pelosi threatened future gun control initiatives, America experienced another preventable and horrific shooting in Aurora, Illinois. After he was fired from his job, Gary Martin used a pistol he unlawfully possessed to shoot employees in his workplace. Martin killed six employees, and wounded five of the police officers who responded to the scene before he was killed by police.

As a convicted felon, Martin should not have possessed a weapon. When applying for an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card in January 2014, he lied about his previous felony conviction for aggravated assault. After he purchased his pistol in March, Martin also applied for a concealed carry permit. When the fingerprinting process revealed Martin’s criminal history in Mississippi, police turned down Martin’s application, revoked his FOID card, and informed him that he must relinquish his weapon within 48 hours. Instead, Martin kept the pistol.

Non-compliance with police orders regarding weapons and FOID turnover is not uncommon. In 2018, 10,818 FOID cards were revoked by the Illinois State Police, who admitted on Monday that “in most instances” a weapon and official record are not returned. Law enforcement is able to petition a judge for a search warrant to retrieve guns that are not turned over, but according to Illinois law, they are not required to do so.

In Aurora, existing gun laws failed. In Parkland, a host of authorities and policies failed. Democrats are shortsighted if they simply believe that creating new limits on gun ownership will increase Americans’ safety.

Pelosi’s threat of future gun control initiatives does not stand alone. During the 2018 midterm elections, more candidates aired “spots promot[ing] gun control than oppos[ing] it.” In the wake of the Aurora attack, Democratic presidential candidates are loudly decrying gun violence, and advocating for stricter gun control measures.

Worth noting, however, is that Democrats have also been notably two-faced on gun control. Last Wednesday, while the House Judiciary Committee passed a bill to require background checks on every gun sale or transfer, Democrats rejected Republicans’ efforts to add an amendment that would ensure law enforcement is notified “when an individual attempting to purchase a firearm fails a federal background check.”

Most Americans Favor Legal Gun Ownership

A majority of Americans do not agree with Democrats’ gun violence demagoguery. According to a March 2018 poll, 58 percent of Americans believe that gun ownership “increase[s] public safety by allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves.”

James Craig, who returned to his native Detroit as its chief of police in June 2013, believes in the strength of a legally armed populace. After working as a police officer for nearly three decades in Los Angeles, “where ‘it took an act of Congress’ to get permission to carry a gun,” Craig transferred to Portland, Maine. There, he discovered a vastly safer city, and one where gun ownership was common. It was in Portland that Craig realized “the effect…good Americans who are armed can have on reducing violence.”

Prior to Craig’s arrival, Detroit was among the most violent cities in the country. According to FBI statistics, 80 in 1000 Detroit residents “became victims of violent or property crime each year.” In 2012, 386 criminal homicides had been reported in the city. To bring down crime rates, the new chief of police urged Detroit residents to legally and safely arm themselves.

In 2014, Craig’s department issued 1,100 handgun permits. That year, the number of home invasions decreased by 38 percent, with the numbers of shootings and robberies likewise decreasing. Of the 1,800 felons queried in a 2015 survey, 57 percent identified their biggest fear as “armed citizens.”

Since Craig took over the department, Detroit has experienced “double-digit drops” in “nonfatal shootings, robberies, and carjackings.” Although the city’s levels of violence still leave much to be desired, in 2017, Detroit recorded its “lowest number of homicides since 1966.”

Craig believes a conversation surrounding guns should not be about gun control, but “crime control.” As he explains, “individuals who are criminally inclined…when in possession of a weapon, create the problems.”

Before Democrats look to new measures of gun control, they should concern themselves with the enforcement of existing gun laws, keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals, and holding accountable institutions and policies which allow threats to go undetected.

If Democrats impede law-abiding Americans from arming themselves to protect their fellow citizens, and themselves, then the only people with access to weapons will be those who purchase them illegally, with criminal intent.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/21/facts-mass-shootings-support-gun-ownership-not-gun-control/,2019-02-21
Top 9 Reasons House Democrats’ Latest Gun Control Bill Is A Terrible Idea,"Shortly after taking back control of the U.S. House of Representatives, Democrats are making a significant push to enact major gun control legislation.

House Democrats are set to pass a bill requiring so-called “universal background checks” at the federal level, which would effectively outlaw private sales throughout the country. That bill—H.R. 8, or the “Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019”—would require that all transfers of firearm possession occur only after a federal background check has been conducted. On its face, this may seem like a reasonable idea, but on closer examination, none of the claims from gun control proponents backing this bill holds water.

Detailed below are the top nine reasons this latest piece of gun control legislation is a bad idea. Federally mandated universal background checks won’t end gun violence or stop the criminal misuse of firearms, but they will significantly increase the burden of millions of law-abiding Americans who wish only to exercise their Second Amendment right to self-defense.

1. Gun Dealers Already Conduct Background Checks

Federal law, promulgated via Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) rules, already requires all gun dealers to ensure that a customer has satisfied the background check requirements prior to allowing the customer to have possession of a firearm.

Under current federal law, gun dealers are required to confirm, prior to any and all sales, that a customer has passed a background check. If you head into a gun store to purchase a new firearm, that dealer must confirm that you have passed a background check before you can take possession of that new gun and take it home. This is the case regardless of where you live. And if you’re traveling across state lines and see a gun in another state that you’d like to purchase, you must pass a background check before you can purchase and possess the gun.

Nearly two dozen states place additional requirements beyond federal law on firearm transfers and already either require a background check to be conducted for every firearm transfer (even between private same-state resident individuals, like the Universal Background Check bill proposes) or a valid firearm possession license that is issued contingent upon a background check.

See more about the efficacy of these extra background check requirements below.

2. In-State Commerce Is a State Issue

Under current law, only firearms transactions between private, non-dealer residents who reside in the same state are exempt from federal background check requirements. That is because the federal firearm licensing system and background check requirements apply only to interstate commerce.

This is not because the federal government doesn’t want more power (since when has that happened?). Instead, it is a valid constitutional restriction on what types of activities and commerce the federal government may control.

As noted above, many states have placed additional restrictions on firearm possession above and beyond what the federal government already requires. These purely in-state transactions between private residents of those states should continue to be handled at the state level, as different states have different challenges that are best addressed with local solutions implemented by local representatives.

Furthermore, each state should retain the authority to decide whether it is willing to incur the additional costs and burdens that will arise from new gun control restrictions.

3. Demands For New Gun Control Are An Admission That Gun Control Doesn’t Work

Background checks are used to ensure that a potential firearm possessor is not one of a class of “prohibited persons” who are prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition under federal law. This class includes felons, fugitives, those subject to certain restraining orders, those convicted of crimes of domestic violence, and more.

This means gun control legislation already makes it illegal for these people to possess a firearm. Requiring more background checks is an admission that the current law prohibiting these people from possessing firearms is not enough to prevent their possession. This is true for all gun-control laws, because if we know one thing about criminals, it’s that they do not care if they break the law.

Every mass killing is caused by one thing: an evil person intent on killing many innocent people. The tool, whether it be an airplane, a pressure cooker, or a firearm, can change. Making even more laws restricting access to the tool will not stop mass killings, but it will make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves from potential violence. By definition, criminals don’t obey the law.

The horrific mass shooting at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, was not prevented by banning murder, banning guns on schools, banning the theft of firearms, nor requiring so-called universal background checks for every gun sale (Connecticut is one of the states that requires this). Adding yet another law on top of dozens of other laws that failed to prevent mass gun violence is an admission that these laws simply don’t work.

4. There Is No ‘Gun-Show Loophole’

One of the biggest claims I’ve heard as a reason for needing more background checks is the so-called “gun-show loophole.” There’s one big problem with that claim: there is no “gun-show loophole” in federal law. It is a myth.

As covered above, federal law requires that all sales from firearm dealers, or sales between residents of different states, must satisfy the background check requirements, regardless of whether those sales happen in a gun shop, at a gun show, or out of the back of somebody’s trunk in a parking lot. Many states also require background checks for individual sales.

There is simply no law anywhere that says if a gun is bought at a gun show, then the buyer doesn’t have to undergo a background check. In fact, gun shows are generally full of ATF agents on the prowl for potential violations of federal law. A dealer who tries to sell a gun at a gun show without confirming that the buyer has passed a background check will get in big trouble in short order.

Furthermore, federal law also prevents sales to anyone the seller believes to be a “prohibited person” (e.g., a convicted felon). As a result, gun dealers regularly turn away potential customers if they think they are not legally allowed to purchase or possess a firearm. There is no special exemption or “loophole” in federal law that allows gun show sales to occur without background checks.

5. There Is No ‘Online Gun Sales Loophole’

Another common call for universal background checks is based on a so-called “online gun sale loophole.” Similar to the “gun show loophole” above, it doesn’t exist. Firearms can be legally purchased online as long as the purchaser is not a “prohibited person,” the firearm is legal to possess in the purchaser’s state of residence, and the state otherwise allows the sale.

But here’s the rub: the process for online gun sales requires that the firearm be shipped to a federally licensed dealer in the purchaser’s home state, where the purchaser must fill out the required federal paperwork and satisfy the background check requirements prior to possession. Just because you click “BUY” on a website that sells guns doesn’t mean you’ll have it shipped to your door without having to process the transaction through a federal gun dealer, who is required to confirm that you have passed a background check before you take possession of that new gun.

6. Universal Background Checks Won’t Stop Criminals From Getting Guns

A potential firearm purchaser is either a person with a clean criminal record and therefore not a “prohibited person,” or someone who is already legally prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Even under a legal regime that requires universal background checks, the person who is banned by law from owning a gun will continue to get a gun the same way criminals do today: by stealing it, having someone else by it for him or her, or purchasing it in the black market. A federal background check requirement will do nothing to prevent that already illegal sale.

Thinking this will stop the criminal misuse of firearms is like insisting upon a background check before someone can purchase crystal meth. Users of crystal meth, much like criminals with guns, act contrary to the law. If they can’t legally buy it, they’ll do it illegally. And the people in the business of illegally selling aren’t about to start complying with laws that require them to conduct their black market sales in a particular way.

Remember, it’s already illegal for a prohibited person to possess a firearm. If that law doesn’t stop them, requiring background checks in more types of transactions won’t either.

There’s also a real problem with “straw purchases” of firearms, wherein someone with a clean record buys a gun from a gun store for someone who can’t legally purchase it on his or her own. This is already illegal and our nation’s gun dealers are the front line of defense against these illegal transactions. However, despite the current background check requirements for gun dealers, straw purchases still happen, and illegal straw purchases will only become more popular and more difficult to discern if H.R. 8 becomes law.

7. Background Checks Won’t Stop Mass Shootings

Demands for more gun control always seem to follow mass shootings. It makes sense that we want to do something—these mass shootings are horrific, and we should do what we can to stop them. However, universal background checks will not end mass shootings or gun violence.

For example, universal background checks would not have stopped the deadliest mass shootings following the enactment of federal background check requirements in 1994:

Las Vegas 2017: Shooter purchased his firearms from a gun dealer (where background checks are already required).

Orlando 2016: Shooter purchased his firearms from a gun dealer.

Virginia Tech 2007: Shooter purchased his firearms from a gun dealer.

Sandy Hook 2012: Shooter stole his firearms.

Sutherland Springs 2017: Shooter purchased his firearm from a gun dealer. He had a criminal record and the background check system failed to stop him (the same system that would be used for private transfers).

Parkland 2018: Shooter purchased firearm from a gun dealer.

San Bernardino 2017: Shooters’ firearms were “straw-purchased” by someone else.

Fort Hood 2009: Shooter purchased firearm from a gun dealer.

Columbine 1999: Shooters’ guns were straw-purchased for them by someone else.

Thousand Oaks 2018: Shooter purchased firearm legally with a background check.

Navy Yard 2013: Shooter purchased firearm from a gun dealer.

Aurora 2012: Shooter purchased firearms from a gun dealer.

8. Universal Background Checks Are Too Burdensome

The current National Instant Criminal Check System (NICS) used for firearm background checks can only be used by federally licensed gun dealers or government entities. This restriction by the FBI on their system is due to them not being able to handle the burden of additional checks.

Opening the background check system, which already experiences significant backlogs and delays, will introduce an extra burden on the government, and on those who wish to exercise their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The universal background check bill will amount to a delay and a tax on the exercise of a fundamental right.

First, a seller and buyer must find, and travel to, a local gun store during the store’s hours and wait for paperwork and a background check to be processed. Second, unless the federal government intends to force dealers into servitude, the dealer will charge a fee for their services conducting the background check. This fee, typically around $25-50, will be, in effect, an additional tax on every sale of a firearm.

There will also be a burden on gun dealers. Most gun dealers are small business owners who are focused on keeping their businesses running. This extra burden will take their time away from customers and other business duties. It will also significantly increase their ATF compliance burden, as they are liable for every piece of paperwork and transfer that takes place.

9. This Creates a De Facto Federal Gun Registry

It is currently illegal for the federal government to maintain a database of ownership of standard firearms (not including silencers, machine guns, etc.). There is a good reason for this ban on a federal gun registry: the government can only confiscate firearms if it first knows where they are all located.

The natural conclusion to this law’s enforcement would be the creation of a database tracking the lawful transfers, and therefore current possessors, of all firearms in this country.

Although a registry is not mentioned in the bill, it is a logical conclusion. After all, how could such a universal background check law ever be enforced absent a national gun registry showing who passed a background check, when, and for which particular firearms?

For law enforcement to prove that a firearm was purchased in a private transaction, they would need to know who was the most recent lawful possessor. Of course, someone with a lawfully possessed firearm could have a receipt from a gun store, but that could be lost or faked.

The natural conclusion to this law’s enforcement would be the creation of a database tracking the lawful transfers, and therefore current possessors, of all firearms in this country. It would be bad enough if the government were to maintain and use such a list, but what if hackers stole that list (just as they stole the personnel records of millions of federal employees)? Suddenly, violent criminals in search of weapons would have a perfect map showing which homes to ransack when nobody’s home.

Mass shootings and gun violence are horrible, and we should try to stop them. However, demands for more gun control only make plain the truth that gun control cannot stop violence.

Current gun control isn’t enough. The latest gun control proposal is no different. It would do nothing to end gun violence, but it would drastically increase the burdens on law-abiding citizens who only wish to defend themselves and their families from the violent criminals who don’t care whether something is against the law or not.

"No, Gun Control Isn’t A Good Idea Because Military Officers Say So","When general and admirals speak, veterans like me tend to listen. That’s why I perked up at a recent letter from the political gun-control group Giffords Veterans Coalition signed by 13 retired officers. That letter advised Congress that passing background checks that ban private gun sales is a moral imperative. They contend this infringement on constitutional rights is necessary to protect American safety.

There are a few things the military just won’t tolerate. Lack of discipline. Disrespect. Getting out of step. I should know—I spent 25 years instilling those values into my Marines. On this, though, I can’t salute.

These military officers claim the moral high ground in the gun debate. Their service is admirable, but they hardly speak for all of us. I’ve been to war, and I won’t forget those who prey on disarmed societies.

I saw first-hand the aftermath of Haitian coup leader Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who was responsible for murdering more than 3,000 people following his overthrow of a democratically elected president. I vividly remember a Shia elder in southern Iraq telling me about Saddam Hussein’s brutality. The dictator’s thugs dragged this man’s three sons in front of him and executed them, just to keep them under his thumb. I’ve seen Afghan villagers living in fear of al-Qaeda, and so much more.

Law-abiding Americans must be skeptical when we’re told to abandon our rights. We wouldn’t tolerate military dictations on how to practice our religion. Historically, the American public has gotten outraged after the government used war as an excuse to censor the media.

We should all remember that our government once used the military to force Japanese-Americans to go into internment camps and that our Supreme Court said that was okay. This should also be true of the uniquely American right to keep and bear arms.

These generals suggest that some high-profile tragedies should be a rationale for us to pass restrictive gun laws against the law-abiding. But the laws they propose wouldn’t have stopped these murderers. Enforcing existing laws would have, if the will existed to enforce them.

The murderers at a Las Vegas country music festival and the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, Calif., passed the same background checks these letter writers want Congress to expand. In Parkland, concerned citizens reported the murderer to the FBI, but it was never followed up. Police were called to the murder’s home 39 times. He allegedly threatened his mother and brother with a gun. Students warned school officials. The laws were there. No one stepped in.

In Sutherland Springs, the military failed six times to report the murderer as a prohibited individual. The Department of Defense was required to report him to the FBI. The Air Force didn’t tell the FBI of his domestic violence court-martial conviction, involuntarily commitment to a mental health facility, and dishonorable discharge—all grounds for barring someone from possessing a gun. The murderer lied on his background check form four different times. No one knew better, because he wasn’t reported.

It wasn’t the military that fixed this. It wasn’t Giffords Veteran Coalition. It was the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association, that worked with Congress and got the Fix NICS Act signed into law by President Trump. Now, DoD and all federal agencies are required by law to report prohibited individuals and states are provided resources to submit all criminal and adjudicated disqualifying mental health records to the FBI.

Let’s be honest about the other claims. The authors maintain nearly all gun owners support blanket background checks. But the NSSF presented the full facts to gun owners. Retailers at gun shows already perform these checks as required by law, and Internet sales require a face-to-face transaction with a federally licensed firearms dealer with a background check. Faced with the complete facts, more than half of Americans polled saw new laws as unnecessary.

The reality is most criminals admit they get the guns they used in crimes through two primary means: theft and the black market.

Let’s be clear about the language the officers use in this letter. They tell us this legislation is just a first step. They want more, including outright bans on entire classes of firearms and magazines.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling even took a CNN reporter to a range to demonstrate the lethality of modern sporting rifles. He said they were weapons of war. The cringe-worthy performance, and utterances of “full semi-automatic,” revealed his agenda.

There’s no such thing as “full semi-automatic.” The truth is these rifles have been commercially available since the 1960s. The truth is the majority of criminal misuse of firearms involves stolen and black-market handguns. The truth is gun control groups will use these generals claim the moral high ground to eliminate Second Amendment rights.

These officers don’t speak for all veterans, and certainly not for those of us who treasure our rights. We spent too much time and have spilled blood to simply wash them away.

Senior enlisted advisors, the salty enlisted types like me, have a special role with commanders. We offer quiet and sage counsel, the benefit of our years of experience. Generals, you’re out of step with our freedom.

NYT Op-Ed Confuses Preemies With Babies Born Alive After Abortion,"On Monday, Sen. Ben Sasse’s Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act fell short of the 60 votes needed to move the legislation to a floor vote. All 44 of the “nay” votes came from Democrats or supposed independents, including presidential hopefuls Cory Booker, Sherrod Brown, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren.

While the party of Planned Parenthood needed to kill the bill, voting to withhold medical care from an infant lucky enough to escape the womb alive isn’t the best look for a party hoping to win back the Senate and White House in 2020. So yesterday saw the liberal media’s launch of a rehabilitation effort for their party.

But how do you prop up a politician who votes to allow newborn babies to die? Easy: With misdirection and prevarication.

Misleading, Evasive Media Coverage

The New York Times led the charge, publishing Dr. Jen Gunter’s op-ed, “I Didn’t Kill My Baby.” Gunter is an obstetrician and gynecologist who has performed late-term abortions. She lost her son Aidan—one of the triplets she was carrying—when he was born extremely premature at 22 weeks gestation.

Gunter’s loss is tragic. But it has nothing to do with abortion. Gunter didn’t have an abortion; her water broke at 22 weeks and three days gestation. Doctors were unable to delay Aidan’s birth, and he died shortly after Gunter delivered him. Physicians apparently succeeded, however, in delaying Gunter’s delivery of her other two babies, because she notes in passing that Aidan’s two siblings survived.

Gunter does not provide any details, though, because that would not serve her purpose. Her op-ed seeks to attack the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act by portraying her tragic loss as equivalent to an abortion: “If you are going to accuse me of executing my child, then you need to know exactly what happened. It’s not a pleasant story and the ending is terrible. I wouldn’t blame you for not wanting to read it. But you need to know the truth, because stories like mine are being perverted for political gain.”

No one is talking about stories like Gunter’s. No one is accusing Gunter of executing her son. And try as she might to equate her situation to the focus of the legislation, which concerns abortion survivors, Gunter did not have an abortion. The only one perverting anything for political gain is Gunter!

To be clear: The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act speaks only of babies born alive following “an abortion or attempted abortion.” The bill also does not mandate “heroic measures,” or “invasive procedures,” as Gunter implies. It simply requires that health practitioners provide the abortion survivor with the same health care “any other child born alive at the same gestational age” would receive. (The abortion doctor must also immediately transport the baby to a hospital.)

Making Sense of Gunter’s Argument

In fact, Gunter’s entire op-ed perfectly illustrates the need for, and functioning of, the proposed Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. The medical team caring for Gunter and Aidan concluded, in their reasonable and conscientious judgment, that Aidan could not survive and that no further health care was medically necessary. Conversely, the medical team caring for Gunter’s other two premature babies concluded that further medical care was appropriate. The bill merely requires a medical team to treat a survivor of abortion the same as Gunter’s doctors treated her three premature babies.

Gunter also makes the incomprehensible claim that the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is “nothing more than a way to warp the reality of perinatal mortality (stillbirth or death within the first week of life) to create confusion about abortion.” Perinatal mortality is a tragic reality, but it has nothing to do with Sasse’s bill. Any confusion between the two stems solely from Gunter’s attempt to manipulate the sympathy the public feels for her loss.

In her op-ed, Gunter adds another dubious but oft-repeated claim, stating that abortions “at or after 24 weeks of gestation, the time largely accepted as viability, are typically performed because of severe fetal anomalies or fetal anomalies combined with maternal health problems.” But a Congressional Research Service report from April 2018 looked at that question and cited an expert in the field (and an abortion apologist) Dr. Diana Greene Foster, who “believes that abortions for fetal anomaly ‘make up a small minority of later abortion.’”

Anecdotally, we also have Beth Vial’s op-ed for Teen Vogue from earlier this month. In “What It Was Like To Get A Later Abortion,” Vial recounted her trip to New Mexico to abort her healthy, viable unborn baby at 28 weeks of gestation. Not quite the typical scenario Gunter would have readers believe, which just goes to show that Vial is too young, too naïve, or too indoctrinated by the “shout your abortion” crowd to realize her story horrifies ordinary Americans.

Gunter knows better, which is why she set herself up as the strawman: the suffering, still-mourning mom. But the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act isn’t about Gunter or her son Aidan, or about any of the other moms who bear children only to bury them. The bill is about the Vials of the world, and the vile doctors who attempt to abort viable fetuses—and when they fail, leave the infants to die.

All the distortion that is fit to print will not change that reality.

Court Rules Remington Can Be Sued For Marketing Guns ‘For Combat’,"Gun-makers are facing a potentially major legal reversal of their protection from liability for gun violence. The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Remington Outdoor Co. can be sued for how it marketed their Bushmaster rifle, the model used in the Sandy Hook mass shooting.

Families of the Sandy Hook victims filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the gun manufacturer in 2012. In this week’s 4-3 ruling, the Connecticut Supreme Court overturned a lower-court ruling that the lawsuit was prohibited by a 2005 federal law, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The PLCAA protects gun companies from being held liable for crimes committed with their products.

The court upheld the dismissal of several of the plaintiffs’ claims as barred under the PLCAA, but found that the PLCAA did not protect gun manufacturers from a state law that bans marketing a military-style weapon to civilians. The plaintiffs alleged that Bushmaster glorified violence and extolled militaristic characteristics to attract civilian buyers.

Unless the ruling is appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, the case will now go back to a trial court, where a jury will decided if Remington violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act.

Here are some of the marketing and advertising phrases the plaintiffs have objected to:

“The Bushmaster Defendants’ militaristic marketing reinforces the image of the AR-15 as a combat weapon used for the purpose of waging war and killing human beings.”

“The Bushmaster Defendants have promoted their ‘civilian’ rifles as ‘the ultimate combat weapons system.'”

“Superimposed over the silhouette of a soldier holding his helmet against the backdrop of an American flag is text that reads: ‘When you need to perform under pressure, Bushmaster delivers.'”

The plaintiffs are asserting that the gun used in the Newtown shooting is more dangerous than other guns simply because it shares characteristics with military rifles like a “matte black, non-reflective finish.”

Another larger legal ramification this case will have on the gun industry is setting a precedent for giving access to gun companies’ internal documents and marketing strategies. The Sandy Hook families will now be able to subpoena information on how the Bushmaster AR-15 was marketed.

“There is a reason why this particular consumer product is the one that is used by people who want to inflict the most damage, and we have seen it time and time again since my son and his classmates were killed,” David Wheeler, father of a Sandy Hook victim, told the Hartford Courant. “That reason very likely potentially resides in the documents that we have been unable to look at until now.”

No final victories have been declared yet, and the gun manufacturers’ lawyers maintain that their clients are protected by federal and state laws. James Vogts, a lawyer for Remington, told the Wall Street Journal that a firearm maker or seller must be “given a reason to know that the buyer is likely to use the product to cause harm,” in order to be liable under Connecticut law.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/03/15/court-rules-remington-can-be-sued-for-marketing-guns-for-combat/,2019-03-15
The Gun Control Campaign Against The AR-15 Is Full Of Lies,"“This conflict over the 2nd amendment and the attempted removal of firearms rights will ultimately result in a civil war that will eventually balkanize the US along political, cultural and, most importantly, racial lines,” wrote the Christchurch, New Zealand mass murderer in his demented manifesto. Some Americans, unfortunately, immediately used the bloodbath to support their political causes.

Sen. Chris Murphy wondered, for instance, why Americans needed “semi-automatic rifles,” at all. “Nobody needs an AR-15 to hunt,” the Connecticut senator tweeted. “Nobody needs a semi-automatic rifle to defend their home. But mass shooters NEED these weapons in order to murder as many people as efficiently as possible. And so nobody will miss them when they are illegal – except for the killers.”

One of the nice things about having individual rights codified in a Constitution is that Americans don’t (or shouldn’t) have to explain to government officials why they choose to practice them. I’m certain nothing in the Second Amendment mentions hunting, because the right of self-defense—an individual concern, as well as a collective one—wasn’t about shooting deer, it was about protecting Americans from the state confiscating their firearms.

While Murphy’s reductionist take is obviously wrong on several counts, it’s exceptionally wrong in claiming that killers would miss these rifles. Killers will always have weapons. And they don’t need AR-15s, even though there are probably between 10 and 15 million of them in circulation in the US. And unless Murphy believes federal agents should be tasked with going house to house and confiscating every “semi-automatic rifle”—an unlikely scenario—they will be with us a very long time.

Nor is there evidence that banning the AR-15 would reduce criminality or mass shootings, anyway. The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (1994 to 2004) did nothing to alter gun violence trends. Once the assault weapon was lifted, and the AR-15 became the most popular rifle in the country, gun violence continue to precipitously fall.

Considering the political hysteria around crime, and the slight uptick in crime in 2017, many Americans might not be aware that every category of violent crime has fallen to historic lows over the past 25 years. And while every school shooting is a distressing event, inflicting deep pain on individuals, communities, and the nation, it’s important to point out that despite the proliferation of the AR-15, schools are much safer today than they were 20 years ago—even school shootings are less common, according to researchers at Northeastern. Four times as many children were killed in schools in the early ’90s than today.

Then again, AR-15s are rarely used in the crimes, in general. If you need any more proof that the AR is being singled out for political reasons, mostly due to its aesthetics, it’s worth noting that in 2017, the last year of FBI data, there were 7,105 Americans murdered by handguns and 374 by all rifles (only a fraction of which were AR-15s.) There were 1,604 knife homicides during that same span. There were 656 people killed by fists and kicking.

“Fact checkers” like to point out that not every national police department reports on the type of gun is used in homicides (3,077 to be exact), but it’s reasonable to believe that the same trends would apply to those crimes. It’s mostly big cities that don’t share information on the types of guns criminals use.

There’s a good reason that gun controllers want to depict the AR as uniquely dangerous. “As a longtime gun owner and supporter of the Second Amendment, I agreed with the Supreme Court’s ‘Heller’ holding that concluded Americans had the right to keep and bear arms. But that constitutional protection did not, and will not, extend to guns designed as weapons of war,” explained Joe Scarborough in a Twitter thread.

“If you own an AR-15, keep it,” the gracious presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke told the American people the other day, “Continue to use it responsibly and safely. I just don’t think that we need to sell any more weapons of war into this public.”

There are two major problems with these talking points.

One: No matter how many times gun-controllers refer to the AR-15 as a “weapon of war” it will still be historically and mechanically incorrect. Writers like James Fallows have, for years, been misleading readers about the history of the AR-15, purposely conflating it with the military M-16. Eugene Stoner, chief engineer of ArmaLite and its parent company Colt, marketed the AR (“ArmaLite Rifle”) directly to the civilian marketplace in the early 1960s—before its more powerful version was adopted by the US military.

Of course, every gun from the musket, to the rifle, to the revolver, to the semi-automatic handgun was once used as, or developed into, a “weapon of war.” In the end, every gun is designed to kill, otherwise it would be worthless. And if any weapon that kills can be categorized as a “weapon of war” then the AR will have some stiff competition. John Browning designed the 1911 handgun before World War I, and it was subsequently used by the US military until 1986. Now it is one of the most popular handgun designs in the country. It was a “weapon of war.”

And every great gunmaker in American history sought government contracts as a way to maximize profits. But that doesn’t mean the civilian and military versions of the AR are the same. Americans like AR-15s for a variety of reasons, include ease of use, but the civilian iteration was never used as a “weapon of war.” The major difference is that the AR-15 fires once every trigger pull, like any other semi-automatic weapon on the market. In fact, it uses smaller ammunition than most semi-automatic guns. The M-16 (and M-4)–actual weapons of war–can be fully automatic or used in three-round bursts. The AR-15, in fact, can be considered less a weapon of war when Stoner sold it to civilians (until 1977 when the patent ran out) than many other legal guns of the time. Fully automatic firearms were only effectively banned in 1986.

Two: Using the phrase “weapon of war” is just a pretext. The District of Columbia v. Heller decision found that the Second Amendment protected weapons “in common use by law-abiding citizens.” The AR-15 clearly meets this criteria. Scarborough invents an exceptionally narrow definition of Heller, in which he argues that the decision basically only protects handguns for the purpose of home protection, and, I guess, bolt-action hunting rifles. But this is clearly untrue. The Heller decision found that the Second Amendment was an individual right to keep and bear arms for any “lawful purpose,” not merely home protection (or hunting). It found that the Second Amendment “guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.”

Gun restrictionists focus on the AR-15 because it looks like a military weapon. Once stripped of emotion, however, the argument against ARs, which feature the same mechanics as many others firearms, is that they work better. There will always be a gun that works better than other guns. The focus on the AR is merely part of an incremental push towards broader prohibitions. After all, many gun controllers openly argue that we should roll back technology to musket—also a weapon of war—because the founders never imagined firearms would become more powerful. This is historically inaccurate, as well. But when politicians go back to writing pamphlets rather than making their cases on TV and the internet, we can start to have that conversation.

Cory Booker Peddles False Gun Law ‘Loopholes’ During CNN Town Hall,"During Wednesday night’s CNN town hall event, 2020 presidential hopeful Cory Booker indulged in a favorite pastime of Democratic politicians: spewing false and inaccurate information on gun laws.

When answering an audience member’s question on his plan to address gun misuse, Booker immediately turned to attacking the National Rifle Association and laws that are not actually found anywhere in federal law. Let’s look at the each of the gun “loopholes” Booker is so passionate about abolishing.

https://twitter.com/jason_howerton/status/1111098164529037313

“[The NRA] is defending loopholes, like that loophole if a man is convicted of beating his wife, he can find a loophole to go out and buy a gun and murder her,” Booker said. “They are defending, not their membership, but the loopholes, like the loophole that says someone on the terrorist no-fly list in our country can still go to a gun show and buy weapons. That somebody that’s convicted of a violent crime can still find a loophole to buy a violent weapon.”

The claim that a wife-beater or someone convicted of a violent crime can purchase or possess a firearm is categorically false. The 1968 Gun Control Act prohibits anyone convicted of a felony or misdemeanor crime of domestic violence from possessing a firearm.

Every dealer with a Federal Firearms License must perform background checks through the FBI’s National Instant Background Check System (NICS) every time they sell a firearm to a consumer. It doesn’t matter if this sale takes place online, at a gun show, or in a parking lot. So anyone with a domestic violence conviction on his or her record should be prevented from buying a gun.

Where the system often fails is not in the lack of background checks, but in a bureaucratic failure to enforce the existing background check. States sometimes fail to submit or update their records with NICS, allowing for lapses in the background check system.

For private sales within the same state, including a gift, trade, loan, or reselling an old gun, the seller does not have to perform a background check. Some states with universal background check systems do require background checks on private sales.

To accurately address the second “loophole” Booker mentioned, it’s best to evaluate the “terrorist no-fly list” and the “gun show” loophole individually. First, there is no such thing as a “gun show loophole.” See above about FFL dealers, who even at gun shows must run background checks with the NICS.

Secondly, while it is true that inclusion on the FBI’s terrorist watch list would not prevent an individual from purchasing a gun, it doesn’t mean we are letting terrorists buy weapons, like Booker is implying.

First of all, there is no such thing as the “terrorist no-fly list” that Booker describes. What we do have is the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, which manages multiple watch lists, and does so in mostly secrecy. The largest one, Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, reportedly adds 20,000 people to its list every year, and totals are now suspected to be higher than 1.5 million people. Also, inclusion in that database does not mean an individual cannot fly. If being one of the million names on TIDE makes you a terrorist, then that’s a lot of known terrorists freely walking around.

We also know the FBI maintains a “No Fly List” and a “Selectee List,” but there is not much public information on how one gets placed on them, or how he or she can get removed. This is partially what makes them unconstitutional. The supposed standard for getting put on a list is “reasonable suspicion,” which could pretty much mean anything, from having facial hair to the color of your skin. And when an American is placed on one of these arbitrary lists, it’s done discreetly. An individual isn’t notified that he or she has been added, or given a reason why.

These are the types of due-process violations and discrimination battles that civil rights organizations like the ACLU have been fighting for decades. As more Democrats attempt to equate “No Fly” lists with “known terrorists,” it’s a battle that gun rights advocates are having to fight too. Creating such a law would mean allowing the government to strip the constitutional rights of anyone who is not even charged or alleged to have committed a crime (let alone terrorism), but simply suspected of being a criminal.

Booker is not the first, and certainly won’t be the last, Democratic presidential candidate to spread these myths about firearms and gun laws. Maybe Booker is a strategic campaigning genius, but it sure seems dicey to me to build a platform on abolishing laws that don’t exist.

Counties Set Up Second Amendment Sanctuaries From Gun-Grabbing Bill,"More than two dozen counties in Colorado have taken a page from the left’s playbook by declaring themselves “Second Amendment sanctuary counties” in anticipation of the passage of a bill that allows local governments to seize people’s guns without due process.

In February, Democrats in the Colorado legislature introduced HB19-1177, commonly known as the Red Flag bill. The law allows the government to seize firearms from a law-abiding owner after as long as a petitioner “establishes ” by a preponderance of the evidence that the gun owner “poses a significant risk to self or others.”

This Is an Insane Idea Ripe for Abuse

There’s a lot wrong with this idea. First, the Red Flag bill makes it easy for anyone to file a petition, including angry former lovers from many moons ago. A petitioner can file on the phone or in person, doesn’t have to provide his address, and doesn’t have to reside in Colorado. A petitioner doesn’t have to appear in person at any hearing, and there is no cost to file a petition.

The petitioner only has to meet the “preponderance of the evidence” standard, which is a lower standard than the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in criminal trials. It basically asks whether the petitioner’s proposition is more likely to be true than not true. This is the same standard that kangaroo courts for campus sexual assault and harassment rely on, per the guidance of the Obama administration.

Second, the Red Flag bill ensures gun owners, not their accusers, bear the burden of proof, and makes it very difficult for the gun owner to defend his or her constitutional right to bear arms. The owner is completely unaware a petition has been filed against him until the police show up to confiscate all his firearms. Since a search warrant is issued at the same time a temporary extreme risk protection order (ERPO) is issued, the police may search the house even after the owner surrenders his firearms.

The first opportunity for the owner to defend himself comes at the 14th day after the ERPO hearing, after he has already surrendered his firearms. Since the whole thing is treated as a civil process, the owner is not eligible for a public defender. So he also must pay attorneys to get his guns back. If he can’t afford an attorney, he is out of luck.

The owner also must provide “clear and convincing evidence,” a higher standard than the “preponderance of the evidence” standard used to take his guns, to show he doesn’t pose a threat and to request his firearms back. However, a judge who isn’t satisfied can still issue a permanent ERPO, which prohibits the firearm’s owner from “possessing, controlling, purchasing, or receiving a firearm for 364 days.”

During this time, the owner has only one chance to request the termination of the ERPO. The original petitioner will be notified of such a request and is allowed to ask for an ERPO extension (via phone, not in person). As you can see these double standards make false accusations possible while doing little to ensure a fair due process for Colorado gun owners.

Third, the Red Flag bill likely won’t make communities any safer. Conservatives in Colorado argue that if there’s sufficient evidence proving the gun owner poses a danger to others, the police should take custody of the person. Simply taking firearms away but leaving a known dangerous person out in the community seems irresponsible. As we learned from past tragic attacks domestically and internationally, someone who is determined to do evil will use anything, whether a knife, a gun, a delivery van, or other objects, to harm others. So removing the person rather than tools seems a more sensible solution.

Weld County Commissioner Steve Moreno said the Red Flag bill “is nothing more than a feel-good measure that will not stop the actions it is aiming to prevent. There are other solutions that must be seriously considered when talking about mental health issues in this country. This bill is not it.” However, since Democrats control the Colorado Assembly and governor’s mansion, the Red Flag bill is expected to pass easily and be signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis soon.

Counties Declare Second Amendment Sanctuaries

The Red Flag bill splits Colorado law enforcement. While Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock offered his support, sheriffs from other countries including Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams oppose this bill because they are concerned it is unconstitutional. They also don’t want to spend law enforcement resources in building and guarding the storage for weapons confiscated from owners.

In anticipation of the bill’s passing, more than two dozen Colorado counties, including Douglas County, the seventh-most populous county in Colorado, passed “Second Amendment Sanctuary” resolutions. Many did so at the request of their duly elected sheriffs.

These counties affirm their support for their sheriffs “in the exercise of his sound discretion to not enforce against any citizen an unconstitutional firearms law.” They also promise not to appropriate government funds to build storage facilities for firearms seized by law enforcement. More counties are either considering similar measures or, like Arapahoe County, the third-most populous Colorado county, waiting for the final wording of the bill to decide the best course of action.

Facing increasing opposition from counties, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weise, a supporter of the Red Flag bill, dismissed the resolutions as something that couldn’t override a state law. He said sheriffs in those counties should resign if they refuse to follow the law. El Paso County Sheriff Bill Elder responded that he and county commissioners would “vigorously challenge the constitutionality” of the bill and “protect the second, fourth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendment rights of all lawful gun owners in the state, and not just in El Paso County.”

It looks like a legal battle will emerge as soon as the Red Flag bill passes.

Sanctuary Provisions Are a Double-Edged Sword

Declaring a jurisdiction a sanctuary from laws they don’t like is an idea originally embraced by the left. Immigration sanctuaries are jurisdictions that have decided not cooperate with certain federal immigration enforcement actions or enforce federal immigration laws regarding illegal immigrants accused or convicted of crimes. It’s reported that in 2015 alone, “more than 200 state and local jurisdictions did not honor requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain individuals.” Today the United States has more than 300 such sanctuary jurisdictions.

Back in 2013, Victor D. Hanson warned the left: “For every left-wing city that declares immigration statutes inoperative, a right-wing counterpart might do the same with the Endangered Species Act, gun-registration laws, affirmative action, or gay marriage. The result would be chaos and anarchy, not compassion.”

It’s interesting that the left now pushes back against gun sanctuary counties by using similar language to what conservatives have said about immigration sanctuary cities—”Our nation and state depends on the rule of laws” and “Everyone must obey the law.” But there is a fundamental difference between sanctuary on the left versus that on the right.

The left supports illegal immigrant sanctuary because they don’t want to obey federal laws they don’t like. They choose to protect law-breakers who may pose security threats to communities and law-abiding citizens. The left supports the Red Flag bill and opposes the gun sanctuary counties because they oppose gun ownership and Second Amendment rights. Once again, they rely on a state law to disobey federal laws they don’t like.

Conservatives believe that federal laws trump state laws and our Constitution trumps them all. No one gets to choose which part of the Constitution to disregard. Therefore, conservatives reject illegal immigrant sanctuaries and support the “Second Amendment Sanctuary” for the same reason—upholding the law of the land and defending law-abiding citizens’ constitutional rights.

Colorado isn’t alone in this fight. A similar Red Flag bill is working though the New Mexico legislature right now. Twenty-nine out of 33 sheriffs there signed a letter disapproving of the bill, and 24 counties have passed a Second Amendment sanctuary resolution, affirming their support of their sheriffs not enforcing what they view as unconstitutional gun control legislation.

What’s happening in Colorado and New Mexico has national implications because similar Red Flag bills passed in at least eight blue states in the United States in 2018, including New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. In recent testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, David Kopel, a Constitution scholar at the Independence Institute, said “Nearly a third of such orders are improperly issued against innocent people.”

Conservatives in these blue states have been looking for ways to push back against aggressive gun control legislation that they believe infringes upon their constitutional rights. Now Colorado and New Mexico have shown them what they can do.

Californians Flood Gun Stores When Magazine Ban Lifted For One Week,"“Do you have standard-capacity magazines in stock?” The salesman at the San Diego GlockStore just laughed.

Late last month, federal judge Roger T. Benitez struck down a California law in place since 2000 that banned the sale of gun magazines holding more than 10 rounds. The next day, San Diego firearms owners were jamming the phone lines of every gun store in town, desperate to lay hands on the larger, freshly legal pistol magazines before the People’s Republic of California pulled new shenanigans and made them illegal again.

When Gunfighter Tactical on Miramar opened at 10 a.m. on Saturday, the line at their front door stretched around the building. They were sold out within the hour.

In his decision, Benitez excoriated California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and the state for “turning the Constitution upside down” with the magazine restrictions. Benitez said, “Individual liberty and freedom are not outmoded concepts.” The question will likely go to the U.S. Supreme Court, one of several California gun control laws headed there. Hence the hurry: Within a week, Becerra won a fresh injunction banning standard-capacity magazines again while the ruling appeals.

Ownership of the not-tiny magazines amounts to a symbolic gesture a much as a practical improvement. None of the patrons standing in line evinced a professional need for a 15-round (or more) pistol magazine. These were not police officers or career criminals expecting a shootout against a well-armed adversary at any moment. They are mostly law-abiding, duly registered private owners with a few extra dollars to spare and an urge to own something exotic in their state, something on the edge of illicit.

As they bagged their purchases, they joked about sticking it to Beccera: “Every time the cash register rings, a gun grabber somewhere loses his wings … and his s–t.”

Guns Kill People But They’re Not Going Away

Firearms advocates and firearms controllers talk athwart one another most of the time, with one side shouting “Fascists!” and the other shouting “You want children to die!” There’s really no point outlining the back-and-forth for the thousandth time, so straight to the chase: Yes, firearms kill an alarming number of people in the United States every year, a great number by accident or suicide.

Yes, a great number of already enacted and newly proposed restrictions on firearms are staggeringly unconstitutional and effective only at irritating responsible gun owners while the irresponsible and the criminal flout them. Nothing short of a thundering authoritarian disarmament of the entire country is likely to substantially reduce death by firearms, and such a “solution” presents existential dangers of its own. In the end, America’s dilemma with gun rights will remain what it is for the seeable future.

Manifestly, no other constitutional right has been manhandled like the Second Amendment. Consider this hypothetical for perspective: a black American who wants to exercise his 15th Amendment right to vote finds out he must complete a weekend voting responsibility class and obtain an up-to-date voting license. He must undergo a background check before every vote he casts. He must wait ten days after filling out the ballot to turn it in, lest he mark his ballot in anger.

He must show two different forms of identification when he arrives at the polls. If his family believes he is unfit to vote, they can disenfranchise him with a phone call. If he gets diagnosed with a mood disorder or beats his wife, he can never vote again.

Such an outrage would, of course, trigger the American Civil Liberties Union apocalypse: “Voting is this man’s right, and these rules are a violation of his dignity and privacy!” Yet mutatis mutandis, California gun owners put up with just such absurdities in infringements on their gun rights.

Gun Privileges vs. Gun Rights

Well-meant wisdom engendered a confusion in American cultural attitudes toward firearms in the later 20th century. The bilateral consensus was that no adult should be able to procure a semi-automatic at the corner store as though he were buying cigarettes: “Give me a Milky Way, a pack of Camels, and throw in a Ruger SR9c 9mm and some cartridges. Neighbor’s getting on my nerves…”

Firearm owners acquiesced to escalating regulation of their right to keep and bear arms from an abundance of caution. Somewhere along the way, the whole culture began to view firearms as a privilege, like driving a car or practicing medicine, rather than a right, like voting or freedom of speech.

The Overton Window shifted, and a great misunderstanding evolved. Now, predicated mostly on their cultural intuition, gun control advocates feel entitled to regulate away firearms for social engineering, as they might cars with bad fuel efficiency, or doctors who overprescribe opiates.

On the other side, firearms advocates have unwittingly accepted gun control’s terms of debate by justifying themselves with statistics and stories of good guys with guns—in all cases arguing and begging for their rights as though they were privileges. Judge Benitez is spot on: the discussion has turned upside down. The Founders would never have justified or bargained. They would have slung their muskets, filled the Capitol Mall, and explained to Congress how it was going to be if lawmakers wanted to keep playing at government: “Our rights came before you bunch, and they will be here after.”

Rights are not a question of common sense or rhetoric. Rights are not a question of social engineering or social optimization. Pace Benitez, rights are not even a question of statistics about how many rounds one really needs to stop an attacker. Rights are not a question at all.

Rights are answers—uncommon, counterintuitive answers to timeless human problems that transcend fashions and centuries. In particular, the Second Amendment is an answer to that unfortunate, perennial human question: “What are you going to do about it if I take away your so-called rights?” Civil conflagrations and oppressive governments all over the world demonstrate that the Second Amendment is a hard-won answer that must be freshly remembered.

Anything worthy of the name right is a private matter, living within every citizen, not displayed in a government building for public perusal and debate. Like voting, the right to keep and bear arms should not deign to justify itself publicly, only assent to universally acknowledged boundaries: “A citizen cannot vote twice, and he cannot own a rocket launcher. So agreed.”

Gun rights supporters must recall the dignity that comes with their private right and cease bargaining. The answer to the question “Why do you even need a 15-round magazine for your Glock if you’re not a police officer?” should be “None of your business.” It’s time to turn the Constitution and the argument right side up again, to stop explaining and instead demand an explanation: what happened to a fundamental American right?

The conventions of privacy are coming apart in the West at an astonishing clip. Private and public are collapsing to a singularity. Oversharing has become the national pastime. The erosion of faith, technological surveillance, and evermore state intrusion into family life wash away the underpinnings of post-Enlightenment individuality more and more every day.

George Orwell worried in “1984” that totalitarianism would end all privacy. The equation seems to run in reverse, too: loss of privacy breeds totalitarianism, a society full of fussy laws to protect overexposed citizens from one another, as civility deteriorates and citizens become perpetual children. The Framers understood that the Enlightenment ideal of privacy was grounded neither in nature nor history and would not survive on its own unprotected.

If Western private life is to continue—what Judge Benitez calls “individual liberty and freedom”—Americans must not surrender their ability to set boundaries and hold them.

Citigroup Won’t Shoot Straight About Discriminating Against Gun Corps,"Citigroup’s getting asked some hard questions about the fiscal sanity of their decision to discriminate against firearms businesses, and their answers aren’t likely to soothe investors.

Justin Danhof, general counsel for the National Center Public Policy Research and Free Enterprise Project, posed a simple question in a shareholder meeting: “Can you tell us—your investors—exactly how much money we stand to lose because of this decision, and explain why you have this right while Warren Buffet has this wrong?”

Danhof was referencing Buffett’s 2018 refusal to impose his political views on investors. The “Oracle of Omaha,” who runs Berkshire Hathaway, rebuffed antagonist Andrew Ross Sorkin when he read a shareholder question during a CNBC interview about doing business with gun manufacturers.

“I don’t believe in imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses,” he said. Earlier in 2018, he stated his position just as clearly: “I don’t believe in imposing my views on 370,000 employees and a million shareholders. I’m not their nanny on that.”

Invest in Business, Not Politics

It’s telling that one of America’s most successful investors sees injecting corporate virtue signaling into investment and banking issues as losing proposition. It’s not that Buffett is a gun rights champion. He’s a board member of billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety, which champions extreme gun control, and supported Hillary Clinton for president when she campaigned on a platform of reinstating and expanding the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.

Buffett sees it as bad business for unaccountable corporate C-Suites to dictate public policy.

Citi CEO Michael Corbat tried to field Danhof’s question but stumbled out of the gate. Instead of owning up to a purely political decision, he offered half-truths. Corbat said Citigroup’s policy to discriminate against firearms manufacturers and retailers who refuse to abide by their policy of instituting age-based gun bans—deny a legal adult’s right to keep and bear arms—wasn’t a Second Amendment threat, rather a “good practice.”

Corbat tried to couch it that they would only do business with retailers who conduct full background checks and offer no financing for companies that use loans to convert legal firearms into illegal firearms. If it sounds confusing, it’s because Corbat was aiming to be.

All federally licensed firearms retailers are required by federal law to conduct an FBI background check at the point of sale before they can transfer a firearm to a consumer. This is done each and every time. This is not a “best practice,” it’s a law the industry supports. Also, no firearms manufacturers use any money—lent, invested, or earned—to convert legal firearms into illegal ones. It’s a quick way lose a manufacturing license and head to prison.

Purposefully Misleading Investors

Corbat is purposefully conflating the actions of individual criminals with that of an entire law-abiding industry that provides the means for Americans to exercise their Second Amendment rights. Citigroup’s actions, and Corbat’s answers, are a threat.

Real solutions to the criminal misuse of guns look a whole lot more like campaigns to make background checks work as intended by entering all disqualifying records, partnerships with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to prevent “straw purchases” of guns and make firearms retailers less vulnerable to theft and robbery, and using enhancing penalties for those who steal guns to commit further crimes in our communities.

The irony here, as Danhof pointed out to Corbat during the shareholder meeting, is Citigroup’s high-rise executives were claiming the moral high ground by using their financial might to influence public policy while it benefitted from public tax dollars—presumably including those paid by gun owners and firearms manufacturers—that ponied up the $45 billion Citigroup bailout.

“To be clear, the company is impinging on the constitutional rights of some of the very Americans who bailed Citi out after you all made a series of poor business decisions,” he told Citi officials. “Maybe you should have just said ‘Thank you,’ instead.”

What’s the Bottom Line?

To the original question, how much money do investors risk losing by this politically driven decision? Corbat wouldn’t say. He admitted, “We’ve had people take business from us around the policy,” adding the move hasn’t “cost us a meaningful amount of money.”

But it has. The state of Louisiana barred Citigroup from competing for a $600 million road improvement project for interfering the lawful commerce-in-arms. U.S. Sen Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and U.S. Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas) introduced the Freedom Financing Act (S. 821/H.R. 2019) that would prevent certain big banks from accessing taxpayer-funded insurance if they institute discriminatory policies against the firearms industry.

“Corbat’s admission that Citi has lost business due to its opposition to the Second Amendment is telling. But it’s concerning that he refused to say how much,” Danhof said in a statement. “This proves that Citi made a purely political decision.” It’s time for banks to focus on banking and let voters weigh in on politics.

Lawyers Say They’d Report A Client For Legally Owning A Gun,"If your lawyer believes that having a firearm license defines you as dangerous, you may be at risk of losing your Second Amendment rights and even your freedom. You may not know about his belief or recognize the risk until it is too late.

I can almost hear you saying, “My attorney is my advocate. What are you talking about? That could never happen!” You are wrong.

Lawyers are required to attend continuing legal education. During a recent ethics seminar, “The ‘Perfect’ Match: Selecting Clients for Successful Representation (Ethics),” Adam Kilgore, general counsel for the Mississippi Bar, offered the following hypothetical to a group of experienced civil and criminal lawyers.

A man has been fired from his job. He is upset. He hires you as his attorney. You are of the opinion he has an excellent case and file a complaint on his behalf. You later discover he possesses a permit to carry a firearm. He also has a so-called enhanced carry license. While his case is wending through the courts, your client goes to a public area outside his former workplace. He displays signs that say he has been wrongfully fired. The man has no history of criminal activity, violence, or threatening anyone.

The instructor asked the class what actions, if any, a lawyer should take. It seemed obvious to me there was no reason to do anything except proceed with the client’s case. I (Jude) would also advise my client to avoid confrontations with anyone who worked for his former employer and what he might consider saying if approached by the media.

While I was forming an answer, many lawyers immediately said they would terminate the attorney-client relationship and contact law enforcement to report their client was potentially dangerous. The only reason offered was his firearm permits.

I have to admit, I was flabbergasted, for several reasons. First, I live in Mississippi, which is among the reddest of the red states. Second, the attorneys—let me call them gun-phobic—were proposing to violate the attorney-client privilege, which establishes one of the most sacrosanct confidential relationships. (American Bar Association “Rule of Professional Conduct” 1.6). As with most things, there are exceptions. They generally pertain to a client who is about to commit a criminal act or engage in fraudulent behavior.

The lawyers who proposed to call the police cited ABA Rule 1.6 (b)(1). It states “[a] lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary: … to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm.”

I have no problem with the rule, if there is reliable evidence to believe a client is about to kill or injure someone. The question is whether there is sufficient reliable evidence to justify firing a client and reporting him to the police—a serious decision with significant consequences.

Evidence is facts, not conjecture, speculation, or supposition. The only fact addressed by attorneys who advocated reporting the client to police was the lawfully issued gun permits. It did not matter that he lawfully owned a firearm, or had a firearm permit, including an enhanced carry permit. He had met significant background and training criteria. He does not have anything in his background that would prevent him from owning a firearm or possessing a permit, including a history of criminal activity, violence, or mental illness.

Gun-phobic attorneys focused on the fact the client owned a gun and had firearm permits. In their opinion, that was enough to label him as reasonably certain to cause death or serious bodily harm and report him to the police.

No one claimed there was anything legally improper about being upset with a former employer. Hiring a lawyer to file a lawsuit is a pretty good indicator of being upset. It is what you would expect from a law-abiding citizen, not a dangerous person. The gun-phobic attorneys acknowledged, in response to a question by the instructor, that displaying non-threatening signs in a public area is lawful, and is likely protected by the First Amendment.

Here’s what I found truly amazing. We are attorneys! We take evidence seriously. We study evidence in law school. Knowledge of evidence is tested on bar examinations. We would be appalled at the thought that a judge might permit our clients to be jailed based on conjecture.

If gun-phobic attorneys like this have their way, there may be truly terrifying consequences. They would punish an American citizen who had done absolutely nothing wrong. Because the lawyer claims his client is reasonably certain to cause death or serious bodily harm, the police would have little choice but to take action, up to and including arrest.

A lawyer’s claim that his client is dangerous is substantially identical to the judicial standard for psychiatric detention. Under these circumstances, the client might be held for a mental evaluation. Even if ultimately cleared, this citizen would be publicly (and permanently on the internet) labeled as “dangerous.”

The adverse consequences have just begun. After being fired by an attorney, reported to the police as likely to injure or kill, arrested and held for psychiatric evaluation, what would happen to the client’s lawsuit? He would face the almost insurmountable burden of finding a new lawyer. How many attorneys would accept a case where a client has been fired by his previous attorney and arrested based on his attorney’s opinion that he is dangerous?

Congress may pass laws to limit our ability to possess firearms. Courts may interpret existing laws to limit our ability to possess firearms. They are obvious threats. What we don’t expect is the insidious, hidden threat from an attorney who does not believe in our Second Amendment rights and who takes action on the belief that he needs to protect the public from us.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/02/ethics-seminar-lawyers-say-theyd-report-client-legally-owning-gun/,2019-05-02
Co. Students Walk Out Of School Shooting Vigil After It Turns Political,"Colorado students walked out of an event billed as a vigil for Kendrick Castillo, an 18-year-old killed in a shooting at his school on Tuesday, when prominent speakers attempted to turn it into a rally for gun control. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colorado) and Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colorado) each took a turn calling for gun control at the Douglas County event before students streamed out in protest.

Two students at STEM Highlands Ranch, a K-12 charter school focused on science, technology, engineering, and math, shot nine students, one fatally. The accused students, who were arrested, are an adult male and a juvenile female who identifies as male. The accused male had written anti-Christian social media messages. He drove a car with a pentagram spray-painted on the hood, as well as other graffiti:

In response to the shooting, a public vigil was announced at another local public high school: Highlands Ranch High School. It was sponsored by the gun control groups Brady’s Team Enough and March for Our Lives and featured Democratic politicians who seek limits on Second Amendment gun rights, but was billed instead as an event to remember and honor Castillo and other victims. As the politicians called for gun control, students left in protest over the politicization of the deaths and injuries.

Bennet, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president and is pictured in the tweet below, said, “We live in a great country, but we need to fix these broken gun laws.”

Students then returned to the gymnasium, taking over the event, complaining about adults politicizing what they hoped would be a remembrance of their friend Castillo, a young man with an interest in robotics who had heroically rushed a shooter. Students also gave Bennet a piece of their mind, telling him to focus on “mental health” issues.

6 Gun Lies (And One Truth) Obama Told In Brazil,"On May 30, former president Barack Obama was a keynote speaker at an event in Brazil. The event, VTEX Day, is billed as “the largest digital innovation event in Latin America.”

During a conversation with a host on stage during the digital innovation event, Obama took the opportunity to speak negatively about U.S. gun laws. He said, “Our gun laws in the United States don’t make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon, any time, without much, if any, regulation. They can buy [guns] over the internet, they can buy machine guns.”

His statement to a foreign audience includes six lies about our gun laws and one truth. Let’s start out on a positive note and cover the one true statement first.

‘Gun laws in the United States don’t make much sense.’

On this, Obama and I agree. I doubt, however, that we share the same reasoning.

Firearms in the United States are regulated by myriad, and often nonsensical or conflicting, laws and regulations. Here are just a couple examples of our absurd gun laws:

If a plastic foregrip is added to an AR-15 pistol, without federal paperwork approved, taxes paid, engravings made, and months of wait-time, it is an illegal firearm. However, an AR-15 rifle with the exact same operating mechanism and cartridge fired may have the same foregrip added without consequence.

A handgun with a rifled barrel (twisting grooves for bullet spin) that fires a shotgun shell is a standard firearm. However, the same handgun with a smooth barrel is a highly regulated firearm.

A semi-auto shotgun made in America may hold more than five shotgun shells. However, if the same shotgun were imported, it may not.

Well, that was easy—we’ve covered all of Obama’s true statements. Now let’s tackle the lies.

1. Anybody Can Buy a Firearm

False. There are three major federal restrictions on who may purchase firearms in the United States (not including the many state and local restrictions).

The first category of persons who may not purchase firearms under federal law is based on age. Persons under 21 years of age may not purchase handguns from a gun dealer, and persons under 18 years of age may not purchase rifles nor shotguns.

The second category of persons who may not purchase firearms under federal law are referred to as “prohibited persons.” This category includes, among others:

Felons,

Those convicted of domestic violence,

Unlawful users of controlled substances,

Illegal aliens,

Those subject to certain restraining orders,

Those adjudicated as mental defectives or committed to mental institutions,

Fugitives, and

Veterans with dishonorable discharges

The third major category includes non-U.S. citizens.

Additionally, various state and local laws prohibit persons from purchasing firearms unless a special permit or license is issued by that state. For example, Massachusetts requires the possession of a valid Firearm Owner Identification Card for any person to purchase a firearm.

2. Any Firearm Can Be Purchased

False. Under federal law, machine guns made after 1986 may not be purchased by civilians (more on this under lie No. 5 below). Also, the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) regulates other firearms which may be purchased, but clearly not in the way insinuated by Obama’s comments (more on this under lie No. 3 below).

Various state and local laws prohibit entire categories of firearms from being purchased, either by their features or by name. For example, AR-15-style rifles may not be purchased in Connecticut and any firearm not on a specified list (most models of handguns introduced in the past few years) may not be purchased in California.

3. A Firearm Can Be Purchased at Any Time

False. When purchasing a firearm from a federally licensed gun dealer (FFL), background-check requirements must be satisfied. In most cases, this includes a background check being run through the federal National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). However, many states use their own background check system.

If a background check is required (all sales except for some states that exempt concealed weapon permit holders), then a firearm may only be purchased during the hours of operation of the relevant background check system.

Federal background checks may only be run between 8 a.m. and 1 a.m. Eastern and some state systems, like Tennessee for example, operate between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. Central.

Within the statement that a firearm can be purchased at any time is also the inference that a firearm may be purchased anywhere. This is also false. For example, handguns many only be purchased in a person’s state of residence. Therefore, if a person wants to purchase a handgun while he out of his home state, that is a time at which he is not permitted to purchase a firearm.

For the class of firearms covered by the NFA, such as short-barreled rifles, a purchaser must wait until certain paperwork is approved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). This wait time is often up to 10 months. Clearly this is a restriction on the time at which certain firearms may be purchased and possessed.

Additionally, some states have mandatory waiting periods before certain purchases.

4. Firearms Can Be Purchased with Few Regulations

False. If you’ve been paying attention so far, the United States has many regulations on the purchase and possession of firearms.

5. Firearms Can Be Purchased Over the Internet

False (well, at least in the way the comment was likely meant). It seems clear that Obama wants people to think that a gun can be purchased online and shipped straight to a purchaser’s home like any other online purchase. This is not true.

It is technically true that firearms may be purchased online. However, when a person purchases a firearm online from an out-of-state retailer, the firearm must first be shipped to a local FFL, where the purchaser must appear in person to fill out the federally required paperwork and satisfy the background check requirements.

Therefore, although it is true that the payment may be made online, the firearm may not be purchased over the internet like any other unregulated product.

6. Anyone Can Purchase a Machine Gun

False. First, see lie No. 2 above. “Anyone” may not purchase a firearm, let alone a machine gun.

Second, machine guns made after 1986 may not be purchased nor possessed by an ordinary civilian. These machine guns may only be purchased or possessed by FFLs or government entities.

Machine guns made before 1986 are still NFA firearms and may only be purchased after the extensive paperwork and wait times that accompany all NFA firearm purchases. Additionally, some local laws outright ban the possession of any machine guns.

If politicians want us to take them seriously in discussions about our firearm laws, they need to stop lying about these laws. Misrepresenting firearms laws does nothing to help reduce gun violence.

In fact, the enforcement, or in many cases like gun-free zones, reducing our current laws is what we need. Any call for more gun control is an admission that gun control doesn’t work.

Virginia Governor Exploits Virginia Beach Tragedy To Attempt Gun Control,"Virginia’s Gov. Ralph Northam is calling for a special session of the state’s legislature to consider gun control measures following the tragic murder of 12 in Virginia Beach last week.

The scandal-plagued governor is pressing for gun control measures he pursued earlier in the legislative session, but were defeated by the narrowly held Republican majority. Northam is seeking a ban on standard-capacity magazines, modern sporting rifles, and suppressors, plus extreme-risk protection orders, mandatory home storage laws, and other measures.

Northam was flanked by Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and Attorney General Mark Herring. All of them are slowly emerging from their own scandals without being held accountable. Northam confessed to appearing in blackface after a photo emerged in his medical school yearbook, but later tried to deny it was him. Fairfax is accused of two separate sexual assaults and Herring also confessed to wearing blackface while at college.

Each has resisted calls to resign from office. The trio is now standing together to call for more gun control. In fact, it was the first time the three appeared in public together since their scandals arose.

Northam is attempting to claim the moral high ground, leaning on his days as an Army physician and his understanding of the damage a gunshot wound inflicts. The murderer in this incident, though, used handguns, not so-called “assault rifles.” Even Centers for Disease Control studies following the expiration of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, that also banned standard-capacity magazines, showed the bans did not reduce crime.

The murderer legally purchased the two handguns used in his crimes, passing the background checks Northam would impose to criminalize private sales. That includes the expanded background checks imposed for the purchase of a firearms suppressor.

Police noted nothing discovered in the investigation to date showed the murderer was posing a threat. Even the mainstream media that is sympathetic to gun control causes noted that suppressor possession in larger cities in Virginia, including Virginia Beach, is illegal.

Further, firearms suppressors don’t eliminate the sound of gunfire. They only reduce it to a point where instant and permanent hearing damage still occurs. The sound is equivalent to that of a jackhammer. Virginia Beach’s Police Chief James Cervera said, “I don’t think most of that would have mattered in this case.”

That’s what the leaders of Virginia’s legislature are saying too. Virginia’s Speaker of the House of Delegates Kirk Cox said Northam’s call for a special session was “hasty and suspect,” adding that any special session would focus on crime instead of criminalizing law-abiding gun ownership. Cox would focus his attention on mandatory minimum sentencing for crimes committed with firearms and behavioral and mental health reforms.

“The governor’s call to special session is more likely to inflame political tensions than produce substantive public policy changes that will keep people safe,” he said.

Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. “Tommy” Norment added that the session was being called without a specific legislative agenda that wasn’t already considered. He added he expects the assembly to address the magazine capacity issue, noting that nothing new is being offered.

“Nothing would have helped us in Virginia Beach,” Norment told a crowd of protestors this week. “I think there are some things we can address” on gun violence, he said, but he didn’t throw his support behind Northam’s gun control agenda.

Northam isn’t offering solutions that would have prevented this tragedy. Sadly, he is just exploiting a tragedy to score cheap political points ahead of the state elections this fall.

‘Gun-Free Zone’ Policy Stopped Virginia Beach Victim From Carrying Her Gun To Work,"The night before 12 people were killed in Virginia Beach on May 31, one victim, Kate Nixon, told her husband she wanted to carry a gun to work because she feared her would-be attacker, but decided against it because of the city’s no-gun policy, according to the family’s lawyer.

The next day, the shooter, who had worked as a city public utilities engineer for nine years, fired at his defenseless colleagues in the city’s Municipal Center.

“Kate expressed to her husband concerns about this individual in particular as well as one other person,” the Nixon family attorney, Kevin Martingayle, told host Cathy Lewis. “In fact, they had a discussion the night before about whether or not she should take a pistol and hide it in her handbag and decided not to, ultimately, because there is a policy, apparently, against having any kind of weapons that are concealed in these buildings.”

“But they were so concerned they had that conversation,” Lewis said.

“The night before it happened, they had that discussion,” Martingayle said. “So, there was obviously something big going on. I don’t know all the ins and outs of that and I don’t know that Kate ever expressed, even to her husband, the full range of what her concerns were.”

Jason Nixon, the victim’s husband, and his attorney have asked the city to release all records about the gunman. According to The New York Times, the shooter had been previously involved in physical “scuffles” at work, and disciplinary measures had been taken.

The city of Virginia Beach enforces a “gun-free zone” policy on all city properties, even if the employee is licensed to carry a concealed weapon. “Employees who violate this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including dismissal,” the city policy states.

With everyone on site disarmed by this policy, the shooter had no opposition and was able to gun down defenseless victims until police were able to force their way into the building.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/14/gun-free-zone-policy-stopped-virginia-beach-victim-from-carrying-her-gun-to-work/,2019-06-14
Cops Shouldn’t React Harshly To Moms Who Won't Put Down Their Babies,"Citizen footage starting in the middle of an interaction between a police officer pointing a gun into a car with a pregnant woman, her one- and four-year-old children, and their father inside has gone viral. The Phoenix Police Department is now facing a $10 million lawsuit due to the incident, which happened late last month. Last Thursday, a notice of claim was filed alleging “police brutality and civil rights violations,” azfamily.com reported.

The father of the children, Dravon Ames, was in the driver’s seat when the police confrontation allegedly began, some time after the family had left a dollar store with a shoplifted Barbie doll. According to the family, five to 10 minutes had passed before the filming started. You can watch the most complete footage I have found here (warning: it is full of expletives and may be difficult to watch for sensitive viewers).

An officer can be clearly seen pointing a gun into the car for at least 30 continuous seconds and shouting profanity-laced commands at the couple. The mother, Iesha Harper, can be heard pleading with the officer not to point a gun at her kids and telling them she’s pregnant.

Once outside the car, an officer rushes up to her and points an index finger in her face, shouting, “When I tell you to put your hands up, you put your f-cking hands up.”

“I couldn’t put my hands up. I had a f-cking baby!” she cries. “What the f-ck are you talking about?”

Harper is ordered to set her child down; she jerks away as the police officer attempts to grab her by the arm. As the confrontation escalates, Harper changes position, putting more of her body in between the officers and the baby on her hip. One of the officers demands again, “Put the child down,” to which Harper screams, “She don’t walk! She’s a baby!”

Previous debates over escalated police encounters have centered on citizen compliance and an officer’s “reasonable belief” that the citizen may be a physical threat to the officer or others. “Reasonable belief” has been cited in cases where a subject reaches out of view, such as toward the small of his back, or into his pocket, or rapidly pulls out something that may resemble a weapon at first glimpse.

In 2016, Daniel Shaver was shot dead in Mesa Arizona while attempting to comply with a series of very specific commands from an officer. He had reached back, presumably to pull his shorts up, while slowly crawling toward the officer at his command. That officer was acquitted, to the outrage of people across the political spectrum.

Although no one was shot in the Ames-Harper incident, it calls into question the idea that any delay or brief lapse in compliance lies somewhere on the spectrum between resisting arrest to evincing a threat. An officer training a gun on a pregnant woman and her small children sheds a bright light on the lack of nuance in “compliance/non-compliance” doctrine that we might miss in confrontations between adult males.

Ames’s behavior should of course be examined to discern whether Harper’s treatment was largely a byproduct of a reasonable response to Ames’s resistance or threatening behavior. According to reporting by azfamily.com, the police report states the officer “drew his gun because Ames ‘began to reach towards the center of the vehicle between the front seats.’” No weapon was reported at the scene, however, and neither adult was charged with resisting arrest.

Would a “reasonable and prudent” officer in that position draw a gun and threaten to “put a f-cking cap right in your f-cking head” for a reason as vague as “reaching toward the center of the vehicle?” And if that standard were applied to anyone pulled over for a potential petty crime, how many drivers would end up shot?

Yet what appears, based on the partial footage currently available, to be highly unreasonable behavior doesn’t end there. The other officer continued to point a gun into a car with a pregnant mother and children in it even after Ames had exited the vehicle and was well under officer control. Is being “loud, verbally abusive, and refusing” to put hands up and exit the vehicle, as Harper’s behavior was described in the police report, an excuse to point a gun and scream profanities at her?

If the audio of Harper’s voice is to be believed, she was holding, or holding onto, at least one child at the time. Holding onto your child, as a mother, is not the same as holding onto a briefcase or a bowling ball. Mothers like myself know that when you feel your baby’s safety is being threatened, as by all the available evidence it was in Harpers’ case, you do not let go.

This may not seem “logical” to those who are not mothers or who have only had peaceful, trusting encounters with law enforcement. Why can’t she just obey? How hard is that?

But a reasonable response for a mother at gunpoint, with the adrenaline pumping through her system, who is intensely focused on the safety of her two born children and one just five months along, is far different. It could be very close to physically impossible for her to release her grip on her baby in such a circumstance, no matter how many times “an officer in uniform” demands she separate herself from the most precious life in the world to her.

From my perspective as a pregnant mother with a toddler, Harper did everything a reasonable mother would do, from holding onto her baby like her tiny life depended on it, to begging the officer not to point the gun at her children. It shouldn’t matter that she was “loud” and that her responses were laced with profanity (and to no greater extent than the officers who were commanding her).

According to the Phoenix Police Department Operations Manual:

A. It is the policy of the Department to use a reasonable amount of force to conduct lawful public safety activities. B. The response option employed will be reasonable and based on the totality of circumstances… (2) Circumstances that may govern the reasonableness of using a particular force option include, but are not limited to: The severity of the crime Whether the subject poses an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others Whether the subject is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight” (emphasis mine).

If police responses are “determined by the totality of the circumstances,” then a pregnant woman holding a baby, having just come from the Dollar Store, shouldn’t be considered a threat. The Venn diagram between mothers who shoplift (or allow their child to shoplift) $5 dolls and people who assault police officers is not huge. In addition, her form-fitting dress didn’t leave much, if any, room to conceal a weapon between herself and her baby (as if that were even a plausibility).

Even if one views Ames’s delay in compliance as resistance, the “threat” assumed after he “reached toward the center of the vehicle” should have passed when Ames was removed from the vehicle and under officer control. Yet Harper was still at gunpoint while Ames’s legs were being kicked apart several yards away. They proceeded to aggressively demand she put her baby down and attempted to restrain her, even once she was out of the car and clearly visible as a non-threat.

If we are to place such a great benefit of the doubt with officers as to what is a “reasonable” response, maybe we should consider what is a reasonable response from the citizen they’re interacting with. Shaver was shot dead after briefly reaching toward his haunches, despite every indication, over minutes, that he was trying his best to obey the officer. Harper was verbally abused and threatened for doing what any mother would have done when put at gunpoint by a man who had just been screaming at the top of his voice that her partner in the drivers’ seat would “f-cking get shot.”

The police uniform does not automatically bestow an officer with the full confidence of the residents he or she is policing, especially for demographics that have historically been subject to harsher standards and more suspicion than the rest of the population. To insist the uniform itself should elicit such faith and trust, to the point of overriding even the most basic maternal and self-preservation instincts, is not just wishful thinking, but dangerous.

It’s a marvel no one got shot on that afternoon in late May. A cop’s actions in the moment convey much more meaning than the badge on his vest, and the more seriously law enforcement take that, the safer and more constructive their interactions with the community will be.

Democrats Move Further Left On Gun-Grabbing In 2020 Debate,"Democratic candidates collectively came out for more gun control in the first debates of the 2020 election cycle, seemingly trying to one-up each other with stricter gun-grabbing policy proposals.

Thanks to gun control activists centered around mass shootings, like March For Our Lives, even candidates who previously held conservative or moderate positions on Second Amendment rights—like Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, and Kirsten Gillibrand—seemed to be pulled left as they unveiled their new gun control talking points.

Vice President Joe Biden proposed banning the sale of any firearm that does not feature biometric locks, which are often referred to as “smart guns.”

“We should have smart guns,” he said in Thursday night’s debate. “No gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger. It’s within our right to do that. We can do that. Our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA.”

There are no guns with said biometric locks currently for sale on the American market. Biden’s policy would effectively outlaw the sale of every firearm currently available in U.S. stores.

California Congressman Eric Swalwell, who has previously threatened to nuke Americans who don’t want to turn their guns over to the government, advocated for his proposal for a mandatory national ban and buyback of “military-style semiautomatic assault weapons.” That would mean confiscating over 15 million guns.

“Keep your pistols, keep your rifles, keep your shotguns, but we can take the most dangerous weapons from the most dangerous people,” Swalwell said.

Senator Kamala Harris said Swalwell’s idea was “great,” but threatened to take executive action on gun control because Congress lacks “the courage to act.”

“I will give the United States Congress 100 days to pull their act together, bring all these good ideas together and put a bill on my desk for signature,” she said. “And if they do not, I will take executive action, and I will put in place the most comprehensive background check policy we’ve had.”

Senator Bernie Sanders was hit on his gun control record in the 2016 Democratic primaries from opponents Hillary Clinton and Martin O’Malley, as Vox reported.

“Hillary Clinton and Martin O’Malley attacked Sanders’s past votes against a bill in 1993 that established national background checks and for a bill in 2003 and 2005 that protects gun companies from lawsuits if their products are used in crimes. Sanders, an independent from rural and gun-friendly Vermont, defended the virtues of moderation on this issue — arguing, “We need a sensible debate about gun control which overcomes the cultural divide that exists in this country, and I think I can play an important role in this.”

Since then, and likely in anticipation of 2020, Sanders has upped his efforts to come out for stricter gun laws including co-sponsoring recent bills in the Senate on gun violence. On Thursday night, Sanders said the United States is experiencing “a gun crisis,” and called for universal background checks. He added that he would “ban the sale and distribution” of assault weapons, saying they are weapons for the military.

Swalwell attacked Sanders, pressing him to answer whether he would buy guns back, the Vermont Senator said, “If the government wants to do that, if the people want to bring them back, yes.”

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand often brags that she is able to win over voters in red districts, citing that she obtained highest vote threshold of 72 percent in the state of New York. When she first entered politics 14 years ago, she had an A+ rating from the NRA, but her position on the Second Amendment has dramatically shifted since.

Senator Cory Booker touted his plan to require a license to buy and own a firearm, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a veteran of the Afghanistan war, relied on his experience to inform voters, “that there are weapons that have absolutely no place in American cities or neighborhoods in peacetime. Ever.”

Of course, these policy positions did not evolve spontaneously. Candidates are responding to the issues Democratic voters say they care about. A Morning Consult poll of what debate topics voters wanted to hear about found that 62 percent of voters said gun policy was “very important.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/28/democrats-move-left-gun-grabbing-2020-debates/,2019-06-28
Virginia Gov Admits Gun Control Wouldn’t Have Prevented Shootings,"Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam admitted his much-ballyhooed call for a special legislative session isn’t about contributing to public safety. For him, it’s about scoring cheap political points, attempting to emerge from his own scandals and pushing an extreme gun control agenda Virginians have rejected time and again, including this legislative session in Richmond.

Northam confessed to 762 high school seniors visiting Radford University that none of his gun control proposals would have prevented the tragic murders in Virginia Beach. Instead, he peddled half-truths, tired rhetoric, and misallocated blame upon millions of law-abiding Virginians.

Northam pitched his gun control agenda to a mock legislative assembly of high schoolers. Interestingly, they showed more intellectual curiosity and interest in real solutions that reflect Virginia’s values over embracing the far-left’s agenda of disarming Americans. The inquisitive students asked the governor how any of the governor’s ideas would have stopped the murderer. His answer was less-than-placating. For him, it’s about the “bigger picture.”

Northam’s vision is to criminalize the private transfer of firearms from one individual to another; limit gun sales to once per month; banning modern sporting rifles, suppressors, and standard-capacity magazines; subjecting victims of firearms theft to criminal charges if they fail to report the crime against them; and expanding “gun-free zones” like Virginia Beach’s city public works building where a shooting took place when an employee ignored the no-gun policy and murdered his co-workers.

Northam touts his gun control agenda with language that sounds meaningful but in reality it will do nothing to contribute to public safety. The governor is demanding universal background checks but refuses to acknowledge that the Virginia Beach murderer twice passed federally required criminal background checks for the two handguns he purchased.

The governor also ignores that the murderer didn’t commit his criminal acts with an AR-15, or modern sporting rifle. Still, he demands the General Assembly give him authority to ban the most-popular-selling rifle in America today in the Old Dominion.

Northam attempted to lecture these students who had the audacity to question his agenda, rhetorically asking why the murderer chose to use a suppressor. He didn’t allow that one of the handguns didn’t have a suppressor, that police clearly heard the gunfire or that suppressors don’t “silence” a firearm. It just reduces the report to a level equal to that of a jackhammer so it doesn’t cause permanent and instant hearing loss.

He also refused to recognize that from 1995-2005, less than 0.1 percent of homicides prosecuted in federal court, an infinitesimally low 0.00006 percent of felonies in California, and a mere 0.1 percent of armed robberies involved a suppressor. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives noted in an unpublished 2017 white paper that an average of just 44 cases involving suppressors per year over a 10-year period were recommended for prosecution. In fact, many of the European countries which Northam looks to as an example of strict gun laws require suppressor use, and they are available over the counter in hardware stores.

Northam isn’t alone in forcing draconian gun control laws on Virginians. He’s been joined by billionaire and liberal cause-du-jour Tom Steyer, a new Democratic presidential candidate who is most notable for pouring millions of dollars towards trying to get President Trump impeached. Now, he’s pouring millions into Virginia to change the General Assembly to enact this grab at Second Amendment rights.

Northam isn’t out of options. If he truly cares about making a difference and keeping firearms out of the hands of those who should never posses them, he can look to the example of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Instead of infringing upon law-abiding gun owners’ rights, Abbott invested a $1 million grant to the firearms-industry’s Project Childsafe to provide free gun safety kits with gun locks to prevent the unauthorized access and misuse of firearms.

This is just one of the real solutions for safer communities championed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, including ensuring all disqualifying mental health records are submitted to the FBI’s NICS database, as well as working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to bring criminals responsible for the robberies and burglaries of firearms retailers to justice through matching reward offers, and partnering with the largest suicide prevention group and the Department of Veterans Affairs to reduce and eliminate suicide by firearms.

These are proposals that save lives. Northam’s special session is only about attempting to save his bankrupt reputation.

Women From All 50 States Gather In D.C. To Advocate For Gun Rights,"Women from across the country, representing all 50 states, traveled to the nation’s capital last Monday to spend the week meeting with legislators to discuss firearms, self-defense, and cumbersome gun control laws.

The initiative, known as The DC Project, is a nonpartisan, grassroots movement that organizes women to share with lawmakers why they choose to own and carry firearms. Ages ranged from 11 to 76, and included students, moms, competitive shooters, and victims of assault.

After several days packed with meetings, the week culminated with a rally on the West Capitol Lawn on Friday where speakers shared testimonies and discussed the rising demographic of female gun ownership.

The DC Project Indiana Delegate Beth Walker, a 17-year-old student and competitive shooter, spoke about how severe concussions prevented her from participating in traditional sports. Competitive shooting provided a non-contact, detail-oriented sport for her to participate in.

Shayna Lopez-Rivas, the Florida delegate, spoke about the night she was raped on her college campus, and how she decided she would never be a defenseless victim again. After her attack, she went with a friend to shoot for the first time.

“I fired her GLOCK 17, and in the moment I fired it, I knew if I had that gun on that life-altering night, I would not have been raped,” she said.

“The man who raped me was bigger, stronger, and faster than I was. And he always will be based solely on our genders. But with my carry gun those factors don’t matter. You don’t have to big or strong or fast to defend yourself with a firearm.”

Dianna Muller, a champion competitive shooter, former police officer, and founder of the DC Project, said the women had positive meetings with both Democratic and Republican members.

Walker wrote on Facebook that their meetings were impactful and they were met with eager questions from members and staffers.

“Sometimes it’s not about swaying a person’s entire position on an issue, but sparking questions and realizations that there may be things that they have never even considered,” Walker wrote. “Thankful to have a team with me that truly believes and advocates for the Second Amendment. We all come from different backgrounds, but we find commonalities in our dedication to preserve our essential liberties.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/15/women-50-states-gather-dc-advocate-gun-rights/,2019-07-15
What Happened When NZ Paid People While Confiscating Their Guns,"New Zealand’s government wants you to know that their first pass at gun confiscation was a great success, but a look at the facts may tell you otherwise. Exactly how these measures succeed or fail in New Zealand will illustrate the problem with the gun control plans of politicians both there and in the United States. It also signals that the gentle words of gun controllers must inevitably yield to more aggressive measures if they are to get their way.

The law in New Zealand, passed quickly and nearly unanimously following a domestic terrorist’s murder of 51 Muslim worshipers at a mosque earlier this year, included provisions for “buybacks” of semi-automatic rifles and certain shotguns. Owners of those weapons will have several opportunities to sell their weapons to the government over the course of the year.

There is a major catch: you have to take the price the government offers you. If you don’t agree to that price, you’re now a criminal, facing up to five years in prison.

A free market, it isn’t. It’s also starting to show the strains of its logical inconsistencies before the mandatory purchase plan even gets off the ground. Americans—including many Democratic presidential candidates—who favor a similar (unconstitutional) plan should watch and learn as the New Zealanders try to fulfill the gun-grabbers’ dream and, inevitably fall short.

The Price Is Wrong

New Zealand’s parliament set aside NZ $200 million—about 134 million American dollars—to buy weapons. (The phrase “buyback” is often used here and in New Zealand, but unless you bought your gun from the government, it doesn’t make any sense.) There are thought to be about 14,000 soon-to-be-illegal guns in the country, but as New Zealand’s largest newspaper, The Herald, reported just 224 were handed in at this weekend’s event, along with 217 items categorized as “parts and accessories.”

There are more grab-a-thon events planned, and more guns will find their way into the government’s hands and then into the hydraulic press being used to crush them. But already gun owners are raising legitimate complaints at being shortchanged. According to the law, gun owners are to receive anywhere from 25 to 95 percent of the pre-tax purchase price of a new gun—the exact fraction depends on the gun’s condition.

That downgrade according to condition is part of the problem. For an antique gun collector, whether a rifle looks beat up and old is a part of the value, but for an ordinary gun-owner looking to buy a firearm for protection or hunting, the appearance is irrelevant. One thing people love about a weapon like the AR-15 is that it is durable, and continues to function well after years of dents and scratches to non-essential parts of the weapon.

Reducing the price of a well-worn but functional weapon presents a real disincentive to comply with the law. Even people who might consider it could hold out in hopes of a better deal from the government. A look at a true market like the one in the United States might show the government officials what a fair price would look like but even then, specially modified guns might be sufficiently unique as to defy estimation.

Not that it matters for the government—with the force of law behind them, if you disagree it’s just too bad for you. And what happens when the tractable few have submitted to the government and only the non-compliant remain armed? Seizing arms from armed men is a deadly idea that could have truly awful consequences for all involved.

Gun Suppression Leads to Gun Hiding

The estimate of 14,000 now-banned guns is just that: an estimate. Like the United States, New Zealand does not have a registry for rifles and shotguns. Neither country has a good idea of how many guns it has, let alone how many are about to become illegal. So not only have few gun owners submitted to the process in New Zealand, but the number of guns outstanding could actually be much higher.

Registries might not violate the right to bear arms, but they have long been seen as the first step on the road to doing so. New Zealand shows us why: without a registry, the government is going to have a difficult time confiscating all of the semi-automatic rifles and pump-action shotguns it banned in the new law. As New Zealand’s Police Association President Chris Cahill told The Herald in May, “We really have no idea how many of these firearms are out there in New Zealand.”

For a counter-example, we can look to the deteriorating situation in Venezuela. That country never had the strong tradition of citizens bearing arms the way the United States, New Zealand, and other countries settled by Englishmen did. After the election of socialist Hugo Chávez, they gradually rolled back even more of the people’s rights in that area. José Niño described the course of events earlier this year:

In 2002, the Venezuelan government passed the first version of the Control of Arms, Munitions and Disarmament Law, reinforcing the state’s iron grip on firearms in Venezuela. A decade later, the law was modified to enhance the scope of gun control and gave the Venezuelan Armed Forces exclusive power to control, register, and potentially confiscate firearms. Under the banner of fighting crime, Venezuela implemented a ban on the sale of firearms and ammo in 2012. Like other gun bans, this proved futile in fighting crime. According to the Venezuelan Violence Observatory’s statistics, Venezuela’s murder rate increased from 73 murders per 100,000 people in 2012 to 91.8 murders per 100,000 people in 2016.

They were able to disarm the people so easily because the government had a record of every gun in the country. When we think about other fundamental rights, we would never agree to that level of state scrutiny.

Imagine if the government decreed a registry on printing presses (or their modern counterpart, the computer)? On copies of religious scriptures? We would all say, rightly, that the only reason to make a list is if you want to start crossing things off of it. Enumeration precedes confiscation. It is the same with guns.

Can It Happen Here?

Despite the enthusiasm among Democratic presidential candidates for New Zealand-style bans, we have a few more safeguards here than the rest of the world does. Our Second Amendment, and a Supreme Court willing to enforce it, limit the plans of politicians who yearn for a meek, disarmed populace. Even if Congress finds the will, the Constitution denies them a way.

But even as the disaster in Venezuela should be a warning to us on many things, the ineffectiveness of a ban in New Zealand should also caution gun-controllers against hubris in their plans to rewrite our Bill of Rights. Likewise, it should serve as a warning to law-abiding gun owners who don’t already know it: any presidential candidate’s call for a gun registry should be seen as what it is: the prelude to wholesale confiscation—willing or otherwise.

‘Top Gun’ Memoir Warns American Military Air Superiority Is In Danger,"In his engaging and succinct memoir Top Gun: An American Story, Topgun’s original commanding officer Dan Pedersen argues that “what matters is the man, not the machine,” and because of this truism, pilot training will always be far more important than the technology of jet fighters for winning battles in the sky. At present, says Pedersen, “Something is rotten in Washington, and one day, sadly, we will lose a war because of it.”

Pedersen claims that the Navy lacks relatively cheap fighter jets for training such as the old F-14 Tomcats (the “Top Gun” jets in the movie) and others. He cites a price tag for the new F-35 as $330 million per plane. The service can’t buy and maintain a large number of trainers at those prices, he says. As a consequence, much of fighter pilot training must be done on simulators, which, in Pedersen’s view, are an inadequate substitute for real flight time.

More ominously, Pedersen says the Navy has once again been beguiled by the siren song of technological triumphalism and has lost the will to properly instruct pilots in dogfighting techniques. This was precisely the situation during the early years of Vietnam, and it led to devastating American losses, and ultimately to the creation of Topgun, the U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School (the Navy spells it “Topgun,” without the space between words).

Unfortunately, claims Pedersen, bureaucratic rot and self-destructive rivalry and jealousy have set in in the years since the 1969 founding of that “graduate school for fighter pilots.” Pedersen suggests this is partly due to blowback from the 1986 movie Top Gun, and the lasting cultural cache it bestowed on the U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School as a result.

Topgun is no longer located at Naval Air Station Miramar (which is now owned by the Marines), but was moved inland in 1996 to Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada. Although Topgun still operates as an independent command, the school has been largely subsumed within the Navy’s Strike Warfare Center at NAS Fallon.

Failure in Vietnam

Pedersen first flew as a U.S. Navy fighter pilot in 1957. It was an era when the Sparrow and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles rose to dominance as the primary armament for a fighter jet. This was mostly a result of Cold War military doctrine and American military superiority in the air during the past decade.

The Navy fighter jet was reconceived as solely a missile-launching platform. The F-4 Phantom, the Navy’s primary carrier-based fighter during the era, didn’t even have a built-in gun. Combat would be over the horizon. The age of the fighter jock was over.

Of course, that’s not the way it worked out in Vietnam—at all. The Democratic Kennedy and Johnson administrations approached the Vietnam War as a political game. Serving under both presidents, delusional defense secretary Robert McNamara attempted to calibrate escalations and de-escalations of bombings with negotiation results, and put in place restrictive rules of engagement that followed no military logic.

We abandoned dogfight training because of the Navy’s faith in missile technology. Most of our aircrews didn’t know how to fight any other way. Yet our own rules of engagement kept us from using what we were taught. The rules of engagement specifically prohibited firing from beyond visual range. To shoot a missile at an aircraft, a fighter pilot first needed to visually confirm it was a MiG and not a friendly plane. . . . Yet three years along, the training squadron in California was still teaching long-range intercept tactics to the exclusion of everything else. Our training was not applicable to the air war in Vietnam.

In the first three years of the war, the Navy lost 532 aircraft in combat, with 644 aviators killed, missing, or taken as prisoners of war. A 1968 review led by Navy carrier captain Frank Ault recommended, among other changes, the creation of a program like Topgun.

Whiskey 291

Enter 33-year-old lieutenant commander Dan Pedersen. Pedersen was two grades below flag rank, but he was in the right place at the right time and, most importantly, possessed the right experience. For him this was no stepping-stone assignment, but a chance to correct a terrible mistake the Navy was making over and over again.

Pedersen had spent a great deal of the Vietnam War as a fighter pilot at Yankee Station, the Navy’s attack point off the coast of North Vietnam. There he witnessed many of his colleagues get shot down and die or become prisoners of war. He knew of more losses in the Air Force. Pedersen believed he had the solution. In fact, he’d had it since 1959.

In those days, any pilot who was in good with the senior chief in maintenance at an air station could check out a plane to get in extra practice. Pedersen and a small but dedicated group of other pilots used the privilege to fight each other in the air to sort out who was the best of the best. They did the sorting in a restricted airspace off San Diego near San Clemente Island called Whiskey 291.

“What happened in Whiskey 291 stayed in Whiskey 291, unless you met your opponent later and had the chance to talk over drinks,” says Pedersen. “There were no debriefs. No reports. No paper trail at all.”

Pilots from all branches of the service would converge. The first move was inevitably a game of chicken at insane speeds, followed by twisting and turning at near-maximum velocity. Fights were generally conducted without radio contact so no one could be identified and get in trouble.

You had to know the capabilities and limitations of your plane. You had to be good. The fights were over within a few minutes when one pilot or the other gained an advantage that would allow a kill-shot. Then the opposing pilot would wag his wings and both would fly back to their respective homes, often never to learn who the other pilot was.

Pedersen adapted this experience for the Topgun curriculum. A second element was the in-depth analysis of the capabilities of the F-4 Phantom. Pedersen recruited instructors who used the “murder board” method for developing their curriculum, mercilessly grilling one another as they worked through their proposed lectures. The technical minded spent days talking to F-4 engineers at McDonald Douglas to learn not only the Phantom’s official specs, but what its real tolerances and capabilities might be.

The result was the development of the signature Topgun “yo-yo” or “egg” maneuver. It was simple and effective. While MiGs had a shorter turning radius, the F-4 Phantom could climb vertically at a rate no MiG could match. Pedersen and his team determined that the best move when encountering a MiG was to go vertical like a rocket, thus avoiding the MiG’s cannon, then to take the plane into a controlled stall, flip the nose, and head back down seeking to get a good shot for the air-to-air missiles.

How did Pedersen and his instructors know these tactics would work? They tried them against real MiGs. Pedersen finagled access to two ultra-secret captured MiGs the Air Force kept in Area 51 in New Mexico. He and his instructors flew them, and flew against them, repeatedly. Later, as an amazing graduation present, the original Topgun class was clandestinely taken to Area 51, where they got to fight against the MiGs themselves.

Reestablishing U.S. Air Superiority

Navy pilots who completed Topgun and rejoined their unit slowly but surely began to win in real-life combat. By the end of the Vietnam War, the overall shoot-down ratio was 24-1 in America’s favor. Topgun trained pilots, and those to whom they passed on their knowledge, were perhaps the major factor in reestablishing U.S. air superiority.

With Topgun an unqualified success, Pedersen moved on to command an air wing on a carrier, then to captaining an oil resupply tanker, and finally to skippering the aircraft carrier USS Ranger. In 1982, however, his career hit a brick wall. Paul Trerice, a midshipman who had been frequently in and out of the Ranger’s brig, collapsed and died during a punitive run while on a Subic Bay layover. The young man had repeated behavior issues and trouble with drug addiction.

Still, Trerice’s father understandably demanded that the Navy get to the bottom of his son’s death. He called the media, and the matter blew up in newspapers nationwide. It is difficult for a contemporary reviewer to put what happened in the matter in perspective just by reading through archived newspaper stories. My gut feeling is that, while what happened to Trerice was tragic, it was not deliberate or even necessarily preventable, given the disciplinary demands of the Navy.

Furthermore, this was the era when President Reagan’s secretary of the Navy John Lehman was rebuilding a 600-ship Navy and once again challenging the Soviet Union on the seas. Given the liberal bent of the era’s journalists, the political toes that were being stepped on, and the constant attacks on Reagan and the Reagan presidency by the media at the time, it is not surprising that The New York Times was lying in wait for something like Trerice’s death to use as a bludgeon against Lehman and the Navy.

Pedersen was cleared of criminal wrong doing in Trerice’s death but was given a nonpunitive letter of caution on the matter. But the Navy’s political opponents had his name and a grudge to settle. When the promotion lists came up the next year, Pedersen was informed Senate opposition was too great, and he was never going to make admiral. In the Navy, it is up or out, so in 1983 Pedersen left the Navy after 29 years.

Man, Not the Machine

Pedersen describes his semi-forced retirement philosophically. After two failed marriages while in service, it allowed him to reconnect with his high school flame, and this led to a successful third marriage. It also allowed him to get closer with his grown children. But the lost time proved mostly impossible to regain.

One night I was aboard ship, ready to take my first ship command, when I got a phone call. Somehow my eight-year-old son had found my direct number. . . ‘Please, Dad. Come back… everyone else has a dad home with them. I don’t.’ . . . I have one regret in my twenty-nine-year career: It was brutal on my family.

The words are affecting because for the most part Pedersen avoids maudlin dwelling on his own psychological sacrifice. This is likely due to the ministrations of ghostwriter coauthor John R. Bruning, Jr., himself a capable military historian.

There is also a fascinating sidebar history of Pedersen’s Israeli pilot friends and Topgun trainees during the Yom Kippur War, and a moving recollection of airlifting thousands of Vietnamese boat people onto American ships after Vietnam was lost. There’s even a bit on the movie. Throughout, Pedersen sticks doggedly to his theme of explaining the purpose of the American jet fighter, and the American jet fighter pilot by telling his own story.

What matters is the man, not the machine. . . A good pilot should have a strong family background with a patriotic mindset and a self-starting work ethic. He should believe in something greater than himself while remaining self-reliant and confident without being overbearing. (Some ego is necessary—I wouldn’t want a soul filled with doubt flying my wing.) An athletic background helps, because when properly coached at the right age, youngsters learn trust, teamwork, and goal setting. They’ll need all those things in the air.

Pedersen speaks glowingly of the exploits of his compatriots and fellow instructors. His reticence to toot his own horn, however, while refreshing, leaves us to intuit how dangerous, cool, and legendary the personal exploits Pedersen recounts might have been viewed by others. Perhaps historians will one day fill in that portion of the story of the original Topgun.

‘Do Something!’ Is Not Going To Stop Mass Shooters,"Although mass shootings account for a fraction of gun deaths in America and gun homicides are at historic lows, the terroristic nature of these crimes make them especially traumatic and destructive. The murderers, predominately young white men and loners with hateful, but often confused, ideologies, can strike anywhere. And that puts them everywhere.

As much as people try to make sense of these events, to blame someone, these murderers have no real or tangible objectives other than death. Mass shootings aren’t Donald Trump’s fault any more than they are Elizabeth Warren’s, despite the efforts of many in our parasitic political class to turn every drop of American blood into more votes.

But no matter what trend is responsible, no matter what the shooter’s manifestos state, no matter how they got their weapons, gun controllers will attempt to shame Republicans into “doing something”—or, rather, anything gun controllers demand.

When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi claims Republican inaction “dishonors our solemn duty to protect innocent men, women and children and end this epidemic once and for all,” she is misleading the American people. She has no plan to protect innocent men, women, and children. She has a hashtag to placate them.

These days, #DoSomething entails two proposals that would do nothing to mitigate gun homicides: “universal background checks” and a ban of “assault weapons.”

President Donald Trump wants “strong background checks.” Sen. Pat Toomey wants to pass his old bill to “expand background checks to all commercial firearm sales.” Democrats have already passed a bill doing just that in the House.

As far as we know, neither the El Paso nor the Dayton gunman would have been stopped from purchasing a weapon by an “expanded” background check or any kind of background checks that didn’t have a pre-crime component. Neither shooter had a criminal record. In fact, I can’t find any recent mass shootings that would have been prevented by instituting a universal background check.

Well, that’s not exactly right. The Sutherland Springs church shooter, having been convicted of assaulting his then-wife and stepson, should not have had a gun, but the FBI blew it. The racist Charleston church shooter should have been stopped by a background check, but his narcotics conviction never reached the FBI. Similarly, the Virginia Tech killer bought guns after a court had found him to danger to himself, but the information was never passed on to the federal background-check database.

Perhaps we should have a conversation about tightening up the system that’s already in place before we start passing new laws.

Pelosi, and others, get away with these kinds of statements because, judging from social media reaction, many Americans are under the impression that a criminal can walk into a gun show or a private residence and purchase a military-grade weapon with his library card.

It’s a myth. Every person who buys a firearm from a gun-show dealer must pass a background check. A small fraction of legal weapons are sold from one individual to another — a friend, a family member etc. And almost all of those guns (other than ones bought before 1998) were purchased through a background check.

Straw purchases are also already illegal. If you want to make them extra special illegal, go for it. But you’re not “doing something.”

Then there is the matter of banning semiautomatic rifles. Many gun controllers want to prohibit the scary-looking rifles that these psychopaths prefer.

“I grew up in Montana, attended hunter’s safety class, hunted with my dad, had multiple rifles in our house,” tweeted Michael McFaul. “No one in my family defends the idea that Americans have the need or right to buy military assault guns, capable of killing 9 people in 30 seconds. #Enough. #DoSomething.”

Notwithstanding the fact that McFaul apparently doesn’t understand the Second Amendment, Americans can’t buy “military assault guns”—and no amount of repeating this phrase will change that reality.

Semiautomatic rifles are not “military assault guns” or “weapons of war” or even “assault weapons.” The distinction matters. Semiautomatic rifles are commonly owned and protected by law. Fully automatic “military assault guns” are not, which, I suspect, is why people conflate them.

Then again, if your argument is that any weapon originally designed for war should be banned, then consider the musket, rifle, revolver, and all semi-automatic handguns. In the end, every gun is designed to kill. Otherwise, it would be worthless.

Mass shooters probably prefer the AR-15 (or AK47-“style” weapons) for aesthetic reasons. AR-15s are responsible for only a sliver of gun homicides. The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (1994 to 2004) did little, if anything, to alter gun violence trends. Once the assault weapon ban was lifted, and the AR-15 became the most popular rifle in the country, gun violence continued to steeply fall.

But what if these murderers started using semiautomatic handguns—the Virginia tech murderer, for instance, killed 32 people with handguns. Should we then have to ban all Glocks, as well?

Maybe that’s the point. If you believe banning and confiscating tens of millions of semiautomatic guns is practical or legal, as many liberals clearly do, just say so. President Kamala Harris is ready to send cops to every door. You are free to try and overturn the Second Amendment. But the Heller decision found that the Constitution protects weapons “in common use by law-abiding citizens.” Semiautomatic rifles clearly meet this criteria.

Maybe it’s not any particular gun? Anti-gun warriors get annoyed when others point out that perhaps the nation should focus less on guns and more on mental health problems, especially depression.

Trump called on the Justice Department to work with social media companies to identify potential mass shooters, who these days latch onto extremist ideologies. Perhaps there’s an effective way to accomplish this, but really, it’s schools and families and neighbors who should be spotting these potential killers.

We already have red flag laws that prohibit the sale of a gun to anyone who “has been adjudicated as a mental defective.” A person has an option to appeal the ban and show “a preponderance of the evidence” that he would use firearms in “a safe and lawful manner.”

The mass murderer of Parkland threatened classmates online, posted photos with guns, and was repeatedly described to authorities as a potential “school shooter.” Police could have arrested him on numerous occasions and confiscated his guns using laws that were already on the books. They didn’t. The Dayton mass murderer was, judging from early reports, a twisted man who had threatened classmates and had an obsession with killing and death. Surely, he should have been flagged.

Police can use these laws. And perhaps they can be expanded to help family members and schools warn others about potential shooters and extremists (the real ones, not the conservatives whom liberals keep smearing.)

One problem with red flag laws is that politicians often use them as an attack on due process, expanding confiscatory laws to prohibit large numbers of people from owning firearms. For example, in California, any one-time patient of a mental facility is banned from owning firearms “for the remainder of his or her life.”

Still, not even the strictest laws in California have stopped mass shootings. There are already tens of thousands of gun regulations on the books. Guns are perhaps the most regulated object in American life, even though owning one is a constitutional right. And just as we shouldn’t let terrorists dictate the contours of our speech rights, or our right to privacy, they shouldn’t get to set the parameters of our gun rights.

Top Democrats Call For Senate Vote On Gun Reform Bills,"Top Democrats are calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to cancel the Senate’s August recess in light of the two mass shootings that occurred this week.

“Make no mistake, tomorrow the @NRA will go back to doing the dirty work of gun manufacturers and blocking progress at every turn. [McConnell] must call us back into session to vote on the two background check bills that have already passed the House,” tweeted Sen. Elizabeth Warren on her 2020 presidential account.

Warren was referencing two bills on gun reform that passed the House of Representatives but have yet to pass the Senate.

The first bill is H.R.8, which would require a background check for every firearm sale. The bill passed the House in February of this year with 240 votes in favor of the bill and 190 against it.

The second bill is H.R.1112, which attempts to close gaps in the background check system by forcing individuals to obtain a license before gaining access to a firearm. The licensing process would include a background check, and only those individuals who passed could legally possess a firearm. The bill also passed the House in February, 228-198.

After the tragic mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, which left a total of 30 people dead and 52 injured, calls for gun reform have reemerged.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tweeted, “Mitch McConnell should bring the Senate back into session immediately to pass HR 8, the gun safety bill that has already passed the House. That’s a first step to addressing our serious gun violence epidemic.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is also calling on McConnell to bring the Senate back into session.

“El Paso, Dayton, one awful event after another. [Mitch McConnell] must call the Senate back for an emergency session to put the House-passed universal background checks legislation on the Senate floor for debate and a vote immediately.”

But would passing these bills actually prevent mass shootings, such as the two that occurred in Ohio and Texas? According to Gun Owners of America, it wouldn’t.

“Shooters are always going to shoot. No, [passing the House legislation] wouldn’t have stopped a thing,” said Gun Owners of America.

According to Ohio police and sources in Texas, neither of the shooters had background history that would have prevented them from obtaining a firearm. Therefore, even if these bills were passed, they would not have prevented these tragic mass shootings.

Weekend Shootings Cast Spotlight On Gun Control In 2020 Race,"The pair of some of America’s deadliest shootings that occurred this weekend has once again prompted Democratic presidential candidates to call for new gun control laws.

Twenty-nine people were killed between two shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, prompting candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination to ramp up their calls for new regulations to restrict gun ownership.

“How many lives must be cut short? How many communities must be torn apart? It’s past time we take action and end our gun violence epidemic,” former vice president Joe Biden wrote on Twitter.

Heartbroken to hear the news from El Paso. Our thoughts are with those impacted by yet another senseless act of gun violence in America. How many lives must be cut short? How many communities must be torn apart? It’s past time we take action and end our gun violence epidemic. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) August 3, 2019

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders directly called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to bring gun control legislation passed in the House earlier this year up for a vote in the Senate.

Senator McConnell, bring a bill to fight this gun violence epidemic to the Senate floor for a vote. These were passed by the House five months ago:

∙ Bipartisan Background Checks Act

∙ Enhanced Background Checks Act Without action, your words are meaningless and insulting. https://t.co/4tcr9NgivP — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) August 4, 2019

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) also called for gun legislation to be passed in light of the recent mass shootings.

“Gun violence happens at schools, at places of worship, at work, at malls, at movie theaters, at festivals, and at home. Gun violence can claim dozens of lives at once—and its daily toll claims dozens. We have a gun violence epidemic in this country. We need to act—now,” Warren wrote.

While candidates called on new gun laws to be passed, many also capitalized on a long, hate-filled white supremacist manifesto targeting immigrants and minorities written by the El Paso shooter just moments before carrying out what became the eighth deadliest shooting in American history. They blamed President Donald Trump, despite the fact that the shooter in Ohio was a raging leftist who supported Warren and was still upset about the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.

Still, Warren’s Twitter feed is filled with rhetoric condemning Trump and white supremacy for the shooting, from her own account and from others that she retweeted.

“The hatred & racism being fueled by Trump & others leads to this type of violence,” wrote Marielena Hincapié, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, in a tweet that Warren retweeted.

The hatred & racism being fueled by Trump & others leads to this type of violence.

We must end #GunViolence & #WhiteSupremacy 3/3 — Marielena Hincapié (@MarielenaNILC) August 3, 2019

Former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke also blamed Trump for the El Paso massacre.

“President Trump has a lot to do with what happened in El Paso yesterday,” O’Rourke said on “Face The Nation” Sunday. “Anybody who begins their campaign for the presidency by calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals; anyone who, as president, describes asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border as an infestation or an invasion or animals; anyone who describes those who do not match the majority of this country as somehow inherently dangerous or defective; sows the kinds of fear, the kind of reaction that we saw in El Paso yesterday.”

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also chimed in to blame the shooting on Trump.

“Donald Trump is responsible for this,” Booker said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “He is responsible because he is stoking fears and hatred and bigotry. He is responsible because he is failing to condemn white supremacy and see it as it is, which is responsible for such a significant amount of the terrorist attacks.”

Meanwhile Trump addressed the shootings as a mental health crisis in addition to condemning hate.

“Hate has no place in this country,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac of a New Jersey airport before boarding Air Force One. “This is also a mental illness problem…These are people that are very, very seriously mentally ill.”

Whether the reignited gun debate will stay inflamed among voters due to these shootings once the caucuses and primaries arrive in January is unlikely, but it is sure to be a hot topic at the next Democratic presidential debate slated for Sept. 12 and 13 in Houston, Texas, the home state of Saturday’s shooting.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/05/weekend-shootings-cast-spotlight-gun-control-2020-race/,2019-08-05
7 Reasons More People Should Concealed Carry,"America is dangerous. The world is dangerous. Here, there, and everywhere, danger is lurking. When people act unpredictably and threateningly, the best thing to do is be prepared.

Police and security are the ideal intermediaries, but personal safety cannot be entirely entrusted to others. It is time to responsibly conceal a firearm.

There are innumerable benefits to obtaining a license to carry a firearm. Here are the top seven reasons that more people should get licensed, train with their gun, and concealed carry daily.

1. Carrying Makes You More Observant

When carrying a firearm, you have the ultimate power of force in your control. With this great power is an equally great duty to stay aware.

When carrying, you need to be observant so you do not get attacked or lose control of your firearm. You must be alert to potential threats in case you need to use your weapon. And you must be cognizant of how you act so your weapon remains concealed and does not create a problem or threat for others.

There many reasons to be vigilant when carrying, and all of them make for a more responsible citizen. When carrying, you may notice odd behavior in others or things that seem out of place. This may be a public threat, like a person wearing a large jacket in the summertime or acting suspiciously, or it may be someone simply in need of help whom you noticed because you were paying attention.

At the grocery store, pumping gas, or just walking around the neighborhood, lawfully carrying a weapon guarantees more observant and alert engagement with your surroundings.

2. Concealed Carrying Makes You More Careful

Along with being attentive to others’ behavior and activities around you, carrying a weapon ensures that you act as a better citizen. While lawfully carrying means that police will not find fault for having a weapon, it is still important to avoid the dangerous potential for a confrontation with police while armed. After all, any interaction with police could result in miscommunication or accident.

This means that concealed carriers adhere more carefully to speed limits and local laws and conform more diligently to rules and regulations in daily life. Statistically, licensed concealed carriers are more law abiding than their unarmed peers. This is not only because of more careful behavior, but more diligent knowledge of state and local laws.

Carrying also causes people to act more deliberately, not rushing or acting carelessly. When concealing in many jurisdictions, it is unlawful to reveal the weapon unless brandishing it in self-defense or temporarily engaging with a peace officer. With this more deliberate pace and action, individuals are more likely to avoid conflict and better able to observe their surroundings.

3. You Can Protect Yourself from Victimization

Defensive uses of firearms routinely outweigh unlawful and violent uses. What’s more, defensive uses of firearms need not result in harm or death. Merely brandishing a gun or telling the would-be assailants about a gun many prevent victimization.

This extends to all types of crime, from home invasions to muggings, rape and assault, to stalking and attempted murder. Carrying a firearm affords you the option to thwart victimization and stay safe.

Police response time, even in the best of conditions, is usually a matter of minutes. When a criminal is approaching, most people only have seconds to react. It is better to have a gun and prevent injustice than to wait for police and potentially become a victim, even if justice is ultimately served on the criminal.

4. You Can Protect Others from Threats and Violence

A gun to protect yourself is important, but a responsible citizen can protect her fellow man as well. Deadly force is not allowed to defend property or nonlethal harm, but it is allowed to protect yourself and others from deadly threats.

This means a lawfully carrying citizen can stop the victimization of another and save lives. Again, this does not necessitate killing the criminal, but the option exists if intervening and brandishing the firearm is not sufficient to save the innocent party.

Then there are mass shooting events, in which an individual carrying a weapon is able to save not only himself and a neighbor, but potentially hundreds of fellow citizens. While under-reported, there are many documented cases of such heroic interventions.

5. You Carry Your Own Background Check with You

A concealed carry permit is its own proof of character. To obtain a license in most states, fingerprinting and background checks are required. These are routinely updated, so any unlawful conduct is flagged and the license can be rescinded. So every day, the license represents a fresh and up-to-date background check.

This is useful for a number of reasons, including interacting with law enforcement and purchasing new weapons. When engaging with law enforcement, such as during a traffic stop, providing a license to carry a firearm communicates to that officer that you are a responsible, law-abiding citizen.

When purchasing guns from a federally licensed firearms dealer, every person must undergo a federal background check. Providing a concealed-carry license or permit can expedite this process and might even make the seller trust and respect you more.

6. You Are Empowered

Knowing you can defend yourself and your neighbors is incredibly empowering. Carrying a weapon and knowing how to use it safely gives you the confidence to face every day without fear of being a victim.

Best of all, you do not have to rely on others for your own protection. Police response time is not fast enough to prevent immediate danger, and a gun equalizes threats, whether you are five feet tall or a heavyweight wrestler, man or woman, old or young, disabled, outnumbered, or otherwise.

7. You Are Comfortable Around Weapons

Most fears are rooted in the unknown. Many people who hate guns have never shot one or are not comfortable around them. A good way to be more comfortable around guns is to know how they work and how to properly handle them.

Responsible, law-abiding citizens who carry must be able to proficiently carry, discharge, disassemble, clean, and reassemble their firearm. They know what to do, and more importantly, what not to do with firearms in order to be safe around them.

You never know when you may encounter a gun. It is best to be prepared in case you ever do. This might be as simple as handling your own guns or a gun at a store or friend’s house. But it also extends to those unknown and rare instances when faced with a threatening gun—maybe an abandoned gun in a park or when a threatening criminal brandishes a gun. If the bad guy is incapacitated, disarmed, or otherwise loses his grip, a responsible gun owner is the best person to take control of that weapon before the criminal gets it back or a child or other bystander unsafely takes the weapon.

Knowing how to control a weapon and store and operate it safely is essential to being a responsible gun owner. And experience with guns is the best way to improve those skills. Carrying not only improves your safety, awareness, and confidence, but it makes you an even more responsible gun owner.

The last thing America needs is vigilante justice or reckless gun owners. But responsible, law-abiding concealed carry is one way to be a better citizen and protect yourself and your community. Even if you never bring out your weapon, it improves the way you engage with the world and causes you to be a more responsible, deliberate, and careful citizen.

Beto O’Rourke Endorses Australian-Style Mandatory Gun Buyback,"2020 presidential candidate and former Congressman Beto O’Rourke endorsed a federal mandatory gun buyback program Monday after back-to-back weekend shootings in Ohio and Texas that killed 31 people.

The Texas Democrat announced his support for the program, which requires gun owners to sell firearms deemed illegal back to the government at a market price, on former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau’s “Pod Save America” podcast.

“I’m open to them right now as a candidate — absolutely has to be part of the conversation,” O’Rourke told Favreau of the policy. “At the end of the day, if it’s going to save lives, if it’s going to prevent the kind of tragedies that we saw in El Paso, or Gilroy, or Dayton, or this weekend in Chicago, or all over this country on a daily basis, then let’s move forward and do it.”

In the interview, O’Rourke also said he would support ending the Senate filibuster to pass gun legislation.

Other 2020 White House hopefuls have also voiced their support for ending the filibuster. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee have both said the filibuster is an unnecessary tool of the past.

O’Rourke is not alone in supporting a federal buyback program for firearms. Former Vice President Joe Biden also came out in support of a federal gun buyback program with a ban on “assault weapons” Monday in an interview with CNN.

Going After Guns And What's Called Supremacy Won't End Shootings,"Public safety risk management consultant Gordon Graham explained risk can be divided into four categories: high risk-low frequency, high risk-high frequency, low risk-low frequency, and low risk-high frequency. Without question, the category of risk most difficult to prepare for is the first, as it pertains to events that cause the greatest damage and disruption with such relatively low frequency that diverting resources toward addressing those risks proves difficult when more emergent risks may be present.

The latest mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, have America mulling what comes next and whether anything can be done to prevent such incidents from occurring again. If the nation intends to translate its emotions into public policy, it needs to be willing to look at the costs and trade-offs.

Mass shootings certainly fall into the category of high risk-low frequency. Although some have made various attempts of questionable faith to suggest otherwise, mass shootings rank low on the list of public safety concerns. This doesn’t diminish their severity (hence, “high risk”); like terrorism, any threat that can result in many deaths demands serious redress. Suggesting that the relative unlikelihood of a particular event justifies not addressing it borders on irresponsibility.

The El Paso shooting specifically highlighted the problem of white nationalism as a motivation behind the atrocities (the Dayton shooter appears to have had other political persuasions). Just how problematic is it? Experts and law enforcement officers have developed somewhat of a consensus that white nationalism is a growing concern, with data to support it. According to one report, the number of right-wing domestic terror incidents quadrupled between 2016 and 2017.

Based on the data alone, one can safely conclude white nationalism is a problem in the United States and deserves to be addressed as a serious public safety concern. But what exactly does a risk assessment of white nationalism and mass shootings actually reveal?

When White Nationalism Means Ben Shapiro

White nationalism isn’t a legally defined term, not unlike “Islamism” and “jihadism.” In the absence of legal definitions, we rely on academic definitions to identify a term.

A 2016 New York Times article on the matter quoted Eric Kaufmann, a professor of politics at Birkbeck College, University of London, who explained white nationalism as “the belief that national identity should be built around white ethnicity, and that white people should therefore maintain both a demographic majority and dominance of the nation’s culture and public life.” He further explains that “white nationalism is about maintaining political and economic dominance, not just a numerical majority or cultural hegemony.”

We can debate definitions, but in the public realm, the already loaded term has taken on such a broad definition that there’s little consensus on what it actually is. Everyone from self-described white nationalist Richard Spencer to Sam Harris, Debra Soh, and Ben Shapiro has been accused of white nationalism. Any term that casts such a wide net ultimately means nothing. The reality is that white nationalism, like “Nazi” and “fascist,” has become a label for anything other than “progressive” or “woke.” This is hardly the basis for sound public policy.

Specifics aside, if we could directly confront white nationalism in its currently defined state, we’d run the risk of implicating millions of Americans who have committed little else except wrongthink. Even sources within the FBI alluded to as much, citing difficulties in pursuing white nationalists because, well, if everyone who’s a Trump supporter, conservative, or right-wing is an extremist, half the country ought to be pursued.

Following 9/11, much of the public was very sensitive to the fact that innocent Muslims and others of Middle Eastern descent could be unjustly implicated in any attempt to uncover terrorists within America. While the United States has largely avoided blatant and major instances of discriminating against either demographic in its hunt for terrorists, many still view “Islamophobia” as a lingering issue today.

Emotions Getting in the Way of Our Brains

The fact that the topic of white nationalism reemerges so soon after President Donald Trump’s call for four congresswomen to “go back to their country” bolsters the arguments of those who define white nationalism in broad strokes. While we could make the case that the president’s opponents chose to see only what they wanted to see in the tweets, the reality is, there’s a perception problem compounded by the fact people are now dead. The visceral impact of the El Paso shooting has further narrowed the limits of the discussion in the public sphere and, at least in the short term, makes it difficult to define white nationalism as anything other than nonprogressive.

The El Paso shooting also comes soon after a 2018 interview resurfaced in which Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota condemned Islamophobia by saying the country ought to be “more fearful of white men across our country because they are actually causing most of the deaths within our country.” Ignoring the factual inaccuracy of her comment, the El Paso shooting does breathe unfortunate life into the idea that white males are the greatest threat to public safety, even if, as Omar’s defenders argued, that wasn’t what she was really saying.

The gun issue runs into similar problems. When followed to its logical conclusion, the emphasis on guns as a source of the problem implies that disarming the population would demotivate would-be mass shooters. At least one Democratic presidential candidate has suggested exactly that. The problem, of course, is that the Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms. Aside from Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who seems intent on presiding via executive order, nobody’s made a serious argument for abolishing the Second Amendment, probably because it’s a losing issue.

Guns Used to Harm Are Usually Already Illegal

Most important, any major gun control legislation will adversely affect the law-abiding public. This is the most underappreciated aspect of any state intervention; restricting the public’s right to carry arms in public didn’t prevent mass shooters from doing so themselves and murdering dozens. Even if it were true that guns are rarely used in self-defense, the fact that so many guns are available and often used in illegal fashion indicates further restricting access will only render the public even more defenseless than they are already and entirely dependent on the state for protection.

Those arguing for gun control on the basis that the use of firearms is largely in the commission of crimes also seem startlingly oblivious to the fact that the lack of defensive use isn’t necessarily cause for alarm. It also suggests there’s indeed deterrent value in gun ownership and the generally responsible nature of gun owners. It may be further related to two factors: Americans who own guns constitute a minority, and gun violence is a geographically defined phenomenon.

A 2012 study revealed gun violence (excluding suicides) to be a largely urban phenomenon and in specific cities, at that. Interestingly, the study also found the fixation on mental illness to be largely unfounded, at least based on the data used. None of this is a justification for doing nothing, but it should reinforce the fact that simply being in America doesn’t place someone at high risk of being victimized with a gun — risk is a relative phenomenon.

Guns used in crime are also, according to available data, usually possessed illegally. Given that nobody who illegally possesses firearms would out themselves in even a confidential survey, let alone participate in one, it’s a safe bet the minority of Americans who own firearms legally don’t pose a public safety threat (with one glaring exception), and neither does gun ownership nor the physical presence of firearms immediately result in widespread death.

Getting Serious About Saving Lives

The key point is this: If the media, politicians, and certain sectors of the public are concerned about gun violence, mass shootings aren’t the hill to die on. The high risk-low frequency nature of mass shootings makes it incredibly difficult to address, but the level of gun violence in the country is such that eliminating mass shootings would have little to no impact overall.

Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson alluded to this fact in a tweet that was roundly panned. Talking statistics seems callous in the face of jarring tragedy, but Tyson has a point — mass shootings are simply a part of a diverse phenomenon and require an equally diverse array of solutions, which is why the focus on gun violence in places such as Chicago, where seven people were shot over the same weekend as the El Paso and Dayton incidents, isn’t “whataboutism” — instances such as those in Chicago represent the lion’s share of gun violence in America.

Measures to prevent white nationalist violence and mass shootings will involve costs and trade-offs that’ll disrupt the daily lives of innocents in hopes of avoiding that single, horrible instance that costs the lives of many. Such is the nature of public policy. For those serious about saving lives, white nationalism needs to mean something more than just disagreeable or distasteful thoughts and opinions, and mass shootings must remain within the context of the larger problem of gun violence. When it comes to managing risk, being safe must always take precedence over being “right.”

"Gun Controllers Should Support Banning Alcohol And Cigarettes, Too","Numbers are powerful persuasive tools. But numbers without perspective and scale can be used to mislead, manipulate, and distract. Surprisingly, Neil deGrasse Tyson made this point in response to the recent shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. The backlash was predictable, but Tyson isn’t wrong.

Let’s look at some more numbers. Firearms of all kinds played a role in nearly 40,000 deaths in 2017. By itself, that sounds like a lot. At the same time, however, 88,000 people died from alcohol-related causes and 480,000 from the effects of cigarette smoking.

All three examples are analogous: Each involves a legal substance that contributes to a large number of deaths and injuries. Alcohol and tobacco are involved in substantially more deaths each year than firearms, yet are very loosely regulated compared to guns. So if numbers are what we’re concerned about, then where’s all the push for alcohol and tobacco control?

Now, you might be thinking, “You’re comparing apples and oranges! Many of these deaths involve things people do to themselves, not other people!” Notwithstanding the fact that two-thirds of gun deaths are suicides, deaths remain bad whether they’re self-inflicted or inflicted by others. The needless death of a person does not become “acceptable” or “morally neutral” simply because it was the result of his own choices.

If our goal is simply to “bring down the numbers,” then it doesn’t really matter how the numbers were generated or where they came from. What matters is that each “number” represents a harm. And on that point, death is always a harm regardless of who dies or how it is caused. So the distinction between “self-regarding” and “other-regarding” actions becomes irrelevant.

Not only that, firearms actually have real and substantial benefits, unlike alcohol or cigarette smoking. I don’t know of anyone who seriously argues that smoking cigarettes can be healthy. With alcohol, the health benefits have been overstated. There’s little evidence that moderate alcohol consumption reduces mortality risk, and new research “is raising doubts about whether moderate alcohol consumption has a protective effect on health.”

But for firearms, the best-quality research consistently shows that guns (1) are very effective when used in self-defense and (2) are used quite often for that purpose — about 2 million times a year. Even if we follow the pro-control crowd and adopt the lowest estimates of defensive gun use (which come from a survey that was never designed to measure defensive gun use), people still use guns defensively at least 70,000 times each year.

That’s a pretty nontrivial number, especially considering we tolerate two other legal substances that offer almost no benefit at all. Even if guns had no benefits at all, the case for alcohol and tobacco control would still be stronger, given the figures.

The point is that if we’re going to advocate for tighter gun laws on the basis of numbers, the same exact reasoning would apply to alcohol and tobacco in arguably a much stronger way. Yet from my experience, many people hesitate to extend the reasoning this far. Maybe they are drinkers or smokers themselves, or maybe they see it as “going too far.” But again, from a purely numbers perspective, the reasoning is hard to dispute.

The utilitarian gun control advocate can make two moves. The first would be to bite the bullet and say we should also heavily restrict alcohol and tobacco. The second would be to drop the facade and admit that appealing to numbers is just a way of selectively justifying opposition to gun ownership and nothing else.

I doubt any gun control advocate sincerely believes the first option. Someone who does make that move is likely trying to save face. The second option describes what I think is really going on: The whole appeal to numbers is just a convenient cover for gun animus.

But if we’re still willing to tolerate legal alcohol and tobacco despite the clearly massive cost-benefit disparity, then either (1) nobody really buys the cost-benefit model of public policy, or (2) we think there are more important things besides just weighing the costs and benefits. If that’s the case, shouldn’t we view guns the same way?

"After Shootings, 2020 Democrats Race Further Left On Gun Confiscation","2020 Democratic White House hopefuls were quick to call for new gun laws this week in the aftermath of back-to-back shootings in Ohio and Texas over the weekend that left 31 dead.

Several candidates, including current front-runner Joe Biden, have called for Australian-style gun buyback programs where owners of firearms would sell back their weapons to the government at government-determined prices.

While Biden has endorsed the policy as an optional measure, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, who is from El Paso, where 22 people were killed in Saturday’s shooting, has endorsed a mandatory one, where owners of weapons deemed illegal under federal law would be required to sell their guns to the government. Both candidates have also called for bans on “assault weapons” with loose definitions of the term, which would require owners of such firearms to sell their guns to federal officials under O’Rourke’s proposal.

Biden announced his support for the policy during a primetime interview with CNN.

“I would institute a national buyback program,” Biden told the network’s Anderson Cooper Monday night, noting that his program would be optional.

O’Rourke touted the policy on a Monday episode of the “Pod Save America” podcast with Jon Favreau.

“I’m open to them right now as a candidate – absolutely has to be part of the conversation,” O’Rourke told Favreau. “At the end of the day, if it’s going to save lives, if it’s going to prevent the kind of tragedies that we saw in El Paso, or Gilroy, or Dayton, or this weekend in Chicago, or all over this country on a daily basis, then let’s move forward and do it.”

Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, another 2020 candidate, joined Biden and O’Rourke in calling for a federal gun buyback program. Bullock told Real Clear News Tuesday that he wants to end the sales of AR-15s in addition to implementing a gun buyback program. Similar to Biden, Bullock wants the program to be optional.

“I think that there should be voluntary buy-back,” Bullock said. “But not a mandatory one.”

A mandatory buyback program such as the one endorsed by O’Rourke is likely to face an uphill legal challenge in the courts under the 2008 Supreme Court decision District of Columbia v. Heller. In the 5-4 ruling, conservative Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that the Second Amendment protected citizens’ rights to possess weapons in “common use.”

Whether the nation’s highest court will approve of whatever Democrats ultimately decide to try to ban remains to be seen, but lower courts have borrowed language from the Heller decision to protect “assault rifles,” citing the fact that guns such as AR-15s are some of the most popular weapons sold across the country, used commonly for hunting and target practice. An expired 1994 federal “assault rifles” ban in fact only banned cosmetic features of common rifles, since automatic weapons are already illegal for civilians to own inside the United States.

As Bre Payton noted last year: “‘Assault weapon’ and ‘assault rifles’ are malleable terms often used in public discourse to scare people. After all, all guns are designed to ‘assault’ something. The usual proper use of this term is to describe fully automatic machine-gun-style weapons, which in the United States have been banned from civilian use for years.”

Australia confiscated approximately 650,000 guns in its mandatory gun buyback program in the 1990s, following a mass shooting that killed 35 people in Tasmania. Touted as a gun control success story and a model to follow by advocates of stricter gun laws, some studies show the program had no significant impact on reducing homicides in the country.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/07/shootings-2020-democrats-race-left-gun-confiscation/,2019-08-07
Shootings Are Not About Gun Control Or White Supremacy. Ask Chicago,"During the same weekend two lone gunmen perpetrated mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas, 55 people were shot in Chicago, seven of them fatally. Two weeks ago, two mothers who took a public stand against street violence were also murdered in Chicago. The irony of these slayings shows the true extent of the tragedy that is taking place in America’s second city.

While the murder toll in Chicago is brandished every year for a shocking media moment, the crisis is not taken anywhere as seriously as it should be, particularly at the national level. Honestly, if politicians had anything to gain from talking about it, we’d never stop hearing about Chicago.

The tragedy of mass shootings deserves a measured emotional response and a thorough analysis to help prevent them in the future. Yet liberals are prone to politicize these shootings to advance their political agenda.

The shootings are not a gun control issue or even a white supremacy issue. The real issue at the heart of these mass shootings lies with the pain the men who commit these acts are feeling. The thoughts expressed in their often-detailed explanations for their actions are symptoms of their intense emotional anguish. What these mass shootings have in common with Chicago is the murderers are in most cases men struggling to cope with life.

Chicago is a failed liberal project. The liberal media ignores the violence in the city because the gun control measures they advocate for have already failed there. Murders are down in Chicago, and it has nothing to do with stricter gun laws. Gun control has loosened in Chicago as murders have gone down, actually.

In 2014, Illinois began allowing concealed carry permits to give regular citizens a better chance to protect themselves from the onslaught. Tougher policing in targeted zones has also helped to curb some of the violence, but ridiculous amounts of shootings still occur.

Violence in Chicago could use more attention and fresh ideas. Yet our overtly political media space does little to address the issue. Partisanship has put the country at-large in a perpetual state of reaction. Instead of reacting to the mass shootings, the media has programmed us to react to President Trump. People now live as if we are in a constant election cycle, and the hysteria on both sides has made the public conversation less effective.

We are built with the wiring to blame our leaders for the problems we face, as it is difficult to cope with the reality that many things are out of our control. For liberals, Trump is the perfect scapegoat. By many of their reactions you’d swear he had pulled the trigger in Texas himself.

Many people believe that simply changing some gun laws would stop these shootings, yet most shooters have either violated existing laws or wouldn’t be stopped by proposed laws. Ignorance is useful for politics, but not so useful in problem solving.

Strict gun control laws did little to deter the violence in Chicago before the laws were relaxed, and it will do little to stop mass shootings. That seven people were killed in Chicago last weekend is just as alarming as these mass shootings. Chicago’s response should be to continue to innovate policing and continue empower people to protect themselves.

Just like last weekend in Chicago shouldn’t distract from the reality that murders are down in the city, these recent mass shootings shouldn’t become election fodder. Stirring racial animus toward white men for the actions of these mass shooters is the same as blaming every black man in Chicago for the sins of a few.

The political leanings of the recent mass shooters are just as irrelevant as the video games the Columbine shooters enjoyed playing. These superficialities are mere coping mechanisms for the void these men feel in their lives.

The violence in Chicago is not a product of rap music, and the violence of mass shooters is not a product of politics. Modern men are violent because they are broken. A few men are born broken, but society is responsible for most broken men. A certain degree of violence cannot be prevented, but in these extreme cases society must be examined.

While smarter policing and giving power back to the people has been a good start in Chicago, the unnecessary violence will continue until America decides that it cares about the plight of the men in the city. According to their own words, these mass shooters don’t feel like they matter much.

Men who resort to violence believe they are doing something that matters. The men in Chicago don’t have much, and the men doing the El Paso and Dayton shootings don’t have much either. Privilege has little to do with either. If we want to truly address the issue of violent men in America, then we have to stop acting like certain men don’t matter.

Mass shootings are beyond the issues of gun control and President Trump’s rhetoric. These kinds of shootings were taking place before President Trump, and they will continue to take place after he is gone. The more’s the tragedy.

"If It Wants To Survive, The NRA Needs To Change","In the mid-1970s the NRA had to make a choice. As crime continued to spike across the nation, and politicians increasingly embraced gun control measures, an internal debate broke out about the future of the organization.

Initially, the NRA’s more passionate Second Amendment advocates were purged. NRA leadership would fire more than 70 activists during the early part of the decade. By 1976, the organization’s board decided to relocate its headquarters from Washington to Colorado to extract itself from political debate altogether. It wasn’t until a 1977 NRA convention in Cincinnati that politically minded members pulled off something of a coup, wresting the organization from the nonpolitical wing.

Many of today’s gun control advocates like to claim the “Cincinnati revolt” was the moment extremists took over the organization, undermining average gun owners who were merely interested in hunting and skeet shooting — which is, needless to say, a simplistic understanding of both the NRA’s history and gun owners. The reality is that the shift was an organic one, reflecting the mounting anxieties among members who felt increasingly under political attack. The NRA was best positioned to take the lead. If it hadn’t, another advocacy group would have emerged to take its place.

The gun control debate had changed, and the NRA changed with it. And the more gun controllers pushed, the more popular the NRA became, doubling its membership from 1977 to 1983. With every concerted effort to enact gun restrictions, the organization grew.

What is the point of the NRA now? Is it to be one of the thousand partisan outfits in D.C. helping elect Republicans, or is it to make compelling and effective arguments about the virtues and necessity of the Second Amendment? For someone looking in from the outside, it seems the past few years have been mostly about the former.

Of course, we shouldn’t forget the NRA runs an array of programs around the country that cultivate responsible gun owners. (I should also mention that the NRA’s National Firearms Museum in Fairfax, Virginia, is a quite fascinating place.) And it isn’t the group’s fault, as a policy matter, that firearms have become predominately a partisan issue. Young voters might not be aware that the NRA once regularly supported pro-gun Democrats such as Harry Reid and Bernie Sanders. It’s the left’s embrace of confiscatory policies and intrusions that often makes bipartisan support untenable. The NRA is compelled to back Republicans because Republicans — and the judges they nominate and confirm — are far more prone to protect gun rights.

The problem with being a partisan outfit, however, is that you soon start working for the party, rather than asking the party to help you. After the Las Vegas mass shooting that killed 58 people, the deadliest in U.S. history, the Trump administration unilaterally banned bump stocks through executive action. “As a matter of both law and physics,” my colleague Sean Davis pointed out at the time, the move was an “abomination.”

You can imagine that had the Obama administration engaged in a precedent-setting intrusion into gun rights, banning an accessory by fiat rather than legislatively, the NRA would rightly have raised hell about the dictatorial powers of the presidency. In this case, the best pushback the organization could muster was that it had been “disappointed.”

Today, Republicans talk about universal background checks and red-flag laws that could strip gun owners of their due process rights, and the NRA isn’t offering persuasive arguments about why they’re bad ideas. Are they even part of the conversation in any meaningful way? It’s difficult to tell. These days, the NRA, it seems, is just a convenient punching bag for Democrats who are too cowardly to go after tens of millions of gun owners.

Today, “taking on the NRA” has become one of the most common acts of faux bravery in Democratic Party politics. If the NRA were as powerful as its critics contended, the civil and constitutional rights of gun owners would never be challenged. If the NRA spent the kind of money its critics claimed, it would be the most powerful organization in American life.

In reality, the group’s expenditures are minuscule in comparison to other major lobbying. Its entire 2019 lobbying efforts have amounted to under $2 million. The NRA is only influential because it represents — either through direct membership or through ideological kinship — a lot of American voters.

If the NRA were as extremist as Democrats claim, Americans would be walking into supermarkets and buying fully automatic real-life assault rifles. The NRA, in fact, has always been cautious on policy. (It’s worth remembering, for example, that the NRA had opposed bringing the Heller case forward, believing taking it to a higher court could backfire and enshrine the collective rights theory. It was an idealistic libertarian contingent that can be thanked for the protections of both Heller and McDonald. If it had been up to the NRA, the Second Amendment would not have been codified as the individual right.)

Another problem with being aggressively partisan is that the NRA turns off millions of Americans who might be open to its cause but aren’t politically involved themselves. In the past few years, the NRA leadership handed the keys (and a ton of cash) to the PR firm Ackerman McQueen, which in turn, seemed to believe the NRA should be another Fox News rather than a civil rights organization. Now the two are mired in counter suits.

Over the past few years, I appeared on a number of shows on the now-defunct NRATV network — the streaming channel run by Ackerman McQueen. Many personalities on the network were excellent spokespeople for gun rights and for conservative ideas. But should the NRA strive to involve itself in every contemporary debate, creating antagonism on issues that have absolutely nothing to do with gun rights? Though I’m certainly no public relations expert, it seems to me that the mission of any issue-oriented organization should be to proselytize rather than alienate.

On top of all of this, a nasty and convoluted internal fight has broken out among the board members and NRA head Wayne LaPierre, none of which has anything to do with the future of gun rights, as it had in 1977, but rather personal animosity and greed.

It’s unlikely that most members are very interested in the disputed specifics of the kerfuffle, but it all spilled into public view when then-president Oliver North alleged that the NRA was spending — or rather, wasting — nearly $100,000 a day on lawyers. The NRA’s top lobbyist, Christopher Cox, would also resign after being accused of plotting to push out LaPierre. Apparently, the NRA head had spent about $540,000 on clothing and travel expenses that had been laundered through Ackerman. The NRA claimed the costs were justified for business reasons — a contention I imagine a gun owner in Bozeman, Montana, or Aurora, Colorado, might dispute.

This week, we learned via the Wall Street Journal that the NRA had signed a document agreeing to purchase 99% of a company that was formed for the sole purpose of buying LaPierre a $6 million mansion in Dallas. For whatever reason, the deal was never consummated.

Why should any gun owner or Second Amendment advocate send money to an organization that is increasingly ineffective on policy, though highly effective at keeping a few people rich? Perhaps longtime members keep re-upping with the NRA, but how many younger Americans are becoming members? If the NRA wants to be as powerful as Democrats claim it is, it’s going to have to change again.

"I’m A Professor, And I Carry A Gun On Campus. Here’s Why","I am an ethics professor, and I carry a concealed handgun in the classroom. In the event of a mass shooting, I am the first line of defense between my students and an attacker. I refuse to let myself and my students be victims.

I’m sure many of my fellow professors would disagree with my actions. In fact, many would probably brand me as a traitor to academia for admitting such a thing. For them, it is inconceivable that a member of the intelligentsia — an ethics professor, of all people — could support the right to carry a so-called instrument of death.

So in what follows, let me make the moral case for campus carry. Those wanting a more rigorous statement of my argument may be interested in reading one of my academic journal articles on the topic.

The Moral Case for Campus Carry

Campus carry is simply an extension of our natural right of self-defense. Our right to life follows us wherever we go, so the right to defend our lives must also accompany us. Whether I am at home, in my car, at work, or in the classroom, I possess the absolute and unrelenting right to defend myself against unjust aggression. Because firearms enhance that right, there exists a strong presumption in favor of being allowed to own and carry a firearm as I go about my daily business.

That presumption may sometimes be overcome (such as in courthouses, prisons, or airports), but only if the government assumes the special responsibility of protecting those citizens whom it disarms through the coercive power of the law. In other words, if the government is going to tell us we can’t carry guns in a specific area, thus impairing our ability to defend ourselves, it must assume a special responsibility to protect us. It must serve the function our guns would provide had we been allowed to carry them.

An analogy might help illustrate this point. Suppose I push you into deep water as part of a swimming lesson. Because I have intentionally put you into a position of increased vulnerability, I owe it to you to make sure you do not drown. Likewise, if the government requires us to disarm ourselves before entering a specific area, it knowingly puts us in a position of increased vulnerability. It must therefore assume the special responsibility of making up for the gap it has created by increasing protective measures.

The government meets this special responsibility only if it can provide a means of defense equivalent to the one it has coercively stripped away. In the real world, this means it must maintain a pervasive armed presence in the places in which it has disarmed us.

The presence of an ordinary police force does not meet this requirement. Police responses almost always come after someone has already committed a crime. According to data from the National Crime Victimization Survey, only 47.3 percent of all personal crimes in 2008 were even reported to police. Of these crimes, only 28 percent of police responses came within five minutes of reporting, 30.3 percent within six to 10 minutes, and 33.5 percent within 11 minutes to one hour of reporting.

Clearly, for resisting attack, the police cannot play the same role as people can by carrying their own guns. The only government apparatus capable of effectively intervening in the midst of a crime is one in which police or other law enforcement officials are present everywhere, which is neither attainable nor desirable.

An ever-vigilant law enforcement presence obviously isn’t feasible in the vast majority of “gun-free” zones, especially college campuses. Even though many colleges and universities maintain their own dedicated police departments, they lack the manpower to maintain a pervasive armed presence. Given the scarcity of police protection in relation to the large areas these officers must protect, the government cannot adequately meet its special duty of protection on campuses. As such, qualified students, staff, and faculty should be allowed to carry guns on campuses.

It is absurd to think one forfeits the right to defend his life simply by entering a classroom. The right of self-defense is essential to our very dignity as human beings. Although we may sometimes partially delegate this responsibility to others, we can never delegate it completely. Even in the most secure college campus, the police response to an active shooter is measured in minutes. But when seconds matter, it is up to students and faculty to defend their own lives. And they cannot do this without a reasonable and effective means of self-defense.

The empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports the notion that forcefully resisting violent crime with a gun is associated with lower injury rates and successful resistance. Studies consistently find that defensive gun use is beneficial for both men and women.

Guns also have deterrent effects aside from their use in disrupting crimes in progress. Criminals tend to pick “soft” targets, so the mere possibility of forceful resistance from victims serves as a disincentive that may prevent shootings before they even begin. Why not extend these benefits to primary and secondary school teachers, college students, and college faculty?

Bad Arguments Against Campus Carry

Some argue campus carry creates a difficult situation for responding police officers, who will be unable to determine the good guys from the bad guys. But this objection proves too much: It applies to any situation in which the police encounter a victim who is successfully resisting an attack. If the mere possibility of mistaken identity is enough to justify a ban on campus carry, it would also justify a ban on any kind of forceful self-defense measure.

Simply because the police may have difficulty distinguishing between criminals and victims does not mean victims forfeit their right to forceful self-defense. Our right to self-defense is not a function of the ability of the police to protect us, but a basic dignity grounded in our right to life.

Many opponents of campus carry argue college-aged students are prone to excessive alcohol consumption and other reckless behavior that would make carrying more dangerous. While this may be true when considering college students in general, this does not take into account the fact that concealed carry permit holders tend to be more law-abiding than non-permit holders across all age groups. The common stereotype of college students as reckless party animals does not apply to the subset of students who are licensed to carry weapons.

Another objection is that civilians don’t have enough training to defend themselves and others while under pressure. This objection is simply false. First, one does not need to be an expert with firearms to use them successfully. As I’ve pointed out, studies consistently show that individuals do just fine when defending themselves with firearms, despite their relative lack of training compared to police officers. Even for the untrained, guns are still their best bet.

Second, just as some defense is better than no defense, having a weapon is better than having no weapon at all. If I find myself in a situation in which I must defend myself or others against a gunman, I would much rather trust my life to my gun than to my ability to tackle the shooter. Studies show armed resistance is more effective than unarmed resistance, so if I’m going to defend myself with a weapon, I’d prefer it be the kind of weapon that best guarantees a successful outcome. In that respect, nothing compares to a gun.

The final objection I wish to consider is that guns don’t belong in classrooms because they have a “chilling effect” on the free exchange of ideas. As a professor who lectures on controversial topics all the time, I regard this as pure nonsense. Self-protection is the guardian of free expression, not its enemy.

A world in which we are the most free to express our ideas is one in which we are entitled to protect ourselves from persecution for holding the ideas we have. This isn’t to say we all must carry guns on us at all times, but that self-protection complements free speech. Besides, this objection also proves too much: If allowing access to a means of self-defense is inherently at odds with free expression, this argument would apply to all kinds of self-defense, not just guns.

Earlier, I pointed out that those who carry concealed weapons tend to be extremely law-abiding. If this is true, there is no good reason to fear those who are armed for self-protection. Such fears are unfounded and promote a mistaken perception of gun carriers. Indeed, the exact opposite may very well be true: In the same way that a police presence might lead to a greater perception of safety, many people may feel safer knowing that qualified students and faculty are carrying weapons for self-defense.

Why Does ‘Compromise’ Always Mean Gun Control Wins?,"People often ask me why I am so unwilling to “compromise” on gun control. In reality, I’m not. A compromise is supposed to mean both sides of an argument get something out of the deal. Neither side gets everything they want, but they both at least get something.

When people ask me what I would be willing to compromise on, I give them a simple answer: I would trade tougher background checks in exchange for nationwide concealed-carry reciprocity. If we are going to create a system where every gun purchaser is fully vetted through the FBI’s background check system, then we should give those vetted and trusted gun owners the right to carry their guns nationwide.

Gun control advocates usually gasp when I make this recommendation, as if the thought of actually having to agree to pro-gun reforms has never crossed their minds. The answer I get is almost always a hard “no,” and that tells me everything I need to know about the gun control movement’s intentions. Every gun control bill that passes is just one step toward an ultimate goal.

If you get lucky and catch a gun control activist in a particularly honest mood, they’ll admit they think the Second Amendment itself should be repealed. More often than not, though, they will feign defensiveness when you accuse them of this. Never forget that when the issue was before the Supreme Court in 2008, gun control organizations openly argued in amicus briefs that there is no such thing as an individual right to own a gun.

Negotiating in Good Faith Has Led to Compromise

Gun rights supporters are so unwilling to compromise because we know we are getting nothing in return. The left’s idea of a “compromise” is that gun owners get to keep some of their guns instead of having to give up all of them. But even if that were palatable — and it’s not — we know any deal we agree to now will not be honored in the future.

Here’s an example: When Congress started debating a background check bill in the early 1990s, Democrats wanted to give the FBI unlimited time to vet gun purchasers. From the very beginning, even when the FBI was using paper records, the background check system was designed to be “instantaneous.” Gun control advocates, however, wanted to give the FBI as much time as necessary to complete a background check. This was hard for them to sell. A background check isn’t instant if the FBI needs weeks or even months to process it.

This is where Republicans drew a red line. If Democrats wanted to pass a background check bill, they had to agree to cap how long the process could take. This makes complete sense. If the government is going to force purchasers to ask for permission before taking a gun home with them, the government should have to give them a timely response. Otherwise, nothing could stop the federal government from blocking gun sales altogether by simply ignoring the background checks that come in.

The compromise was for 72 hours. That is how long the FBI has to process an “instant” check. If they can’t come back with a yes or no in three calendar days, then the purchaser is allowed to take the gun home anyway. The only reason we have a background check system today is because Republicans and Democrats negotiated in good faith and came to this agreement.

Without Good Faith, One Side Is Forced to Lose Everything

But gun control advocates don’t refer to this as a “compromise” anymore. Today, this provision is known as the “Charleston loophole” because the FBI failed to process the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, church shooter’s background check before the 72-hour clock expired.

Right now, Democrats are demanding that the Republican-controlled Senate go into emergency session to pass the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 (H.R.1112). This bill would undo the 72-hour compromise and extend it to give the FBI 10 business days to perform an “instant” background check. If someone wants to appeal a rejection, the FBI would have another 10 business days to process the appeal. This would allow the government to take 20-21 business days before giving a final determination on a background check that is supposed to be instantaneous.

When you fill out a Form 4473 to start a background check, that application is only valid for 30 calendar days. If you haven’t taken a gun home within 30 days of filling it out, you must go through the process again so the FBI can make sure you haven’t committed a crime in the meantime. In any given year, somewhere between seven and nine months have 21 or fewer business days. This means that if the FBI has 20-21 business days to give a final answer, the government would suddenly have the power to run out the clock on millions of gun purchases every year.

Twenty-five years ago, Republicans told us we had no choice but to give up our rights, but the “compromise” was that in the worst-case scenario, we would only have to wait three days to buy a gun. Today, we are being ordered to “compromise” again and allow the government to take up to a month to give us permission to buy a gun. This is what a slippery slope looks like.

A ‘Compromise’ Is Never Enough For Democrats

We see it on other gun issues as well. In 1968, Republicans and Democrats “compromised” and raised the handgun purchase age to 21. They agreed to leave the minimum age for long guns untouched so that 18-to-20-year-olds would still have the right to own a gun. Democrats today are trying to raise the long gun purchase age to 21 as well, arguing that if you need to be 21 to buy a handgun, the same should apply to long guns.

In 1934, when Congress debated the National Firearms Act, Democrats wanted to treat semi-automatic weapons the same as fully-automatic weapons. Lawmakers reached a “compromise” when the left agreed not to go after semi-automatic guns. Yet here we are, 85 years later, and Democrats are deliberately trying to trick the public into thinking AR-15s are essentially machine guns and the government should regulate them even more than fully automatic weapons.

Democrats have not honored a single gun control “compromise.” The minute they secure one change to the gun laws, they immediately begin arguing lawmakers need to do more.

Ronald Reagan famously said our rights and freedoms are never more than a generation away from extinction. Democrats didn’t have the votes to push through their complete agenda back in the 1990s. They had to “compromise” with Republicans to get some of what they wanted. But now, a generation later, new Democratic legislators are promising to finish the job. Of course, these gun control advocates want gun owners to “compromise” again.

Anyone who actually wants to compromise and pass real pro-gun reforms, such as the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act alongside a tougher background check process, you’ll find gun owners are more than willing to negotiate in good faith. But if your idea of a “compromise” is that I surrender some of my rights in order to avoid losing all of them, and you refuse even to honor the “compromises” of the past, don’t act surprised when we gun owners say “no.”

"In Gun Control Crusade, Beto Gets The Facts Wrong About Shootings","Former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke has been one of the most vocal proponents of increased gun control among the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. His home state has been the scene of two major shootings capturing the nation’s attention in the last month.

O’Rourke, who briefly suspended his campaign following a shooting that killed 22 people in his hometown of El Paso, jumpstarted his campaign once again with a new focus on gun control, advocating for a mandatory Australian-style gun buyback program at the federal level. It’s likely to face a serious legal challenge due to the Second Amendment and Supreme Court precedent set by District of Columbia v. Heller, which secure to Americans the individual right to own guns.

While endorsing sweeping new gun measures on the trail and advocating for federal gun confiscation in the media, O’Rourke has made several false claims and mischaracterizations about gun violence in America.

On CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, O’Rourke claimed that the United States has been averaging “300 mass shootings” a year. According to the Washington Post, however, this number is demonstrably untrue. Defining a mass shooting as one where four or more people were killed by one or two shooters, there have only been 167 “mass shootings” since 1966.

“If we don’t call it out for what it is, if we’re not able to speak clearly… act decisively, then we will continue to have this kind of bloodshed in America and I cannot accept that,” presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke reacts to the deadly mass shootings in Texas. #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/oEzCLeZYiy — State of the Union (@CNNSotu) September 1, 2019

On the network’s program Sunday, O’Rourke also claimed that 100 people were shot and killed in America each day. While data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention generally supports this number, O’Rourke mischaracterized the statistic as homicides by citing it in the context of mass shootings. A majority of gun deaths, six in ten, are a result of suicide.

While characterizing the nation’s gun violence as an epidemic, O’Rourke has blamed President Donald Trump, saying the president bears responsibility for the shootings in El Paso because of the shooter’s lengthy manifesto that included support for reducing the human population to save the planet, which is typically a lefty position. According to O’Rourke, Trump’s “racist rhetoric,” fueled the attacks in El Paso, and therefore the president is responsible for crazy people’s actions.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/03/crusade-gun-control-beto-orourke-gets-facts-wrong-shootings/,2019-09-03
Dems Propose First Gun Grab Since Lexington And Concord,"The media should stop using absurdly lazy phrases like “mandatory gun buybacks.” Unless the politician they’re talking about is in the business of selling firearms, it’s impossible for him to “buy back” anything. No government official—not Joe Biden, not Beto O’Rourke, not any of the candidates who now support “buyback” programs—has ever sold firearms.

What Democrats propose can be more accurately described as “the first American gun confiscation effort since Lexington and Concord,” or some variation on that theme. Although tax dollars will be meted out in an effort to incentivize volunteers, the policy is to confiscate AR-15s, the vast majority of which have been legally purchased by Americans who have undergone background checks and never used a gun for a criminal purpose.

The “mandatory gun buyback” exemplifies the impracticality and absurdity of do-somethingism (although Biden’s proposal to ban “magazines that hold bullets”—so most guns—is also a contender!). Democrats want to turn millions of otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals overnight for refusing to adhere to a law that retroactively transforms the exercise of a constitutional right into a crime.

And they do it without any evidence that it would curtail rare mass shootings or save lives.

While national confiscation would be unprecedented in American history, we already possess hard evidence that bans of assault rifles don’t alter gun violence trends. Gun homicides continued to drop steeply after an “assault weapons” ban expired in 2004. It’s also worth noting that in 2017, the last year of available FBI data, there was a near-historic low of 7,032 murders with handguns, and 403 by “rifles” of any kind, not only “assault weapons.”

To put that in perspective, there were 1,591 knife homicides during that same span, 467 people killed with blunt objects, and another 696 with fists and kicking. (Not every police department reports the type of gun used in homicides (3,096 of them), but it’s reasonable to believe that similar trends apply, since those murders took place in big cities where handguns are most prevalent.)

Although a number of Democrats now unequivocally support a “buyback,” no one has explained how the procedure will unfurl. What will the penalty be for ignoring the “buybacks”? Fines? Prison terms?

Will local police be tasked with opening case files on the 100 million homes of suspected gun owners who are armed with hundreds of millions of firearms, or will it be the FBI? Maybe Democrats will propose “paying back” family members and neighbors who snitch on gun owners? How else will they figure out who owns these AR-15s? There is no national tracking of sales.

Then again, many Democrats support “universal background checks,” which would necessitate a national database. So subsequent confiscations would be far easier, I suppose. (I can remember a time not very long ago when liberals accused a person of being a tin-foil-hatted nutter for merely suggesting that anyone had designs on their guns.)

It’s unclear to me if every candidate supports mandatory buybacks. Imprecision, after all, is the hallmark of gun-control rhetoric. Of course a non-coercive “buyback” program wouldn’t work either because no patriotic American is going to sell his firearms under market value. If you pay gun owners more than market value, they will surely turn a profit and purchase new weapons.

The criminal class and deranged would-be mass shooters have absolutely no incentive to participate, anyway. But you knew that.

Then there is the little matter of constitutionality. I’ve noticed an uptick in gun grabbers—a phrase that’s no longer hyperbole—arguing that Americans don’t need AR-15s to hunt, as if it mattered.

Although ARs are used by hunters, I’m certain nothing in the Second Amendment mentions hunting, because the right of self-defense—an individual concern, as well as a collective one—has nothing to do with shooting deer, and everything to do with protecting Americans from those who endeavor to strip them of their inalienable rights.

The District of Columbia v. Heller decision found that the Second Amendment protected weapons “in common use by law-abiding citizens.” The AR-15 clearly meets both criteria. It’s one of the most popular guns in America. Its semi-automatic mechanism is the same mechanism found in a majority of other legal firearms in the nation.

The arguments for a ban on “assault weapons”— a purposefully elastic phrase that allows the liberal legislator’s imagination to run wild — is centered on aesthetics, on the false claim that the AR is a “weapon of war,” and on the firearm tastes of a handful of deranged, sociopathic murderers.

Democrats and their allies like to mock these sorts of arguments as nothing more than semantics; mostly because they need to conflate and euphemize terms to make their arguments work. It’s how they generate favorable polling. I’m sure you’ve heard about the popularity of gun-control measures. But like “Medicare for all,” and other vaguely positive sounding policies, once voters learn what specifics entail, those numbers tend to settle along the usual partisan lines.

If you think you’re going to have overwhelming support for “mandatory gun buybacks” when people learn that you’re really talking about “the confiscation of 20 million guns,” you’re fooling yourself.

Why Republicans Shouldn’t Cave To Democrats On Guns,"It has been said that Republicans are the “party of stupid” and Democrats the party of something worse. In their reaction to Democrats’ demand for gun control several weeks ago, President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared ready to prove the comparison about the GOP.

Soon after the multiple-victim murders in Dayton and El Paso—the former by a Democrat and self-described leftist supporter of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the latter allegedly by someone who, for the sake of the environment, theorized “if we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can be more sustainable”—Trump and McConnell said they were considering two elements of Democrats’ decades-old civilian disarmament agenda: “universal” background checks and a ban on so-called “assault weapons” and ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, including those for handguns.

If Trump and McConnell, encouraged by Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, who supports susceptible-to-abuse “red flag” gun confiscation laws; Rick Scott, who as governor of Florida signed legislation prohibiting young adults from buying firearms; and Pat Toomey, co-sponsor of a version of “universal” checks, cave to Democrats on guns, they might alienate enough voters to assure that Democrats re-take the White House and Senate, and hold the House of Representatives in the 2020 elections.

However, there are more important reasons Republicans should reject Democrats’ demands on guns.

‘Universal’ Checks Are Really About Gun Confiscation

By way of background, firearm dealers are required to run a background check on anyone to whom they sell guns. “Universal” checks would impose the same requirement on everyone else.

Whenever there is a multiple-victim murder with a gun, Democrats don’t wait for law enforcement agencies to determine how the perpetrator acquired the gun. They immediately demand “universal” checks, to trick the public into thinking that the perpetrator could not pass a background check, therefore bought the gun from someone who is not a dealer, therefore the crime would have been prevented if the seller had been required to conduct a check.

The deception, promoted by the gun control-supporting media, is intended to manipulate the public into supporting the scheme, and prevent the public from instead blaming such crimes on societal factors associated with the leftist voting base.

However, almost all mass murders with guns are committed by people who pass background checks to get guns. As Professor James Alan Fox, the nation’s leading criminologist in the study of murder, has explained, “Most mass murderers do not have criminal records or a history of psychiatric hospitalization. They would not be disqualified from purchasing their weapons legally.”

Furthermore, “universal” checks would not be universal, because most other criminals—who commit the vast majority of murders with guns—get guns by methods to which a background check requirement is irrelevant. The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics has repeatedly found in surveys of state prison inmates imprisoned for gun crimes that most—90 percent, in the most recent survey—got guns by stealing them, by buying stolen or illegally trafficked guns on the black market, or from acquaintances such as “straw purchasers”—people who can pass a background check, who illegally buy guns for people who cannot pass checks, and who would still be able to do so if a “universal” checks requirement were imposed.

The surveys, which go back to 1991, also undercut Democrats’ phony alarm about the so-called “gun show loophole” by consistently finding that less than 1 percent of criminals imprisoned for gun crimes get guns at shows—all from dealers who, as noted, are already required to run checks.

The Real Reason Democrats Want ‘Universal’ Checks

To understand why Democrats want “universal” checks, some additional background is in order.

Democrats’ intent with the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) was to restrict firearms particularly useful for defensive purposes. Told by the Department of Justice that a ban would be unconstitutional, they settled for requiring the registration of fully-automatic firearms, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, and sound suppressors, and almost imposed the same requirement on handguns and semi-automatic firearms that held more than 12 rounds of ammunition.

In 1968, Democrats imposed the Gun Control Act (GCA), which included provisions restricting guns the executive branch at any time deems not “particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes,” meaning those suitable for or adaptable to defensive purposes. Signing the GCA into law, President Lyndon B. Johnson complained that it didn’t require the registration of all guns and the licensing of all gun owners.

In 1976, the handgun-prohibition activist group National Council to Control Handguns admitted that it envisioned registration as the second step in a three-step plan to ban and confiscate handguns. It said, “The first problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns being produced and sold in this country. The second problem is to get handguns registered. And the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition . . . totally illegal.”

In 1989, California ordered owners of “assault weapons” to register them with the state government, but only about 2 percent of owners complied. Compliance was similarly small after New Jersey ordered “assault weapon” registration in 1990. Democrats focused on civilian disarmament took notice.

In 1993, a Democrat-majority Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed the Brady Bill, which included a provision requiring the background check system to be established within five years. The late Neal Knox, a no-compromise opponent of gun control who some years earlier had been the director of NRA’s political division, said that gun owners would eventually “rue the day” the system was imposed.

Soon after, Democrats set about proving Knox right. First, they began demanding checks on non-dealer gun sales at gun shows. Next, they began demanding checks on non-dealer sales everywhere (“universal” checks). Then, in 2009 and 2013, respectively, the late-Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.)—hailing from the very states where “assault weapon” owners had refused to register their guns—introduced legislation to allow the FBI to retain records on people who pass checks to acquire guns.

In 2013, a Department of Justice report said “universal background checks . . . depends on . . . requiring gun registration” and without “a nationwide registration and licensing program,” gun confiscation “cannot be effective.” If “universal” checks were imposed, all that would be required for the system to become a registry would be for check-related records kept by the FBI to include the make, model, and serial number of any gun sold, given as a gift, or inherited. Such a registry could then be used to enforce a gun confiscation law, such as the one Joe Biden and other Democrats are threatening to impose if elected president.

The ‘Assault Weapon Ban’ Didn’t Reduce Crime, But It Wouldn’t Matter If It Had

On August 9, 12, and 20, respectively, former president Bill Clinton in Time magazine, Biden in The New York Times, and gun-prohibition advocate Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) via Twitter claimed that the “ban,” in effect from 1994 to 2004, reduced crime. Other writers have disagreed.

On the one hand, the disagreement is irrelevant. The right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental, individual right protected by the Bill of Rights and, as the Supreme Court said in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), “the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.”

In Heller, the court also observed that people have “the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation,” including “all instruments that constitute bearable arms.” Although the court erred in emphasizing arms “in common use,” the 10-million-plus guns and tens of millions of magazines that Democrats want to ban certainly meet that standard. Moreover, a ban directed at guns and magazines that are useful for the purpose contemplated in the Second Amendment is patently unconstitutional.

On the other hand, it’s easy to show why Clinton, Biden, and Feinstein are wrong. All that’s required is to compare the year-to-year trend in the U.S. murder rate, as reported by the FBI, to the number of just one of the “banned” guns Americans own, the AR-15, based upon firearm production data reported by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Before beginning, it’s important to explain why, in this instance, the word “ban” is presented in quotation marks. Contrary to Democrats’ claim that the “ban” reduced the number of “banned” guns and magazines in Americans’ hands, the “ban” didn’t require anyone to turn over any guns or magazines to the government, it allowed “banned” guns already in existence to continue to be acquired, it allowed “banned” magazines to continue to be imported and acquired, and—most important of all—it allowed “banned” guns to continue being made and acquired in slightly modified form.

For example, the “ban” banned the manufacture of the first AR-15 shown below, but allowed the continued manufacture and sale of the second one. At least 730,000 such AR-15s were manufactured and sold while the “ban” was in effect.

Now, the data. First, as illustrated in the graph immediately below, the annual murder rate (murders per 100,000 population) began declining in 1991, three years before the “ban” was imposed. Furthermore, while the “ban” was in effect (1994-2004), the murder rate continued declining while Americans bought the 730,000 AR-15s noted above, along with an unknown number of other similarly modified rifles, as well as countless “banned” rifle and handgun magazines.

Second, as shown in the next graph, all of the other crimes tracked by the FBI declined at the same time: rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft. Something was causing crime to decline, but it wasn’t anything to do with guns.

Finally, as illustrated in the next graph, since the “ban” expired in 2004, Americans have bought another 10 million AR-15s, and through the first half of 2018 (the most recent data) the annual murder rate has averaged 18 percent lower than when the “ban” was in effect. It’s worth noting that rifles, of which those like the AR-15 are a subset, are used in 2-3 percent of murders, while 27 percent of murders are committed without firearms of any type.

Reducing Violence Isn’t Why Democrats Want To Ban and Confiscate Guns

No one should believe Democrats when they say they want to ban and confiscate guns because they oppose “violence.” After all, the old Democrat Party was the party of the Ku Klux Klan and the new Democrats’ underlying ideology is leftism, the adherents of which around the world over the last 200-plus years have murdered “enemies of the revolution” as a matter of course.

Leftists in this country might say that what their brethren have done in other countries doesn’t mean they would do the same thing here. However, the FBI reported in “Terrorism 2002-2005” that the most serious domestic terrorist threats in this country during the preceding 30-plus years were “leftist-oriented extremist groups, that generally professed a revolutionary socialist doctrine and viewed themselves as protectors of the people against the adverse effects of capital­ism and U.S. foreign policies.”

The FBI noted that in the 1950s, leftists attempted to assassinate President Harry S. Truman and “opened fire on a session of the U.S. House of Representatives,” and in the 1970s bombed Senate and State Department buildings in Washington, D.C.

No one should believe Democrats when they say they want to ban and confiscate guns because they oppose ‘violence.’

More recently, there have been the Bernie Sanders supporter who tried to kill Republican members of Congress playing softball, the murders in Dayton by a Warren supporter, the murders in El Paso allegedly by an environmentalist fanatic, numerous violent attacks by members of Antifa, the felony assault upon Sen. Rand Paul, the attack upon a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office with a Molotov cocktail and, as Chrissy Clark detailed for The Federalist on August 14, several attacks upon Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices around the country.

Then there are the supporters of a Democrat state senator pretending to assassinate President Trump, the various leftwing entertainers who have portrayed Trump’s assassination onstage and in music videos, threatened to suffocate Trump to death, posed for photographers holding a facsimile of the president’s guillotined head, and talked about blowing up the White House. And the college professor in Iowa who said “I am Antifa” and that he wanted to hit Trump with a baseball bat and to kill all Christians.

And then there is the Washington Post columnist who encouraged fellow travelers to “burn down the Republican Party” and to leave no “survivors,” and the people who publicly celebrated the death of Republican philanthropist David Koch, and Democrats’ limitless support for abortions, which in the U.S. outnumber firearm-related murders by at least 50 to 1.

Democrats are going after guns for two reasons. First, since the advent of the big-government Democrat Party under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, they have increasingly opposed people having arms with which they might most easily defend themselves against government overreach.

After imposing the NFA and GCA, primarily to restrict guns particularly useful for defensive purposes, Democrats in the late 1970s and 1980s supported campaigns to get handguns banned. In 1986, when most members of the House of Representatives were not present, Democrats snuck into the otherwise favorable Firearms Owners’ Protection Act an amendment banning newly manufactured fully-automatic firearms. In 1989, they began campaigning to ban various semi-automatic firearms. Democrats also signed amicus briefs supporting the District of Columbia’s handgun ban in Heller.

Second, midway through the Obama administration, “progressives” decided to use “guns” as a core issue around which to rally their voter base.

The Second Amendment Protects the Right to ‘Weapons Of War’

Democrats, who have disparaging names for everything they don’t like, call rifles like the AR-15 “weapons of war.” However, if the rifles are what Democrats say they are, they are quintessentially what the Second Amendment prohibits the government from banning.

The amendment was adopted to protect the right to keep and bear arms for defense against tyranny.

After all, the amendment was adopted to protect the right to keep and bear arms for defense against tyranny. The statements of the Founding Fathers leave no doubt on this point. Here are some examples.

In The Federalist No. 28, Alexander Hamilton wrote, “If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government.”

In The Federalist, No. 29, Hamilton added that an army “can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow citizens.”

In The Federalist, No. 46, James Madison, who later introduced the Bill of Rights in the House of Representatives, wrote that tyranny would be opposed by “citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties.”

And Then There Is the Supreme Court

Democrats claim that the Supreme Court never considered the Second Amendment to protect an individual right to arms before Heller. To the contrary, the court did so in U.S. v. Cruikshank (1876), Presser v. Illinois (1886), Miller v. Texas (1894), U.S. v. Miller (1939), and U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez (1990). Heller was only the first case in which the court was asked specifically to state whose right the amendment protects.

‘If the citizens have these arms in their hands, they are prepared in the best possible manner to repel any encroachments upon their rights.’

In U.S. v. Miller, cited by Heller, the court further recognized that the amendment protects the right to arms that have a “reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,” including those that are “part of the ordinary military equipment” and any others the use of which “could contribute to the common defense.”

For that proposition, the court cited the decision of the Tennessee Supreme Court in Aymette v. State (1840), that “the arms, the right to keep which is secured are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and that constitute the ordinary military equipment. If the citizens have these arms in their hands, they are prepared in the best possible manner to repel any encroachments upon their rights by those in authority.”

U.S. v. Miller also cited U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story’s “Commentaries on the Constitution” (1833), which noted that “The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms . . . offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers, and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.”

President Trump, McConnell, and other Republicans should stand up to Democrats and explain to the American people why they are doing so. Showing courage and commitment to their promises might help them in the 2020 elections and, more importantly, help avert what the Second Amendment was designed to prevent.

Why Criminals Looking To Victimize Women Love Gun Control,"On September 3, Lachelle Hudgins wounded a robber who had attempted to steal her purse. While the mainstream media pan the attack as an overreaction to an attempted purse-snatching, Hudgins, who was there, saw it differently.

According to the video recorded by a local ABC reporter, five attackers approached her car in the wee hours of the morning. How was she to know the attack would end with only a stolen purse? “With so many men surrounding her car and trying to get in the car, she did the only thing she could think to do. She reached in her purse for her gun.” Hudgins said of the incident, “I saved my life.”

In all the current hysteria to “buy back” (translation: “confiscate”) guns, we should not overlook this question: Should women be permitted to protect their own bodies? Or should they be forced to passively endure an attack until an authorized protector from the government can ride to their rescue?

I can reasonably assume Ronnie Preyer’s opinion: He’s against women being armed. Or he would be if this serial rapist wasn’t shot to death by a Cape Girardeau woman fighting to protect her body from his attack. After Preyer raped her the first time, she dutifully called the police. A few days later, he returned to attack her a second time. This time, instead of a phone, she used a gun to protect herself.

Ricky Wright would likely join calls for sensible gun control after being shot in the face by Michelle Booker when he attempted to steal her car and drive off with her children inside. Justin Martin, were he alive, would also likely join the chorus for gun control, after being shot trying to invade the home of an 18-year-old woman with her new baby. Go mama bear! A 70-year-old grandmother in Philadelphia created yet another gun-control advocate when she wounded a 43-year-old home invader trying to, well, thank heavens we don’t know what.

Often overlooked in the gun control issue is that laws intended to disarm male attackers also reduce the choices women have for self-protection. It might make sense for some gun control advocates to carry pepper spray or remain in the company of a protective male. But for some women who wish to live independently, the option of a firearm offsets the overwhelming physical superiority of a potential attacker. It’s her body. Shouldn’t she have the right to choose how best to protect it?

“No!” says the National Women’s Law Center. The solution may be found in “robust public policies” to keep guns out of the hands of people who have demonstrated their capacity to harm others.” Yet Preyer’s victim did exactly that, reporting his violent rape of her days before he returned to do it again. Unfortunately, “robust public policies” keep guns out of the hands of victims, leaving them to attempt fending off attackers with nothing but a cell phone and soaring social justice rhetoric.

Ah, but what about “common sense” gun restrictions? Consider Vermont’s well-intentioned laws that will actually make women more defenseless in the face of their attackers. Among other things, it bans women under the age of 21 from purchasing a firearm to keep in their purses. That should make good common sense to predators who prefer victims under the age of 21.

California, Connecticut, Washington D.C., Hawaii, parts of Chicago, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York have all restricted the magazines women can use in their handguns to 10 or fewer rounds. Why would anyone need more than 10 rounds to defend themselves? Because, as a study shows, when a trained police officer fires at a suspect at close range, he has a 15 percent chance of hitting his target.

This is the reason police have gradually trended away from the big Dirty Harry-style guns with high-powered rounds in favor of the high-capacity but lighter 9mm weapons. Why? To be effective, the weapon needs to hit its target. In the heat of the moment, the police prefer to have a margin of error.

So if a police officer needs to stop a bad guy with lethal force, how many shots does he need to expend before he has a reasonable chance of actually hitting a single assailant? A 9mm Glock used by a large number of police departments carries up to 19 rounds. If police officers were sent into service with only 10 rounds in their handguns, they would only have 10 chances at 15 percent to even hit an assailant.

Reload? Not at six feet away, a distance at which most of these conflicts take place. Remember the scene in “Pulp Fiction” in which two mob hitmen forget to check a back room for a potential threat. A panicky assailant pops out and empties a giant .44 revolver in their direction. Stunned, they realize that every single round missed both of them in spite of the shooter being within ten feet. One hitman credits divine intervention. The other chalks it up to a crazy fluke.

Yet this scene would not have required divine intervention. If a trained police officer has a 15 percent chance of hitting a person at six feet, it’s very plausible that a less-experienced civilian could miss six consecutive shots at that same range. Remember Hudgins? She had only two rounds in her firearm to fend off five attackers. Had the attackers been even slightly more persistent, she would have needed a full clip of at least 11 rounds to have a fighting chance to escape.

Consider another point. There have been several instances in American history in which a community has descended into anarchy. Sometimes it’s the result of a disaster such as Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Other times, a vengeful mob takes to the street to spread destruction. Think the Los Angeles riots after Rodney King’s attackers were acquitted.

Remember the images of the Korean store owners protecting their shops with guns? If that were to happen in your city, how many rounds would you need in your magazine to credibly deter a mob from laying waste to your property or visiting bodily harm on you or your loved ones?

Finally, how many rounds would your wife, mother, or sister need if she were home with the baby when two attackers broke through the front door? In my humble opinion, the answer to that question, whether it’s 12 rounds or 19, defines the constitutional right. You know, the right about arming bears—mama bears.

Here Are The Top 10 Gun Laws Americans Really Need,"During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump said previous Republicans had made big promises to get votes and failed to deliver, but that he would be different. Appealing to America’s 100 million gun owners, he argued against two elements of Democrats’ civilian disarmament agenda: “universal” background checks, which Democrats hope to transform into a federal gun registry that can be used to enforce gun confiscation, and a ban on semi-automatic rifles Democrats call “assault weapons.”

However, several weeks ago Trump and several Republicans in Congress said they were considering giving in to Democrats on both counts.

For various reasons, perhaps including his waffling on guns, it is not certain that Trump will be reelected in 2020. But if he stops listening to members of his family who support gun control, if the Republican Senate quashes Democrats’ gun schemes, if Trump is reelected, if the Republicans hold the Senate, and if they re-take the House of Representatives—a lot of ifs—he and the Republicans could change federal gun laws for the better.

Aggressively pursuing these changes and explaining to the American people why the changes are warranted would help protect the right of the people to keep and bear arms. By now, supporters of that right should have figured out that they will never win the war to protect it if they remain catatonic when the opportunity to pass good laws exists, then cower when Democrats and the liberal-left media attack in the minutes, hours, and days after a high-profile crime involving a gun.

‘The Best Defense Is a Good Offense’

Consider the decision of the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), a case that challenged the District’s bans on handguns, having a gun in operable condition within one’s home (thus preventing its use for self-defense), and carrying a gun within one’s home without a permit (which D.C. would not grant), and which asked the court—for the first time in its history—to expressly state whose right to keep and bear arms the Second Amendment protects.

The court explained at great length why the amendment protects “the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation” and “extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms.” There might not have been a fifth vote on the court for that decision if not for two independent offensive strategies that preceded it by a generation.

The first, which began in earnest in the early 1980s with the research of the late civil rights lawyer Don B. Kates and Second Amendment scholar and attorney Stephen Halbrook, but has since included contributions by dozens of other law professors and constitutional scholars, was a series of law review articles and books that detailed the amendment’s history.

These efforts, many of which are online at the Guncite Second Amendment Law Library and some of which were cited in Heller, proved that the Founding Fathers and Framers of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and 19th century court decisions and legal commentators, considered the right to arms to be individually held and that such viewpoint continued almost without exception until 20th century activist state and federal judges claimed otherwise. (See Salina v. Blaksley, 1905, contending that the amendment protects a so-called “right” of a state to arm its militia; U.S. v. Tot, 1942, contradictorily contending that the amendment protects a “right” of an individual to bear arms only while on duty in a militia; and the Fifth Circuit’s decision in U.S. v. Emerson, 2001, rejecting both theories in favor of the traditional, individual rights view.)

The second strategy was the National Rifle Association-led campaign for state right-to-carry laws, which provide a fair and reasonable process for people to obtain permits to carry guns for protection away from home (essentially undoing restrictions on carrying that in most cases had been imposed decades earlier). In the early 1980s, only six states had right-to-carry laws. By the time of Heller, there were 42, accounting for three-fourths of the U.S. population. These laws led to a massive increase in Americans’ acquisitions of handguns and a massive increase in the number of Americans carrying handguns for protection away from home, and coincided with a sharp decrease in murders and other violent crimes.

Now, instead of caving, President Trump and congressional Republicans should man up, fulfill their promises, and crush Democrats’ civilian disarmament schemes. Then, if and when the opportunity presents, here are the changes they should make to federal gun laws.

1. Repeal the Gun Control Act’s (GCA, 1968) prohibition on young adults buying handguns.

Adults ages 18-20 can marry without parental consent, raise children, serve in the military, serve on juries, and vote. They also have the right to defend themselves. Raising to 21 the minimum age to buy guns—like Republican Sen. Rick Scott did last year when he was governor of Florida, running for the Senate, and sacrificed young adults’ rights for the sake of his political ambitions—is movement in the wrong direction.

2. Repeal the GCA’s prohibition on buying a handgun from a firearm dealer outside your home state.

Dealers are required to conduct a federal background check on anyone to whom they sell a firearm and the check is the same wherever it originates. Democrats can’t have it both ways, claiming that a background check is effective, but only when a gun buyer is in his or her home state.

3. Repeal or amend the Gun Free School Zones Act.

This law within the GCA prohibits a person from carrying a gun within 1,000 feet of a “school zone” unless he or she has a permit issued by the state in which the school is located. It was struck down by the Supreme Court as a violation of the Tenth Amendment, but was re-imposed by Congress. It probably should be repealed, because it still offends the Tenth Amendment, criminals don’t pay attention to “gun free zones,” and you can’t drive very far in any city or town without being within 1,000 feet of one or another school. However, at a minimum, it should be amended to exempt a person who has a permit from any state.

4. Pass national right-to-carry reciprocity legislation.

Most states already honor most other states’ other states’ carry permits, so going along with “universal” checks—which Democrats want as a stepping stone to gun registration—in exchange for getting Democrats to go along with carry permit reciprocity legislation is not, as some think, a good idea. Nevertheless, drivers’ licenses are good in every state, so firearm carry permits should be too.

Make New York, California, and a few smaller states also dominated by Democrats respect the fundamental right to self-defense like other states do. The legislation should also require all states to make carry permits available to any otherwise eligible person at least 18 years of age.

5. Amend the GCA’s firearm importation law.

This provision requires the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to approve the importation of only such firearms and ammunition it considers “generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes.”

However, sports are not the reason for which the Second Amendment protects the right to arms. Furthermore, the BATFE has repeatedly misinterpreted every adverb, verb, adjective, and noun of the law’s “sporting purposes” verbiage to ban the importation of various firearms that are useful for defensive and sporting purposes alike. The law should be amended to require the BATFE to approve the importation of any firearm or ammunition of a type that is legal to manufacture in the United States.

6. Amend the GCA’s “armor piercing ammunition” law.

This 1986 law was intended to prevent the sale of handgun bullets made of certain, specific hard metals capable of defeating soft armor vests worn by law enforcement officers.

A problem is that in applying to bullets that “may” be used in a handgun, the law applies to some rifle bullets. For that reason, in 2015—with then-president Barack Obama campaigning for a ban on AR-15s and similar rifles—the BATFE tried to ban M855, the second most commonly used bullet in those rifles. A possible fix would be to reword the law to apply to only hard-metal bullets “of a caliber and type originally designed and intended for use in a handgun.”

7. Repeal the GCA’s prohibition on using imported parts to assemble a semi-automatic rifle.

If it is legal to assemble a firearm with American-made parts, it should be legal to assemble the same type of firearm with imported parts.

8. Repeal the National Firearms Act’s (NFA) restrictions on “silencers.”

Pop music concert-goers may not care about hearing loss, but smart gun owners do. A “silencer” does not eliminate, but at least reduces the noise of gunfire, thereby protecting people’s hearing and making it easier to hear the safety-related instructions of range safety personnel.

9. Repeal the NFA’s restrictions on short-barreled rifles and remove shotguns from the NFA’s definition of “destructive device.”

The NFA was originally intended to restrict concealable firearms, particularly handguns. Yet short-barreled rifles are nowhere nearly as concealable as handguns, which are owned by tens of millions of Americans, and which 42 states respect the right of people to carry concealed away from home. Furthermore, short-barreled rifles are especially well-suited for defensive purposes, thus they are among the types of firearms quintessentially protected by the Second Amendment.

The NFA defines “destructive device” to include explosives, incendiaries, poison gases, bombs, grenades, rockets, missiles, and mines, but also firearms the internal barrel diameter of which exceeds one-half inch, which ends up including most shotguns. Shotguns are exempted only if the BATFE deems them “generally recognized as particularly suitable for sporting purposes.” Again, sports is not the reason people have the right to arms and the BATFE has repeatedly misinterpreted “sporting purposes” to ban politically disfavored firearms, including some shotguns.

10. Change the NFA’s definition of “machinegun” and repeal the 1986 ban on new “machineguns.”

The NFA defines “machinegun” as a firearm that fires “automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.” On the one hand, basing the definition upon how a firearm operates mechanically makes sense. If the definition were instead based on how fast a firearm could be fired, Democrats in Congress and the White House could by legislation, or a Democrat president could have the BATFE by regulation, whittle the acceptable firing rate down until we would be back to the single-shot firearms used to win the War for Independence

However, the NFA’s mechanism-based definition ends up lumping a lightweight, selective-fire rifle like an M4, an effective individual defense weapon, in the same category as a G.E. Mini-Gun, a heavy, multi-barreled, motorized Gatling Gun that can fire 6,000 rounds of ammunition in a minute and which is usually bolted to an airplane, helicopter, or some other motorized platform.

One possible solution would be to amend the NFA’s definition of “machinegun” to exclude rifles, amend its definition of “rifle” to include rifles capable of firing more than one shot with a single function of the trigger, excluding those intended to be crew-served weapons, and exclude “rifles” from the 1986 ban.

Additionally, to make it harder for the BATFE to misinterpret the law to define “machinegun” to include semi-automatics, the definition of “machinegun” could be amended to exclude “any semi-automatic firearm and any firearm not designed or modified to fire without its trigger resetting between shots.”

Be Careful What You Wish For

Attempts to change federal gun laws for the better should be approached with caution, however. If the necessary bills were introduced, Democrats would attempt to amend them for the worse before final passage and they might succeed.

That’s what happened before Congress approved the otherwise favorable Firearms Owners’ Protection Act of 1986. Without a roll call vote, and with many House members not on the floor, Democrats snuck through an amendment by Bill Hughes (D-N.J.) to prohibit new fully-automatic firearms, laying the groundwork for their campaign against semi-automatic firearms two and a half years later.

Yet for supporters of the right to arms there seems no other choice but to adopt an offensive strategy. Without victory, they will eventually suffer defeat.

Beto O’Rourke Flip-Flops On AR-15s,"During the third round of Democratic presidential debates, former Texas representative Beto O’Rourke said if he is elected president the government would “take your AR-15s,” a direct reversal from his claim in 2018 that people who have purchased AR-15s should keep them.

After sharing an emotional anecdote about children who died at the hands of a mass shooter in Odessa, Texas, on Sept. 1, O’Rourke said, “H-ll, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.”

O’Rourke began grandstanding on gun control during his opening statement, even going so far as to say the El Paso shooter was “inspired to kill by our president.”

On Aug. 3, in El Paso, Texas, two things became crystal clear for me. … The first is just how dangerous Donald Trump is — the cost and the consequence of his presidency. A racism and a violence that had long been a part of America was welcomed into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed, dozens more grievously injured by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place, inspired to kill by our president.

His enthusiastic declaration later in the debate that the federal government would confiscate semi-automatic weapons, however, contradicts a statement he made on “The Chad Hasty Show” in April 2018, less than a year and a half ago.

“I own an AR-15,” said host Chad Hasty. “A lot of our listeners own AR-15s. Why should they not have one?”

“Well, to be clear, they should have them. If you purchased that AR-15, if you own it, keep it. Continue to use it responsibly,” said O’Rourke. “I think Texas has a real opportunity to lead on this issue right now because we so jealously guard that Second Amendment. We believe in it. We’ll defend it.”

O’Rourke continued, “We have this proud, rich tradition of hunting, of owning guns for self-defense, for sport, for collection.”

“Doesn’t that punish the responsible gun owner?” asked Hasty. “Isn’t it punishing the good guys who are out there, the majority?”

“I don’t think so, and again, we support the Second Amendment. If you own a gun, keep that gun. Nobody wants to take it away from you — at least I don’t want to do that.”

Regardless of these statements, as a presidential candidate O’Rourke has continued to ramp up his gun control rhetoric, saying earlier Thursday that America’s financial institutions should be more active in curbing gun control.

“Credit cards have enabled many of America’s mass shootings in the last decade,” O’Rourke tweeted. “And with Washington unwilling to act, they need to cut off the sales of weapons of war today.”

After shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, last month, O’Rourke endorsed a federal gun confiscation program, or mandatory gun “buyback.” Additionally, the presidential candidate has begun raising money for March for Our Lives and Moms Demand Action, two gun control lobbying groups, by selling T-shirts emblazoned with “THIS IS F*CKED UP” repeated six times across the front as well as the words, “End gun violence now.”

Beto O’Rourke: Banks And Credit Cards Should Ban Gun Purchases,"2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke said Thursday that the nation’s financial institutions should take a more active role in curbing gun violence by prohibiting the purchase of firearms.

“Credit cards have enabled many of America’s mass shootings in the last decade,” O’Rourke wrote on Twitter. “And with Washington unwilling to act, they need to cut off the sales of weapons of war today.”

Shooters have indeed used credit cards to purchase weapons used in several mass shootings, according to a report by the New York Times. The Times reported last December that eight of the shootings that killed 10 or more people in the last decade included weapons financed on credit.

Many would argue, however, that mass shooters would find their weapons of destruction regardless of credit cards being allowed to purchase them, by withdrawing cash or getting the funds from somewhere else.

Regardless, some banks have already begun to distance themselves from gun manufacturers. Citigroup and Bank of America have both ended lending to and relationships with gunmakers.

O’Rourke’s encouragement for financial institutions to step in on gun control comes the same day the former congressman will appear on stage in Houston along with nine other White House rivals for the third Democratic presidential primary debate.

Since entering the race, O’Rourke has jump-started his campaign several times, the last time in August after taking a few days off the campaign trail following the mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso that killed 22 people. O’Rourke, who was already an avid supporter of stricter gun laws prior to his candidacy, has pivoted even further to the left on the issue since the El Paso massacre, endorsing a mandatory Australian-style gun “buy-back” program at the federal level.

Having made gun control an issue central to his candidacy, O’Rourke has ramped up the rhetoric on the issue, even using profanity on cable news and selling T-shirts with the words “THIS IS F*CKED UP,” repeated six times across the front followed by the text, “End gun violence now.”

"It’s Not The NRA Stopping Gun Control, It’s 100 Million U.S. Gun Owners","During the Reign of Terror, the most bloodthirsty member of France’s revolutionary government, Jean-Marie Collot d’Herbois, a “vehement, emotional and vulgar man, craving the center of the stage, dramatizing and gesticulating and bellowing when excited” (Ch. 7), called for the executions of “merchants.”

For Adolf Hitler and the German national socialist workers party, the enemy was instead “the Jew.” For Joseph Stalin, it was “the capitalists.” For Mao Zedong, “the bourgeoisie,” “the intellectuals,” and “the reactionary classes.” And for Che Guevara, “rich landowners.”

President Lyndon B. Johnson cannot be placed in the same category as those miscreants. Nevertheless, when the Gun Control Act of 1968 didn’t require the registration of all guns and the licensing of all gun owners as he had hoped, LBJ singularly blamed “the gun lobby.”

President Bill Clinton more specifically blamed “the NRA” when, after Congress imposed the firearm background check system and a nearly make-believe “ban” on “assault weapons,” 62 Democrats, including Speaker of the House Tom Foley, were defeated in the 1994 congressional elections, giving Republicans control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1954.

Pick The Target and Polarize It

Participants in this year’s Democrat presidential debates have also pointed their accusatory fingers at “the NRA,” along with a laundry list of other groups and individuals, including “corporations,” “big corporations,” “the 1 percent,” “big pharma,” “big insurance companies,” “the rich and powerful,” “those with money,” “the special interests,” “PACs,” “the Koch Brothers,” “Mitch McConnell,” and, of course, “Donald Trump.”

Meanwhile, in San Francisco, where vagrants reportedly cover the sidewalks with feces, urine, and needles—a condition aspired to for Austin, Texas, by its mayor, Steve Adler, and its like-minded city council—the Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a resolution labeling NRA a “terrorist organization.”

Throughout history, the left has achieved power by rallying its mob, and rallied its mob by giving it someone to hate. Vladimir Lenin encouraged “language which sows among the masses hate, revulsion, and scorn toward those who disagree with us,” Saul Alinsky advised radicals to “pick the target . . . and polarize it,” and leftists continue the practice today.

So, a few days ago, left-wing columnist Michael Tomasky wrote that the gun laws Democrats are now pushing can be imposed if “The NRA Can Be Beaten.” Having worked in the NRA’s political division from 1991 to 2016, I might laugh at Tomasky’s notion, if I had a sense of humor about such things. The left’s everyone-on-message vilification of “the NRA” may inspire high-pitched squeals of approval during the Democrats’ presidential debates and campaign rallies, but anyone who thinks that the NRA is all that stands in the way of disarming the people of the United States has another think coming.

It’s Not the Electoral College When You Lose Congressional Elections

Those 62 Democrats who were defeated in the 1994 elections didn’t lose just because of the several hundred of us who worked at NRA headquarters, nor even because of the NRA’s 1 million or so members at the time. There were 60 million other gun owners in America in 1994 and soon thereafter polls showed that more Americans identified with the NRA than with either major political party.

NRA’s membership roughly doubled to 3 million after Clinton and the Democrats imposed gun control and rose to 5 million after President Barack Obama tried to impose more gun control during his second term. There are now 100 million gun-owning Americans, and gun owners tend to be single-issue voters.

Tens of millions of Americans own handguns, which anti-gun activists tried to get banned in the 1970s and 1980s. Seventeen and a half million Americans have permits to carry handguns for protection away from home. A comparable number own semi-automatic rifles that Democrats in Congress have been trying to ban since 1989.

Since the 1990s, every time Democrats inside the Beltway have acted against the right to keep and bear arms, or threatened to do so, purchases of guns, particularly those that Democrats want most to ban, have soared. For example, in August, the first month of Democrats’ new push against guns, gun purchases increased roughly 16 percent, compared to the number in August 2018.

Yet Democrats believe they have reason to hope. Polls show support for some of the gun laws they are demanding, though support for gun control typically falls once the public becomes informed about the details and it has fallen this year. Also, some have recently claimed that there are internal troubles within the NRA, inspiring some of its detractors to speculate that the organization can now be defeated and gun control now be imposed.

Speculations about defeating “the NRA” may titillate the mob, but even if NRA disappeared overnight, there are still 100 million gun owners, their family members, and their friends. Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election because he won “swing states” Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Florida, all of which have large populations of gun owners. If gun control supporters achieve their goals, it will be because gun owners are complacent or don’t understand the details and ramifications of what Democrats are demanding, not because of rumors about the NRA.

Don’t Forget the Supreme Court

Conventional wisdom holds that you shouldn’t predict what the court might do in a specific case. But three of the justices who voted with the majority in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, are still on the court, and most observers think the most recent appointees to the court, Associate Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, have similar respect for the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms.

Heller observed that self-defense is an “inherent right” that is “central to the Second Amendment,” and ruled that the amendment protects “the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation” and “extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms.” One needn’t a crystal ball to conclude that might not bode well for state laws that impose unreasonable restrictions on carrying arms for protection or that ban firearms and ammunition magazines owned for the inherent right the amendment protects.

Confiscate Guns?

Finally, while “Beto” O’Rourke—another “vehement, emotional and vulgar man, craving the center of the stage, dramatizing and gesticulating and bellowing when excited”—says Americans would agree to hand over their semi-automatic rifles, the last time our government tried to confiscate guns from the people, it received a revolution in return.

As Meghan McCain said on “The View” several days ago—courageously taking a stand while Republican members of Congress we elected to protect our rights hide in the shadows—“If you’re talking about taking people’s guns away from them, there’s going to be a lot of violence.”

Or, as Alinsky observed, paraphrasing Lenin, the radical left cannot begin murdering its political opponents in the United States, because it’s the rest of us who have the guns.

The point is, if any of the 2020 Democratic candidates were going to be the one to reveal the unspoken truth behind their party’s real gun policy, it was always likely to be O’Rourke. And so far back is he now in the polls, that he really has nothing to lose by doing so.

But where are all the Democrats insisting, nay, demanding that nobody is trying to take away your guns? How has that strong talking point, excellently portrayed in this Washington Free Beacon super cut, been absent in the Democrats’ response to O’Rourke?

What has been telling in the days since O’Rourke said, “Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15s, AK-47s,” is the nature of the Democratic response. Nobody is attacking O’Rourke for a blatant attempt to violate the Second Amendment by seizing American’s guns. Rather, they are suggesting it’s bad politics at a time when more modest gun control measures could be realized.

Pete Buttigieg was asked on cable news if he agreed with Sen. Chris Coons, a Joe Biden supporter, that O’Rourke’s comment would be played at Second Amendment rallies for years to scare Americans into thinking Democrats want to take their guns.

Mayor Pete replied, “Look, right now we have an amazing moment on our hands. We have agreement among the American people not just for universal backgrounds checks, but we have a majority in favor of red-flag laws, high-capacity magazines, banning the new sale of assault weapons. This is a golden moment to finally do something.”

He said nothing about the right of the American people to own guns and be secure in their property, nothing about the impractical nature of a forced gun buy-back, in fact, no indication that he does not actually support the policy, but simply that he sees more modest gains as more reachable at the moment.

Two of the other 10 candidates on stage last week, Kamala Harris and Corey Booker, support a mandatory buy-back, despite it potentially being bad politics. Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York came out in support of it on CNN today. It received enormous cheers inside the debate venue; this is not some extreme Democratic Party policy position. It is the logical extension of their entire program on guns.

The reason the NRA and other gun rights organizations claim that Democrats’ end goal is to take away your guns is that the end goal of most Democrats is to take away your guns. They aren’t protesting O’Rourke’s position by saying it’s something we should never do; they are protesting the political timing of it.

It is as if pro-life organizations, in seeking limited restriction on abortion, pretended their end goal was not overturning Roe v. Wade and eliminating all or most abortion. Of course it is. The only way to solve the problem they are addressing, the killing of babies, is to put a ban on abortion, even if they work in the meantime to reduce its frequency through more modest measures.

Democrats are in exactly the same position on gun control, yet they refuse to admit it as if we can’t all see it. After New Zealand swiftly enacted new gun laws last year in the wake of the Christchurch shooting, Democrats almost in chorus asked why we couldn’t act so quickly and effectively. The main thrust of that New Zealand program was a mandatory buy-back, almost exactly what O’Rourke is calling for.

The only way gun violence could be reduced to the levels of other developed nations, the Democrats’ goal, is to adopt gun policies similar to theirs that include forced buy-backs. This is the crux of the whole gun control debate. Progressives believe that the uniquely American freedom to own powerful guns is outweighed by public safety concerns. Conservatives believe freedom is more valuable than safety.

Regardless of what Coons and Buttigieg think of the politics of O’Rourke’s loud threat to take away Americans guns, there is every reason to believe it announces a sea change in the gun debate. Gun confiscation is clearly on the table now in the Democratic Party. Frankly, it probably has been more secretly for many years. Wherever this fight over gun control leads, at least today we know where we really stand.

There’s No Difference Between Beto’s And Other Democrats’ Gun Bans,"By now, everyone who has had the time and inclination to pay attention to the Democrat presidential debates knows that during the third debate, on September 12, “Beto” O’Rourke bellowed that “we” are going to confiscate Americans’ semi-automatic rifles. Thereafter, Sen. Chris Coons and fellow presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, concerned that O’Rourke’s rant may decrease Democrats’ chances of getting gun control through Congress, tried to suggest that support for gun confiscation is an outlier in their party.

O’Rourke is indeed something of an outlier. He tried to run away from a car wreck he caused when he was driving under the influence. He wrote a story about having fun running over children with a car. Under the pseudonym “Psychedelic Warlord,” he wrote a poem, “The Song of the Cow,” that is too warped and vulgar to be quoted here.

After failing to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz, O’Rourke ate dirt that he thought had “regenerative powers.” He says America was founded on racism. He says reparations for slavery should be considered. He says felons should be allowed to vote while in prison. He says walls along our southern border should be torn down. He says we should eliminate the Electoral College. He says we are all going to die from “global warming” in 12 years. And he supports abortion with few, if any limits.

Coons and Buttigieg are wrong, of course. O’Rourke’s support for gun confiscation is not an outlier, it is pervasive in the Democrat Party. In addition to O’Rourke, at least four other Democrats who participated in the third debate have come out for confiscating guns too.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), leader of the effort in Congress to impose a ban that is much more severe than the anemic one she authored in the early 1990s, has also come out for confiscation. On December 5, 1995, on CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Feinstein said “there is no question that I would have preferred to see an outright ban on the possession of semi-automatic assault weapons in America” and “If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in, I would have done it.”

However we should not get distracted, counting which Democrats support banning new guns and magazines and which additionally support confiscating guns and magazines already owned. The most important take-away in all of this is that all 10 Democrats who participated in their party’s third presidential debate (and all members of Congress who support a “ban” in any form) advocate an end state in which everyone will be banned from possessing what are currently the most popular rifles, rifle magazines, and handgun magazines in America.

Here’s why. Five of those 10 candidates advocate an intergenerational ban—one that would prohibit the manufacture and sale of new guns and magazines, but allow current owners of the guns and magazines to keep them. The other five—former vice-president Joe Biden; Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker; and O’Rourke—are not willing to wait for current owners to die. They want those owners’ guns and magazines confiscated now. Thus in the long-term, there would be no difference between a ban on new guns and magazines, and a ban on existing guns and magazines too. Eventually, the result would be the same: No one would be allowed to possess the guns and magazines.

The same non-existent “divide” exists with the other big gun control issue on the front burner today—“universal” background checks. Democrats and a small number of Republicans (e.g., Sen. Pat Toomey and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick) advocate “universal” checks, a step toward transforming the background check system into a gun registry. Less patient Democrats advocate gun registration (and gun owner licensing) now, knowing it will be needed to enforce gun confiscation in the future. And, as noted, Biden, Sanders, Harris, Booker, and O’Rourke are even less patient, insisting that guns be confiscated now.

Supporters of the right to keep and bear arms should therefore oppose a non-confiscatory ban with the same vigor as one that includes confiscation. Current owners of the guns and magazines that Democrats want to ban should not be silent, on the grounds that a non-confiscatory ban wouldn’t affect them. If Republican members of Congress vote for a non-confiscatory ban, they cannot ask for gun owners’ votes in 2020 on the grounds that they didn’t vote for a confiscatory ban.

The Supreme Court might overturn a ban. But if a law prohibiting people from acquiring the best firearms and magazines for defensive purposes, including the core defensive purpose contemplated in the Second Amendment, were allowed to stand, there would be no barrier to prohibiting the possession of the new offensive and defensive weapons and related technologies that are being developed as we speak. Unless O’Rourke is right about “global warming,” the future is a very long time, and its fate begins now.

Why Expanded Background Checks Would Pave The Way For Gun Grabs,"On September 18, Attorney General William Barr, who in 1991 testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he supported banning “assault weapons” and imposing a waiting period on purchases of handguns, circulated an “Idea for New Unlicensed-Commercial-Sale Background Checks” on Capitol Hill.

Federally-licensed firearm dealers—gun stores, department stores that sell guns, etc.—are already required to conduct background checks on their customers. By current appearances, Barr’s “idea” proposes to expand the check requirement to “advertised commercial sales” by non-dealers and all sales by non-dealers at gun shows, but not to sales arranged informally, at locations other than gun shows, between people who know one another.

By comparison, H.R. 8, by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), proposes to require a background check on transfers of firearms between non-dealers more generally, including merely handing a firearm to someone in many circumstances, including some circumstances related to self-defense. It also prohibits young adults from acquiring handguns and contains many other onerous provisions.

President Trump may reject Barr’s “idea” because it would move Democrats closer to their goal of transforming the background check system into a gun registry, while Democrats may reject it because it wouldn’t move them there fast enough. In any case, instead of expanding the background check system, we should be working to get to the point at which the federal and state governments will be less certain, not more certain, who owns guns and which guns they own, thus less able to confiscate them.

As long as there is a background check system for gun purchases, Democrats will try to transform it into a firearm registry that can be used to enforce gun confiscation, which, in the case of semi-automatic rifles like the ubiquitous AR-15, five of the 10 leading Democrat presidential candidates publicly advocate. In fact, Democrats have been trying to transform the background check system into a gun registry since before the system was established.

The Journey of a Thousand Miles Begins with One Step

If the last sentence of the previous paragraph is confusing, some background is in order. The first civilian disarmament activist groups—other than the Democratic Party, most of the major TV news networks, news magazines such as Time and Newsweek, and newspapers such as the New York Times and Washington Post—were formed in the 1970s, hoping to capitalize on the momentum they believed was generated by imposition of the Gun Control Act of 1968.

At first, they and their politician and media allies campaigned for a ban on handguns. In 1976, one of the groups, the National Council to Control Handguns (NCCH), said, “[t]he first problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns being produced and sold in this country. The second problem is to get handguns registered. And the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition . . . totally illegal.”

Since Congress and the states refused to ban handguns, the disarmament activists resorted to a “Plan B” that focused on the first part of their three-part plan: slowing down handgun sales. Thus in 1979, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.) began introducing legislation proposing that handgun buyers be required to obtain a purchase permit from the police, be subject to a 21-day waiting period to purchase a handgun, and be limited to two handgun purchases per year.

Congress did not go for “Plan B” either, so in the late 1980s the activists went to “Plan C,” which called for “Plan B’s” waiting period, scaled back from 21 days to a week. In 1988, Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.) counter-proposed essentially the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) we have today. Because the system would allow a person with a clean record to pass a computerized check and buy a gun within a few minutes, the disarmament activists opposed it.

The debate between the waiting period and the instant check alternative ended up with the imposition of the Brady Act in 1993. The law imposed a waiting period of up to five business days on sales of handguns by dealers, but included an amendment, opposed by disarmament activists and many congressional Democrats, requiring that five years down the road, the waiting period requirement would cease in favor of NICS, which would screen not only purchasers of handguns, but purchasers of rifles and shotguns as well.

The Phony ‘Gun Show Loophole’

NICS went into operation at the end of November 1998. Earlier that month, however, President Bill Clinton complained that the law didn’t require background checks on people who buy firearms from non-dealers at gun shows, calling it a “loophole” in federal law. There was and is no “loophole,” because federal laws apply at shows just like they do anywhere else. Also, state prison inmate surveys by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the vast majority of inmates in prison for gun crimes acquired guns through theft, black market purchases, or acquaintances, while less than 1 percent got them from shows.

Furthermore, illegal firearm trafficking data accumulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives indicated that a large percentage of the acquaintances were straw purchasers, people who can pass a background check, who buy firearms for people who cannot pass a check. Contrary to the activists’ suggestion that criminals avoid the check by buying guns from non-licensed gun owners, the Bureau said “[t]he most frequent type of trafficking channel identified in ATF investigations is straw purchasing from federally-licensed firearms dealers. Nearly 50 percent . . . .”

Clinton was trying to help disarmament activists move the background check system one step closer to the second goal of their three-step plan: getting handguns (now all firearms) registered. Congress didn’t agree there was a “gun show loophole,” so in 2009 Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) introduced legislation to allow the FBI to retain records on people who pass background checks to buy guns anywhere, not just at gun shows. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) introduced similar legislation in 2013.

If those bills had become law, all that would have been required—and all that is required today—to transform the system into a registry would be for all gun transfers to be subject to a background check and for the records of those checks to be kept by the FBI and include the make, model, and serial number of the firearm for which the check was conducted.

There are other potential problems with Barr’s “idea.” For example, it would impose a record-keeping requirement on people who are not firearm dealers. The Gun Control Act imposed such requirements on only dealers, manufacturers, and importers. But any additional problems with Barr’s “idea” are beside the point. Any expansion of the background check system is movement in the wrong direction. Democrats’ ultimate goal is the prohibition of private gun ownership and any step in the direction of gun registration—however small—would get them closer to the gun confiscation regime they would like to impose.

"With The Help Of Media, Democrats Are Smearing The NRA","National Public Radio’s Tim Mak has been on the NRA-is-a-Russian-front beat for some time now. You may find a journalistic project predicated on a determined outcome a bit odd, but that’s how things seem to work these days.

The latest article in the series is headlined “NRA Was ‘Foreign Asset’ To Russia Ahead of 2016, New Senate Report Reveals,” and it reads like a partisan talking points memo, with not a single hint of skepticism to be found anywhere. The “report” itself, written by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, is larded with suspenseful prose that works to create the impression that completely legal and innocuous interactions are part of a nefarious plot. The only thing it “reveals” is that Senate Democrats have no qualms leveling tendentious claims and spreading conspiracy theories.

Wyden should have been asked two simple questions:

1: Where we can find evidence demonstrating that the National Rifle Association acted in the interests of the Russian government rather than the interests of its members or its core mission in defending gun rights? Surely a sitting senator wouldn’t accuse an advocacy group with millions of members of being a “foreign asset”—I mean, it’s right there on the cover!—without the presence of at least one corroborating piece of evidence. An email? A phone call? A witness?

2: Where in the report can we find evidence that backs up your long-held contention that Kremlin lackey Alexander Torshin or his sidekick Maria Butina—or anyone else, for that matter—“illegally funneled money to the National Rifle Association to help Donald Trump win the presidency” in 2016? Surely there’s a bank receipt or transaction record or a witness who supports this spectacular allegation? The FBI and former special counsel Robert Mueller, armed with subpoena powers and an unlimited scope, reportedly investigated the issue of Russian money and the NRA, and even they turned up nothing.

The answer is there is no such evidence. A full fisking of the document would be longer than the actual report. Although a reader really only needs to follow some of the footnotes to understand just how preposterous Wyden’s work really is. Take these two quick examples.

The Senate minority report claims that “public reporting throughout 2017 and 2018 characterized the NRA delegation’s December 2015 trip to Moscow as an NRA-authorized trip.” This is important for Wyden’s purposely convoluted narrative.

The footnote for this claim leads us to an article from the far-left Raw Story which, as it turns out, is just an aggregation of a speculative story in the liberal Daily Beast about how NRA and Russian officials met at a shooting competition. The Daily Beast article was written by Tim Mak, with information very likely provided him by Wyden.

So the meeting was “characterized” as official by “public reporting” because Senate Democrats characterized it that way.

In another section, the report states that Butina, the central player in Wyden’s tale, had been charged by the DOJ for trying to “gain access to American conservative organizations on behalf of the Russian Federation.”

Sounds pretty bad. When you follow the footnote, though, you find out that the DOJ press release doesn’t mention anything about “conservative” organizations or the NRA. Wyden uses “conservative” 19 times in a similar manner, although it appears zero times in the affidavit.

How do we know Butina and Torshin weren’t focusing solely on “conservative” organizations? Well, the duo met with all kinds of people in 2015, including Stanley Fischer, then Federal Reserve vice chairman, and Nathan Sheets, then Treasury undersecretary for international affairs in the Obama administration. (This tidbit is tucked into footnote 400 on page 73 of the 77-page report.)

Why on earth would two Obama nominees meet with a “convicted Russian agent now in federal prison” and a “sanctioned Russian oligarch”?

Events can really sound suspicious when you retroactively attach convictions onto characters in your stories from 2015. Yet Butina is cited 338 times in the report, and most often her involvement is framed as if everyone interacting with her should have known that she was a Russian superspy.

Then again, even her criminality is conveniently shaded, heavily leaning on early accusations rather than her actual conviction. While it’s true that Butina is now serving an 18-month prison term on a count of conspiracy, she was never convicted of espionage, or of bundling illegal funds, or of illegally gaining access to “conservative organizations,” or of violating Russian sanctions, or even of taking Russian funds to operate in the United States.

Federal prosecutors had initially accused Butina of using sex to gain influence—“Maria Butina, Suspected Secret Agent, Used Sex in Covert Plan,” read a titillating New York Times headline. They were forced to walk back that allegation, as well. As James Bamford noted in his excellent article in The New Republic:

The inquiry by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the FBI’s surprise raid on Butina’s apartment also failed to turn up anything incriminating. Years of physical surveillance, which, according to a knowledgeable source, included secretly following her to interviews, at a cost of perhaps $1 million or more, also came up empty.

Then again, even if Vlad Putin was signing Butina’s checks and personally instructing her to infiltrate the NRA for Donald Trump, nothing in the report shows that anyone at the NRA knew, or that anyone changed direction, or that any money was laundered, or even that anyone took Butina very seriously.

Wyden also wants you to believe Torshin anticipated Trump’s run for president, and so decided to become a lifetime member by openly supporting the organization back in 2012, paying no more than his minimal dues for years while patiently waiting to infiltrate the United States government.

Now, NRA officials were clearly interested in having better ties with a Russian pro-gun groups (and I’m highly suspicious of the idea that Putin is interested in the masses owning firearms.) Maybe it was a bad idea. But before the Russia paranoia broke after Trump’s win in 2016, it certainly wasn’t a big deal.

What’s clear from the report is that Wyden’s real goal is to strip the NRA of not-for-profit status, hampering its ability to effectively lobby on gun policy. The only marginally new information the report digs up are some emails from NRA staff helping officials with visas, itineraries, and personal business during their trip to a Moscow pro-gun event. It is illegal for tax-exempt organizations to use funds for the personal benefit of its officials “significantly” outside their stated missions.

What NRA officials may have done—although the evidence is murky, at best—might be enough for a fine. Moreover, there probably isn’t a single tax-exempt organization in America whose support staff has not helped its leadership in some small personal capacity. Hardly the stuff of “foreign assets.” But if that’s the new standard we’re holding advocacy groups to, count me in.

Of course, no sane person believes that Wyden takes umbrage with the NRA for failing to single-mindedly “advance the NRA’s tax-exempt purpose.” The very reason Wyden is trying to smear the NRA is because they advance gun rights.

Perhaps one day we’re going to learn that Wayne Lapierre has a big red phone on his desk that is a direct line to Kremlin and open line of credit for unlimited Rubles. Though there is this wacky competing theory that the NRA supported Trump in 2016 because he was the pro-gun rights candidate, and Hillary Clinton, his opponent, was the anti-gun rights candidate, who when asked which “enemy” she was most proud of, named the gun rights organization.

What I do know is that most people who conduct a year-long investigation that produces no corroboration for their explosive claims would move on. If you’re a Washington Democrat, though, a lack of evidence only tells you it’s time to double down with more hyperbolic claims. Because you know well that most media outlets will pass on your rank speculation without any skepticism.

Newsom Fiddles With Pointless Gun Restrictions While California Burns,"California is literally on fire. Power is being cut to millions. There’s rampant homelessness. Gas prices are skyrocketing. Taxes are among the highest in the nation.

Meanwhile, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom fiddles with guns. Newsom signed a raft of gun control bills, 15 of them to be exact, including limiting law-abiding Californians’ right to buy a gun to just one per month.

Along with the nation’s widest-ranging so-called “red-flag” law that allows nearly anyone to call for seizure of a private citizen’s firearms that even the American Civil Liberties Union won’t support and former governor Jerry Brown rejected, Newsom is demonstrating he’s more interested in settling political scores and pursuing far-left ideologies than actually governing.

California already has among the strictest gun laws in nation. Previous to this, Californians could only buy one handgun per month, with a ten-day-waiting period to pick up the gun once it is purchased and a ban on modern sporting rifles. Earlier this year, the state required background checks to buy ammunition.

The latest gun laws are drawing ire even before the ink has dried on Newsom’s signature. The new laws will:

Enact age-based gun bans for adults under the age of 21 who want to purchase centerfire rifles.

Ban gun shows at the Del Mar Fairgrounds.

Eliminate the state’s $100 cap for concealed-carry permit fees (making the fee limitless).

Require “precursor parts” (including unfinished lower receivers, barrels, and triggers) to be sent to a licensed dealer for background checks and fees to be assessed.

Expand so-called “red-flag” laws to allow school administrators, employers, and co-workers to petition courts to have firearms confiscated.

Expand extreme risk protection orders from one-to-five years, allows courts to issue simultaneous search warrants, eliminating the right to due process.

Even the ACLU, hardly a gun-loving organization, said the last one was too much for them. They said it “poses a significant threat to civil liberties.” Brown, who loved to sign gun control laws, rejected similar legislation twice.

The FBI’s most recent crime report showed, again, that crime continues to drop even as firearms ownership grows. Yet Newsom falsely claims that lawful gun owners are the biggest threat to California’s safety.

Not California gang crime. Not the wildfires raging outside of Los Angeles, San Fernando Valley, Santa Clarita, and Riverside County. Not the homelessness plaguing urban centers. Not even the state’s power company shutting off electricity to millions. Instead of working on answers Californians need, Newsom is playing a distraction blame game.

Newsom would rather fiddle with repetitive gun laws than tackle the issues facing California. The only thing left would be to turn the lights out, but he’s got that covered too.

Why Abortion Apologists Like Jen Gunter Keep Lying About Babies,"Why did the religious leaders of Christ’s day put him to death? Most Christians would probably tell you it was because they hated him for claiming to be the Son of God. But this isn’t entirely correct. Rather, it’s a bit more accurate to say that the Pharisees, chief priests, and scribes hated Christ because they didn’t want Him to be the Son of God.

These men knew Jesus had spent much of the last three years ticking off box after box on the “Hey guys, I’m the Messiah” checklist—healing the sick, casting out demons, and raising the dead, to name a few examples. Likewise, in his final theological throw-down with the Pharisees, Jesus showed them quite clearly from the scriptures that the messiah (read: He) was not merely David’s son, but also God’s Son.

But because the Pharisees, chief priests, and scribes didn’t like the implications of Christ’s divinity, they chose to ignore every proof of it. Acknowledging Christ’s divinity would have robbed them of both their esteem in the eyes of men and the glory the imagined they had in the eyes of God, so they simply treated Christ’s miracles and superior teaching as though they weren’t real.

In spite of all the evidence, they simply said to themselves, “It’s bad for us that this is true, so it’s not true.” To flip Ben Shapiro’s famous saying on its head, their feelings didn’t care about the facts.

What Christ’s opponents did was, of course, ungodly, but this tactic is hardly uncommon. It’s something sinners in every generation do when the truth robs them of the righteousness they imagine they have or when the facts force them to stare the hideousness of their sins in the face.

A good example of this is found in a barrage of tweets from Dr. Jennifer Gunter, an OB/GYN, author, and acid-tongued abortion apologist. (Let me apologize in advance to my mom for sharing the profane rants of a woman I’m sure is smart enough to express herself in a more dignified manner). Presumably in response to some proposed pro-life legislation, Gunter recently tweeted the following:

A fetus is not a baby.

A fetus is not an unborn or a preborn baby or child.

If your goal is to legislate medical care you have to use medical terminology.

I will fucking call you out each and every time. — Jennifer Gunter (@DrJenGunter) October 16, 2019

In response, Greg Locke, pastor of Global Vision Bible Church and winner of 2019’s “Yikes, Dude, Maybe You’re Not the Guy to be Leading the Charge Here” award, said the following:

https://twitter.com/pastorlocke/status/1184907708073414656

Gunter shot back:

Dear Jen, have any of the anti-choicers actually replied to tell you how they work to protect pregnant women and babies? I seriously doubt it but I’m curious. — Truth-Telling Woman (@think_teach1) October 17, 2019

And, finally, for good measure, added this:

In summary, Gunter appears to be saying, “Hey pro-life people, there’s no medical evidence that a fetus is a human being and there’s no evidence that you’re actually committed to caring for pregnant women and the children they birth.” Both of these accusations, however, are absurd.

With regard to the “pro-lifers don’t science” claim, there is an Everestian amount of evidence that life begins at conception—so much, in fact, that most abortion apologists have moved the goal posts away from “it’s not a human being” to “Fine, it’s a human being but it’s not a person.” Gunter, however, employs a less clever trick to ignore the evidence for abortion’s immorality. She insists that a fetus isn’t a human child because “fetus” is a different word than “baby.”

“Fetus,” however, is not the cold, unfeeling, clinical term that Gunter implies. It’s simply the Latin term for “offspring,” a term we use to describe still-gestating human beings, in the same way that we call newborn human beings “infants,” two-year-olds “toddlers,” and 13-year-olds “pituitary catastrophies.”

Furthermore, Gunter doesn’t seem to understand how words work. The names we give things may reflect their value, but they don’t impart value to them. Even if “fetus” meant “glob of cells that you can totally evacuate from a woman’s uterus with no moral hesitation,” that doesn’t actually make a fetus a glob of cells that you can totally evacuate from a woman’s uterus with no moral hesitation.

Likewise, with regard to the “pro-lifers don’t really care about helping people” canard, Christian organizations dominate the list of America’s 100 largest charities. Individual Christians are more charitable than their secular neighbors. Pro-life believers, congregations, and church bodies build hospitals, crisis pregnancy centers, shelters for women and children, and various other ministries that give aid to parents and young children in need. Christians are more likely than the rest of the country to become adoptive parents and foster parents.

Should Christians be even more committed to these things than they are now? Sure. Is there always room for improvement? Of course. But for abortion apologists like Gunter to act as though Christians are all clearly all talk and no action despite the unyielding supply of evidence would be like Prometheus denying the existence of birds every day while the eagle ate his liver.

If the pro-life position is actually in keeping with the scientific evidence, then she has been supporting something truly evil.

Surely Gunter is smart enough to realize that the thylacine didn’t become a feline when people started calling it a Tasmanian tiger. Why, then, does she pretend that refusing to call a fetus a baby stops it from being a human life worth protecting?

Likewise, she’s certainly educated enough to realize that “St. Mary’s Hospital” and “Grace Church’s Food Bank” probably weren’t built by NARAL or Planned Parenthood. Why, then, does Gunter act as though these institutions don’t exist?

The answer is simple. Just like the Pharisees, chief priests, and scribes who rejected the divinity of Jesus, she ignores all the evidence in favor of the pro-life cause because she doesn’t like the implications of that truth.

If the pro-life position is actually in keeping with the scientific evidence, then she has been supporting something truly evil. If “fetus” and “baby” aren’t mutually exclusive terms, then the pro-lifers have been right all along when they’ve said that “terminating a fetus” is just a sterilized-through-medical-jargon way of saying “killing a human being.”

If pro-lifers are on the right side of this issue, she won’t be able to escape from the judgment of God. So to avoid being exposed, she hides behind her medical degree and dismisses the arguments of any pro-lifers without one.

To avoid being exposed, she hides behind her medical degree and dismisses the arguments of any pro-lifers without one.

Likewise, if pro-lifers aren’t all a bunch of hypocrites who deserve to be ignored, then they’re real people whose beliefs should be taken seriously. If pro-lifers are actually living according to their principles, then those principles might actually be the ones we’re supposed to hold. If pro-lifers aren’t demons, then they might well be on the side of the angels. And if that’s true, that would confirm the deepest fears of the most ardent abortion cheerleaders—that they’ve been the bad guys the whole time.

But perpetual denial need not be the fate of Gunter and everyone else who responds to the wisdom and love of pro-lifers like the way the enemies of Christ responded to the resurrection of Lazarus. Just as Jesus died for the Pharisees and promised His eternal mercy to those who once denied His divinity, so Jesus died for the abortion apologists and promises complete forgiveness for those who once denied the dignity of their littlest neighbors.

No matter how much unborn blood abortionists and their enablers have shed, all of that has been erased in the blood that poured out of Christ’s veins at Calvary. No matter how much time they’ve spent pretending the truth didn’t exist, those who look to the cross will find that they’ve been set free by the truth of Christ’s love.

Whenever those who spent years in unbelief come to the faith, they will find that they no longer need to employ denial to hide from the wrath of God because all that wrath is gone—poured out upon the head of God’s only begotten Son who came to be the Savior of Pharisee and apostle, abortionist and abortion victim alike.

"On Laws, Guns, And Freedom, Bureaucrats Fight To Overrule The People","With just over a month left before the Supreme Court’s scheduled December sitting, Second Amendment activists are eagerly anticipating the first major hearing on gun rights since the high court struck down Chicago’s handgun ban in 2010. At issue is an onerous New York City ban on the transportation of legally-owned handguns between residences or shooting ranges located beyond municipal borders. And while New York lawmakers tried to rescind their dictate in the face of a near certain judicial reversal, the pending case highlights an increasingly concerning trend in state, federal, and foreign affairs.

What we in the US are seeing now, and have ever since Donald Trump was elected, is an attempt by Democrats to weaponize the legal system to further a nakedly political agenda. New York lawmakers want to cudgel the Bill of Rights with ill-conceived regulations, and Congressional partisans are set on twisting impeachment proceedings into the reversal of a free election. Such heavy handed government tactics are not limited to elites in the United States.

In Britain also, we are seeing all the proper people doing everything in their power to nullify Brexit, called for by a popular vote.

And we also saw people in Europe run over by their “betters” in the lead-up to the European Union. The French people voted not to join—obviously the wrong decision, and so obviously the wrong decision that the French rulers decided to vote again. That is, the rulers decided that they would vote again, and get it right. So they repaired to—the symbolism is pungent (pungent with the smell of blood)—they repaired to Versailles where they voted to join the EU.

To visit Versailles is to understand regicide.

In Ireland too, the people voted by 54.3 percent not to join the EU (Barack Obama got 52.9 percent of American votes). Having gotten it wrong (a “triumph of ignorance”), they were compelled by their betters to vote again. The second vote was in favor of joining. Why wasn’t there a third vote, or a fourth, or a fifth vote? The answer is, because the rulers decided that on the second vote the people had gotten it right by endorsing the rulers’ position.

All those actions were perfectly legal.

In the US, the current crisis (“Ukrainegate?”) was originally provoked by a “whistleblower” law, a law that gives any disgruntled bureaucrat the power to throw monkey wrenches into the workings of government. A still-unknown individual, but one rumored to be a partisan Democrat, operating solely on hearsay (as we understand it at this point, the whistleblower hadn’t heard the conversation, and hadn’t read the transcript), claimed that President Trump had said something wrong in a telephone conversation with the president of Ukraine.

Yet now the nation is convulsed; impeachment hangs in the air; the nation’s needs will be ignored; no legislation will be passed for the next year or more; the whistleblower’s charge will be examined; and the House will probably vote to impeach the president. Of course, the Senate will not vote to convict, so the whole thing is a grande charade. All perfectly legal.

It should remind us of the Watergate movie, where a president who had won a landslide victory only months before—60.7 percent of the popular vote and 49 states—was toppled by left-wing Democrats and their media allies getting even for Nixon’s having nailed Alger Hiss, the Left’s darling who (uh, oh) turned out to be a Soviet spy. Note that the Watergate putsch was perfectly legal.

At the same time all this is happening, left-wing pols and some Republican dupes (no, Virginia, not all Republicans are dupes) are calling for gun control. Energy exploration and production expert Hunter Biden’s father, Joe Biden, wants a ban on all military-style weapons as well as a ban on high-capacity (i.e., more than one round!) magazines; and also more “red flag” laws.

Red flag laws, currently on the books in 15 states, allow police, family members, and others (e.g., cranky neighbors) who fear (or say they fear) that a gun owner has become dangerous, to file a seizure warrant for that person’s weapons, reversing the burden of proof: the gun owner is presumed dangerous and has to prove he is not—making a travesty of both the Sixth and Second Amendments.

As of now, there is no national gun registry, but Democrats dream of creating one so officials can confiscate the firearms of dangerous people. Like you.

Not a good idea in a country where people aspire to be free.

The history of Venezuela’s gun control is instructive. In 2012 the Venezuelan National Assembly enacted the “Control of Arms, Munitions and Disarmament Law,” with the explicit aim to “disarm all citizens.” There were only a few objections, from some pro-democracy opposition figures. After the law took effect, there was a months-long amnesty program that encouraged Venezuelans to trade in their arms for electrical goods. Only 37 (!) guns were surrendered voluntarily. Thousands were confiscated by force. In 2014 Chavez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, is said to have spent more than $47 million enforcing the gun ban. Now, as we have seen, the disarmed populace has no chance of defeating the Maduro thugs.

And it was all perfectly legal.

As it could be here.

Laws written on paper aren’t enough to keep a people free. Freedom has to be written in their hearts as well.

Bernie Can’t Keep His Position On Banning ‘Assault Weapons’ Straight,"On Sunday, during a campaign appearance in Iowa, Bernie Sanders broke with several other current and former candidates for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination by saying that he disagrees with confiscating “assault weapons” from their owners. Using the Democrats’ term for such a scheme, Sanders said, “a mandatory buyback is essentially confiscation, which I think is unconstitutional.”

“Buyback” is, of course, a euphemism and misnomer. The government did not sell Americans their “assault weapons,” the term civilian disarmament activists gave to various semi-automatic firearms in the 1980s. Therefore, it could not buy them “back.” Also, confiscating guns would not be confiscation “essentially,” it would be confiscation per se.

More importantly, however, Sanders’ position that confiscation of those firearms is unconstitutional is incompatible with his position that their new manufacture and acquisition should be outlawed. If it is unconstitutional to prohibit people from keeping firearms they already own, it must necessarily be unconstitutional to prohibit people from acquiring the same firearms in the future.

This is particularly the case with firearms best suited for defensive purposes, particularly the defensive purpose contemplated in the Second Amendment. Disarmament activists and most of the Democrats running for president say that “assault weapons” should be banned because they are particularly useful for combat, or words to that effect, but that only emphasizes the unconstitutionality of a ban on those guns.

In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court recognized “the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation,” which “extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms.” It cited its decision in U.S. v. Miller (1939), which recognized the right to keep and bear arms that have a “reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,” including arms the use of which “could contribute to the common defense,” which certainly would include semi-automatic rifles like the ubiquitous AR-15.

More important than the unconstitutionality of banning the most useful arms for individual defensive purposes would be the immorality of prohibiting people from possessing the means with which to defend themselves, their freedom, and their liberty. Some people say the amendment “confers” the right to keep and bear arms, and every so often a frustrated civilian disarmament advocate calls for the amendment’s repeal, thinking that would end the right to arms, but both are wrong. With or without the amendment, the people have the right to defend themselves with arms.

As the Supreme Court said in U.S. v. Cruikshank (1876), the right to arms “is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it dependent upon that instrument for its existence.” Likewise, in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the court said, “The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it ‘shall not be infringed.’” Heller also ruled that self-defense is a “fundamental” and “inherent right.”

It is possible that Sanders believes confiscating guns is unconstitutional because, as he said, it would require going into people’s homes to seize the guns. Perhaps he thinks that would be unconstitutional via some interpretation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, rather than because of the Second.

It is also possible that Sanders believes that banning the manufacture of some guns is constitutional so long as not all guns would be banned. That was the District of Columbia’s argument, defending its handgun ban in Heller. However, striking down D.C.’s handgun ban, Heller said, “It is no answer to say, as petitioners do, that it is permissible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms (i.e., long guns) is allowed,” because the right extends to arms “in common use” and, as noted above, “all instruments that constitute bearable arms.”

It is even possible that Sanders thinks that feigning a distinction between a ban with confiscation and one without will help him win a few votes from gun owners who don’t care what happens to Americans in the future, or even what happens to their guns after they die, so long as they get to keep their guns while they are still alive. More likely, Sanders realizes that the serious and not-so-serious contenders for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination advocate such radically leftist policies that they have virtually no chance of being elected president as things currently stand.

By opposing something as dangerous as raiding people’s homes to confiscate guns—the modern equivalent of the event that provoked the American Revolution—Sanders may limit his chance of winning the nomination of a party increasingly dominated by leftists as radical as the Jacobins of late-18th-century France. But without some appearance of sanity on at least one important issue, Sanders may realize, whatever his chance of winning the nomination, he has no chance of winning the general election.

"Is Kavanaugh, SCOTUS, Or First Circuit Right About 2nd Amendment?","In April, in Worman v. Healey, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, on appeal from the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, upheld Massachusetts’ ban on “assault weapons” and ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Worman has been appealed to the Supreme Court, which will soon decide if it will take the case.

If the Supremes take the case, it will be interesting to see how they deal with it, not only for the obvious reason, but also because the district and appeals courts disregarded the high court’s rulings in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), which struck down D.C.’s laws banning handguns and having any firearm in operable condition within the home, and McDonald v. Chicago (2010), which ruled that handgun bans are unconstitutional nationwide.

On the one hand, Heller found that the Second Amendment protects a “fundamental” right that, as the court observed in U.S. v. Cruikshank (1876), existed before the Constitution was adopted. Heller described it as “the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation,” including “all instruments that constitute bearable arms.” (Of course, the amendment protects the right not only to “weapons,” but to “arms,” which Webster’s dictionary of 1828, cited by Heller, defined as “weapons of offense and armor for defense.”)

However, Heller erred in ways that could threaten the right to arms via Worman and beyond. As if the opinion were written by multiple people who gave no deference to what his or her co-authors had written—and it may have been—Heller contradicted its “all instruments” declaration, imposing two unsupportable limitations on the types of arms the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear.

The Supreme Court Misread Itself

As I have noted previously, Heller mischaracterized the court’s decision in U.S. v. Miller (1939) as holding that the Second Amendment protects the right to only such arms as are “in common use.” Instead, Miller cited the Tennessee Supreme Court’s decision in Aymette v. State (1840), that the Tennessee constitution protected the right to arms “usually employed in civilized warfare and that constitute the ordinary military equipment.” On that basis, Miller said the Second Amendment protects the right to arms that have a “reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,” those that are “part of the ordinary military equipment,” and others the use of which “could contribute to the common defense.”

The first and third of Miller’s standards would encompass semi-automatic so-called “assault weapons” and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds used by civilians, including the unorganized component of the militia of the United States (see 10 U.S.C. 311). All three standards would encompass fully-automatic M16-series rifles and the same magazines used by the military and the militia’s organized component (the National Guard, when not under the plenary control of the federal government, per the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision in Perpich v. Department of Defense, 1990).

Heller also claimed that the M16 can be banned from private possession because over time the private possession of fully-automatic firearms has been incrementally restricted to the point of being now almost entirely banned. But that contradicts Heller’s “common use” standard, because the M16 is the rifle most “in common use” by the military and organized militia.

The “common use” standard also makes no sense. In his dissent in Heller, Justice Stephen Breyer ridiculed the notion, saying “the majority determines what regulations are permissible by looking to see what existing regulations permit. There is no basis for believing that the Framers intended such circular reasoning.” Similarly, in Worman the First Circuit cited the Seventh Circuit’s decision in a separate case, that “it would be absurd to say that the reason why a particular weapon can be banned is that there is a statute banning it.”

Furthermore, Heller mischaracterized “dangerous and unusual weapons” statutes. As Second and Fourteenth Amendment scholar Stephen Halbrook has explained, those laws did not prohibit the possession, nor, as Heller claimed, the carrying of any arms, but instead prohibited the use of arms in a terrorizing manner.

District Court Ruling Parrots Anti-Gun Activists’ Propaganda

In Worman, district court judge William G. Young upheld Massachusetts’ ban not by disputing whether the firearms and magazines in question are “in common use,” but on the notion that semi-automatic rifles are close enough to fully-automatic rifles that they might as well be considered one and the same. That idea originated in the first chapter of a 2003 publication by the anti-gun activist group that in 1988 proposed that gun control activists adopt “assault weapons” as a “new topic” to “strengthen the handgun restriction lobby.” A representative of the group was one of the Democrat witnesses during Democrats’ House Judiciary Committee hearing on “assault weapons” in September. (See items 5, 8, and 9 here.)

The First Circuit upheld Massachusetts’ ban on a different basis, perhaps realizing that because Heller clearly distinguished between fully-automatic firearms and all others, as do federal and state laws, the Supreme Court would reject the district court’s ruling out of hand. Noting Heller’s “common use” standard, it said that “as of 2013, nearly 5,000,000 people owned at least one semiautomatic assault weapon” and “between 1990 and 2015, Americans owned approximately 115,000,000” of the magazines. (Magazines that hold more than 10 rounds outnumber “assault weapons” primarily for two reasons: They are standard equipment not only for “assault weapons,” but also for many other firearms, mostly handguns, and it is typical for a person to own multiple magazines for a single firearm.)

However, the First Circuit did not consider such numbers sufficient for it to rule that the guns and magazines are “in common use.” So, it claimed that Heller said the “core” of the right to keep and bear arms is self-defense “in the home,” then said Massachusetts’ ban “does not heavily burden” defense within the home because it “does not ban the sale, transfer, or possession of all semiautomatic weapons, nor does it impose any restrictions on magazines that are designed to hold ten rounds or fewer.”

Concluding that intermediate scrutiny was the appropriate standard of review in Worman, it said that while “the time-honored right of individuals to bear arms in self-defense . . . is protected in varying degrees by the Second Amendment,” “the interests of state and local governments in regulating the possession and use of such weapons are entitled to great weight.”

Judicial Activism Gone Rogue

Put simply, the First Circuit lied about what Heller and McDonald said about the “core” of the right to arms, thumbed its nose at their guidance on how to evaluate gun bans, and mischaracterized the Second Amendment.

First, Heller did not say that the “core” of the right to arms is self-defense “in the home.” Having referred to “the core lawful purpose of self-defense” in general, Heller said (and McDonald reiterated) that “self-defense [is] the central component of the right.” Heller only noted that it is in “the home where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute,” because “in the home” was what the case was about; D.C. had refused the plaintiff’s request to have a handgun in his D.C. home. As Heller said in its opening sentence, “We consider whether a District of Columbia prohibition on the possession of usable handguns in the home violates the Second Amendment to the Constitution.”

Second, Heller preemptively rejected the First Circuit’s argument that Massachusetts can ban some semi-automatic firearms and some magazines because it does not ban all of them. In striking down D.C.’s handgun ban, Heller said, “It is no answer to say, as petitioners do, that it is permissible to ban the possession of handguns so long as the possession of other firearms (i.e., long guns) is allowed.”

Additionally, Heller preemptively rejected the First Circuit’s notion that the right to keep and bear arms should be balanced against government’s claimed interest in banning guns and magazines. McDonald did so as well, saying Heller “expressly rejected the argument that the scope of the Second Amendment right should be determined by judicial interest balancing.” Heller said:

We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding ‘interest-balancing’ approach. The very enumeration of the right [to arms] takes out of the hands of government—even the Third Branch of Government—the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges’ assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all. Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad.

Finally, relative to the First Circuit’s idea that the Second Amendment protects the right to arms to “varying degrees,” there are no varying degrees indicated in the amendment’s command that “the right . . . shall not be infringed.”

Enter Justice Brett Kavanaugh

In 2011, thus after Heller and McDonald but before Worman, then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh dissented from the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Heller v. District of Columbia (“Heller II”), which upheld the District’s “assault weapon” ban. “Our sole job is to faithfully apply Heller and the approach it set forth for analyzing gun bans and regulations,” Kavanaugh wrote.

He asked: “Are gun bans and regulations to be analyzed based on the Second Amendment’s text, history, and tradition . . . . Or may judges re-calibrate the scope of the Second Amendment right based on judicial assessment of whether the law advances a sufficiently compelling or important government interest to override the individual right?” Kavanaugh answered, “Heller and McDonald leave little doubt that courts are to assess gun bans and regulations based on text, history, and tradition, not by a balancing test such as strict or intermediate scrutiny.” (McDonald said “Heller makes it clear that this right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”)

Guns are obviously ‘arms,’ as are magazines, because firearms for which they are designed will not work without them.

At first glance, a view based upon “history and tradition” would clearly favor the right to semi-automatic firearms and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Semi-automatic firearms and detachable ammunition magazines were introduced in the late 19th century, magazines holding more than 10 rounds were introduced in the early 20th century, and popular semi-automatic handguns and rifles using magazines of more than 10 rounds were introduced in the 1930s and 1940s respectively. The M1 Carbine and the AR-15, rifles Massachusetts bans as “assault weapons,” were introduced in 1942 and 1963, respectively.

One might note that an evaluation of a gun law based upon text might reach a different conclusion than one based upon history and tradition, depending on when history and tradition are thought to have begun. For example, prior to the adoption of the federal and state constitutions, it was legal to carry concealed handguns. However, in the 1800s some states prohibited the practice. Then, in the 20th century most states that had prohibited concealed carry rescinded those prohibitions in favor of carry permit systems, and today one-third of the states don’t even require a permit to carry concealed.

One might also note that a conclusion based upon text alone is sufficient unless there is reasonable doubt about what the text means. For example, in traffic court there would be no need to go beyond the text of a law that “the speed limit in school zones shall be 20 miles per hour,” unless someone could reasonably question the distance covered by a mile, the duration of time covered by an hour, or how to count to 20. In evaluating Massachusetts’ gun and magazine ban against the text of the Second Amendment, guns are obviously “arms,” as are magazines, because firearms for which they are designed will not work without them.

In the case of Massachusetts’ gun and magazine ban, the amendment’s text alone would be insufficient only if one asks whether “the right” includes the modern equivalent of the muskets, powder horns, and lead balls the right to which was beyond question when the Second Amendment was ratified in 1791. Because the firearms and magazines banned by Massachusetts give an individual today even less ability to defeat tyranny—the purpose contemplated in the Second Amendment—than an American armed with a musket had in 1791, the answer to any such question must necessarily be “yes.”

As Heller said, obviously thinking of gun control supporters’ claim that “the Founding Fathers couldn’t envision ‘assault weapons’”:

Some have made the argument, bordering on the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment. We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.

Heller might also have noted that the Founding Fathers did envision those who would try to disarm the people to obtain control over them, hence their adoption of the Second Amendment.

On the interaction between text, history, and tradition, as well as on the First Circuit’s idea that the Second Amendment protects the right to arms “in varying degrees,” the case of Bliss v. Commonwealth (1822) is instructive. Kentucky’s constitution provided “that the right of the citizens to bear arms in defence of themselves and the state, shall not be questioned.”

Ignoring its constitution, the Kentucky legislature thereafter prohibited carrying “a pocket pistol, dirk, large knife, or sword in a cane, concealed as a weapon.” But it did not do so for long. Said the Kentucky Supreme Court:

To be in conflict with the constitution, it is not essential that the act should contain a prohibition against bearing arms in every possible form; it is the right to bear arms in defence of the citizens and the state that is secured by the constitution, and whatever restrains the full and complete exercise of that right, though not an entire destruction of it, is forbidden by the explicit language of the constitution.

As the U.S. Supreme Court would say about the Second Amendment in U.S. v. Cruikshank in 1876, the Kentucky court recognized that “the right” preexisted their state constitution. It continued:

The right existed at the adoption of the constitution; it had then no limits short of the moral power of the citizens to exercise it, and it in fact consisted in nothing else but in the liberty of the citizens to bear arms. Diminish that liberty, therefore, and you necessarily restrain the right; and such is the diminution and restraint, which the act in question most indisputably imports, by prohibiting the citizens wearing weapons in a manner which was lawful to wear them when the constitution was adopted. . . . For, in principle, there is no difference between a law prohibiting the wearing concealed arms, and a law forbidding the wearing such as are exposed; and if the former be unconstitutional, the latter must be so likewise.

Were those Kentucky justices with us today, and given the opportunity to strike down Massachusetts’ ban, no doubt they would do so with a vengeance. Whether there are five votes on the Supreme Court to do the same remains to be seen.

African Americans Aren’t The Only People Democrats Want To Disarm,"Democrats running for president may have realized they angered voters by calling for gun bans and confiscation earlier this year, because they barely mentioned the subject in their November debate. However, as Ecclesiastes 1:9 reminds us, “What has been is what will be . . . there is nothing new under the sun.”

In the post-bellum South, Democrats prohibited blacks from possessing guns outright or imposed gun prohibitions selectively enforced against blacks, leaving them vulnerable to the Democrats’ Ku Klux Klan. In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court noted that “Blacks were routinely disarmed by Southern States after the Civil War.” In U.S. v. Cruikshank (1876), the court considered the convictions of white Democrats who had participated in the disarming and cold-blooded murder of at least 60 black Republicans in the infamous Colfax Massacre in Grant Parish, Louisiana.

In 1911 in New York, Democrats began requiring a selectively granted license to own a handgun, so the police could deny handguns to Italian immigrants in New York City. Not long thereafter came the most famous Democrat in history. As researchers Mark and Carol Leff described it, President Franklin D. Roosevelt campaigned for the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) “with his characteristic flair for spotlighting the most sensational and villainous aspects of an issue.” Thus, when FDR claimed “Federal men are constantly facing machine gun fire in the pursuit of gangsters,” he was exaggerating.

The most famous “gangster” associated with machine guns by name, bootlegger and one-time kidnapper George “Machine Gun” Kelly, wasn’t interested in guns, but was given a submachinegun (a pistol-caliber, automatic rifle) and his nickname by his girlfriend. The ambitious gal also spread a story that Kelly had been an expert with real machine guns in World War I, hoping it would increase his stature in the underworld. Kelly never fired the gun in a crime and, when surrounded by FBI agents, gave up without firing any gun, surrendering with the plea, “Don’t shoot, G-men!”

Roosevelt supported a ban on fully-automatic firearms while governor of New York, thus with the NFA was trying to impose New York-style gun control upon the rest of the nation. But he was also doing the bidding of his attorney general, Homer Cummings, a former Democratic National Committee chairman who wanted the NFA to require people to register their handguns. Roosevelt was quite the storyteller, but so was Cummings, who claimed “there are twice as many people in the underworld today armed with deadly weapons, in fact, than there are in the Army and Navy of the United States combined.”

Banning Fully-Automatic Firearms Would Be Unconstitutional . . . in 1934

As originally envisioned, the NFA would have defined “machinegun” to include not only machine guns, but also fully-automatic rifles and even semi-automatic firearms capable of holding more than 12 rounds of ammunition. The final version of the legislation incorrectly included fully-automatic rifles, but correctly excluded semi-automatics by defining “machinegun” as a firearm that can fire “automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.”

The NFA would also have banned the possession of “machineguns” outright. However, the Department of Justice thought a ban would have violated the Second Amendment. The idea that banning fully-automatic firearms doesn’t infringe the right to arms would have to wait until 2008, when Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia would fabricate a rationale to that effect in Heller. The final version of the NFA instead required that “machineguns” be registered with the federal government and prohibitively taxed. To Cummings’ dismay, it didn’t require the registration of handguns. Roosevelt wasn’t finished disarming people, however. During World War II, he disarmed 120,000 Japanese-Americans by throwing them into concentration camps on account of their ancestry.

One Thing Can Lead to Another

Early in 1963, while Democrats still paid lip service to the Second Amendment, Sen. Thomas Dodd (D-Conn.) introduced legislation concerning the mail-order purchase of handguns, saying, “I want to emphasize that we do not intend to tamper with the constitutionally guaranteed right of a free people to keep and bear arms.” Not yet, he meant.

Of course, our president at the time was John F. Kennedy, an NRA member and owner of an M1, a semi-automatic rifle used by our troops in World War II and the Korean War, praised in 1945 by then-Lt. Gen. (later General) George S. Patton as “the greatest battle implement ever devised,” and today owned by hundreds of thousands of Americans.

Kennedy couldn’t and wouldn’t be a Democrat today for numerous reasons, including his support of the right to arms. In 1960, he said:

By calling attention to a well regulated militia for the security of the nation and the right of each citizen to keep and bear arms, our Founding Fathers recognized the essentially civilian nature of our economy. Although it is extremely unlikely that the fears of governmental tyranny, which gave rise to the Second Amendment, will ever be a major danger to our nation, the amendment still remains an important declaration of our basic military-civilian relationships, in which every citizen must be ready to participate in the defense of his country. For that reason, I believe the Second Amendment will always be important.

After JFK’s assassination, the fake news media of the period blamed the crime on right-wingers. However, as Robert J. Kukla noted in Gun Control, “The villain became the gun when it was discovered [Lee Harvey Oswald] . . . was a communist.” Thus, over the next several years, Dodd’s bill was transformed into the vehicle for most of the federal restrictions on the manufacture, importation, sale, acquisition, possession, transportation, and shipping of firearms today.

Democrats portrayed the resulting law, the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), as a response to the assassinations of JFK, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy. However, some believed they imposed it for the same reason Democrats imposed gun control during the previous century. Journalist Robert Sherrill, a gun control supporter, wrote, “With the horrendous rioting of 1967 and 1968, [the Democrat majority] Congress again was panicked toward passing some law that would shut off weapons access to blacks.”

Before Fauxcahontas and Spartacus, There Was ‘Landslide’

During the Democrat presidential debate in September, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said “I like [gun] registration” and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said “I was the first person to come out for gun licensing.” However, President Lyndon B. Johnson beat Warren and Booker to the punch by 51 years. LBJ pushed for universal gun registration and gun owner licensing and, when he signed the GCA into effect, complained that it didn’t include those requirements.

Another example of how one thing can lead to another, Johnson would not have been president if he had not been vice-president, would not have been vice-president if not senate majority leader, not majority leader if not elected to the Senate, and not elected to the Senate if he had not stolen the 1948 Democrat Senate primary from Texas governor Coke Stevenson.

Stevenson defeated Johnson in the primary’s first round by 71,000 votes, but didn’t achieve a majority. In the ensuing runoff, Johnson should have lost again. But, as historian J. Evetts Haley explained in A Texan Looks at Lyndon: A Study In Illegitimate Power, “organized evil is never stupid, never lazy, never apathetic.” South Texas political boss George Parr, the Duke of Duval County, a felon Johnson had helped obtain a pardon from President Harry S. Truman two years earlier, helped engineer a 30-to-1 vote spread for Johnson in the South Texas counties where Parr held sway.

Still, Stevenson appeared to have won by 113 votes out of a million votes cast. But five days later, in Jim Wells County Precinct 13, within Parr’s sphere of influence, 202 new votes for Johnson turned up, all cast by folks buried in the local cemetery or otherwise not available to vote in-person on election day, all of whom had signed in at a single polling location, one after the next, in alphabetical order, with the same blue ink pen, in the same handwriting. “Landslide Lyndon” had “won.”

Later, the dead could not be reached to explain their votes, at least two of the other “voters” who had put Johnson over the top swore they had not voted, and some of the others predicted they would live longer if they kept their mouths shut. The episode wasn’t an outlier in LBJ’s political career. In 1941, when the government was looking for land on which to build an ammunition factory, then-Rep. Johnson pushed the government to purchase 8,000 acres from his father-in-law.

If You Can’t Ban Handguns, How About Rifles?

In 1974, civilian disarmament activists emboldened by LBJ’s and the Democrat Congress’ imposition of the GCA formed the National Coalition to Ban Handguns (NCBH) and the National Council to Control Handguns (NCCH). To avoid alarming millions of hunters and recreational target shooters, the groups pretended that the only guns they wanted banned were handguns.

NCBH said “rifles and shotguns serve a sporting purpose. . . . It is the concealable handgun that threatens and intimidates the citizens of this country—not the rifle and not the shotgun.” NCCH said “We’re not trying to deprive America’s hunters of their rifles and shotguns . . . . The handgun [is] the favorite weapon of the criminal.”

A decade later, with Congress and the states refusing to ban handguns, the activists and their allies in the media looked for a new issue. Their focus shifted to semi-automatic rifles in October 1985, when Newsweek published its “Machine Gun U.S.A.” issue.

Semi-automatic firearms were invented in the late 19th century and can fire only one shot when you pull the trigger, so they are not machine guns. But Newsweek—in a single article—characterized them as “machine guns,” “automatic weapons,” “assault weapons,” “rapid-fire weapons,” “military guns,” “exotic military guns,” “military-style assault guns,” “sophisticated paramilitary guns,” “paramilitary ‘grease guns,’” “modern combat weapons,” “maxi-violence weaponry,” “exotic weapons,” and “the mainstay of commandos.”

In 1988, a new gun prohibition group put together by a former NCBH employee who had also been an activist with Amnesty International, a major player in the international civilian disarmament movement at the United Nations, proposed that domestic disarmament activists pursue a “new topic” to “strengthen the handgun restriction lobby.” It said, “Efforts to restrict assault weapons are more likely to succeed than those to restrict handguns” and “[t]he public’s confusion over fully-automatic machine guns versus semi-automatic assault weapons—anything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine gun—can only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons.” (A representative of the group was a Democrat witness during “assault weapon” hearings held by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., in September.)

The Fake Media Portray Semi-Automatics As Machine Guns

In 1968, in support of LBJ’s push for universal gun owner licensing and gun registration in the GCA, Time magazine dutifully said “licensing for the owner, registration for each of his firearms . . . would hardly be an outrageous imposition.” In 1981, when anti-gun activists were calling for a ban on handguns, the magazine again got on board, saying “the solution is not tighter controls but an outright ban. . . . A nationwide ban on private possession of handguns . . . would be a start – a movement in the direction of common sense and responsible social policy.”

On February 6, 1989, when the activists were campaigning against rifles, Time got with the program again, calling for a ban on “the import or sale of paramilitary weapons to civilians” and a ban on private sales of firearms, as proposed today in “universal background checks” legislation, which—demonstrating there is nothing new under the sun—is intended to lay the groundwork for the registration requirement Democrats began imposing in 1934 and tried to expand in 1968. Two days later, communist-linked Democrat U.S. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (Ohio) introduced S. 386, a bill to ban semi-automatic firearms branded as “assault weapons.”

‘CBS 48 Hours’ and Dan Rather showed fully-automatic firearms being fired while talking about semi-automatic firearms.

The following month, “CBS 48 Hours” and Dan Rather ran their “Armed and Deadly” episode, which showed fully-automatic firearms being fired while talking about semi-automatic firearms. NBC’s “Today Show” and Matt Lauer did the same thing in 1993, just before the Senate passed the final version of the legislation (sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein D-Calif.), and again in 1994, just before the House passed it as well.

CNN reporter John Zarella and Ken Jenne, then the Democrat sheriff of Broward County, Florida, did the same thing in 2004. Jenne was thereafter convicted of mail fraud and sentenced to prison, while Zarella bragged on his website that he had “authority” and “trust.”

In 2009, NBC-5 Chicago’s Kim Vatis teamed with Andrew Traver, then of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE), in a similar deception. As video footage of an overseas battlefield rolled with machine guns being heard in the background, Vatis talked about semi-automatic rifles. Then, at a shooting range with Traver standing by, Vatis held the trigger down on one of BATFE’s fully-automatic rifles, waving the gun back and forth, spraying bullets wildly for theatrical effect. The same year, the Associated Press gave Vatis a “Best Reporter” award for “Excellence in Journalism.” Several years later, Traver became director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS).

In 1993, President Bill Clinton said the country “can’t be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans to legitimately own handguns and rifles.” The following year, Clinton signed into law Feinstein’s “ban” on “assault weapons” and “large” magazines, passed by a Democrat-majority House and Senate.

As I noted here, Feinstein’s “ban” allowed owners of “banned” guns and magazines to keep them and allowed the continued manufacture of the same guns in slightly modified form and the importation of the magazines in their original form. The anti-gun Washington Post admitted “no one should have any illusions about what was accomplished. . . . The provision is mainly symbolic; its virtue will be if it turns out to be, as hoped, a stepping stone to broader gun control.”

This year, several Democrats running for president have explained what “broader gun control” means, saying they support confiscating semi-automatic firearms and ammunition magazines. And nowadays when Democrats talk about confiscating guns, they don’t mean “only from blacks.”

Record Sales Show Americans Are Voting For Guns With Their Wallets,"There’s no denying it: Americans still value gun ownership.

The total number of firearm background checks conducted on Nov. 29, 2019, was 202,465. That is the second-highest single day for the FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) in history, dating back to 1998 when NICS was implemented. It also represents an 11 percent increase over last year’s Black Friday total.

The high-water mark occurred in 2017, with 203,086 checks. This year’s total was just 622 shy of that record. Checks for the entire month of November 2019 totaled 1,342,155, a 2.1 percent increase over November 2018.

This continues this year’s trend of near-record monthly background checks for retail firearms sales. The FBI reports NICS figures monthly, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry’s trade association, adjusts those figures to remove checks not associated with transferring a firearm to provide a more accurate proxy for firearms sales. NSSF-adjusted NICS data has shown an increase year over year for the past three months.

Black Friday also revealed guns are hot items. Americans are voting with their wallets as politicians on the national stage and in some states have become increasingly vocal about restricting Second Amendment rights.

Buying firearms is a significant investment. It’s not a financial decision made on a whim. Americans are investing their hard-earned dollars to buy the firearms they want before gun-grabbing politicians attempt to regulate away their rights.

This isn’t a “bitter clinger” moment. The trend line shows that as gun control politicians continue to assail on gun rights, Americans don’t get wary. They buy guns.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., told CNN in April when he launched his ill-fated presidential campaign that it would be centered on gun control. He was the first to openly propose outright forced confiscation of lawfully possessed firearms under the threat of felony conviction. The following month, 910,910 NICS checks were conducted for retail firearms sales, up from 904,834 in May 2018.

In the June Democratic presidential primary debate, former Vice President Joe Biden wagged his finger on stage, saying, “Our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA, the gun manufacturers.” Not a single other candidate condemned the remark. Americans noticed, though. June’s NSSF-adjusted NICS figure of 924,054 showed a 3.5 percent increase over June 2018. And Swalwell dropped out of the race.

September’s Democratic debate featured former Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s headline-grabbing outburst. “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” he shouted from the debate stage. The viral moment electrified not just the gun control base, it also galvanized gun owners — who went shopping. September’s NICS figure topped out at 1,011,636, a 10 percent increase compared to September one year earlier.

That came after another banner month in August, with 1,113,535 NICS checks, a 15.2 percent jump compared to August 2018. O’Rourke’s campaign also folded.

Interestingly, guns and gun control barely made the Democratic debate in October. There were just two passing mentions of gun control, but nothing of substance. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota didn’t even mention her “Uncle Dick” and explain how her proposals to ban sales of modern sporting rifles, create a national firearms registry, or criminalize private firearms transfers somehow don’t violate his constitutional rights.

Maybe the candidates are taking campaign advice from Joy Behar of “The View.” “If you’re going to take people’s guns away, wait until you get elected — then take the guns away,” she said. “Don’t tell them ahead of time.”

The fashionably late, anti-gun billionaire Michael Bloomberg made a splash in the Democratic primary race by announcing his candidacy and then telling everyone he wasn’t really going to participate. He’s been in the race and then out, and now he’s back in again.

The former New York City mayor bankrolls anti-gun groups including Everytown for Gun Safety, Moms Demand Action, Students Demand Action, and March for Our Lives. He poured $2.5 million-plus into Virginia to flip it blue for gun control. Old Dominion Democrats quickly thanked him for the donations by pre-filing legislation that would dispossess law-abiding Virginians of their legally purchased modern sporting rifles and other commonly owned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns.

We’ve seen this sort of ramp-up before — in 2016. That was the year Hillary Clinton ran on a platform of reinstating gun bans, clamping down on Americans’ gun rights, and blaming the law-abiding for criminals’ misdeeds. That was also the year Americans clocked in 27,538,673 firearms retail background checks — the most ever.

Gun Control Activist Promotes False Data To Uphold Anti-Gun Propaganda,"In light of the West Freeway Church shooting in White Settlement, Texas, gun control activists are blaming gun access and conceal-carry laws for the rise in gun deaths in the United States.

Gun control activist Shannon Watts claimed more than 3,500 Texans are killed by guns every year. Her tweet insinuated mass shooters and increased access to guns are to blame for the rise in this number.

“If more guns and fewer gun laws made Texas safer, it would be the safest state in the US. Instead, it has high rates of gun suicide and homicide, and is home to 4 of the 10 deadliest mass shootings,” Watts tweeted.

3,500+ Texans are killed by guns every year: a life lost every 3 hours. If more guns and fewer gun laws made Texas safer, it would be the safest state in the US. Instead, it has high rates of gun suicide and homicide, and is home to 4 of the 10 deadliest mass shootings. #txlege pic.twitter.com/qnHrbTIBJW — Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) December 30, 2019

There are many problems with Watts’s analysis, beginning with the fact that Texas has one of the highest state populations, making statistics between states incomparable. When Texas is compared to all 50 states and Washington D.C. factoring in gun deaths per population, it falls to number 27, making Texas far from the highest rate of gun violence.

In fact, CDC data shows that since 1990, homicidal and suicidal gun deaths per capita in Texas have fallen bellow the rest of the U.S. population.

The graph tweeted by Watts also fails to differentiate types of gun deaths. According to the CDC, the “firearm-related deaths” referenced in Watts’s graph is not limited to deaths by mass shooter or deaths by homicides. Causes of death included in “firearm-related injuries” includes: suicides, homicides, terrorism, accidental misfire, and legal intervention involving firearm discharge.

For instance, in the West Freeway Church shooting that took place on Sunday, the shooter was shot and killed. This was considered a heroic act and saved many more lives, but it would be considered a “firearm-related injury” according to Watts’s data. So would a suicide, so would the death of a terrorist, so would the death of individual shot by a policeman or other legal authorities. This data simply does not take into account the entire picture or encapsulate the entire problem.

This narrative and messaging is completely on brand with Democrats and the mainstream media. They ignore the big picture and put a laser focus on the issues they wish to highlight, no matter how out of context these issues may be.

So, to put “firearm-related injuries” into context, let’s compare Watts’s alleged mass killings statistic to the amount of unborn babies murdered in the womb in Texas in 2017.

According to Abort73, the Guttmacher Institute, and the CDC, in 2017 there were 53,277 abortions performed in the state of Texas. If Watts’s data was not aggregated and 3,513 Texans were actually killed by gunmen alone in 2017, that would still be nearly 50,000 less deaths by guns than abortion.

This perfectly encapsulates how Democrats and the mainstream media work overtime to ignore the actual causes of deaths and point their focus on an issue they want to discuss, such as gun control. The truth is, Watts’s data is only being used to promote an agenda, not the truth about how people are dying in the United States.

Why Supporting Gun Rights Is Pro-Life,"As during a Texas church shooting on Sunday, guns save lives, so supporting the Second Amendment is pro-life. Abortion, on the other hand, takes a life every single time.

Studies on incidents of defensive gun use range anywhere from an absurdly low 55,000 to a high of 4.7 million per year. The most commonly cited and widely accepted is the 1995 study by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, which estimates that between 2.1 and 2.5 million defensive gun use instances occur in the United States each year.

By contrast, from 1993-2011, nonfatal firearm-related crime ranged between 1,287,190 and 331,618 incidents per year. This data makes a strong case that defensive gun use is much more common than firearm-related crime. Instances of defensive gun use save lives every day, but the stories get very little news coverage, while the statistically much fewer negative gun uses are often covered by the national news media for days on end.

PoliceOne’s Gun Policy and Law Enforcement survey, which was conducted in March 2013, received more than 15,000 responses from verified police professionals. The survey found that almost 90 percent of police agree mass shootings would be “reduced” or “avoided altogether” by the presence of legally armed citizens. It is also not a coincidence that the huge majority of mass shootings take place in gun-free zones.

To actually save lives, we need a lot fewer gun-free zones and a lot more abortion-free zones. The most recent abortion data available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is for 2015. It shows there were 638,169 legal, induced abortions reported to the CDC from 49 reporting areas. It’s important to note that states and areas are not required to report their abortion data to the CDC, and the large state of California doesn’t at all, so these numbers are certainly underestimated.

Citing stats from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 2016 and the Guttmacher Institute for 2014, the pro-life organization Live Action states that 7,741 Americans were killed by guns in one year while 926,200 children were killed in the womb in one year. The facts clearly show that abortion is far deadlier than firearms.

There is also strong statistical and circumstantial evidence that abortion is very often carried out in a way that is both racist and sexist. From the 2015 CDC data, black Americans accounted for 36 percent of abortions while only making up about 13 percent of the U.S. population. In very liberal New York City, more black children were aborted than were born alive in 2015.

Why do the statistics show that black Americans are disproportionately targeted? Isn’t it wrong and a form of racism to encourage the abortion of a black child in the womb because his life holds no value to you?

Sex-selective abortion is clearly discrimination against women, and it’s not just happening in China and India. Current estimates are that as many as 200 million girls may have been victims of sex-selective abortion worldwide.

Undercover investigations of U.S. Planned Parenthood abortion clinics by Live Action have documented clinic workers at multiple locations supporting sex-selective abortions. In response, Planned Parenthood issued a statement saying they are against gender bias, but in practice Planned Parenthood seems to support abortion for any reason. The United Kingdom bans sex-selective abortion, but the United States does not have a nationwide law against it.

Less than 1 percent of abortions are due to rape, incest, or a risk to the life of the mother, yet those who are pro-choice use this argument 99 percent of the time to justify killing children in the womb.

Upholding our Second Amendment rights and an increased presence of legally armed citizens will without a doubt save lives. Reducing and ultimately ending abortion will, without a doubt, also save lives, especially of women and black Americans.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/12/31/why-supporting-gun-rights-is-pro-life/,2019-12-31
5 Ways You Can Prepare For Dangerous Gun Scenarios,"Whether it’s a church, school, or Walmart shooting, the response is the same: The media blames guns, people panic, and a gun control fury ensues, until it all dissolves and repeats weeks or months later.

We saw this last week when a man opened fire at a Texas church, the day after a man killed several Jews with a machete. The Texas shooting was particularly notable because Jack Wilson, a former reserve deputy sheriff and a firearms instructor, shot the perpetrator within seconds of his first shot, boosting the mantra among conservatives: It takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun.

Tensions were already high, and even some so-called conservatives weren’t in the mood for a debate about guns despite the incredibly teachable moment. But some debates still broke out on social media, specifically about guns in houses of worship, cultural stigma around guns, and whether conservatives are simply becoming gun nuts.

I live in Texas, I’m a mother of four, and I possess a firearm. Here’s my advice, specifically to women, about how to process and react to these shootings.

1. Realize You Don’t Have to Get a Gun

I don’t know about your home state, but Texas is a church-goin’ one. In fact, I heard about the Texas church shooting on my way home from church, and had passed right through the town of White Settlement, where the shooting occurred, to get home.

My first thought was empathy for the people worshiping that day, the fear they must have felt. My second thought was admiration and gratitude for the trained man who took swift action. I know I wouldn’t have been that calm and accurate under pressure. Even though my church has a paid security team, not every place does, which raises the question of whether to get a license and then carry a firearm regularly.

While my thoughts immediately tend toward carrying a firearm, it’s okay if yours don’t, especially if you feel you would be doing so out of pure fear, rather than a desire for preparedness. Carrying a firearm regularly doesn’t make you a gun nut, but carrying a gun and practicing very little with it because you’re terrified could lead to accidents, misfires, and ineffective results. If you’re too busy to practice, or think you’d be unable to remain calm under pressure, you certainly don’t have to get a gun just because of scary headlines.

2. Don’t Be Afraid to Acquire a Gun — It’s Your Right

Rather than approach the gun-carrying question out of fear, educate yourself on the risks and benefits. Of course, it’s true the chances of encountering violence with guns is limited. But in the end, you’re responsible for your own safety.

The chances you’ll get in a car accident are limited too, but you still buckle your seatbelt and drive at a safe speed, and most people travel with first aid kits and jumper cables in case of crisis. Before you even got a license, you took classes, practiced driving, and then implemented necessary safety measures.

My point: The Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees your right to bear a firearm to protect yourself from the government or in self-defense. Whether you exercise that right is up to you, but if you do, approach that freedom from a place of confidence and education, not fear and ignorance.

3. Get Educated, Take Classes, and Practice Regularly

If you decide a firearm is the route you want to take, it’s important to do so methodically. Every state has different laws about how to possess a handgun legally, so follow the guidelines in your state. In fact, contrary to some of the outlandish rhetoric on social media last week, concealed carry permit holders are some of the most law-abiding citizens around. Resolve to do likewise. Start with the U.S. Concealed Carry site, which offers good pointers.

You can get a decent handgun for anywhere between $250-$500. While you’re gun shopping, I recommend bringing a friend who knows about guns. Take your time, and hold each gun to get a feel for it. Even better, go to a range with a friend, rent different types of handguns, and see how they shoot. My friend and fellow Federalist Senior Contributor Chad Felix Greene did this recently.

https://twitter.com/chadfelixg/status/1213575649434181634

I’ve done the same and intend to go to the range more this year than I did last year.

4. Instill Safety Protocols Within Your Family

If you’re keeping your handgun in your home, especially if you have children, it’s best to keep it in a safe with a code that can be unlocked quickly, such as one like this, which has a biometric lock. Even so, keeping your gun locked away isn’t enough. Without going overboard — guns don’t take on a life of their own — it’s important to talk to your kids about gun safety and instill in them a healthy respect for firearms, just as you would do with moving vehicles or anything else that can be both useful and harmful.

That said, accidental gun deaths involving children are rare. Rather than make gun safety the only time you talk about safety or danger in your home, thus instilling either a fear or worship of guns in your children, talk to your children about other safety issues: locking and answering the door, when and how to call 911, or when to simply call for a parent or neighbor. Include “stranger danger” talks or discussions about abuse when it’s appropriate as well. Have these conversations often until safety protocols become second nature.

My point is that if you only discuss gun safety in your home while ignoring other possible dangers, children may develop an irrational fear of or attachment to firearms while not knowing what to do if someone knocks on the door and an adult isn’t home. Through familiarity and consistency, children gain confidence and maintain respect of firearms — and other things that could endanger them too.

5. Practice Gratitude

Wherever you are in your gun safety journey, be thankful you live in a country that secured the right for you to bear arms hundreds of years ago. Very few countries have it, let alone for women. If I were a feminist, I’d be all over this, yet strangely, few do.

The Second Amendment is often misinterpreted as something only pertinent to colonial era America in the time of Daniel Boone, the Cherokees, and George Washington. If you don’t know much about the Second Amendment, educate yourself so you can understand its true meaning and see why it’s still as important today as it was in 1776 — and perhaps even play devil’s advocate and debunk some myths.

@piersmorgan right next to the word ""muskets"" — Carol Roth (@caroljsroth) December 3, 2012

If you decide not to purchase a firearm for yourself and your family, be aware of your surroundings, and if your local church doesn’t have a security team like the one in Texas did, perhaps petition your church’s leadership to consider it. Be grateful there are everyday American men and women who are well trained and versed in firearm use. Were it not for Jack Wilson’s training and willingness to protect, the latest shooting would have been an even larger tragedy, rather than a teachable scenario for gun advocates.

Virginia State Democrats Launch Into An Anti-Gun Law Frenzy,"Virginia Democrats are on a tear to pass as much anti-Second Amendment legislation as possible and are sadly determined to shame the Commonwealth’s own state motto, “sic semper tyrannis,” or “thus always to tyrants”— a rallying cry against abuse of power.

In the last week, the Virginia state Senate passed three anti-gun bills, including requiring background checks on all firearm sales, limiting gun purchases to one in a 30-day period, and allowing localities to ban guns from public events. This was after lawmakers voted the week prior to ban all firearms from the Capitol building, citing the need protect public safety in anticipation of this week’s contentious gun bills. (Of course, the only real effect of this rule was long security lines, delaying staffers, citizens, and thus the votes).

But that’s not all. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved creating an “extreme risk protective order,” or red flag laws, which are about as unconstitutional as “no-fly” lists. It awaits amendments.

Numerous amendments waiting for SB240 (red flag bill) so it went by for the day — Virginia Shooting Sports Association (@VSSA) January 17, 2020

Although it struck down the most controversial bill, a version of an “assault weapons ban” on bump stocks, suppressors, and magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds, it has another bill with a similar focus, HB961, which “allows” gun owners to keep their “banned” firearms if they register them with state police. All of these bills passed straight down party lines. Nope, no tyrants here.

But, wait! There’s more. Gov. Ralph Northam, who admitted to wearing blackface and advocated for infanticide last year, has an eight-bill package of anti-gun legislation he introduced last July. Many of his proposals are already moving forward this week, but additionally, Northam wants to require anyone whose firearm is lost or stolen to report it to police within 24 hours, and he wants to prohibit anyone subject to a court’s final protective order from possessing a gun. Since the Virginia Beach mass shooting last year, Northam pledged to sign into law any new gun legislation that comes across his desk.

Finally, Virginia Democratic Del. Dan Helmer filed a bill Wednesday that would give Attorney General Mark Herring discretion over which states’ concealed carry permits Virginia would continue to recognize. This would mean if Herring found other states’ carry permit requirements insufficient, the permits, potentially affecting 25 states, would be deemed invalid in Virginia.

After the 2019 election, the Virginia Legislature flipped, and Democrats took full control of the statehouse for the first time in a generation. They are clearly taking advantage of it. But pro-gun Virginias, of which there are many, are fighting back. Virginia is of course home to the National Rifle Association.

“Regrettably, Virginia lawmakers approved a series of measures today that will make it harder for law-abiding Virginians to protect themselves, while doing nothing to stop criminals. We are pleased one of the most egregious gun confiscation bills was pulled from consideration,” the NRA said in a statement.

130,000 Virginians and supporters of the Second Amendment plan to attend an annual lobby day at the Virginia state Capitol building this Monday. But instead of acknowledging the anger or concern that would drive Virginias to hold such a large, grassroots protest in response to laws such as the ones proposed this week, Northam and the media have painted the gathering of Second Amendment advocates as neo-Nazis and white supremacists. “I took this action to protect Virginians from credible threats of violence,” Northam said as his reasoning for imposing an emergency firearms ban on Capitol grounds ahead of the demonstration.

The Virginia Citizens Defense League (VCDL) and Gun Owners of America filed a lawsuit Thursday seeking an injunction against the ban, but a Richmond Circuit Court judge upheld it, ruling the governor has the authority under state law to take action related to “the safety and welfare” of the state.

The gun groups argued before the judge that carrying guns is a form of symbolic speech, but hours before the ruling, FBI agents arrested three men who were allegedly linked to a violent white supremacist group and were believed to have plans to attend Monday’s protest. The VCDL has instructed its members to remain peaceful.

The anti-Second Amendment laws pursued by Virginia Democrats are not just an affront to their own state’s motto and seal, as depicted by the Roman goddess of virtue with a spear, standing triumphantly on top of a defeated representative of tyranny, but they entrap innocent people, make Virginia less safe, and do nothing to address the real bad actors they want to punish.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/17/virginia-state-democrats-launch-into-an-anti-gun-law-frenzy/,2020-01-17
Thousands March For Gun Rights Peacefully In Virginia Despite Riot Fears,"RICHMOND, Virginia – More than 22,000 gun-rights activists descended on the Virginia State Capitol Monday to peacefully protest new gun laws making their way through the Democrat-controlled legislature.

Contrary to Democrat-fueled media fearmongering of a white supremacist rally threatening to erupt into chaos, as occurred in Charlottesville three years ago, a sea of gun owners flooded the capitol grounds and surrounding areas in a peaceful day of protest.

The demonstration, organized by the Virginia Citizens Defense League, was supposed to be a lobbying day for the gun rights group, focused on new gun legislation on a path to Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s desk. The bundle of new gun laws includes universal background checks on gun sales and expanded authority for local governments to prohibit firearms in public places. The Virginia Legislature is also considering “red flag” laws that would allow the government to strip firearms from people deemed too dangerous either to themselves or others.

Democratic lawmakers, however, were absent from the statehouse as thousands of gun advocates, many of whom were armed, marched in opposition.

“I was trying to meet with my legislator, and I don’t see any legislators available to actually meet with, which is pretty frustrating,” said Charles Howard, a Virginia gun-owner standing feet away from the capitol steps.

In the weeks leading up to the organization’s day of action, the protest became a nationwide rallying cry for gun-rights activists, who flew across the country to attend one of the largest pro-gun rallies in recent memory.

Scores of protesters had arrived as early as 7 a.m. in 25-degree weather before the sun began to rise.

By the time the protest ended about 2 p.m., there had been no fights, no violence, no rioting, no vandalism, and one arrest, according to officials.

Northam, however, had declared a “state of emergency” ahead of the event after announcing that authorities had discovered credible “threats of violence” from out-of-state militias and hate groups, reminiscent of the state’s nightmare demonstrations in Charlottesville three years prior. Northam also banned weapons from the statehouse grounds and put up fencing around the capitol building with tight security to enforce the firearm prohibition.

“Three years ago, Virginia and the nation watched horrified as civil protest was marred by violence and hate,” Northam said in his declaration. “We must take all precautions to prevent that from ever happening again.”

Those threats, however, failed to surface Monday as the pro-gun demonstrations proceeded without conflict.

Philip Van Cleave told reporters in a press gaggle that the governor’s fearmongering tactics were partially motivated by Democrats’ desire to suppress turnout. He said the Virginia Citizens Defense League had fully cooperated with law enforcement to discourage violence from breaking out.

“They’ve done one thing after another to discourage people showing up,” Van Cleave said of Democrats. “It didn’t work. People are determined to be here to make sure their voices are heard, and it’s wonderful to see that kind of determination.”

It’s easy to see why Northam and Virginia Democrats were concerned about a large turnout. Chants to expel Northam rang out throughout downtown Richmond as angry protesters voiced their frustration with Virginia Democrats pushing through unpopular laws infringing on their Second Amendment rights.

Dozens of protesters throughout the rally were sure to remind the public that Northam wore blackface, carrying signs of the Virginia governor’s infamous high school yearbook photo showcasing Democrats’ double-standard regarding racism.

Contrary to claims that the rally was a haven for far-right neo-Nazi groups to express their anger toward minorities, the demonstration consisted of diverse people standing up for their right to bear arms, calling out the false narrative depicting the protesters as racists.

Many protesters said it was unfair to conflate Monday’s pro-gun rally with the neo-Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville in the summer of 2017.

“This has nothing to do with people of color saying that they’re better than another color,” said Joe Tinsley, a Richmond native speaking of the day’s protests. “[In Charlottesville], you’re talking about 200 people, not thousands of people here because this is a constitutional right, whether you’re black, green, Puerto Rican.”

The “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville was explicitly a white supremacist, neo-Nazi demonstration that sprung out of opposition to removing Confederate statues. The protests turned violent in a clash with counterprotesters, ending in 11 people arrested and one person killed, sparking national outrage.

In Richmond, however, counterprotesters were absent, and a significant presence of white nationalists remained to be seen, if any showed up at all, while minority gun-owners paraded through the streets carrying their firearms.

Women also turned out at the pro-gun rally in high numbers.

One woman by the name of Elizabeth Warren, not to be confused with the senator and 2020 contender, came to the rally from Fairfax, Virginia, and held a sign reading “gun rights are women’s rights,” outside the statehouse. When asked whether she attended the 2020 Women’s March on Saturday, Warren said she “wouldn’t be within 10 miles of them.”

“They don’t represent me. I’m pro-life. I’m pro-gun,” Warren said. As The Federalist’s Erielle Davidson wrote after covering Saturday’s march in Washington, D.C., the women’s protest has indeed become more about hatred for President Donald Trump than about women’s rights.

15 Awesome Things I Saw At The Huge Gun Show Only Insiders Attend,"More than 65,000 people gathered in Las Vegas, Nevada this week for the nation’s largest annual gun industry convention, SHOT Show 2020. Organized by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), SHOT Show brings together the world’s best in shooting sports, law enforcement, hunting, and armed forces to share their products and businesses, but more importantly, to shoot the globe’s latest and greatest firearms in the Nevada desert.

With more than 2,000 exhibiting manufacturers and companies crammed into the 13-acre Sands Convention Center, it’s physically impossible for a single visitor to see everything. But after just two days of being tightly surrounded by guns, ammunition, Navy SEALs, military dogs, tactical gear, camouflage, and American flags, my faith has been restored in the status of freedom and the Second Amendment in this country.

Since SHOT Show is not open to the general public (only gun industry business people who buy guns or gear at wholesale, and gun-related media are allowed in), I’m excited to share some of the more impressive or interesting products and companies that stuck out to me, as a novice female shooter. Let’s start with the guns.

1. SIG P365 SAS (Sig Anti-Snag)

Sig Sauer’s P365 is one of the most popular choices for a concealed-carry pistol. Their new model, the P365 SAS, was announced last year and features a unique sight that many were able to test for the first time at SHOT this year. Instead of having a traditional iron sight at the end of the gun and on top of the slide like most pistols, in their efforts to make the gun “anti-snag,” Sig embedded a green bullseye sight that almost seems to light up at the rear of the slide.

There seemed to be a trend in more electronic and red dot sights (I’ll get to that later) across manufactures, but Sig’s version of this “point and shoot” sight trend was my personal favorite.

2. Two Fun .22 LR Pistols

Even though .22 LR pistols aren’t the best choice for self-defense or a concealed-carry weapon, they are extremely fun to shoot. The combination of cheap ammunition and lack of recoil makes them great for training or learning to shoot.

I got to shoot two different .22 LRs: Glock’s newly introduced Glock 44, and Ruger’s Mark IV with a suppressor. I can’t really compare apples to apples here, since shooting with a suppressor (silencer) is THE most fun, but the Glock 44 was almost just as fun even without a suppressor. Women are the fastest-growing segment of the firearms market, and I think Glock’s decision to make a new .22 that appeals to women for both its size and ease of shooting is a smart move.

Shooting the Glock 44.

3. SIG CROSS Bolt-Action Rifle

Shooting a target from 500 yards is not something I had done before, or even known how easy it can be. With a helpful spotter at the SIG Sauer range and some optics, I hit targets at 100, 300, and 500 yards with their new ultra lightweight hunting rifle, the SIG CROSS.

4. Old Timey Western-Style Revolvers

A number of exhibitors showed off Western movie-inspired revolvers that are more focused on style than practicality. I’m not sure if this is the Hollywood influence of shows like “Westworld” and “Deadwood,” or just the greatness of American capitalism.

This one looks Pablo Escobar-inspired.

5. More Guns

Lever-action rifles by Marlin also follow the trend in making ultra light hunting rifles.



SIG Sauer’s P320 M18 was fun to shoot but also a great example of the civilian market craving military design. This is the commercial version of the gun that is currently the official sidearm of all Marines.



Some AK-47s with Romanian parts.

The new “Hellcat” is Springfield Armory’s attempt at competing with other popular 9mm conceal-carry weapons.

5. Red Dot Sights

There is clearly a trend in the pistol game right now for slide-mounted red dot sights. Once you get used to them, they can be easier and faster to shoot than your traditional iron sight. It’s as simple as point the red dot where you want it to go, and shoot.

I got to shoot with several of them, including SIG’s Romeo 1, and an Aimpoint model on this Glock 45 pictured below. The main downside is that unlike traditional sights, the glass can get dirty and they are battery powered. Anytime electronics are involved, the reliability of the gun decreases.

6. California Compliant

The state of California’s (often meaningless) regulations on guns lead to manufacturer niches like this:

Manufacturers are always creatively adapting their designs to make their guns “legal.”

7. Freedom Throne

It could be yours for only $17,800.

8. Good Dogs

9. Triggering Gun Cleaning Mats

The company Tekmak makes thick, durable mats designed to protect your guns and your work surface while cleaning firearms. They also make gun mats and doormats with designs that are not shy about their customers’ political leanings. One Tekmak representative said their mat picturing Trump on top of a humvee with explosions, a bald eagle, and an American flag is their most popular design.

10. Grenades

11. Silencer Shop

I already discussed how fun shooting with suppressors (a.k.a. silencers) is, but the not so fun part is obtaining one legally. Despite their all-around usefulness, especially for preventing hearing loss, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) treats them as deadly weapons of destruction. The ATF makes the process of obtaining a suppressor tedious, long, and expensive.

Silencer Shop is taking advantage of all these disadvantages in ATF’s process by jumping through the hoops for customers. Their digital kiosks located at local gun dealers make the federal registration forms and fingerprinting seamless. Plus, another good boy was hanging out at their booth.

12. Cute And Fluffy Decoys And Target Practice

Prairie dog practice targets.

These spinning critter tails bring all the coyotes to the yard.

13. Heavy Duty Artillery

The rounds on top of this mini tank were longer than an average human hand.

14. Semi-Trailer Mobile Range Arming Women Shooters

Karen Butler started the Shoot Like A Girl movement, which invites women to shoot guns and bows with instruction and guidance from other female instructors. I got to shoot in Shoot Like A Girl’s mobile range that features a military grade firearms simulations system and a live fire archery range.

The organization provides an encouraging, comfortable, and safe environment to introduce women to shooting sports. “Shooting revived my confidence. It just makes you feel good about yourself to aim at a target and hit it,” Butler said.

15. The Freedom Cabinet

The “Freedom Cabinet” was designed by metal artist Shane Henderson in his garage, but quickly went viral, drawing attention from politicians, celebrities, and freedom lovers.

What looks like a piece of metal art on your wall, is actually a safe storage space for your firearms, flask, Bible, and anything else you might want to protect from grubby hands.

GQ Declares Nonviolent Richmond Gun Protest Violent After Admitting It Was Nonviolent,"Mainstream media outlets are desperate to turn what was a peaceful protest against new gun laws in Virginia into a white supremacist neo-Nazi riot, reminiscent of the Charlottesville “Unite the Right,” rally three years that resulted in 11 arrests and one death.

Monday’s pro-gun demonstrations in Richmond, Virginia however, could not have been more calm, possessing all the elements and fanfare of a Fourth of July celebration.

Sure, a Fourth of July holiday with guns can sound quite alien to urban elites who have never laid a finger on a firearm, but for thousands across the country, guns are a part of everyday life.

It’s no wonder then, that many in the media stoked fears of violence fed by Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam who declared a “state of emergency” in the days leading up to the rally.

Despite the lack of violence at the 22,000-person second amendment rally, the magazine GQ decided to declare the protest violent anyway.

“That Pro-Gun Rally in Virginia Wasn’t Exactly ‘Peaceful,’” titled a piece in GQ on Wednesday.

After the author, Talia Lavin, admitted the protest ended peacefully, Lavin argues that the real violence stemming from the protest came from the arrests made prior to the demonstration, the ripple effects of the government’s declaration, and her imaginary consequences of what is to come if the Virginia state legislature defies the demands of the massive crowd.

“There was, it was true, an absence of immediate bloodshed,” Lavin conceded. “But what abounded, in that armed and insurrectionist sea of humanity, was the promise that bloodshed might happen at any time, should the will of the mob be thwarted.”

In other words, the Brooklyn-based writer argues that the armed citizens protesting in Richmond were violent by, in her words, threatening an all-out civil war if the state passed restrictive gun laws. On Monday however, there were no calls to shoot up the Democratic state legislature or the state governor, but there sure were calls to use the power of the ballot box to throw out government officials infringing on their constitutional rights.

“Northam Out!” chants break out at the statehouse pic.twitter.com/Vus1tp5X5x — Tristan Justice (@JusticeTristan) January 20, 2020

Lavin also pointed out that Northam’s “state of emergency” declaration prompted the cancellation of dozens of events and led many to flee the city out of fear of what the media portrayed as another Charlottesville threatening to erupt. If people leaving town to avoid the gun rally qualifies as violence, which it doesn’t, that’s on Northam for perpetuating gun-hysteria, not the peaceful demonstrators.

Lavin argues that protestors were heeded to because America has an “exceptional tolerance towards armed white gunmen,” that oppresses minority gun ownership.

“In America, if you are white, you can wear a mask and carry a gun and hang a governor in effigy, and go home quietly at the end of the day, unmolested,” Lavin wrote, never mind that the Richmond crowd was an extraordinarily diverse group celebrating individual rights to self-defense. This kind of racist stereotyping however, has become the norm among many urban elites.

Of course, her narrative that only armed white men would have the privilege of protesting was busted by a number of non-white gun owners in attendance.

In another double-standard deployed among urban media types, Lavin omitted that Northam wore blackface, while characterizing the Richmond gun crowd as racist white men. Good thing the crowd reminded the public of Northam’s infamous yearbook photo sporting Northam’s high school costume.

Lavin also accurately notes that three individuals arrested before the event were allegedly part of a white supremacist group who were planning to inject chaos by spraying bullets into the crowd. While no one can be certain of the arrested individuals’ intentions, the potential perpetrators wouldn’t have gotten far surrounded by a crowd of highly armed firearms enthusiasts ready to protect themselves. It’s almost as if guns make lives safer.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/23/gq-declares-nonviolent-richmond-gun-protest-violent-after-admitting-it-was-nonviolent/,2020-01-23
John Kerry’s Ignorant Gun-Control Rhetoric Is More Dangerous Than Guns,"Former Secretary of State John Kerry is back in the headlines, this time for denying reports that he was overheard talking about jumping into the 2020 presidential race. But he’s also stumping for Joe Biden, and during gun-related remarks in Iowa before the caucuses, Kerry passed gun misinformation off to voters who deserve better.

“There’s not a veteran here who would take an AR-16 with a long clip to go out and shoot a deer or shoot anything,” he told voters.

He’s right, and the first reason is the rifle he’s trying to demonize doesn’t exist. He also reminded everyone of how he cloaks himself in the veil of military service to push for gun control. Unlike Kerry, I know gun owners. Veteran gun owners are my friends. Kerry is not a veteran gun owner nor a hunter. He is a caricature though, a veteran version of Elmer Fudd.

John Kerry Doesn’t Understand Guns

Kerry was obviously referring to the AR-15, again conflating the semiautomatic rifle with the military’s M16 and M4 rifles, which are automatic. He also clearly confused magazines with clips.

All the while, though, Kerry confirmed the long-held beliefs that the only thing he and the candidates he supports want to do with firearms are banning, outlawing, restricting, and denying the ability of law-abiding gun owners to buy the firearms they choose. He warned if voters don’t turn out for Biden, those “AR-16s” and “clips” could make a comeback.

“Now we have a crowd who’s willing to bring them back,” he added.

Kerry should be more aware when his anti-gun bias is showing. The ban he’s scaremongering about expired in 2004, and today, the modern sporting rifle is the most popular-selling centerfire rifle in America. More than 17.7 million of them are in circulation today. They’re popular for hunting, recreational shooting, and self-defense. They come in a wide array of calibers, firing not just the popular 223-caliber, but an array of bullets that are often better suited to hunt big game.

Both hunters and veterans are able to ferret out a certain kind of authenticity rather quickly. Just as quickly, Kerry ably fails to convince either group he’s authentic. This isn’t a screed to bash his service. Kerry did, in fact, serve in the U.S. Navy in Vietnam. His service is respected.

His service, though, like mine, should have been instructive on the rifle he carried into combat. The M16 rifle has a selector switch. It allows the rifle to be put on safe, which doesn’t permit it to fire, “semi,” which is short for semiautomatic, meaning one round fired for each squeeze of the trigger, and finally, “auto” or automatic. When I served, this was changed to “burst,” for a three-round automatic burst of fire for one squeeze of the trigger.

The AR-15 doesn’t do that. It’s only capable of safe and semiautomatic, just like the shotgun Kerry toted into the marshes in Ohio for his 2004 presidential “goose hunt.” About the same time, he had a few hunting tales of his own, which were rather revealing.

‘That Dog Won’t Hunt’

“I go out with my trusty 12-gauge double-barrel, crawl around on my stomach,” he said in 2004. “I track and move and decoy and play games and try to outsmart them. You know, you kind of play the wind. That’s hunting.”

Hunters have a familiar saying that applies here: That dog won’t hunt.

NSSF’s Senior Vice President Lawrence Keane noted as much in a news report at the time. “The only thing Senator Kerry is hunting today is the all-important sportsmen’s vote,” Keane said, according to a UPI report. He added Kerry’s supporters were hardly pro-hunting. “The senator’s rhetoric and play-acting aren’t fooling anyone. Kerry the ‘hunter’ is endorsed by radical anti-hunting organizations like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and Fund for Animals.”

Kerry emerged from his goose hunt with a bloodied hand but no goose in tow, saying it was sent forward with his aides. No one was convinced.

“His new camouflage jacket is an October surprise, an effort he’s making to hide the fact that he votes against gun-owners,” said Vice President Dick Cheney at the time. “The cover-up isn’t going to work.”

You can’t blame hunters or veterans for being skeptical about Kerry’s views on guns and hunting.

Kerry Supports Biden, Who Is Also Ignorant About Guns

Kerry’s understanding has been to ban, limit, and control. He supported the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban mandatory trigger locks and voted against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. As secretary of state, Kerry signed the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which would have exposed the firearms and ammunition industry to a confusing web of international regulations that would not have contributed to curbing illegal arms trafficking, protecting human rights, or guaranteeing the rights of U.S. citizens.

The treaty was never ratified, and President Donald Trump withdrew from the treaty in 2019, saying, “We’re taking our signature back.”

The tragic thing is that the once-defeated presidential candidate is backing Biden, who said from the debate stage the firearms industry was “the enemy.” Kerry’s throwing his support behind the guy who would ban modern sporting rifles, and who proposes taxpayer-funded buybacks to gather them up, thinks a federal gun rationing plan is appropriate, and wants to mandate technically impossible DNA-matched “smart guns.”

All of this, and Kerry’s AR-16 proclamation, make about as much sense as Biden infamously advising a woman during an online forum to “get a double-barrel shotgun” and like he told his wife just to “fire two blasts” of a shotgun if she felt threatened.

Think of how dangerous these anti-gun politicians would be if they actually knew what they were talking about. Likely, more knowledge would force the fallacy of their indefensible political talking points.

"No, David Hogg, LGBT People Did Not Start The Anti-Gun Movement","David Hogg, the anti-gun activist who attended Stoneman Douglas High School during the shooting in 2018, tweeted last week about “indigenous lgbtq women and non binary people” who he claims began the anti-gun movement he’s joined.

This is a tweet for for the founders of the gun violence prevention movement started centuries ago by almost entirely black, brown and indigenous lgbtq women and non binary people that never got on the news or in most history books. We may not know all your names but thank you. — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) January 27, 2020

As the national coordinator for the Pink Pistols, the largest U.S. pro-queer gun group that was founded under the principle “Armed queers don’t get bashed,” I found Hogg’s statement not just wrong, but completely careless in its inaccuracy, and therefore callous to the injustice done to those people whom he is claiming to champion.

Hogg speaks of “centuries of gun violence prevention.” I have no idea how he arrived at this number, and I doubt anyone else does, either. If there is a history book that tells the story of how non-white queer women and transwomen started a gun control movement in 1820, then I would very much like to read it.

I specify the year 1820 because Hogg’s use of the plural for century indicates a minimum of 200 years, and the United States will be only 244 years old this July 4. In the 44-year period between 1776 and 1820, our country was nearly always at war, including the Revolutionary War, the Franco-American Naval War, the Barbary Wars, the War of 1812, and the Creek War. During that time our nation still relied upon militias composed of volunteers with privately owned rifles and pistols. So restricting arms only to those citizens who belonged to a standing army would not only have severely hampered a fledgling America’s struggle for existence both on home soil and abroad, but gun control as we know it today would have been an alien concept to American colonists and early citizens.

At that time, the British East India Company — a private company answerable to stockholders, not an organ of the British government — had the largest armed force in the world, consisting of multiple armies with cavalry and artillery assets, as well as fleets of heavily armed merchantmen supplemented with warships. Furthermore, the Constitution of the United States includes a framework for Congress to write letters of marque and reprisal, which granted private citizens the ability to hunt ships of hostile nations for the good of the country. These private citizens did this with privately held warships armed with naval-scale cannons.

Given just these two examples, it is clear the highest levels of military hardware were available to private owners, and that small arms — including those suitable for military use — were therefore ubiquitous. So ubiquitous were they that states and municipalities would fine able-bodied men for not having weapons or participating in militia musters. There were even laws fining people for traveling or attending church unarmed.

However, while the colonists and early citizens of the United States were well-armed and saw virtually no restrictions on what arms they could own or when they could carry or use them in a peaceful manner, this was not true for all inhabitants of the land. Many people of color were brought to this country as slaves, and as property, they had no rights. Furthermore, free persons of color and Native Americans were often prevented by law from owning firearms.

Such gun control as Hogg champions would have hurt those fighting slavery. Abolitionists were highly unpopular and threatened with violence or worse. Rev. Elijah Parish Lovejoy, publisher of the abolitionist newspaper The Saint Louis Observer, was murdered by a pro-slavery mob who shot him before destroying his new printing press. Members of the Underground Railroad needed to protect themselves from law enforcement and bounty hunters enforcing fugitive slave laws, and so were often armed. The most famous example of these is Harriet Tubman, who carried a pistol for self defense while escorting runaway slaves to freedom.

While the 14th Amendment eliminated some of this discrimination, many additional laws were passed to keep people of color, the poor, and other “undesirables” from owning or carrying arms as part of the many Jim Crow laws of the time. Some of these statutes have survived to the present day, such as the North Carolina Pistol Purchase Permit. It requires that an applicant be of “good moral character” despite the fact that “The term ‘good moral character’ is not defined in our statutes nor is there a case specifically on point as to what constitutes good moral character for purposes of a pistol purchase permit.”

Needless to say, being a person of color was ample reason to deny a permit under these circumstances. Most famously, in 1950 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, applied for an Alabama concealed-weapon permit after receiving death threats. He was, of course, denied. In the 1960s, California’s Mulford Act banned the open carry of firearms as a direct reaction to members of the Black Panthers patrolling minority neighborhoods while visibly armed.

More recently, 19 states maintained sodomy laws which, until their overturn by the Supreme Court in 2003, could mean the arrest and prosecution of people for “unethical sex acts,” i.e., consensual sex between queer people, the punishment for which would often be severe enough to make the convicted a person prohibited from owning firearms. Even today there is nothing to stop racist, sexist, or homophobic and transphobic police chiefs from denying people permits because of their race, religion, gender presentation, or sexuality in jurisdictions with may-issue gun laws.

Hogg’s ridiculous claims not only ignore history, but discount how all gun control disproportionately affects queer people and people of color. Or, put another way: Hogg isn’t just wrong, he’s fractally wrong: not merely wrong, but wrong on every scale, with pockets of small wrongness concealed within larger wrongness; wrong from any analytical viewpoint, with each piece self-similarly wrong.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/02/05/no-david-hogg-minority-and-lgbt-people-did-not-start-the-anti-gun-movement/,2020-02-05
Beto’s Back As Biden’s Chief Gun Grabber,"Former Vice President Joe Biden appears to be in the tank for confiscating millions of lawfully owned firearms and locking up gun owners who dare to resist.

Biden invited Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke, the failed presidential contender, on the stage in a rally in Texas and declared him the gun control sheriff for the Biden campaign. “I want to make something clear – I’m gonna guarantee you, this is not the last you’re seeing of this guy. You’re gonna take care of the gun problem with me, you’re gonna be the one who leads this effort. I’m counting on you, I’m counting on you, we need you badly,” he said.

O’Rourke’s own presidential ambitions crashed and burned last year shortly after he emphatically announced in a primary debate, “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.”

He Said It

That’s right. The former U.S. congressman from Texas proposed forcefully confiscating the more than 17.7 million commonly owned modern sporting rifles in circulation today. Any owner who dared to not “voluntarily comply” with his confiscation vision would face jail time.

O’Rouke said, “I think just as in any law that is not followed or flagrantly abused there have to be consequences or else there is no respect for the law. So in that case I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and make sure that it is purchased, bought back, so that it cannot be potentially used against somebody else.”

O’Rourke masked his confiscation ideas as a “mandatory buyback.” Even if, and it’s very doubtful, Americans would turn out en masse to surrender their right to keep and bear arms, the costs would be overwhelming. O’Rourke commented on an Arkansas stop where AR-15s sold for $395, certainly on the low side of the cost of modern sporting rifle.

But if that were the running cost for Beto’s federal government confiscation, it would be nearly $7 billion. That’s assuming every modern sporting rifle is worth only $395. If the median price were closer to $500, it’s $9 billion. At $750, it’s $13.2 billion, and at an even grand per rifle, it’s a clean $17.7 billion. Pretty soon, we’re talking about real money, even for politicians who love to spend other people’s money.

Economic aside, O’Rourke couldn’t answer the dilemma of his proposal. Criminals, by definition, don’t obey the law. Law-abiding citizens do. His confiscation answer would only disarm a civil society and leave them vulnerable to criminals who would prey upon them.

That Dog Won’t Hunt

O’Rourke later tried to amend his proposal when a teen hunter in Iowa challenged him on why he wanted to confiscate the young man’s hunting rifle. “So, this is the first time that I’ve heard the case made for using an AR-15 to hunt deer,” O’Rourke said. “I’ve heard feral hogs in Texas, which are a real problem…”

He offered that Americans could follow the English or German models and keep guns locked in hunt clubs. Except that’s not what the Second Amendment says.

That’s not all O’Rourke wants, either. His gun control agenda included federal registration for all guns, mandatory training and licensing for firearms ownership, mandatory but technically impossible microstamping, a ban on standard magazines and suppressors, increase on firearms excise taxes to pay for “gun violence” programs, and age-based gun bans.

O’Rourke also called to revive the Obama administration’s illegal Operation Choke Point by having credit card companies to refuse to honor sales for modern sporting rifles. It was an idea pushed by New York Times’ Alan Ross Sorkin to have businesses decide which rights are proper for Americans.

Shine up that tin star. Looks like O’Rourke’s the new gun control sheriff in town.

"Joe Biden Is Ignorant And Dishonest About Guns, Just Like The Media","Set aside Joe Biden’s weirdly aggressive response to the Detroit auto plant worker who challenged him on gun control policy at a campaign stop yesterday—Biden tells the guy, “you’re full of sh-t,” calls him a “horse’s ass,” and later threatens to slap him in the face—and consider instead how the blue-check media exulted in it.

Instead of noting how Biden distorted his record, or that he was factually wrong on almost every particular about guns, pundits and reporters focused on the optics, on how great it was that Biden stood up to a random voter who dared to question him.

Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Epstein spun the exchange as Biden pushing back, and speculated that Biden supporters are “into it.” Jonathan Martin of The New York Times euphemized the exchange as an “earthy Biden encounter” that probably won’t hurt him with voters, which it probably won’t, at least not with Democratic primary voters.

But take a look at this exchange and then tell me the big takeaway here is what a good job Biden did dealing with a tough question about gun control.

This is insane. Beyond telling the guy he’s “full of shit” Biden gets in his face and then says something about “take this outside.” Mainstream media can’t run cover for this much longer. Anyone know who the man is? Would love to have him on the show. https://t.co/MwnUiEeGUJ — Dave Rubin (@RubinReport) March 10, 2020

Somehow, the media thought Biden did great. No one exemplified this fawning reaction better than The Atlantic’s David Frum, who thought it was “amazing that anybody thinks this video makes Biden look anything other than terrific. He shushes the aide who wants to lead him away—and then engages a hostile critic face to face, fact to fact. Impressive.”

One wonders what “facts” Frum thought he heard from Biden, who told the Detroit man the government “would take your AR-14s” (no such gun exists), and that AR-15s are “machine guns” (nope) that are “illegal” (they aren’t). After this string of false statements, Biden then blurts out, without context, “Do you need 100 rounds? Do you need 100 rounds?!”

By contrast, the auto plant worker’s remark that triggered the exchange was a straightforward statement of fact: “You are actively trying to diminish our Second Amendment rights and take away our guns.” Any plain reading of Biden’s proposed gun control policies—like banning AR-15s, the most popular gun in America—is consistent with that statement.

What’s more, the man accurately references comments Biden made at rally on March 2 while accepting the endorsement of Beto O’Rourke. Biden said, “I’m going to guarantee this is not the last you’ve seen of this guy,” referring to O’Rourke. “You’re going to take care of the gun problem with me. You’re going to be the one who leads this effort.”

How else can one interpret that except as an endorsement of gun confiscation? After all, it was O’Rourke who in a September debate boasted, “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.”

This is just a rundown of the “facts” in this brief encounter. There’s also the question of Biden’s horrible demeanor, first toward his aide—the young woman he angrily shushes like a child—and then his immediate Grampa Simpson-like irritability toward the auto plant worker.

So far from being “impressive” or making Biden look “terrific,” the incident both plays to fears about Biden’s mental sharpness and calls into question the sincerity of his lofty rhetoric about a return to decency and normalcy. If anything, Biden’s performance here was positively Trumpian, and not in a good way.

Biden’s Running a Big Risk Here

Again, this incident might not hurt him with Democratic primary voters, but Biden’s combination of belligerence and ignorance in this case is just the sort of thing that could be effectively used against him in the general election. Not only is gun confiscation deeply unpopular (just ask Barack Obama), but Biden’s response to pointed questions about his proposed gun policy was completely disingenuous and unconvincing.

Biden can wag his finger all he wants and insist he supports the Second Amendment, but no one will believe it if he then turns around and tells cheering crowds of Democrats that he’s going to put O’Rourke in charge of his AR-15 confiscation effort.

Maybe he’s just playing to his base, hoping hardcore Democrats don’t believe his empty rhetoric about supporting the Second Amendment. Maybe he’s counting on the media to indulge their narrow biases and laud him for standing up to a random gun nut, no matter how much he gets wrong or how cantankerously he comes off.

Problem is, ordinary Americans can watch the video and come to their own conclusions. Joe Biden supports the Second Amendment? What a bunch of malarkey.

Why Governments Shouldn’t Close Gun Stores During A Pandemic,"Business across America is grinding to a halt. Some of this is due to self-isolation and some to stay-at-home orders by government officials. There are exceptions for businesses critical to maintaining a functioning society. Gun businesses need to be among them.

Americans are turning out in droves to purchase firearms. In times of crisis, keeping yourself and your loved ones safe must be certain. America is entering into an unsettled time, and hundreds of thousands of Americans, many of whom have never owned a gun before, are taking action.

Gun stores across the nation are flooded with customers. The FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System officials told the National Shooting Sports Foundation that background checks skyrocketed 300 percent March 16, 2020, compared to the same date one year prior. FBI officials told the firearm industry trade association that since Feb. 23, background checks have been roughly double each day what they were a year ago.

The exact numbers will be available in early April, but all expect firearm sales figures to be eye-popping. The reasoning is easy to understand. Americans want to know they have access to guns when there are real concerns for personal safety. Authorities announced they would no longer jail nonviolent offenders, and some police departments are being forced to quarantine and temporarily reduce staff due to health concerns.

Disparate Closure Orders

Governors and mayors are issuing a patchwork of orders hampering essential manufacturing and retail services. The Department of Homeland Security critical infrastructure list doesn’t carry the force of law, however. It is only government guidance.

Right now, governmental orders are arbitrary. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s shelter-in-place order specifically declared that firearm and ammunition suppliers and retailers are essential and may remain open for business. That’s not the case everywhere, though.

In California, the state government ordered residents to stay in their homes, and local governments including Santa Clara and Contra Costa counties and the City of San Jose have ordered firearms retailers to close.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s order for nonessential workers to stay home shuttered Remington’s plant in Ilion.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont ordered nonessential businesses to close, while allowing defense-related work to continue — excluding firearms retailers.

Athens-Clarke County in Georgia passed an ordinance requiring firearms retailers to close as nonessential businesses. [UPDATE: The county has reversed itself and listed firearms retailers as essential businesses.]

In Nevada, the governor has not included firearms companies in the list of essential businesses.

Pennsylvania’s governor ordered the closing of all “non-life-sustaining businesses.”

Additional localities, including New Orleans, have measures in place that could lead to the shutdown of firearms businesses.

That’s why the firearm industry trade association is working with Capitol Hill, governors, and local officials — not to request a government bailout, but to detail the indispensable role firearms commerce provides for a free and functioning American society. Keeping gun businesses running isn’t a luxury of a free state. It is a necessity.

Necessary for the Security…

The Founding Fathers knew firearms were critical for the functioning of a free society. It’s spelled out in the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

That’s why the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security to request it include firearm and ammunition businesses in its list of critical infrastructure industry sectors that should remain open during this public health crisis. Firearm and ammunition industries are crucial for national security and community safety, especially during a time of societal vulnerability. Even while our nation’s scientists and doctors search for a way to head off infection, the military and law enforcement missions continue.

Firearm and ammunition production is vital, as these manufacturers fulfill government contracts to keep American and allied troops armed. The U.S. military acquires virtually all its small arms from domestic commercial firearm manufacturers. All handgun ammunition the U.S. military uses is sourced from commercial ammunition manufacturers.

The Department of Defense arsenal located in Lake City, Missouri, is operated by a commercial ammunition manufacturer, and most of the rifle ammunition the U.S. military uses is produced in Lake City. The U.S. military also purchases rifle ammunition directly from domestic commercial ammunition manufacturers.

Critical, too, are the retailers and ranges for community safety. Most law enforcement agencies obtain firearms and ammunition from their local, federally licensed firearms retailer. Retailers and ranges are also a valuable resource for gun owners regarding safe firearm storage and use.

What New Gun Owners Must Know

New gun owners might find themselves in a dilemma. They brought their new gun home but aren’t sure what to do. Some might also be under stay-at-home orders, making it difficult to get to a range to learn from a qualified instructor. One of the first considerations every gun owner must make after purchasing a firearm is deciding which safe storage option works best.

NSSF says every firearm when not carried or in use should be locked up beyond the reach of those who aren’t authorized to possess them, including children, prohibited individuals, and those who may be experiencing a mental health crisis. Each new firearm includes a cable lock, and NSSF’s Project Childsafe distributes these to law enforcement officers to hand out free of charge.

Besides cable locks, gun owners can get lockboxes, biometric safes, or traditional upright safes. Firearms owners must understand which option works best for them and should thoroughly read and understand the user manual included with each new firearm.

Ryan Cleckner founded GunUniversity.com and is a former Army Ranger sniper, firearms attorney, and author of “Long Range Shooting Handbook.” He’s an unparalleled firearms expert who updated his Gun University’s Gun 101 page to give new owners the tools they need, including lessons on how to safely unload a gun, help finding qualified training, and the four foundational safety rules for firearms. NSSF offers videos that teach these rules:

Always point a firearm in a safe direction.

Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot.

Treat every gun as if it were loaded.

Know your target and what’s around it, including beyond it.

If new owners aren’t ordered to stay home, they should seek reputable and qualified training. NSSF’s LetsGoShooting.org is a good place to start, with an entire section dedicated to new shooters and an interactive map to find a range for safe shooting.

Democrat Governors Back Off Gun-Buying Bans During State Shutdowns,"It’s not often the firearm industry gets to thank New Jersey’s Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. He’s certainly no friend of the industry. However, he justified the National Shooting Sports Foundation’s work with the White House and Department of Homeland Security to list firearm businesses as “essential critical infrastructure.”

Murphy had been the lone governor holding out on an emergency order that deprived his citizens of their ability to purchase firearms. His order closed retailers and shut down state police from running the required background checks. Now that DHS updated the list, specifically including firearm manufacturers, distributors, and retailers as “essential,” Murphy has changed his tune.

“It wouldn’t be my definition, but that’s the definition at the federal level, and I didn’t get a vote on that,” Murphy said in a press conference, updating the status change in the statewide gun rights ban. This realization affirms why NSSF worked diligently to protect the industry from ideologue politicians who would use a crisis to further their anti-gun agenda.

Can’t Buy, Can’t Defend

The Trump administration’s move to safeguard the rights of Americans to keep and bear arms is essential. The ability to exercise that right begins at the gun counter. When gun control activist politicians seized on an emergency to delay or outright deny the ability to lawfully purchase firearms, especially during times of uncertainty, the work of the firearm industry trade association and the Trump administration proved vital.

A free society depends on the ability of law-abiding citizens to exercise all their civil liberties, including the pre-existing right to keep and bear arms.

The National Shooting Sports Foundation saw the need to ensure Americans could exercise this right before the avalanche of governmental stay-at-home orders started. Firearm sales were skyrocketing. The FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System officials confirmed to the trade association that a spike in background checks on March 16 reached 300 percent over the same day in 2019.

Since Feb. 23, they added, background checks have been roughly double what they were a year ago. That pace has remained steady.

Necessary for Security

The reasoning behind this is easy to understand. During times of uncertainty, Americans want to be sure about the safety of themselves and their loved ones. Safety and security are critical for a functioning society. That’s why the Founding Fathers penned it into the Bill of Rights not as a desire or status to be achieved, but as a necessity.

The NSSF knew this to be true, which is why it reached out quickly to the White House and the Department of Homeland Security for the firearm industry to be listed among others as essential. NSSF also worked with senators, members of Congress, governors, attorneys general, county officials, and mayors to make sure firearm retailers stayed open.

Kris Brown of the gun control group Brady Campaign claimed over the weekend that there is no constitutional right to immediately sell guns. But a right delayed is a right denied. For Brown and other gun control activists, it’s perfectly fine to twist a crisis to push an agenda.

Some governors, including those who embrace strict gun control, understand now isn’t the time to be fiddling with enumerated rights. The right to keep and bear a gun must also include the right to legally purchase one.

Politics Aside

Proving this is a rights issue and not a “red vs. blue” issue was Gov. J.B. Pritzker, the Democrat governor of Illinois. Pritzker was among the first governors to issue an emergency order, and his specifically noted firearm businesses were essential services. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont did the same. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf relented on his attempt to block gun sales. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton reminded Lone Star State counties and municipalities that the state legislature sets firearm polices. In Texas, gun businesses remain open.

There are still challenges, to be sure. Los Angeles Sheriff Alex Villanueva is taking it upon himself to interpret executive orders and DHS guidance. He decided after closing, reopening, and then closing gun stores again that retailers there could sell, but only to law enforcement and certified security guards. North Carolina’s Wake County Sheriff Gerald Baker is refusing to sign handgun purchase permits, a holdover Jim Crow-era law that gives county sheriffs nearly complete autonomy on who can buy handguns.

This guidance from DHS, however, shows how important NSSF’s work is for all Americans, including during pandemics.

Why Owning A Gun Is A Rational Insurance Policy Against Danger,"The social and economic uncertainty surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic has Americans understandably concerned about their personal safety. In March 2020, the FBI reported the highest monthly number of firearms background checks ever recorded: 3,740,688. Compared to March of the previous year, Americans bought 1.1 million more guns in a single month. Ammunition is also flying off the shelves, with sales in some states increasing more than 4,000 percent.

Many recent first gun-buyers are people who were previously either ambivalent or even opposed to gun ownership. Several such people have reached out to me with questions about which gun they should buy. Many fellow firearms instructors report the same experience.

It’s easy to see why Americans are worried. While we live in a generally high-trust society, catastrophes can easily disrupt the delicate social order on which that trust depends. As it is sometimes said, we are all only nine meals away from anarchy.

Desperate people do desperate things. Economic goods are human goods, and while the current lockdowns are necessary to contain the pandemic, they carry real human costs. Many of these costs — joblessness, homelessness, mental health issues, and drug abuse — lend themselves easily to criminal behavior.

Always Be Prepared

Am I saying society is on the brink of collapse? No, we are far from an apocalypse. The point is simply that the world is and has always been a risky place, so it makes perfect sense to be proactive and prepared. When things are peaceful and prosperous, we often don’t pay attention to danger because things are going so well. But in times of great social and economic stress, we are more attuned to things that might go wrong.

Having a disaster plan isn’t as foreign as some might think. We routinely make decisions aimed at mitigating risks. We purchase insurance, maintain emergency savings, and get flu shots. We keep spare tires, jumper cables, flashlights, and fire extinguishers handy, and buy extra supplies just in case we might need them.

Unless you happen to be naively optimistic, you’re already a “prepper.” Even if you’re relatively “lucky,” you can bet something catastrophic will eventually befall you sometime in your life. Better to be prepared than to be caught off guard.

Prepping for improbable events isn’t necessarily irrational; it is often wise. Consider this: In 2017, more than 2.7 million people were injured in 6.4 million car crashes. With 327 million people in the United States, this means the baseline probability of you getting injured in a car accident each year is slightly over 0.8 percent.

Now, a 0.8 percent chance might be perceived as pretty good odds. After all, that’s a 99.2 percent chance you won’t be injured. But .8 percent of 327 million still comes out to 2.7 million people each year, which is no small number. Are you willing to bet you’ll never be one of those unlucky few? Probably not.

Although your chances of getting into an accident are small, consider what you stand to lose if you do get injured. Making preparations, such as buying insurance or carrying road flares, isn’t irrational, despite statistical improbability.

The Odds of Violent Crime Are Higher than You Think

With that point in mind, let’s look at the odds of violent criminal victimization. In 2018, 3.3 million people ages 12 and older were victimized in 6 million violent crimes. There were 23.2 violent victimizations per 1,000 U.S. residents ages 12 and older, meaning 2.3 percent of Americans 12 and older were victims of violent crime in 2018. This is much greater than the baseline odds of injury from motor vehicle accidents, for which preparation is rational.

If you have a 1-in-50 baseline chance of being violently victimized each year, wouldn’t it be rational to take prudent measures to protect yourself? I think so.

That is exactly why millions of ordinary Americans own guns. Firearms are extremely effective in preventing injury and do not require a great deal of effort to use and keep around. Guns are a perfectly reasonable, cost-effective, safe, and convenient form of risk mitigation.

Owning a gun is like keeping a spare tire in your trunk, a first aid kit at home, or an emergency savings account. We hope never to use them, but we’re glad we have them. None of this indicates paranoia. Carrying a gun is similar to carrying insurance, except it’s better: You actually get to collect the benefits without having to incur serious harm.

Insurance against national catastrophe makes pretty good sense when you consider the past few hundred years of failed states, civil wars, and less-than-ideal regimes. Among other things, the track record of state-sanctioned citizen slaughter, vigilante violence, and racial conflict shows that when societies do go bad, they tend to go extremely bad. Think of the hundreds of sovereign nations that no longer exist due to war and internal strife.

Police, of course, serve a valuable public function. But most police responses come after crimes have already been committed. Less than half of all personal crimes are even reported to police. Moreover, in times of crisis, police are stretched thin. At the time of writing this, 17 percent of the New York Police Department is out sick, and many police departments are not performing arrests or even responding to “minor” crimes.

All this highlights the need to be self-reliant. Ultimately, we are our own last line of defense. We may delegate some of our protection to civil authorities, but the natural right to protect ourselves is inseparable from our humanity.

Gun Owners Aren’t Paranoid, They’re Smart

Some people believe you’re more likely to harm yourself or someone else with a gun than to use it in self-defense, but that isn’t the case. The findings of more than 19 surveys specifically designed to measure the number of defensive gun uses all confirm that defensive uses are vastly more common than criminal uses. A small sampling of these can be viewed on the Active Self-Protection YouTube channel, which has collected several hundred video clips of successful civilian self-defense encounters.

The often-heard charge that gun owners are paranoid and fearful is just naive psychoanalysis unsupported by credible research. Indeed, a recent study has found that gun owners report lower levels of fear and victimization than those who don’t own guns. If anything, there is a lot of irrational fear directed toward firearms as inanimate objects, something famed firearms instructor Jeff Cooper calls “hoplophobia.”

To all the new gun owners out there: Welcome to the Second Amendment community. We’re glad you’ve decided to take the protection of yourself and your loved ones seriously. Get training, be responsible, and be prepared.

"Gov. Northam Can’t Help Himself, Picks Gun Control Over Virus Control","Gun control legislation has been all the rage in Richmond since Democrats took over the Virginia General Assembly last November. The Democratic majority teamed with Gov. Ralph Northam in their ambitious efforts to cross items off the gun control checklist, such as enacting a “red flag” law, banning private firearm transfers, reviving a handgun purchase limit, and even implementing a modern sporting rifle ban that was thankfully defeated in committee — for now.

It should come as no surprise, then, that the governor who wouldn’t let his past use of blackface stop his political pandering would also not let a global pandemic stop him and his fellow Democrats from diverting taxpayer funds toward purely symbolic gun control programs.

This past March, as the coronavirus pandemic began sweeping across the nation, Virginia’s General Assembly passed SB 248, a bill that would redirect $3 million in grant money over the next two years to local-level gun control initiatives. Despite the gaping fiscal hole Virginia faces due to Northam’s disjointed efforts to combat COVID-19, the governor is expected to sign this gun control bill.

This is no doubt what Northam must do to satisfy his anti-gun financiers such as Michael Bloomberg, who spent millions to buy the 2019 Virginia election. The state’s taxpayers, however, would be better off if their elected officials instead focused on blunting the economic and health effects of the Wuhan virus.

Three million dollars of taxpayer money is no paltry sum, but for Virginia Democrats it is most likely just the tip of the fiscal iceberg. While the grant allocation has yet to be laid out publicly, a simple comparison to similar programs in other states shows that costs will still be prohibitive. For instance, a contract with the Cure Violence program, which has received similar grants in other states, can cost taxpayers up to $500,000. That’s just one example.

Meanwhile, Virginia’s small businesses are facing economic peril and uncertainty as they try to comply with the governor’s inconsistent plan for allowing business activity to resume — that is, if they were able to survive his interminable lockdown at all. As of May 5, Northam decided against a regional approach to reopening, despite data showing that some parts of the state had experienced zero coronavirus cases.

While the governor was no doubt preoccupied with how he could better serve Bloomberg’s anti-gun agenda, the Roanoke Times pointed out that the governor’s initial reasoning for his reopening policy was illogical and poorly designed. The paper’s editorial board was quick to call out, among other inconsistencies, that the policy was recommended by his “COVID-19 Business Task Force” but that this group did not include anyone from the Roanoke Valley, “the largest metro area west of the urban crescent.”

Despite Northam’s public stance in early May, the governor subsequently reversed course, and Virginia went on to reopen regionally. As of May 15, much of the commonwealth had moved to “Phase One” reopening, while northern Virginia remained under lockdown. Yet while parts of the state are being allowed to partially reopen, Northam simultaneously mandated that Virginians must wear face coverings anywhere people gather indoors.

Virginians might take the governor’s attempts at leadership more seriously if he too bothered to wear a mask or socially distance in public, or if Virginia had not ranked 48th out of all U.S states for COVID-19 testing at the onset of the pandemic. Instead of addressing those issues in their infancy or dealing with their subsequent fallout, Northam can’t help but appease his anti-gun political masters by committing a small mountain of taxpayer dollars toward a symbolic gun control program.

There is an upside, however. In late May, Virginia voters turned out for municipal elections and ousted Northam Democrats from city councils that had been Democratic strongholds for years. By angering voters with his anti-gun pandering and his tragically inept handling of the coronavirus, Northam may have tipped the political pendulum of the commonwealth back to red.

Coach Mike Gundy Wasn’t ‘Man’ Enough To Resist The Thought Police,"“I’m a man! I’m 40!” No mater what Oklahoma State head football coach Mike Gundy accomplishes over the course of his career, those are the words that will be etched on the tombstone of his public persona. It was the exclamation point to an epic rant defending his quarterback and the kind of thing coaches can never truly out-coach (see: Jim Mora’s “playoffs” or Dennis Green’s “They are who we thought they were”). Monday was evidence the power dynamic in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and across college athletics has changed dramatically.

The OSU Cowboys’ star running back Chuba Hubbard took his mullet-sporting coach to task over a T-shirt Gundy was wearing in an otherwise innocuous Facebook post. The shirt in question featured his favorite news network, One America News. Gundy says he watches OAN because they “just report the news.”

The New York Times last week referenced OAN as “The Network that Spreads Conspiracies to the West Wing,” noting as evidence President Donald Trump’s tweet that a 75-year-old Buffalo, New York, man, who was hospitalized after police shoved him, was an “ANTIFA provocateur” who may have been trying to “set up” law enforcement. John Oliver recently skewered the network and its cozy relationship with the president. Trump has several times in recent months tweeted his support for the politically right outlet.

Hubbard was not so supportive. The 2,000-yard rusher at Oklahoma State University, who finished in the top 10 of Heisman Trophy-voting, tweeted Monday, “I will not stand for this. This is completely insensitive to everything going on in society, and it’s unacceptable. I will not be doing anything with Oklahoma State until things CHANGE.”

It’s not entirely clear what Hubbard meant by things changing, but it was clearly the T-shirt and Gundy’s choice of news networks that set off the star. Several teammates joined Hubbard’s call for change, including senior linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga and offensive lineman Teven Jenkins, who tweeted, “as an O-line we stand and support Chuba.” College football players publicly shamed their head coach, telling him what to wear and what to watch.

In a matter of hours, Gundy responded and appeared to concede to the players demands. The head coach and running back appeared a video together, with Gundy explaining, “In light of today’s tweet with the T-shirt that I was wearing, I met with some players and realize it’s a very sensitive issue with what’s going on in today’s society. … I’m looking forward to making some changes, and it starts at the top with me.

The Anti-Police Rioters Finally Got Me To Buy My First Gun,"I bought a gun last weekend. It’s not a purchase I wanted to make, and I pray I never have to use it, but with mayhem recently engulfing cities across the United States, I and many others are biting the bullet and purchasing firearms.

Mine is a Springfield 9mm — something small enough to fit in my nightstand or under my driver’s seat should I have to visit one of America’s many war-torn cities. But it’s powerful enough to do the job.

I’ve pondered the purchase for years but always found a reason to put it off. The carnage that has rocked the country over the last couple of weeks, however, sealed the deal. After all, I have a duty to protect my family as best I can, and when the government’s protections begin to break down, a firearm becomes my only option.

It’s not that I have anything against guns — quite the opposite. I’m a big believer in the Second Amendment and have defended Americans’ right to bear arms in writing. But guns were such a fixture of my youth that, like a kid forced by overzealous parents to play baseball year after year, I walked away at my first opportunity.

My father was an independent gun dealer who had me shooting my Chipmunk rifle at four years old, and my mom’s second husband was an avid hunter and gun collector. By the time I was 17, I had shot nearly every gun imaginable, from derringer and Desert Eagle pistols to SKS rifles.

I suppose I enjoyed it all at one point, but it’s been 20 years since I fired a live round. I will be heading to the range this week to correct that error.

I Can’t Count on Anyone Else to Protect Me

I seriously doubt I will get the same trigger rush as my gun-loving friends, but I’m not in this for the thrills. Knowing that if someone kicks in my door I have a fighting chance of defending my home is well worth an arduous hour or so at the range. In fact, I have come to view it as my civic responsibility as I witness, in real time, the unraveling of the societal structures that are supposed to ensure our safety.

For years, liberal politicians and their public relations officers in the mainstream media have attempted to repeal the constitutional right to bear arms protected by the Bill of Rights. We were told our juvenile fantasies of protecting ourselves from a tyrannical government were laughable, given the advanced technology of the U.S. military. You know, all that “What good is a rifle against a fighter jet?” nonsense.

But that’s an absurd framing of the issue, done purposely to deflect from the real reason gun owners so passionately cling to their Second Amendment rights: the gross incompetence of their respective local governments.

That incompetence has been abetted by liberal politicians and pundits who, while trying to strip Americans of their right to protect themselves, also demonized American law enforcement by obsessing over and flooding the media with extremely rare incidents of police brutality. They also, of course, ignored the heroic stories of cops risking their lives to save others.

The tragic combination of these two efforts is now playing itself out on the national stage as cities across the country grant license to mobs of looters and rioters, grifting on the heels of the horrific murder of George Floyd and wreaking havoc on minority communities. The predictable result: cities full of sitting ducks in the throes of national turmoil. Thus far, my town has remained immune from such insanity, but the way this madness is spreading, I fear it’s only a matter of time.

As Police Presence Goes Down, Gun Sales Go Up

The nation’s most iconic newspaper is publishing op-eds calling for the dismantling of police departments across the country. While such thinking was previously confined to America’s most liberal enclaves, it has gained footholds in mid-America cities such as Denver and Nashville.

All the while, violence goes unchecked because America’s police forces either have been ordered to stand down or are paralyzed by the fear that if they do their jobs, the media will ruin their lives. Whatever the reason, I can no longer rely on the government for my safety, and every bad guy in America knows it. Sadly, the left’s concerted campaign against America’s cops is dangerously close to taking them down.

But there’s a silver lining: As America’s cities continue spiraling out of control, millions of Americans like me are exercising their rights and purchasing firearms, thus undoing decades of work by the left to restrict the gun rights of Americans. According to Business Insider:

Federal background checks increased 75% in May compared with 2019, a further acceleration from April’s 69% gain over the previous year, according to Cowen research. Handguns, in particular, were up 94%. Background checks are largely considered a proxy for gun purchases in the absence of more granular sales data.

With weak mayors and powerless police, we have little choice but to take our safety into our own hands.

"No, ‘Gun Violence’ Is Not To Blame For The Spike In Violent Crime","With violent crime skyrocketing in American cities, local officials and mediahave blamed the deaths of innocent children and mostly African-American victims on “gun violence,” a term that obfuscates who is responsible for these tragic crimes.

The term “gun violence” has long been used by gun control groups, politicians, and the media to refer to the criminal misuse of firearms, in an attempt to pin the violence on guns themselves, not criminals, despite the fact that a gun is an inanimate object incapable of violence on its own.

After New York City saw more than 300 people, all minorities, shot since the start of June, the New York Police Department’s Chief of the Community Affairs Bureau Jeffrey Maddrey said “gun violence” was the common enemy of communities and cops.

After a six-year-old African-American boy was shot and killed in San Fransisco while watching fireworks on July Fourth, local media said the mayor decried “gun violence.”

A CNN headline read, “At least 6 children were killed by gun violence across the nation this holiday weekend.”

In a PBS NewsHour report titled, “What’s behind a recent surge in U.S. gun violence — and how to stop it,” one panelist concluded the problem is “the underlying police violence,” saying he believes “there is actually a connection between police violence and community violence.”

Since June 20, nine children under the age of 18 have been shot dead in Chicago, a city that touts some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Similar stories have emerged out of Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C., where the official response is not to address grieving parents asking why black lives don’t matter regarding black-on-black crime, but to instead call for more restrictions on guns.

The Washington Post responded to the recent crimes in their city by publishing an op-ed calling black-on-black crime a “fallacy,” and concluding by blaming “lawmakers’ blind devotion to the NRA.” Nevermind the fact that more homicides are committed every year with knives and blunt objects than are committed with firearms.

Larry Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said there have never been more firearms lawfully owned by Americans, and until very recently, we have seen crime rates plummet. “In reality, when law-abiding citizens own firearms, crime goes down, not up,” he told The Federalist. “What we have here are criminals engaging in criminal activity, illegally possessing firearms, and misusing them to commit their crimes.”

Of course the recent spike in crime is related to a number of complicated and intertwined factors like coronavirus, an economic collapse, the defunding of local police departments, and mayors allowing chaos and anarchy in cities like Seattle. But that has not stopped the gun control lobby’s friends in the media and the Democrat Party from blaming “gun violence” for all of the above.

As for the gun industry and the Second Amendment, all of the above has never made them safer.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/07/09/no-gun-violence-is-not-to-blame-for-the-spike-in-violent-crime/,2020-07-09
‘Defund The Police’ Has Increased Gun Sales And Support For Trump,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants to take federal funds away from any police department that has violated the civil rights of the citizens they serve. The Minneapolis City Council agreed with calls from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) to disband the city’s police department and unanimously passed a resolution to replace the police with a “community-led public safety system.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti seeks to cut $150 million from the police budget. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced he would slash the city’s police department budget too.

Despite all these actions, some leftists are engaging in word gymnastics by stating that “defund” really means reform. Yet, in a New York Times op-ed titled “Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish the Police,” Mariame Kaba — an activist and an anti-crime organizer — clarified for Americans what “Defund the Police” means.

Kaba writes, “We don’t want to just close police departments. We want to make them obsolete.” She criticized a police reform bill put forth by Democrats as something that was tried and failed in the past. She concluded the police couldn’t be reformed because they are always racist, violent, and “don’t catch the bad guys.”

She states, “The surest way of reducing police violence is to reduce the power of the police, by cutting budgets and the number of officers in half” as an immediate step. But don’t confuse that with her ultimate goal: “We don’t want to just close police departments. We want to make them obsolete.”

Without the police, what should the community do to protect themselves against criminals? Kaba suggested using “community care workers” to address mental health issues and “restorative-justice models” instead of “throwing people in prison.”

Thanks to Kaba’s clarification, it seems even many of the leftist readers of The New York Times reject the call to “defund the police” once they grasp its true meaning. One comment at NYTimes.com that accrued more than 2,600 “likes” said: “This is a fantasy. You can fund all the social programs you want, you won’t eliminate crime or disorder. I appreciate law and order.”

Another one with more than 1,300 “likes” wrote: “This is a non-starter for me. Serious reform is needed. But you might as well call for abolishing hospitals or grocery stores.” A man who says he lived in the Bronx during the 1970s exclaimed he knew from firsthand experience that abolishing police is “a terrible idea.”

These readers who disagree with Kaba are not in the minority. An ABC News/Ipsos poll finds 64 percent of Americans oppose the “defund the police” movement and reject many of its goals, such as reallocating police department funding to mental health, housing, and education programs. Even 43 percent of Democrats oppose both defunding the police and reallocating funding to other causes. The poll reveals that the majority of Americans do believe that police keep them safe and a society without police is unthinkable and dangerous.

Americans Realize How Much We Need Good Police

The recent weeks of unrest across America have only served to reinforce the idea that policing is needed to maintain law and order. Americans saw that when police pull back, a movement that started with a legitimate grievance was quickly hijacked by criminals who are bent on destroying the communities and livelihoods of black and Caucasian Americans alike.

Burning down black-owned businesses, looting Louis Vuitton stores, and killing black police officers had nothing to do with finding justice for George Floyd. The combination of the pandemic, the riots, and now the calls for defunding the police have convinced many Americans that they need to become gun owners so they can protect themselves, their families, and their communities.

USA Today reports that Americans are loading up on guns and ammo in the wake of the riots. Firearm sales went up 78 percent in the last week of May, compared to the same time in 2019. The online ammunition website Ammo.com saw a 602 percent increase in revenue since the pandemic.

The International Firearm Specialist Academy website saw a 50 percent rise in first-time gun owners taking online training classes. The FBI reported more than 3 million background checks in May, the highest for on record for that month. Gun and ammo manufacturers and retail shops expect sales to remain strong in June too.

Gun restriction has long been a top issue in the Democratic Party’s platform. During the Democrat presidential primary race, all candidates advocated for strict gun laws including universal background checks and the banning of assault weapons. The recent surge of firearm sales presents Democrats a dilemma: they can’t call for defunding the police and gun control at the same time. Democrats have to choose one.

If they keep supporting the “defund the police” movement, Democrats will lose on the gun control issue because when Americans hear “defunding the police,” they hear government giving up enforcing laws and protecting law-abiding citizens. They envision a lawless world where no one will help them when criminals rob their houses or attempt to rape women.

Americans don’t need any data (although there is plenty) to tell them that when police retreat, crime spikes. As long as there is a persistent call for defunding the police, Americans will take matters into their own hands by becoming gun owners and Democrats will fail to win hearts and minds on the gun control issue.

Voters Will Turn to Trump For Law and Order

The “Defund the Police” movement has not only turned more Americans into gun owners and supporters for the Second Amendment, but may prove to be a boon for President Trump’s reelection campaign. Since downtown Oakland saw some of the worst riots and looting in the nation, I recently checked in with a friend who lives there to make sure she and her family are safe.

Like me, she’s an immigrant from China and experienced Chairman Mao Zedong’s “Cultural Revolution” when growing up. Unlike me, she has supported Democrats for years. She loathes everything Trump stands for, from his immigration rhetoric to positions on foreign policy. For the sake of our friendship, we typically avoid discussing domestic politics as well.

This time, however, she went straight to domestic politics. She told me she and her family were safe but the riots and looting in downtown Oakland were terrifying. She was heartbroken to see so many immigrant-owned “mom and pop” stores ransacked or even burned to the ground.

She conveyed that while she wanted to see justice for Floyd, night after night of destruction and lawlessness were just “too much.” They reminded her of China’s “Cultural Revolution” from 1966-1976. She told me: “I didn’t come all this way to America to re-live a ‘Cultural Revolution’ in 2020.” Then she said something I would never have thought she’d say before: “Trump is right. We need law and order.”

She’s not the only longtime Democrat who is deeply troubled by the call to get rid of the police. Bill Maher, the host of “Real Time,” also blasted Democrats for their call to “defend the police.” “That’s so ‘Democrats’ for you,” said Maher, “You know, they must have meetings to be this f—ing stupid about politics. ‘Hey guys, we’re making some headway here, how could we turn this into something that makes people have to vote for Trump?’”

There is probably a silent majority of level-headed Americans, who, like my friend, are sick to their stomach to see the injustice and brutality that Floyd suffered. They demand justice for Floyd and serious reform for our nation’s police force.

What’s equally important to this silent majority, however, is that they don’t want to continue to experience constant chaos, lawlessness, and destruction. Many probably are troubled by some of the president’s tweets and disagree with him on a number of issues. But if the choice this November is between “Defund the Police” and “Law and Order,” many will hold their nose and vote for Trump.

AG Lawsuit Scares These NRA Members Much More Than NRA Spending,"New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit last week calling for the dissolution of the National Rifle Association because “assets are required to be used in a way that serves the interests of NRA membership,” as opposed to the way she alleges millions of dollars were spent for personal use by NRA leadership. Yet James’s mission to dissolve the NRA also does not serve the interests of the millions of NRA members, but weakens those interests even more.

Two years ago, James ran for the NY AG office on a promise to stand up to the NRA, which is headquartered in Virginia but incorporated in New York, calling the gun-rights group a “terrorist organization” and a “criminal enterprise.” James is certainly fulfilling that promise, and just months before a national election to boot.

James’s investigation alleges NRA executives siphoned off $64 million from the non-profit to pay for personal expenses such as private jets, lavish vacations, and expensive dinners. But these are not the first signs of trouble at the top of the organization, and certainly not news to many who pay membership dues, the very people James claims to be protecting.

Just in the last year, the 150-year-old organization has battled infighting of board members, lawsuits, and an open revolt from members at its 2019 annual meeting. Last summer, after contract disputes and financial problems with their longtime marketing and PR firm, Ackerman McQueen, the organization shuttered NRATV, the production arm that familiarized non-members most with the NRA brand and personalities such as Dana Loesch and Colin Noir. There are more than 5 million NRA members, but it is estimated more than 15 million Americans believe they are members but are not current on their membership dues.

The NRA is now counter-suing James, claiming she “maligned” the group “without a single shred of evidence, nor any sincere belief, that the NRA was violating the New York Not-For-Profit Corporation Law.”

Our Rights Are More Important Than Political Squabbles

Despite the turmoil at the top, NRA members tell The Federalist they are far more worried about a future without the Second Amendment group than one with organizational problems, like leaders who “spend money when they’re not supposed to,” as one member described the scandal.

Rick Travis, director of development of the California Rifle and Pistol Association, is a lifetime member of the NRA, who has also served as a trainer for NRA firearms instructors for over a decade.

“For the five million members out there, there’s not really a denial so much that there are some issues at the top that need to be resolved, like in any non-profit or even a for-profit organization…there are always going to be rumors circulating and we want to see what’s true and what isn’t true, but that’s not the job of the attorney general of any state, let alone New York,” Travis told The Federalist.

Travis said many of the members he talks to at trainings and competitions are aware the NRA was instrumental in getting President Donald Trump elected in 2016, and that this lawsuit appears to be a reaction to that.

“It feels like it’s a gross overreach of power, and it’s being done politically. It’s not being done for anything other than a charge to try and devalue the NRA,” he said.

Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works and NRA member, said his only reaction is that it was completely unsurprising the state of New York would start such an investigation. He added this is the NRA’s own fault — not for allowing alleged fraud or abuse, but for being incorporated in such a notoriously anti-gun state that would undoubtedly treat the group unfairly.

“That’s dumbest thing I’ve ever heard of in my life, and I had no idea. I assumed that the NRA actually had their documentation out of Virginia,” he said. But other than moving the organization to a pro-gun state like Texas or Georgia, Cargill’s only advice was to get it sorted out before the November election.

“They need to work through whatever this problem is, get it fixed, and get on target and get on message, because if we don’t, you know, this election season, you know we’re gonna get our clock cleaned,” he warned.

Other NRA members believe James’s lawsuit has nothing to do with the NRA, but is part of a broader scheme by Democrats to nationalize state and local elections. Mike Cox, political legislative director of the Texas State Rifle Association, a state affiliate of the NRA, told The Federalist most of his organization’s members are focused on marksmanship and competitions, not politics. According to Cox, many are unaware of the threats to their local politics from outside groups like the Mike Bloomberg-funded, anti-gun group Moms Demand Action.

“This is no accident that [James] filed that lawsuit less than 85 days until the election,” Cox said, decrying the amount of out-of-state money and strategy being poured into Texas House elections. “[Our members] are not political. They’re shocked when we tell them, ‘Do you realize we got more risk coming our way right now than we did when Santa Ana was coming up here to take our guns in 1836?'”

Kamala Harris Scares Gun Owners

Although a year of coronavirus, lockdowns, and protests have driven record-setting gun sales across the country, including a wave of first-time gun owners, the threat of the anti-gun lobby and gun law restrictions remains very real to NRA members and non-members alike. Every person I spoke to cited Joe Biden’s selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate as a cause for concern considering her notoriously anti-gun record.

“We have a number of leading Democrat candidates camouflaging their record on the Second Amendment and gun control, but there’s no avoiding the case of Biden and Kamala Harris,” said Larry Keane, senior vice president and general counsel at the National Shooting Sports Foundation. He recalled a Biden campaign stop in Detroit, Michigan where Biden told an auto plant worker concerned about the Second Amendment that he’s “full of sh-t” and that the government has a right to “take your AR-14s.”

In California, Travis has not forgotten his state senator’s hypocrisy on guns. Harris, who has said she owns a gun “for personal safety,” also filed a Supreme Court amicus brief in support of Washington, D.C.’s ban on most personal handgun ownership.

Can’t Beat Gun Owners, So They Try To Shut Them Up

Keane said the NY AG’s investigation is clearly a political hit, and not just against the Second Amendement but a threat to the First Amendment, based on “the fact that [James] is seeking to dissolve the organization rather than to just address the financial allegations.”

“It’s because they can’t defeat the pro-gun movement, they can’t achieve their legislative agenda, and so rather than win on the merits of the argument, they try to silence and muzzle the voice [of the NRA], and that can be troubling,” he said. “This is very a concerning attempt to silence a political voice leading into an election, in which the issue that organization speaks to is central in that election.”

As David Harsanyi writes, “not in a million years, not if all the nation’s prestigious public-relations firms were mobilized for the cause, could gun manufacturers have conceived of a more effective advertising campaign for their product than the ‘defund the police’ movement.” While this may also be true for the security of the pro-gun movement as a whole, maybe that’s why the NY AG had no choice but to seek full dissolution of the entire organization. Simply forcing NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre to correct his wrongs would not have aided the gun control lobby like she intends to.

NRA members and gun owners alike know this is bigger than private jets and expensive dinners. With an election on the horizon, they see this conveniently-timed lawsuit for exactly what it is: a direct attack on the institutional voice they choose to protect their Constitutional rights.

Joe Biden Crassly Capitalizes On Cop-Killing Attempt For Gun Control,"Joe Biden has a way of twisting and co-opting events to usher in his radical anti-gun agenda. This is evident most recently in his thoughtless tweet demanding his vision of far-left gun control in the wake of an assassination attempt on two Los Angeles County Sheriff deputies.

The former vice president, who is trotted out by his wife as the presidential candidate who “feels” America’s angst, was blithely callous when he tweeted for gun and magazine bans less than 24 hours after a criminal brazenly walked up to a sheriff’s vehicle and fired several times with a handgun, critically wounding two deputies.

Biden’s first instinct was to call for a ban on “weapons of war,” facts be damned. What’s more important to Biden is to establish the “it’s the gun’s fault” narrative. Biden also demonstrated willful ignorance concerning how he and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., are complicit in stoking anti-police animus.

Ignorance or Exposure

Biden either exposes his ignorance of firearms and existing laws or opens up his true intentions on gun control. “Weapons of war have no place in our communities,” his tweet said. “We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.”

Surveillance video clearly shows the assailant walk up to the deputies’ vehicle and fire a handgun several times, striking both deputies in the face and head. The criminal wasn’t holding Biden’s vaunted “assault weapon,” a term invented by gun control advocates to scare Americans into adopting the gun control narrative.

The Violence Policy Center’s Josh Sugarmann created the term in 1988 to confuse and mislead the public into believing that commonly owned semiautomatic rifles are the same as machine guns. Sugarmann wrote, “[A]nything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine gun [and] — can only increase the chance of public support for restrictions of these weapons.” In reality, the modern sporting rifle operates in the same manner as other semiautomatic firearms, firing one round with each pull and release of the trigger.

Biden knows this yet perpetuates this myth. He cherry-picks data to support his political agenda but ignores the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s findings that the ban on AR-15 rifles and magazines had no effect on crime reduction. He would reinstate an even more draconian version of the 1994 assault weapons ban. Instead of just banning the sale of modern sporting rifles with certain cosmetic features that have no bearing on the firearm’s function, he’d go further.

Biden’s Gun Control

Biden’s plan would put current modern sporting-rifle owners on government watchlists by forcing them to register their guns under the restrictions of the National Firearms Act, which is the same tax-and-license plan in place for machine guns and firearm suppressors. These permits require fingerprint and photo submissions, tax fees, multiple background checks, and paperwork delays averaging nine months or longer.

It gets worse. Biden’s plan includes a provision to use taxpayer funds to “buy back” privately owned firearms from those who refuse to register with government watchlists. Biden also stood on the campaign stage with Beto O’Rourke, pledging to make him his gun control czar, even after the former representative from Texas shouted “Hell, yes,” he would confiscate modern sporting rifles by force, if necessary.

If he got his way, Biden would put the more than 18 million modern sporting rifles in circulation in jeopardy. He’d also outlaw more than half the firearm magazines in possession today, according to questions raised by a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which rejected California’s ban as unconstitutional. That decision is pending an en banc hearing, and 17 state attorneys general signed on, begging the court to keep the ban.

Doing Backers’ Bidding

Biden is purposefully conflating handguns and criminal activity with lawful firearm ownership. The concern is why. Biden’s tweet clearly labels what he sees in the video as a “weapon of war,” and Biden’s backers, including anti-gun billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who funds the gun control groups Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action, don’t want everyday Americans to own firearms.

Bloomberg said Americans can’t be trusted with their constitutional right to own a gun. He made this outrageous claim just days after Jack Wilson, a concealed carry permit-holder and member of the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, responded immediately to a murderer in his church and neutralized the threat just six seconds after it began. Bloomberg is now dumping $100 million into Florida to buy the state for Biden and Bloomberg’s gun control fantasy.

Biden’s call for gun control in the wake of a blatant attack is also tone-deaf to the tacit approval he and Harris gave to the mob targeting police. Biden said, “Yes, absolutely,” when asked if he would support redirecting funding away from police departments. Harris promoted and solicited donations to the Minnesota Freedom Fund to bail out rioters, looters, and those attacking police. Those donations include bailing out a two-time rapist and other violent criminals.

Biden’s call to ban guns in the wake of an attack on police shows how obtuse he is. This wasn’t a mistimed tweet or poorly worded platform plank. If Biden has his way, we’ll be left with a disarmed America, rendered helpless against the criminals he refuses to confront.

Gun Purchases Are Breaking All-Time Records This Year After Rioting,"As people become increasingly interested in buying and using firearms in the United States since COVID-19 lockdowns began in March and widespread rioting began in May, federal firearm background checks for 2020 reached 28.82 million this month, surpassing last year’s record of 28.36 million.

An updated report released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation shows that the National Instant Criminal Background Check System processed 2.89 million background checks in September 2020 alone. The report also demonstrates that July produced the largest number of total background checks, 3.93 million, in the FBI’s NICS history.

These background checks are not exclusive to firearm sales, but they are required for gun purchases through federal firearms licensees (FFL), which the National Shooting Sports Foundation reports had a 61 percent increase compared to background checks issued for gun sales in September of 2019.

“At this pace, it is possible we could witness more than 20 million background checks for the sale of a firearm in 2020, widely eclipsing the strongest year on record of 2016, when 15.7 million background checks were conducted for the sale of firearms,” said Mark Olivia, director of public affairs at NSSF.

Although the September firearm checks appear to be down from other months this year, the NSSF says that the lockdowns played a massive role in the rise in firearm sales, especially when some politicians such as Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and West Palm Beach, Florida Mayor Keith James played into the public’s fears by legislating against gun freedoms and even “preventing the sale and public possession of firearms.”

“This has been a year unlike any other, where law-abiding Americans are seeing for themselves the need to be able to protect themselves and their family,” Olivia stated.

The “defund the police” movement also contributed to the large increase in gun sales in May when riots broke out around the nation. The same week of Geroge Floyd’s death in Minneapolis and riot-related violence and destruction began, “firearm sales went up 78 percent…compared to the same time in 2019.”

In addition to the unprecedented circumstances of lockdowns and rioting, Olivia said that panic buying due to the upcoming election is also a probable cause for the rise in background checks and sales.

“It cannot be discounted that threats by Joe Biden to confiscate, ban, register, and regulate out of existence, the firearms Americans want the most are driving sales,” Olivia said. “Background checks for firearm sales typically rise during election years in response to threats of gun control.”

“As previously stated, this is a year unlike any other, and voters are faced with a choice unlike any other. On one hand, is a candidate who has stood for preserving Second Amendment rights. On the other, is a candidate who is on the record for backing forcible confiscation of lawfully owned firearms. The biggest threat to Second Amendment rights today is Joe Biden, and gun buyers are reacting to that threat,” he added.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris are both strong advocates for increased gun restrictions. Not only has Biden called for a ban on “assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,” but the Biden/Harris platform is running on policies including issuing buyback programs for certain firearms, restricting how many guns someone can purchase per month, ending online sales of firearms and ammunition, and many more regulations.

Weapons of war have no place in our communities. We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 14, 2020

How The Left Tries To Trick Gun Owners Into Supporting Gun Control,"The Giffords Gun Control Group launched a new entity titled “Gun Owners for Safety” to spearhead the organization’s latest efforts to attack the Second Amendment. This group markets itself to American gun owners, who they claim are looking for “an alternative to the NRA … but [who] also want to reduce gun violence.” The past two decades, however, show that fake gun-rights groups like “Gun Owners for Safety” are always smokescreens for the same, tired gun control agenda of Giffords, the Brady Campaign, and others like them.

That agenda, which includes banning modern sporting rifles, is unpopular with gun owners and was conceived with zero input from the firearms industry. That industry has in fact proposed and implemented truly effective firearm safety proposals for decades.

Giffords Is No Friend of Gun Owners

Giffords’s latest iteration of a gun control group made up of gun owners is an obfuscation of facts. The group’s website landing page is a front. It hosts an image of a hunter plus a word salad that includes talk of gun ownership, common-sense gun laws, and reducing violence. It lists its principles as respect, devotion, and compassion, as if these traits are exclusive to those who favor the group’s gun control ideals.

Past this mirage is the truth. The so-called common-sense gun control ideas are really the radical proposals embraced by ideologues such as failed presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke. Giffords’ gun control measures would criminalize private firearm transfers, enact a national licensing scheme for Americans to exercise Second Amendment rights, enact mandatory home storage requirements the Supreme Court already struck down as unconstitutional, and ban, ban, ban.

Giffords seeks to outlaw the sale of precursor firearm parts for home-built hobbyists, which has always been legal, and to ban the most popular-selling centerfire rifle on the market, the modern sporting rifle. More than 18 million are in circulation. The group also wants to ban the standard-capacity magazines used in those rifles, which account for more than half of all the magazines in existence. If Giffords had its way, open and licensed concealed carry would also be gone, and the group would repeal laws that protect homeowners who are forced to defend their lives in their own homes.

Gun Control Groups Have Tried This Before

This is not the first time a gun control group has pretended to advocate for the interests of gun owners. The campaign to brand restrictive gun control schemes as moderate proposals supported by gun owners began shortly after the Clinton administration, when some of the president’s former staffers, funded by gun control activist billionaire Andrew McKelvey, founded Americans for Gun Safety.

Like Giffords’ Gun Owners for Safety, Americans for Gun Safety claimed to offer “common sense” solutions to gun violence supported by gun owners. Yet the proposals for which it advocated included restricting magazine capacity, banning modern sporting rifles, and instituting universal background checks. Sound familiar? When the group made no progress on its agenda for years, McKelvey eventually lost interest and stopped funding it.

Another “anti-gun wolf in sheep’s clothing” tumbled onto the national stage in 2006 with the formation of the American Hunters and Shooters Association. Led by former NFL player-turned-gun-grabber Ray Schoenke, the group’s board consisted of others with extensive anti-gun pedigrees to combat what they referred to as “the extreme positions of the NRA.” Predictably, the association embraced America’s leftists by partnering with known anti-gun zealot billionaire Michael Bloomberg and endorsing then-Sen. Barack Obama for president in 2008.

Moreover, the American Hunters and Shooters Association endorsed Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court in 2009. Once confirmed to the bench, she dissented in the landmark Second Amendment case of McDonald v. Chicago in which the majority reaffirmed the right of Americans to “keep and bear arms” and said that applies to state and local governments. This group also faded into obscurity and ceased operations. Sound familiar?

Giffords Is a Threat to the Second Amendment

Some are pointing to Giffords’ Gun Control Group as an attempt to splinter off gun owners in the weeks before the presidential election. Others look at this as another wolf in sheep’s clothing. The truth is that Giffords is a threat to all Second Amendment rights, spending big to get what it wants.

Giffords Political Action Committee spent nearly $9 million to buy the gun control candidates it wants in Congress, including Mark Kelly, who is running on the Democratic ticket for U.S. Senate in Arizona and who is Giffords’ co-founder and the husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. It also dumped money in Colorado for then-Senate candidate John Hickenlooper, who as governor infamously banned standard-capacity magazines in his state. Giffords’s list of endorsements is a veritable “who’s who” of gun control legislation.

Giffords, which today joins the failed ranks of poseurs with its Gun Owners for Safety group, will also in time come to the conclusion that American gun owners are not so easily fooled by Potemkin villages built to disguise radical gun-grabbing policies.

Abortion Fanatic Wendy Davis Also Wants To Grab Your Guns,"It is well-known that Texas House candidate Wendy Davis is a favorite of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the left. The major abortion organizations Planned Parenthood and Emily’s List rank among her top supporters. What isn’t as clear to the patriotic people of central Texas is that she is coming for your guns.

Davis wants this to fly under the radar, knowing Texas is the most pro-Second Amendment state in the nation. To mask her disdain for gun ownership, she uses innocent-sounding terms like “gun safety” and “common sense” to refer to gun-grabbing laws she supports, laws intended to disarm law-abiding Americans. She’s also supported by the top three anti-gun lobbying organizations in America.

While refusing to seriously condemn the violence and looting that is being advanced by radical leftist groups like Antifa, or to seriously support our law enforcement, let us briefly remind ourselves what it is that is at stake and the situations that Davis would subject us all to if her radical agenda were allowed to advance. We know. We both faced horrifying assaults from evil men that required good people to have guns to fight back.

What Happens When Only Bad Guys Have Guns

I (Hupp) faced a mass shooter up close, in a tragic series of events that culminated in both my parents being killed and my own narrow escape. Here is how I told part of the harrowing story to the state legislature.

“As we finished lunch and my friend got up to check on things in the kitchen, this pickup truck came crashing through the floor-to-ceiling window where we normally sat. It came to rest about 15 feet from us after knocking over a number of tables and injuring several people.

“Of course, we all thought it was an accident, and I began to rise to go help the people that he had knocked over. But as I began to stand up, we heard gunshots. Immediately, my dad and I got down on the floor and turned the table up in front of us. Mom got down behind us. I continued to hear shooting on the opposite side of the truck. It took a good 45 seconds…which is an eternity, to realize that he was just there to execute people.

“As he made his way around the front of the truck, I watched as he leveled his gun on the head of a person crouched beneath him. He pulled the trigger. Then he calmly walked to the next person, pointed the gun and pulled the trigger. It was then that I thought, ‘I’ve got him!’

“I reached for my purse on the floor next to me. I had a perfect place to prop my shooting hand, and I have hit much smaller targets at much greater distances. Then I realized that a few months earlier I had made the stupidest decision of my life. I had begun to leave my gun in my car because at that time, in the state of Texas, concealed-carry laws did not exist.

“I was concerned about getting caught with it. I did what most normal people would do: I wanted to obey the law and certainly didn’t want to lose my license to practice my livelihood. I never thought I’d need it in the middle of a crowded restaurant.

“I remember looking around for something to use as a weapon, and thinking, ‘Great, what do I do now? Throw a salt shaker at him?’ I can’t begin to get across to you how incredibly frustrating it is to sit there, like a fish in a barrel, and wait for it to be your turn, with no hope of defending yourself.” Yet this is the kind of situation that Davis’s preferred laws would place more people: defenseless against murderers while waiting for the police to arrive.

Banning Guns Only Helps Bad People

I, Stephen Willeford, found myself in another desperate situation as I heard gunshots ringing out inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Confronting and hitting the shooter with my rifle, I then pursued the shooter until police arrived, preventing more senseless deaths.

All the police departments that were around my church, all of them are great people, they were coming just as fast as they could, but they say that they were five to seven minutes estimated behind me, and my community didn’t have five to seven minutes to wait. The lesson reinforced that day for me was simple: Infringing on the rights of good guys with guns does nothing to stop the bad guys with guns. In fact, it helps them.

Davis’s Agenda Is Anti-Constitution

Davis says on her campaign’s website that she is concerned about the “proliferation of handgun violence.” That phraseology is typically “code” for supporting a ban on handguns, despite the fact that studies have historically shown they are used defensively many times more frequently than in criminal acts.

Davis is endorsed by BradyPAC, a political action committee connected to an anti-gun activist group that has called for “a ban on the manufacture, sale, and importation of all handguns and handgun ammunition” and a law “to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition . . . totally illegal.”

In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller that banning handguns would violate the Constitution, stating that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms for defense, and handguns are the type of firearm the American people most commonly keep for that purpose. But Democrats have vowed to overturn the Heller ruling and would easily be able to do so if they carry out their threat to increase the number of seats on the Supreme Court and pack them with leftwing activist justices.

Gun Registration Always Leads to Gun Confiscation

Davis also says she supports a ban on handgun and rifle ammunition magazines that are commonly used for self-defense and are therefore most commonly relied upon by everyday Americans and law enforcement officers alike. This cannot be to anyone’s surprise, of course, since the most obvious political reality in America today is that Democrats as a whole support the rioters who are attacking police, burning, looting, and ripping down statues in Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis, and other Democrat-led cities around the country.

Davis also supports banning the manufacture of the kind of rifles that are most effective for an entire range of self-defense situations. She does not say outright whether she agrees with Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden and vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who have said that the government should confiscate these rifles from the millions of Americans who own them. But voters will likely not be fooled by Davis’s calculated ambiguity on that question.

Davis has said she supports imposing so-called “universal background checks.” To the casual observer, saying she is in favor of “checks” might seem reasonable. We would all like to keep weapons out of the hands of criminals. But as has been explained in detail here, “universal checks” are part of a multi-step plan to turn the gun purchase background check system into a de facto gun registry. And gun registration is always a precursor to gun confiscation.

Despite the pro-Democrat media lies, the current elections are ultimately about two competing ideologies. One of those ideologies favors killing the unborn and preventing the rest of us from defending ourselves from radicals bent on destroying our American way of life. The alternative is to preserve American exceptionalism and our position as a grand example of freedom that millions around the world would risk their lives to obtain.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/30/abortion-fanatic-wendy-davis-also-wants-to-grab-your-guns/,2020-10-30
"2020 Shatters Annual Gun Sales Record, An Estimated 17 Million Sold Year-To-Date","With an estimated 17 million guns sold through October this year, 2020 now holds the record for most gun sales in a single year, according to new data released by the FBI Monday.

A National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) analysis of the FBI data found that compared to October 2019, October 2020 saw a 60 percent increase in firearms background checks conducted. NSSF also estimated that nearly 7 million people purchased a gun for the first time between January and October.

“Each month since March has been the strongest of that month ever recorded,” said NSSF spokesman Mark Oliva in a statement.

The 2020 background check numbers surpass the previous annual record in 2016 of 15.7 million.

While firearm and ammo sales have historically spiked during election years and after mass shootings or terrorist attacks, 2020’s surge has been sustained for months in response to the coronavirus pandemic, government lockdowns, widespread protests and riots, and the threat of a potential Biden-Harris administration in favor of gun control and gun confiscation.

In 2019, Sen. Kamala Harris said so-called gun buybacks were “a good idea,” and promised to take executive action on gun control if Congress failed to act within 100 days of her presidency. On the campaign trail this March, former Vice President Joe Biden got in a yelling match with a Detroit auto plant worker, telling the man he would “take your AR-14s.”

“This much is clear as we head into Election Day: Americans of all political persuasions are exercising their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and doing so in record numbers,” Oliva said.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/11/03/2020-shatters-annual-gun-sales-record-an-estimated-17-million-sold-year-to-date/,2020-11-03
6 First Gun Control Measures To Expect From A Biden Administration,"If we have a Joe Biden administration in the White House on Jan. 20, we will have the most overtly anti-gun president in American history.

Biden’s plan lists effectively every gun control measure ever proposed: banning “assault weapons,” banning “high-capacity” magazines, limiting the number of guns an American can purchase, holding manufacturers liable for the criminal misuse of their products, and many, many more.

Out of the myriad options a Biden administration will have to infringe on our constitutional protections, which will they choose first? Based on my experience with clients and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (AFT) as a firearms attorney, some recent news events, and a bit of firearm-industry intuition, I think the first things a Biden administration will do regarding guns if given the chance are:

Banning pistol braces

Banning homemade firearms/80 percent receivers

Banning online firearm and ammunition sales

Shortly after the first bans, and if he has the help of the Senate, the next gun control measures will likely be:

Banning “assault weapons”

Banning “high capacity” magazines

Requiring universal background checks

Let’s examine each of these in turn.

1. Banning Pistol Braces

Pistol braces are attachments to the rear of a handgun designed to provide stability to the shooter by using the shooter’s forearm as support. Currently, adding a pistol brace to a handgun does not change the firearm’s legal status as a handgun. This is why pistol braces are so popular.

If a buttstock (a device designed to allow the firearm to be fired from the shooter’s shoulder) were added to the same firearm instead of a pistol brace, then the firearm would change classification to a rifle and significant legal implications could occur. Under federal law, a rifle must have a barrel length of at least 16 inches to avoid classification as a “short-barreled rifle” and be subject to extra restrictions, registration, and taxes.

As most of these pistols with pistol braces have barrels shorter than 16 inches, their status as a non-rifle is legally significant. If Biden is able to ban pistol braces, millions of otherwise law-abiding gun owners would become criminals overnight.

The ATF has already signaled that banning pistol braces is their number-one priority. This is one more odd move by the ATF, which originally certified the devices as non-buttstocks, then determined they couldn’t be shouldered, rescinding their opinion, and now wants to ban them outright. In fact, their legal gymnastics are so difficult to follow and unfair, Rep. Matt Gaetz has been unsuccessfully looking for answers on ATF’s overreach.

2. Banning Homemade Firearms

Under federal law it is perfectly legal for anyone who is legally allowed to possess a firearm to make his own gun at home for personal use. In the past few years, companies have offered components to make it even easier to make your own firearm at home.

These frames or receivers, often called “80 percent receivers,” have not yet crossed the legal line into becoming a firearm. In most cases, the ATF has specifically made a determination that the object is not “readily convertible” into a firearm and is therefore a non-gun.

Anti-gunners have long been against these homemade firearms and 80 percent frames/receivers, which they call “ghost guns” for their lack of traceability, and a few states have already banned them. We knew this would be a priority for a Biden administration but the ATF, just this week, raided the largest “80 percent” manufacturer, accusing them of unlawfully making and selling firearms despite giving permission to that company a few years ago.

3. Banning Online Firearm and Ammunition Sales

Firearms and ammunition can be legally purchased online. This upsets anti-gunners.

A firearm, once purchased online, must follow the same rules as any other firearm transaction. A firearm may not be purchased from a gun dealer online and shipped straight to someone’s home. It must be shipped to a local gun dealer, where the customer must appear to fill out paperwork and satisfy background check requirements.

Ammunition, on the other hand, may be purchased online and shipped straight to someone’s home under federal law (some states restrict this).

Biden proposes to end all online firearm and ammunition sales, which would require customers to forgo the benefits of e-commerce they enjoy for almost every other product in their lives, such as competitive pricing and product availability.

4. Banning ‘Assault Weapons’

The anti-gun movement learned a few lessons from their previous federal “assault weapons” ban. First, their previous ban had a sunset provision that allowed the ban to expire in 2004. Second, the ban focused on cosmetic features of firearms.

Biden has explained in his gun-control proposal that a new ban will be tougher and not allow firearm manufacturers to circumvent it with “minor changes that don’t change a weapon’s lethality.” With that standard, we can only assume that he intends to permanently ban all semi-automatic rifles.

Currently, his proposal includes plans to either “buy back” currently owned “assault rifles” or require their registration under the National Firearms Act (NFA) with the payment of a $200 tax each.

5. Banning ‘High-Capacity’ Magazines

The Biden administration wants to ban detachable magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. This effort will likely be easier for them than banning “assault weapons,” as they’ll try to argue that they aren’t effecting a gun ban at all.

As with “assault weapons,” these will be outright banned and there will be an option to surrender magazines for money or register each magazine as an NFA firearm and pay a $200 tax each.

6. Universal Background Checks

Currently, background check requirements apply to all firearm transactions conducted through a federally licensed firearm dealer. However, under federal law, private party transactions in the same state may occur without a background check as long as the seller has no reason to believe that the recipient is a person prohibited from possessing a firearm. For example, a friend may loan a firearm to another during a hunting trip.

Universal background checks place a government barrier around a fundamental right and will, in effect, create a national firearm registry in order for the government to enforce and verify current possession of a firearm.

Biden has already promised that he wants to take your guns and laid out plans to do so. With Democrats possibly poised to control all of Congress, expect them to follow through on these public promises.

Here’s The Full List Of Every Lie Joe Biden Has Told As President,"Updated June 23, 2021

As President Joe Biden assumes the Oval Office, The Federalist will continue its rigorous coverage of the new White House, keeping the administration accountable with substantive fact-checking throughout Biden’s tenure.

59: White House Suggests Republicans, Not Democrats, Tried To Defund The Police

After last year’s summer of rage, Jen Psaki suggested that Republicans, not Democrats, were trying to defund the police.

“Part of his announcement is also ensuring their specific guidance to communities across the country to ensure that they have funding to get more community police around the country, something that was supported by the American jobs plan that was supported, that was voted into law by Democrats, just a couple of months ago. Some might say that the other party was for defunding the police,” Psaki concluded during a White House press briefing.

Psaki’s comments come after a year of leftist-led crusades to “defund the police” after the death of George Floyd.

Biden acknowledged the left’s quest to remove power from policing but warned civil rights leaders in December that it was the ‘defund the police’ push that granted Republicans victories in many down-ballot races on Nov. 3.

“That’s how they beat the living hell out of us across the country, saying that we’re talking about defunding the police,” Biden said in a leaked call.

58: Biden Says Corporate Media Reporters Are The Smartest People In The Entire Country

President Joe Biden told reporters on Wednesday following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin that he thinks they’re the smartest people in the entire country.

“You all are some of the brightest people in the country,” Biden said. “I mean it, I’m not being solicitous. But it makes no sense for me to negotiate with you!”

Biden’s affirmations for his Democrat cronies in the corporate media came minutes after he told the CNN White House Correspondent she was in the wrong business, and lobbed insults at the press pool for “never” asking a positive question.

Just a few weeks ago, reporters fawned over Biden as he munched on a chocolate chocolate chip ice cream cone.

57: Biden Repeats Lie That Rioters Killed Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick

During a press conference following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden once again repeated the lie that the Jan. 6 rioters killed a Capitol police officer.

“It’s one thing for literally criminals to break through [sic], go into the Capitol, kill a police officer, and be held unaccountable and than it is for people objecting, marching on the Capitol and saying ‘you are not allowing me to speak freely. You’re not allowing me to do A, B, C, or D.’ And so they’re very different criteria.”

While the White House continues to tout Officer Brian Sicknick’s death as a reason to condemn Capitol rioters, the Washington D.C. chief medical examiner revealed in April that Sicknick, who died on Jan. 7, suffered two strokes and died of natural causes later at the hospital. The report followed months of erroneous coverage promoted and propelled by corrupt corporate media institutions and Democrats.

Biden’s false claim follows a deflection from Putin who mentioned the Jan. 6 riot and Ashli Babbitt’s death in response to a reporter who asked why many of his own political opponents are are “dead, imprisoned, or jailed.” Biden called Putin’s comparison “ridiculous.”

56: Biden Keeps Saying That The Economy Was Tanking Before He Arrived At The White House

Throughout his campaign for congressional Democrats to jam his expensive infrastructure proposal through both chambers, Biden has repeatedly claimed that the economy was tanking before he arrived in the White House.

“Remember, when I took office in January, our economy was in a tailspin,” Biden said last week.

As the Wall Street Journal reported, “Biden uttered these words eight days after his own Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. real gross domestic product ‘increased at an annual rate of 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2021.'”

Biden claims his infrastructure plan will be good for the U.S. and even potentially stimulate the economy but as noted by The Tax Foundation, federal spending costs will eventually outweigh the benefits for Americans.

“We estimate the infrastructure spending would increase long-run GDP by 0.3 percent, but this positive economic effect is entirely offset by the increase in corporate taxation, resulting in less corporate investment which reduces GDP by 0.5 percent in the long run, reduces wages by 0.5 percent, and eliminates 101,000 full-time equivalent jobs,” the Tax Foundation’s analysis of The American Jobs Plan suggests.

55: Biden Repeats Claim Capitol Riot Days Before Inauguration Was Worst Assault On Capital Since Civil War

While demanding a 9/11-style commission to study the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, President Joe Biden appeared to forget about 9/11 altogether.

Speaking to reporters outside a Cleveland-area ice cream parlor, Biden repeated his claim the riot was “the greatest assault since the Civil War on the capital.”

But at any rate, I came for ice cream."" pic.twitter.com/gT1hI7mRL3 — DJ Judd (@DJJudd) May 27, 2021

On Sept. 11, 2001 however, 125 people died instantly with 64 passengers on a plane flown into the Pentagon by Al-Qaeda terrorists. Only one person died at the 2021 riot at the Capitol when they were shot by security.

54: Psaki Claims ‘Number Of Officers’ Died On Day Of Capitol Riot. Zero Did.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a May 21 briefing that a “number of officers lost their lives” on the day of the January Capitol riot.

“Obviously, the president’s view is that a number of officers who lost their lives paid a tremendous sacrifice on a day that will be a stain on our democracy for many years to come,” Psaki said.

That number of officers, however, is zero.

While Democrats, in their second Trump impeachment, pointed to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick’s death the day after the riot based on a debunked report in the New York Times, the D.C. medical examiner concluded in April that the officer died of natural causes.

53: Biden Appears to Make up Amtrak Story

At a 50th-anniversary event for Amtrak in Philadelphia, President Joe Biden said that when he was vice president, a train conductor congratulated him for traveling 1.5 million miles on Amtrak. A Fox News report out on May 5, however, pokes holes in the president’s account.

“When I became vice president, one of the Capitol Hill newspapers estimated that I had taken more than 7,000 round trips on Amtrak over my career,” Biden said. “I think that’s an exaggeration. I’m going to rely on those two conductors. … One of them was a guy named Angelo Negri.”

Biden continued, telling the audience Negri estimated Biden had traveled 1.5 million miles on Amtrak trains around his fourth or fifth year as vice president, which would have been in 2013 or 2014.

“My mom was sick, and I used to try to come home almost every weekend as vice president to see her,” Biden said. “I got on the train and Angelo Negri came up and he goes, ‘Joey, baby,’ and he grabbed my cheek like he always did. … He said, ‘Joey, what’s the big deal? One-point-three million miles on Air Force Two? Do you know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?’ I said, ‘No, Angie, I don’t know.’ He gave me the calculation and he said you traveled 1.5 million miles on Amtrak.”

As Fox News pointed out, however, an obituary for Negri says the conductor retired in 1993, decades before Biden’s supposed story took place, while he was still a senator from Delaware. Biden’s mother died in 2010.

52: White House Says Trump Admin Spurred Border Crisis

Psaki said Trump created “an immigration system rooted in destructive and chaotic policies” that spurred the border crisis.

“Our administration immediately jumped into action to address the influx of migrants at the border, something that began during and was exacerbated by the Trump administration,” Psaki said.

.@PressSec says that the influx of immigrants at the southern border is ""something that began during and was something that was exacerbated by the Trump administration."" pic.twitter.com/iacLlRwxVg — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) May 4, 2021

While apprehensions under Trump’s leadership did begin increasing in fall 2020, border crossings surged during the first few months of Biden’s presidency. Not only did U.S. Customs and Border Protection take more than 172,000 illegal aliens into custody in March, but data also shows increases between February and March forced the CBP to stretch its chart to accommodate the largest numbers it has seen in at least two decades.

51: Biden Claims $1.8 Trillion American Families Plan Won’t Add to Deficit

Biden claimed in Virginia on May 3 while promoting the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan that the Democrats’ latest behemoth wish-list bill “doesn’t add a single penny to our deficit.”

“It’s paid for by making sure corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent just pay their fair share,” Biden said.

According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, however, the plan “includes $1.5 trillion of offsets, resulting in a $300 billion net deficit impact over a decade.”

50: Biden Says Anyone Making Less Than $400k Doesn’t Have to Pay Taxes

Biden said that anyone making less than $400,000 a year doesn’t have to pay taxes.

“Anybody making less than $400,000 a year will not pay a single penny in taxes,” the Democrat said. “And we will not increase the deficit either, unlike the last gigantic tax cut which increased the deficit by $2 trillion.”

https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1389279329335529476?s=20

Biden’s words may be a gaffe, but even experts agree that his promise not to raise taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year is ambitious and not realistic. Even if the Democrats concentrate on “taxing the rich,” those who fall below the $400,000 mark are subject to consequences from a highly taxed economy.

49: Biden Blames Trump for the Border Crisis (Again)

During his interview with NBC News, Biden claimed that the “one god-awful mess at the border” was created by the Trump administration.

“Hey, look, here’s what happened – the failure to have a real transition. The two departments that didn’t give us access to virtually anything were the immigration [department] and the Defense Department. So, we didn’t find out they had fired a whole lot of people, that they were understaffed considerably,” Biden said.

This statement, Former Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said, is false.

“At the Department of Homeland Security, we provided the transition team with more than 200 extensive briefings on homeland security issues, the majority of which dealt with the border, immigration policy, and the processes and procedures we had in place to secure the border and reduce asylum fraud. … During the transition, the incoming Biden administration was made fully aware of the consequences of undoing the effective policies that had fixed the previous crisis and driven illegal crossings down substantially,” he said.

Biden is quick to shift the negative media coverage of the disaster at the border to his predecessor, but Trump is not responsible for the thousands of people crossing the border. Not only have the number of illegal aliens surged to record highs since Biden assumed office, but migrants have admitted that the reason they came is that they knew the Biden administration wouldn’t turn them or their families away. Even though illegal migrants may be hopeful about a future in the U.S., Biden and his team are struggling to keep up with housing the aliens in safe and clean conditions.

48: Biden Claims the Border Is ‘Under Control’

Despite his belief that Trump created the border crisis, Biden falsely claimed that it is “getting urgent action now.”

“For example, a month ago, we had thousands of young kids in custody in places they shouldn’t be, and controlled by the Border Patrol. We have now cut that down dramatically,” Biden said in an interview with NBC News.

As noted by Heritage, even if the “number of unaccompanied minors in Customs and Border Protection custody has decreased, the numbers are clear: most of those minors are simply being transferred from one government agency to another — in this CBP custody to the Department of Health and Human Services.”

47: Biden Says Trump Admin Didn’t Adequately Plan for Border Crisis

During his interview with NBC News, Biden claimed the Trump administration did not plan for the border crisis.

“For example, we have — they didn’t plan for, which it comes every year, this flow, whether it is 22,000 or 10,000, they didn’t have the beds that were available. They didn’t plan for the overflow. They didn’t plan for the Department of Health and Human Services to have places to take the kids from the Border Patrol and put them in beds where there was security and there were that people who could take care of them. So, there is a significant change right now, a significant change in the circumstance for children coming to and at the border,” he said.

As noted by Former Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan, “This is an outrageous claim.”

“In November 2020, CBP under the Trump administration had fewer than 800 unaccompanied alien children, family units, and single adults in custody. In March of this year, that number had exploded to more than 10,000. Even though apprehensions started increasing in 2020, as growing numbers of illegal migrants gambled on a potential Biden election victory and subsequent amnesty, the Trump administration had strong policies in place to quickly and responsibly process and deport most of these individuals. This meant there was no systemic issue with backlogs or overcrowded CBP or HHS facilities,” Morgan said.

46: Biden Claims His Administration Has Control of the Border Crisis

In an interview with NBC’s Craig Melvin on “Today,” Biden falsely claimed his administration successfully reigned in the southern border crisis.

“It’s way down now, we’ve now gotten control,” Biden said.

“Do not send your kids, period. … they're in jeopardy going, making that 1000-mile trek.” -President Biden’s message to parents sending their children across the border pic.twitter.com/stHHQeUiWl — TODAY (@TODAYshow) April 30, 2021

Instead of facing the fact that U.S. Customs and Border Protection took more than 172,000 illegal aliens into custody in March, making it the busiest month for the agency in more than 20 years, Biden blamed the previous administration for not preparing for the influx exacerbated by Democrat rhetoric.

“They didn’t plan for, which comes every year, this flow, whether it’s 22,000 or 10,000,” Biden said. “They didn’t have the beds that were available, they didn’t plan for the overflow. They didn’t plan for the Department of Health and Human Services to have places to take the kid from the border patrol and put them in beds where there’s security and there were people that could take care of them.”

Biden promised that the White House and other federal agencies are taking “urgent action now,” a record-breaking 18,890 unaccompanied teens and children have been packed into overcrowded shelters plagued by COVID-19 spread and “dangerous” conditions for longer than the 72-hour limit permitted by federal law.

45: Biden Says Banning ‘Assault Weapons’ Reduced Gun Violence and Mass Shootings

Biden said that former President Bill Clinton’s ban on assault weapons contributed to the decline in gun violence and mass shootings over 10 years in his joint address.

“A ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds … we beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. Check out the report over 10 years,” Biden said.

President Biden once again touts the lie that former President Clinton's ban on ""assault weapons"" reduced gun violence and mass shootings over 10 years. Rep. @laurenboebert knows this is false. You can read @KatiePavlich's fact-check on the claim here: https://t.co/ALfjLcD7UM pic.twitter.com/1zCgpJ6MMN — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) April 29, 2021

As noted by Townhall’s Katie Pavlich, a 2004 University of Pennsylvania Center of Criminology study funded by the Department of Justice found that the “ban cannot be credited with a decrease in violence carried out with firearms.”

“We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury,” the report stated. “The ban’s impact on gun violence is likely to be small at best, and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. AWs [assault weapons] were used in no more than 8% of gun crimes even before the ban.”

Biden’s claim that semiautomatic rifles with “high capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds … can be fired off in seconds” is also disputed. While a semiautomatic rifle may be able to fire off 100 rounds in less than a minute, speechwriters chose to use “seconds,” which implies a smaller timeframe than what is actually required to go through that much ammo.

President Biden is about to lie to the American people about guns. Again. My favorite here is the blatant lie that ""high capacity magazines"" enable semi-automatic rifles to fire 100 rounds in seconds. It's just not true.https://t.co/nIeYNXhF9L — Amy Swearer (@AmySwearer) April 29, 2021

44: Biden Brags That COVID Spending Bill Was Bipartisan Effort. It Wasn’t.

During his first address to a joint session of Congress, Biden said his $1.9 trillion COVID spending bill was a bipartisan effort.

“What else have we done in those first 100 days? We kept our commitment — Democrats and Republicans — of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households. We’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door,” Biden said.

No Republicans, however, voted for the bill, which was jammed through the Democrat-controlled Congress using budget reconciliation. While Biden met with members of the GOP about the legislation to discuss changes, he ultimately refused to compromise on its price.

43: Biden Claims Jan. 6 Riot ‘Worst Attack on Our Democracy Since the Civil War’

Biden claimed in his first State of the Union address before Congress that the Jan. 6 riot was “the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.”

By the death toll, however, the United States has seen far worse.

Five died who were present at the riot, four of whom through natural causes, including the Capitol police officer whose death was weaponized by Democrats to impeach then-President Donald Trump. One Capitol rioter was killed by a police officer.

The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, killed nearly 3,000 people after two commercial airliners flew into the New York’s World Trade Center buildings, one into the Pentagon, and one into a field in Pennsylvania.

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, killed more than 2,400.

42: Biden Admin Repeats Fake News Russia Bounty Story to Justify Sanctions

The White House used a recently discredited narrative to justify enacting sanctions against Russia.

New reports state that U.S. intelligence had “low to moderate” confidence in a story claiming that Russia offered members of the Taliban bounties in exchange for killing American soldiers, but the Biden administration cited the narrative as one of the reasons Russia should be punished. Not only was the Russia bounty story mentioned in the White House “fact sheet” detailing the sanctions but it was also echoed by government officials.

Say what you will about New York Times journalists, but you can't deny that when they have a bit they stay committed to the bit. pic.twitter.com/ksuwhejIFP — Omri Ceren (@omriceren) April 16, 2021

Despite former President Donald Trump’s insistence in 2020 that the story was “fake news,” corporate media immediately latched onto the narrative and promoted it as fact. Many of the same news organizations that peddled the story have yet to walk back their previous coverage.

41: Biden Makes Misleading Statements About Gun Delay for 2015 Charleston Shooter

During his announcement of new gun control executive orders, Biden claimed that it was a three-day FBI background check delay called the “Charleston loophole” that allowed Dylann Roof to execute the 2015 Charleston church shooting.

“What happened is someone was allowed to get the gun used to kill those innocent people at a church service,” Biden said. “If the FBI didn’t complete the background check within three days. There was a process. If it wasn’t done in three days, according to the Charleston loophole, you get to buy the gun.”

As the Washington Free Beacon notes, not only did Roof shoot up the church more than two months after his background check was delayed, but “the FBI did not find the records that should have prohibited him from buying a gun” due to a mistake by the agency.

40: Biden Insists Gun Manufacturers Can’t Be Sued

Biden insisted during his gun control executive order announcement that gun manufacturers can’t be sued.

“People don’t realize the only industry in America, a billion-dollar industry, that can’t be sued, that are exempt from being sued, are gun manufacturers,” Biden said. “This is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued.”

As noted by the Washington Free Beacon, multiple gun manufacturers such as Remington and Sig Sauer have been sued over design flaws and defects in their products. The Free Beacon also noted that while the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act protects manufacturers from lawsuits “stemming from the criminal misuse of guns by third parties,” other industries including pharmaceutical companies tasked with creating the COVID-19 vaccine are protected have immunity under the 2005 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act.

39: Biden Says Gun Show Purchases Don’t Require Background Checks

During his announcement introducing multiple gun control executive orders, Biden said background checks are not required for purchases at gun shows.

“Most people don’t know when you walk into a store and you buy a gun, you have a background check but you go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want with no background check,” Biden claimed.

BIDEN: ""You go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want–no background check."" pic.twitter.com/TbvfDPEwlp — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) April 8, 2021

While private firearm sellers in some states may complete gun show transactions without a background check, what many Democrats often label as the “gun show loophole,” any gun dealers with a federal firearms license are required to run background checks on customers investing in a weapon.

When confronted with a fact-check on Biden’s comments, the White House denied the president’s words just minutes after he stated them.

“No, it’s not his belief,” Psaki said. “He believes that gun that background check should be universal. … We know what his position is.”

A reporter just asked Jen Psaki why Biden lied and said, ""You go to a gun show, you can buy what you want and no background check."" Psaki just said the complete OPPOSITE and said ""it is not his belief."" These two comments were made within 60 mins of each other. WH is clueless. pic.twitter.com/kabw6ysJ1w — Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) April 8, 2021

38: Biden Repeats Spurious Claims About Georgia’s New Election Law

Biden told ESPN that Georgia’s new election reform law not only bans water and food in polling lines but also closes polls early so working people can’t vote.

“This is Jim Crow on steroids, but they’re doing it in Georgia and 40 other states,” Biden said. “Imagine passing a law saying you cannot provide water or food for someone standing in line to vote. Come on. Are you going to close a polling place at 5:00, where can people just get off? This is all about people, working folks, ordinary folks that I grew up with, from being able to vote.”

Despite Biden’s claims, nothing in the new legislation suggests that voting hours should end early. In fact, the law mandates that polls be open at least 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during early voting and offered counties the option to extend those hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. if necessary, a provision the Washington Post fact-checkers even acknowledged. The new law also provides exceptions for “poll officers” to give voters food and water as long as they are not provided by political interest groups.

37: Biden Insists ‘No One Making Under $400k Will See Their Federal Taxes Go Up’

During his introduction of a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, Biden repeated the lie that “no one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period.”

“This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe in American capitalism. I want everyone to do well,” Biden said. “Right now a middle-class couple, a firefighter and a teacher with two kids, making a combined salary of say $110,000 to $120,000 a year pays 22 cents for each additional dollar they earn in federal income tax. But a multinational corporation that builds a factory abroad, jobs overseas … is bad for American competitiveness, deeply unfair to the middle-class families, wrong for our future.”

BIDEN: ""No one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period."" pic.twitter.com/3offgNfVEY — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) March 31, 2021

Despite months of promises from Biden and his team on the campaign trail and from the debate stage, White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently clarified that individuals making $200,000 a year who are married to someone making similar amounts will be subject to the proposed tax hike.

36: Biden Repeats Falsehoods About Trump’s Tax Cut

Less than one week after he stated the claim during his first press conference, Biden insisted that “83 percent of the money went to the top 1 percent” because of Trump’s tax cuts.

Biden says again that in Trump tax cuts, ""83% of the money went to the top 1%."" That's a think tank projection of what would happen in 2027 if its individual cuts expired after 2025 as scheduled, not what has happened already; estimate is top 1% got 21% in 2018, get 25% in 2025. — Daniel Dale (@ddale8) March 31, 2021

As previously noted by The Federalist and other outlets, Trump’s tax plan not only benefitted Americans across the working, middle, and upper classes, but it also contributed to a large decrease in unemployment and underemployment. The 83 percent figure often touted by Biden, fact-checkers determined as early as 2018, is “true for 2027 but only because most of the individual income tax changes expire by then,” but not other years.

35: Biden Says Georgia’s Election Law Cuts Back Voting Hours for Working Americans

Biden is spreading misinformation that Georgia’s new election law ends voting hours early, making it difficult for working Americans to get to the polls after they leave their jobs for the day.

“What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick … deciding that you’re going to end voting at 5:00 when working people are just getting off work,” the president said during his first press conference.

Biden repeated the falsehood in an official statement released just one day after his presser, claiming that “among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over.

While Biden insists the new law is “un-American” and “sick,” nothing in the new legislation suggests that voting hours should end early. In fact, the law mandates that polls be open at least 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during early voting and offered counties the option to extend those hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. if necessary, a provision the Washington Post fact-checkers even acknowledged.

34: Biden Insists He Is Tough on China

During his first presser, Biden claimed he will “deal with China effectively” by “investing in American workers and American science” and “hold China accountable.”

The Committee on Ways and Means, however, says, “China’s corporate income tax rate is 25 percent, despite being a Communist nation” and that Biden’s promise to “increase our federal rate to 28 percent, on top of state corporate taxes, exposes American firms to takeovers from competitors based in Communist China.”

The committee also noted that Biden “has so far not committed to any action to enforce the China Phase One Agreement achieved during the Trump Administration, which included very specific requirements that protect American workers.”

33: Biden Makes Misleading Claim About R&D Investments

In his first official press event nine weeks into office, Biden claimed that research and development investments have consistently fallen since the 1960s.

“Back in the 1960s, America invested more than 2 percent of GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today it is 0.7 percent,” Biden stated.

Research and development spending, however, is at its highest point and accounted for more than 3 percent of the real GDP before the COVID-19 economic shutdown.

32: Biden Falsely States Top Corporations Don’t ‘Pay a Cent in Taxes’

During his first press conference, Biden said top corporations in the United States don’t put any money toward taxes.

“Ninety of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars are not paying a cent in taxes,” Biden said, “reducing taxes to a point that people who are making, you know, if you’re a husband and wife, school teacher, and a cop, you’re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year.”

The Committee on Ways and Means, however, said that the claims Biden made relied on information that “continually confused the difference between taxable income and financial statements.”

“From sales taxes to property taxes to payroll taxes, Fortune 500 companies pay billions of dollars in taxes to local, state, and federal government,” they wrote in a fact check. “Federal tax laws provide important bipartisan tax incentives to encourage specific economic activity — including investments in R&D, energy innovation, low-income housing, and distressed communities — which reduces taxable income without changing financial statement profits.”

31: Biden Says Trump’s Tax Cuts Only Helped the Rich

During his press first official press event, Biden falsely claimed that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did not put “money in ordinary people’s pockets” and instead only helped the “top 1 percent.”

“Do you hear them complain when they passed [a] close to $2 trillion Trump tax cut, with 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Do you hear them talk about that at all?” Biden asked.

Not only did Trump’s tax cut benefit Americans across the working, middle, and upper classes, a fact even corporate media outlets noted, but it also contributed to a large decrease in unemployment and underemployment. The 83 percent figure often touted by Democrats, fact-checkers determined in 2018, is “true for 2027 but only because most of the individual income tax changes expire by then,” but not other years.

30: Biden Says Majority of Migrant Families that Cross Border Are Sent Back

Biden said in his first press conference 64 days after inauguration that a majority of the migrant families crossing the border illegally are sent back.

“If you take a look at the number of people are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back,” Biden said at the White House. “We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming.”

According to Customs and Border Protection data, however, a fraction of the 20,000 family units apprehended have been sent back.

Further, Michelle Hackman, who covers immigration for the Wall Street Journal, reported on March 23 that an internal document she reviewed with her colleagues found that the weekend prior to Biden’s press conference, “only about 10 percent of families were being expelled.”

29: Biden Says Trump Admin Didn’t Address Communist China’s Human Rights Abuses

During his first official press conference, Biden implied that his predecessor former President Donald Trump did not address communist China’s human rights abuses.

“I made it clear that no American president, at least one did, but no American president ever backed down from speaking out of what’s happened to the Uyghurs, what’s happened in Hong Kong, what’s happening in the country. That’s who we are,” Biden said. “The moment a president walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world.”

The Trump administration, however, did directly condemn China’s actions against the minority Muslim population located in the Xinjiang province as a genocide before leaving office. Following investigations into the CCP’s use of mass imprisonment of more than 1 million people, forced labor, forced sterilization, torture, and limits on religious freedom, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that the United States has definitively evaluated and labeled these actions by the CCP as “crimes against humanity.”

Secondly, the Biden regime just deleted the State Dept page highlighting China’s human rights abuses: https://t.co/Py9yNKPFsD — R.J. Kassam (@RaheemKassam) March 25, 2021

The Trump administration previously issued sanctions against China shortly after Trump signed the “Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020” into law in June of 2020.

28: Biden Says Migrants Not Flooding the Border Because of Him

During his first press conference, Biden claimed illegal aliens are not crossing the southern U.S. border because of his rhetoric and open border policies, but because migrants’ chances of “dying on the way because of the heat in the desert” are lower in January, February, and March and because of the instability in their home countries.

“I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I’m a nice guy. … The truth of the matter is, nothing has changed. … That’s not the reason they’re coming. The reason they are coming is that it’s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one,” Biden said. “Number two, they’re coming because of the circumstances in [their] country.”

Biden believes surge in migrants is due to conditions in their countries & weather that's better for traveling not because he's seen as a ""nice guy"" who's lax on the border

While Biden might be convinced people are flooding to the U.S.-Mexico border in a normal immigration cycle, Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador recently said it is the new president’s migration policies and rhetoric that sparked hopeful “expectations” and created the border crisis.

“Expectations were created that with the government of President Biden, there would be a better treatment of migrants. And this has caused Central American migrants, and also from our country, wanting to cross the border, thinking that it is easier to do so,” López Obrador said, just weeks after he told reporters that many of those crossing the border illegally view Biden as “the migrant president.”

Some illegal aliens who crossed the border have also testified that Biden was the deciding factor for why they chose to come to the U.S.

“So did you come here because Joe Biden was elected president?” ABC’s Martha Raddatz pressed.

“Basically. Basically,” one migrant father replied. “The main thing was the violence in our country. And the second thing, I think, was Joe Biden.”

27: Biden White House Claims Regular Talks With McConnell

White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed at a March 24 briefing that the president regularly speaks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

McConnell’s office, however, told NBC News reporter Julie Tsirkin that the two have only spoken once since the inauguration in January, which focused on the military coup in Myanmar.

26: Biden Lowers Tax Hike Threshold After Promising It Would Only Affect People Making Over $400K

While the president recently told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that his bid to increase taxes would only apply to “anybody making more than $400,000,” and that any individual making less than that amount “won’t see one single penny in additional federal tax,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki recently clarified that individuals making $200,000 a year who are married to someone making similar amounts will be subject to the proposed tax hike.

Biden tax hike could hit people earning $200K, White House clarifies https://t.co/YYzEqoDPJz pic.twitter.com/wW4Wj6aCPt — New York Post (@nypost) March 17, 2021

This revelation comes after months of promises from Biden and his team on the campaign trail and from the debate stage that their attempts to raise taxes would not affect individuals making under $400,000 a year but eventually morphed into households making under $400,000 a year. Studies from at least five economic analysis institutions suggest, “Biden’s proposals would increase taxes, on average, for households at every income level” and that his intention to repeal Trump’s tax cuts would only further this outcome.

25: Biden Makes Sweeping Projection About Child Poverty

During his March 11 address, Biden said the COVID-19 spending bill “will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts.”

While researchers at certain think tanks and universities conceded that portions of the American Rescue Plan have the potential to “reduce child poverty by more than half in 2021,” the provisions in the bill apply only to this year, leaving the long-term effects of the spending bill on child poverty a mystery. There is no current evidence to suggest that the policies included in the plan will have a long-lasting effect on child poverty.

24: Biden Overreports Number of Vaccinated American 65 and Older

In his address on March 11, Biden lied about when the COVID-19 vaccine first became available in the United States. He also misspoke about the number of Americans 65 and older who have received the vaccine.

“When I took office 50 days ago, only 8 percent of Americans — after months — only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination,” Biden said. “Today that number is 65 percent.”

The vaccine, however, was not available for months before Biden took office. The first COVID-19 vaccine dose in the United States was administered on Dec. 14, just one month before the new president transitioned into the White House. Not only was Biden wrong about when the shots first became available, but he also lied that 65 percent of Americans 65 years old and above have been vaccinated. As of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that only 62.4 percent of those 65 and older received at least one round of the vaccine, not 65 percent.

23: Biden Claims US COVID Death Toll Exceeds Three Wars and 9/11

During his address to the nation on March 11, Biden falsely claimed that the total number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. was more than those in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and 9/11.

“I carry a card in my pocket with a number of Americans who have died from COVID to date. It’s on the back of my schedule.

As of now, total deaths in America: 527,726. That’s more deaths than World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined,” Biden stated.

President Biden notes the more than 527,000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States: ""That's more deaths than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War and 9/11, combined."" https://t.co/Zv4cfRYdhW pic.twitter.com/NKcXVzZcyy — PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) March 12, 2021

While Biden is correct in saying that at least 527,726 Americans have reportedly died from coronavirus, the nation’s death toll does not exceed the fatalities that resulted from the three wars and one terrorist attack he mentioned in his speech. Even without 9/11 included, more than 580,000 people died fighting in the aforementioned wars. “World War I: 116,516 deaths, World War II: 405,399, Vietnam: 58,220” the Washington Post reported.

22: Biden Claims Coronavirus Was Met with Silence

In his prime time address to the nation on March 11, Biden claimed the novel Wuhan coronavirus “was met with silence and spread unchecked.”

The Trump administration, however, convened a White House coronavirus task force, which CNN complained was too white, while congressional Democrats were pursuing partisan impeachment proceedings.

21: Biden Says Goal of 100 Million Vaccine Shots in 100 Days Was Tough for Him to Meet

Biden claimed his administration’s initial goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days was difficult to meet in his prime time address on March 11.

“When I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was kind of way over the top,” Biden said. “I said I intended to get 100 million shots in people’s arms with my first 100 days in office.”

That vaccination pace, however, had already been met by his White House predecessor. About 1.3 million Americans were vaccinated on Biden’s first full day in office.

20: Biden Says COVID Spending Bill Garnered Bipartisan Support

Shortly after Democrats in the Senate passed the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending bill, Biden falsely claimed in a celebratory speech that the legislation garnered bipartisan support.

“Quite frankly, without the overwhelming bipartisan support of the American people, this would not have happened. Elected officials heard overwhelming public support. Every public opinion poll showed overwhelming support for this plan,” Biden said.

Just watched his whole 10-minute monologue and this did happen. Also tries to describe bill as bi-partisan even though not a single Republican in either chamber voted for it https://t.co/P6HFBIePqD — Julie Kelly 🇺🇸 (@julie_kelly2) March 6, 2021

Despite Biden’s rhetoric pretending that the legislation received support from people on both sides of the political aisle, every Republican senator voted against passing the massive bill. Last month, the White House agreed to meet with 10 Republicans to discuss a smaller relief proposal that cut spending by almost two-thirds. Biden, who launched his presidency on a platform of unifying the country and toning down partisanship, however, did not budge on his decision to push the legislation through both chambers of Congress without GOP support.

19: Biden and White House Deny Border Crisis as Crossings Surge

Biden denied that there is a crisis at the border after departing a White House briefing in early March evaluating how to provide more than 20,000 beds for the largest projected influx of unaccompanied migrant children who are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

“We’ll be able to handle it,” Biden told reporters as he was escorted out of the room by his vice president.

When asked if there’s a border crisis, Biden says “no”https://t.co/1r8KjY5OKR pic.twitter.com/itA90NEAyo — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) March 2, 2021

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas also told reporters at the beginning of March that there is no crisis at the southern border, despite his own agency’s projections that more than 117,000 unaccompanied minors will attempt to cross the U.S.-Mexico border this year, numbers that are on track to exceed the current record of minors in federal custody by 45 percent. More than 13,000 of them are expected to come to the United States in May, giving the Biden administration just two months to sort out its plans for housing migrant minors after refusing to expel them.

“Do you believe that right now there is a crisis at the border?” a reporter asked.

“No,” Mayorkas said. “There is a challenge at the border that we are managing. … The men and women of the Department of Homeland Security are working around the clock seven days a week to ensure that we do not have a crisis at the border, that we manage the challenge, as acute as the challenge is.”

18: Biden Says Administration Not Opening New Migrant Centers

Biden falsely claimed during a February interview with Univision that the new administration is merely reopening migrant camps operational during the Trump administration even as the Biden White House creates new ones.

“They opened up one, one that was a former one used in the administration in the last administration,” Biden said. “Our hope and expectation is that won’t stay open very long and that we’ll be able to provide for every kid who comes across the border safely.”

Border agents opened up a new facility in Donna, Texas, three weeks ago, according to the Washington Post, while creating new camps in Del Rio, Texas, and Arizona.

17: Biden Repeats False Claim That Trump Told Public to Inject Bleach

Biden repeated the debunked story, rated false even by left-leaning PolitiFact, that President Donald Trump recommended during a White House coronavirus press briefing to inject bleach.

“I think there’s a growing awareness that injecting bleach into your system doesn’t do it for you,” Biden said in remarks to black essential workers.

Trump, however, said no such thing, as Biden also asserted last summer. Instead, Trump was speaking on the role of disinfectants help in preventing serious infection with viruses such as the novel Wuhan coronavirus.

Speaking w/ Black essential workers, Biden says, ""I can't tell you how much a difference you're making. We have met with people all over the country…I think there's a growing awareness that injecting bleach into your system doesn't do it for you.""

16: Biden Lies Again About Not Inheriting a Vaccine Plan

During his visit to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing plant in mid-February, Biden once again falsely claimed that his administration did not inherit a vaccine plan from former President Donald Trump.

“Just over four weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country,” Biden said. “My predecessors — as my mother would say, God love ’em — failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office.”

Despite this repeated claim from Biden as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and White House press secretary Jen Psaki, officials such as Anthony Fauci have reassured the public that the Trump administration and Operation Warp Speed did not leave the Biden administration empty-handed.

“We’re certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution,” Fauci said, disputing the White House’s claims.

Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s project to facilitate the creation and distribution of the vaccine, also passed along a plan to Biden and his team once they assumed office.

15: Biden Says There Is ‘Overwhelming Consensus’ to Pass Excessive COVID Spending

During a February CNN town hall with Anderson Cooper, Biden claimed there was “overwhelming consensus” to pass a coronavirus spending bill with excessive funding.

I’m committed to pass — look, here’s — some of you are probably economists or college professors or you’re teachers in school. This is the first time in my career — and as you can tell, I’m over 30 — the first time in my career that there is a consensus among economists left, right, and center that is over — and including the IMF and in Europe, that overwhelming consensus is, in order to grow the economy a year, two, three, and four down the line, we can’t spend too much.

A column in the Wall Street Journal published in January disproves Biden’s erroneous assertion by highlighting remarks from several of Biden’s own political allies on the left who refute the idea of passing a gargantuan package.

Another article in the New Yorker published days before Biden’s CNN appearance cited warnings over Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief package by prominent economists.

“The 1.9 trillion program could overheat the economy so badly as to be counterproductive,” Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, tweeted.

14: Biden Denies Psaki Said Schools Should Open Just One Day a Week

The same night he claimed a COVID-19 vaccine was not created until after he joined the White House, Biden denied that White House press secretary Jen Psaki ever said schools should be open just one day a week, claiming it was simply “not true” and eventually clarifying his statement to say it was “mistaken in communication.”

Asked about @PressSec saying that schools should be open one day a week, Biden says ""that's not true"" and it was a ""mistaken in communication."" The quote from Psaki: pic.twitter.com/TVbeo80JnB — Philip Melanchthon Wegmann (@PhilipWegmann) February 17, 2021

At the beginning of February, Psaki proudly declared that Biden’s goal to have children back to classroom learning by his 100th day in office, in April, only applied to half the country’s schools and only requires one day of in-person learning — meaning just 50 percent of kids attending school for about five days total would accomplish the “goal.” When a reporter asked her to clarify the Biden administration’s position, Psaki doubled down on the plan to require just one day of in-person learning per week in “the majority of schools.” Days later, the White House flip-flopped its position on school reopenings, and Psaki told reporters that Biden’s plan was to ensure every school would be open “five days a week.”

13: Biden Claims COVID Vaccine Wasn’t Around When He Assumed Office

During a CNN town hall on Feb. 16, Biden falsely claimed the United States did not have a COVID-19 vaccine when he transitioned into the White House in late January.

President Biden said in reference to a vaccine — ""Which we didn't have when I came into office."" That's just blatantly false. @CnnTown — Beverly Hallberg (@BeverlyHallberg) February 17, 2021

Against faulty predictions from journalists, so-called experts, and verified Twitter users who cast doubt on former-President Donald Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, the first round of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the United States to health care workers in mid-December following the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use and mass distribution approval. The FDA also applied emergency authorization to the Moderna vaccine in mid-December, approving it for widespread distribution and use long before Biden joined the White House.

Biden received both doses of the Pfizer COVID vaccine before he was inaugurated.

12: Biden Statement on Impeachment Falsely Attributes Officer’s Death to Capitol Riot

Biden’s statement on Trump’s impeachment acquittal opened with the assertion that a Capitol police officer who died on the day of the January riots was killed by the mob of Trump supporters storming the congressional complex.

“It was nearly two weeks ago that Jill and I paid our respects to Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who laid in honor in the Rotunda after losing his life protecting the Capitol from a riotous, violent mob on January 6, 2021,” Biden said.

There is absolutely no evidence to prove, however, that Sicknick was brutally killed by the mob that day, a claim amplified by Democrats throughout the impeachment proceedings with the help of legacy outlets such as the New York Times, which quietly later issued a correction as the trial came to a close.

Amazing: the NYT just quietly appended this so-called ""update"" – which is really a correction if not a retraction – to its Jan 8 article about Officer Sicknick's death.

11: Kamala Harris Repeats Bogus Claim New White House Starting ‘From Scratch’ on Vaccines

Vice President Kamala Harris repeated the bogus claim that the Biden White House has been forced to start “from scratch” to handle the coronavirus vaccine rollout.

“We’re starting from scratch,” Harris said, “on something that’s been raging for almost an entire year.”

Even National Institutes of Health Director Anthony Fauci rejected the assertion made by White House officials in January, as the Trump administration reached the 1 million shots-a-day threshold Biden has attempted to claim credit for.

10: Biden Said He Would Fire Staff ‘On the Spot’ for ‘Disrepect.’ Hasn’t Fired Deputy Press Secretary

Biden issued a stark warning to about 1,000 presidential appointees upon taking the reins of the Oval Office.

“If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect or talk down to someone, I promise you, I will fire you on the spot — on the spot. No ifs, ands, or buts,” Biden said.

On Feb. 12, however, Vanity Fair reported White House deputy press secretary TJ Ducklo threatened a Politico reporter inquiring about a romantic relationship with an Axios political reporter tasked with covering the vice president after leaving the Biden beat.

“I will destroy you,” Ducklo reportedly threatened Politico’s Tara Palmeri, if the paper published the story.

Instead of unemployment, however, Ducklo was given a one-week suspension without pay.

9: Biden Said He ‘Misspoke’ When Claiming US Would Reach Only 100 Million Vaccines in 100 Days

Biden said during a Jan. 25 press conference he “misspoke” when claiming the United States would reach only 100 million coronavirus vaccine shots given out within the administration’s first 100 days, a pace reached by the Trump administration. Biden then emphasized a hope of reaching 150 million instead.

The White House COVID-19 Response Team tweeted two days later, however, that the Biden administration’s goal of 100 million doses in 100 days hasn’t changed.

The President set an ambitious goal of administering 100 million shots in our first 100 days. To get there, we’ve got to average about a million shots per day.

8: Biden Trashed Trump’s China Travel Ban as Xenophobic Before Signing His Own

When Trump implemented a travel ban on China in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, then-candidate Biden railed against the executive action as “xenophobic,” claiming such restrictions do not work.

Less than a year later, Biden has implemented his own travel bans on South Africa, Brazil, Great Britain, and 26 other European countries in the second week of his presidency.

7: Biden Team: Trump Vaccination Plan ‘Worse Than We Could Have Imagined’

After Biden staffers lied, telling CNN there was “nothing for us to rework” in terms of a vaccination distribution plan, White House press secretary Jen Psaki admitted at the podium during a Jan. 25 briefing that there was a plan — they just won’t give credit. Psaki told reporters the plan from the Trump White House was “much worse than we could have imagined.”

.@PressSec says the coronavirus vaccine distribution plan inherited from the Trump White House is ""much worse than we could have imagined."" — Anders Hagstrom (@Hagstrom_Anders) January 25, 2021

The plan inherited by the Biden White House, however, has already put the new administration on a trajectory to reach its goal of getting 100 million people vaccinated within its first 100 days.

Below is the chart outline for the distribution process under Operation Warp Speed, which produced not one, but two coronavirus vaccines in record time.

6: Biden Warns Pandemic Will Worsen After Pledging to Shut Down Virus

Biden spent the entire campaign last year running on a platform to shut down the novel coronavirus, only to back away from the signature pledge on day three of his White House tenure with a bold admission.

“There’s nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months,” Biden said on Jan. 22.

Not only did Biden’s official campaign promise acknowledge that “the trajectory of COVID-19 in America is headed in the wrong direction” and that his administration would be the solution, but Biden also pledged numerous times to “immediately put in place a national strategy that will position our country to finally get ahead of this virus and get back our lives.”

5: Biden Claims Federal Government Never Acted with Urgency to Combat Pandemic

Joe Biden claimed the federal government failed to “act with the urgency” that was necessary to combat the coronavirus pandemic, apparently neglecting to mention the Trump White House’s Operation Warp Speed that produced two viable coronavirus vaccines by the year’s end.

Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn also pointed out that Congress passed trillions in stimulus, providing funds for pandemic efforts and economic recovery.

4: Biden Team Tells CNN Trump Offered No Plan for Vaccine Distribution

Sources within the Biden administration told CNN they inherited no vaccine distribution plan from the previous White House.

“There is nothing for us to rework. We are going to have to build everything from scratch,” one source reportedly told CNN’s MJ Lee, except there was, as outlined in Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, included below.

The Biden team’s statements were also contradicted by Dr. Fauci the same afternoon.

“We’re certainly not starting from scratch, because there is activity going on in the distribution,” Fauci told reporters.

3: Biden White House Claims Elites ‘Celebrating’ Is Exception to Mask Edict

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki justified Biden’s decision with his family to forgo face masks at the Lincoln Memorial after signing an executive order requiring them on all federal lands.

“He was celebrating a historic day in our country. … We have bigger things to worry about,” said Psaki, whose dismissal of the face mask as an insignificant issue was contradicted by the White House edict passed hours earlier.

Though Biden has received both shots of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines stipulate that vaccinated people are to continue wearing face masks, citing a lack of research showing whether those vaccinated can still spread the virus. While Biden likely did not need to wear a face mask, considering he was outside and adequately distanced from others, the absence of a mask flies in the face of Biden’s executive order, in which “celebrating” is not listed as an exception.

2: Biden Falsely Claims ‘All’ Media Smeared Vaccine Plan as ‘Impossible’

Joe Biden defended his administration’s goal to vaccinate 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office after a reporter questioned whether the target was too modest.

“When I announced it, you all said it wasn’t possible. C’mon. Gimme a break, man,” Biden snapped.

While few articles at major publications have voiced some skepticism, they remained rare, undermining Biden’s claim that “all” media had been overwhelmingly pessimistic of the Biden administration reaching the 100 million mark by the end of April.

1: Biden Vows to Be Unity President After Smearing GOP Sens. as Nazis

Biden launched his first term as commander-in-chief by branding himself as the unifier-in-chief while aggressively pursuing a partisan progressive agenda promoting left-wing ideas of “social justice” after smearing two Republican senators as Nazi collaborators.

“To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart,” Biden pleaded with the American people.

Susan Rice Abandoned Me In Benghazi. She’ll Abandon You On Guns,"President Joe Biden is installing his chief cover-up agent to run domestic policy for the United States. Susan Rice can’t be trusted to stand up for Americans and steer policy to protect our rights, especially our Second Amendment rights. She failed in upholding her oath of office while being a puppet for Hillary Clinton regarding Benghazi.

It’s a painful lesson we learned with the truth about what caused of deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods. Rice knowingly lied to cover up the mistakes made by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then Vice President Biden and President Barack Obama, who failed to fulfil their duty and protect the lives of Americans overseas. Ambassador Rice made the rounds on five Sunday morning talk shows spreading lies of how the coordinated attack on a U.S. compound was sparked by a video no one ever saw nor heard.

Rice failed us on Sept. 12, 2012, and she will fail us again as director of the White House Domestic Policy Council. She will be in the unique position to shape, sharpen, and spearhead the Biden-Harris administration’s attack on constitutionally protected Second Amendment rights.

During his presidential campaign, Biden made it crystal clear what he intends to do to the Second Amendment. It will become a doormat upon which he’ll wipe his feet as he walks into the White House. Rice will be the one who puts it there for him.

President Biden called firearm manufacturers “the enemy” in 2019 during the primary debates. These are the same manufacturers who made the firearms in my gun safe and the firearms I used to defend my life and the lives of fellow Americans in Benghazi. These are the manufacturers who make the firearms for our military and police officers to keep our nation and communities safe. I’ve faced off against the enemy. American firearm manufacturers aren’t it.

A Biden administration proposes to confiscate the more than 20 million modern sporting rifles that are in circulation today. Those include the AR-15-style rifles they purposely mislabel as “assault rifles.”

They know they’ll never get law enforcement to agree to round them up, much less convince freedom-minded Americans to willingly surrender their firearms to the Biden gun control agenda. That’s why Biden has floated the notion of reclassifying them under the 1934 National Firearms Act and slap a punitive tax on each rifle and every magazine.

The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearm industry trade association, conservatively estimates there are 20 million rifles and more than 150 million magazines that hold more than 10 rounds (that’s about 50 percent of all magazines). So law-abiding Americans would be hit with a tax bill of more than $34 billion for the privilege to keep what they already lawfully own and have a constitutional right to keep.

On top of all that, a Biden administration would require photos, fingerprints, notification to the local chief law enforcement officer, and another background check for this “privilege.” Every single law-abiding American who owns an AR-15 would be put on a secret government watch list.

There’s more. Biden would force states to adopt gun licensing schemes, turn the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) into an agency that revokes licenses from gun retailers for a single minor paperwork error, criminalize the private transfer of firearms, reinstitute gun grab policies seen during the Obama-Biden administration when they used the Social Security Administration to eliminate gun rights, require unworkable and unreliable so-called “smart-gun” technology on all guns sold, and repeal the law that keeps activist lawyers from filing harassing lawsuits against firearm manufacturers for the criminal acts committed by individuals. That’s like letting drunk driving victims sue Ford.

Guiding all this will be Rice. She’ll be heading Biden’s gun control dream team. That includes naming California’s Democratic Attorney General Xavier Becerra to the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. He has no health experience but knows how to call gun control “a health-care crisis” and defend unconstitutional gun grabs from Californians. There will also be Judge Merrick Garland, who has ruled from the bench at every opportunity to deny gun rights.

This all fits in neatly with Rice’s personal ideas on enacting stricter gun control. She supports a ban on Americans owning semiautomatic modern sporting rifles, the most-popular-selling centerfire rifles today. She wants to make it a crime for a neighbor to sell another neighbor a gun. She was vetted by the antigun billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety to be a possible vice-presidential candidate.

Rice won’t take the job to protect the American people. She’s proven she can’t, or won’t. She’ll be the one to set the Second Amendment on the doorstep of the White House while gun control groups march in. Rice will abandon our God-given rights just as quickly as she abandoned me in Benghazi. Then she’ll spin it on Sunday morning talk shows.

"Biden, Democrats Push Forward With Crackdown On Legal Gun Owners","Now that another failed impeachment is out of the way, the Biden administration and members of Democrat-controlled Congress are seeking ways to crack down on legal gun owners and enact strict gun control measures to “end our epidemic of gun violence.”

President Joe Biden led the charge on Sunday, releasing a statement citing incidents such as the deadly Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, three years ago and the “historic increase in homicides across America” as the main reasons to ban certain rifles such as AR-15s (semi-automatic guns commonly mislabeled as “assault weapons”), prohibit the sale and use of “high-capacity magazines,” create a universal background check system, and make gun manufacturers “who knowingly put weapons of war on our streets” susceptible to punishment.

“This Administration will not wait for the next mass shooting to heed that call. We will take action to end our epidemic of gun violence and make our schools and communities safer,” he said in a statement, calling for Congress to “enact commonsense gun law reforms.” “We owe it to all those we’ve lost and to all those left behind to grieve to make a change. The time to act is now.”

While one gun-control activist is flirting with creating a pillow company to rival Fox News advertiser MyPillow, multiple anti-gun groups hailed Biden’s demands as necessary, praising the president for promoting “these vital measures.” Pro-gun organizations, on the other hand, warned against the dangers of these sweeping suggestions.

“President Joe Biden’s call for his gun control agenda is not working to address the shared American goal of reducing criminal misuse of firearms,” National Shooting Sports Foundation public affairs Director Mark Oliva said in a statement. “His demand that Congress ban the modern sporting rifle (MSR), which he knowingly mislabels an ‘assault rifle’ and ‘weapon of war,’ denies the reality that more murders are committed with knives, fists, and clubs than all rifles combined. Over 20 million MSRs are in circulation today, used daily for lawful purposes.”

Oliva also noted that Biden’s call to hold gun manufacturers accountable for crimes committed with guns they produced widely contradicts the bipartisan Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.

“Rolling it back would be akin to allowing activist lawyers to sue Ford for the wrongful deaths caused by drunk drivers,” he said. “The criminal responsible for the horrors thrust on Parkland, and the nation, must be held accountable for his crimes. Anything less is a whitewash of the failures of local, state, and federal authorities to act on any of the 45 instances of warnings, tips, and police responses prior to his final terrible crimes.”

The National Rifle Association also spoke out against Biden’s demands, noting that his proposals would “ban commonly owned firearms (AR-15s) and 10+ round mags, criminalize private firearm transfers, and run firearm manufacturers & dealers out of business.”

TODAY: President Biden issued statement calling on Congress to: 🚨Ban commonly owned firearms (AR-15s) and 10+ round mags

Despite polling that indicates support for stricter U.S. gun laws is at its lowest level since 2016, Biden’s call to action elicited promises from congressional members such as Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut to introduce background check legislation “in the upcoming weeks.”

“President Biden and his administration are clearly committed to signing commonsense gun violence prevention legislation into law and taking executive action to save lives and make our communities safer. Two years ago, we got pretty darn close to striking a bipartisan deal to expand background checks that I believe would have passed on the floor if [then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell put it up for a vote,” Murphy said.

Other members such as Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island are gearing up to reintroduce legislation banning “assault weapons” such as semi-automatic rifles and pistols that previously failed to receive votes in the Republican-controlled Senate.

Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, the same congresswoman who incorrectly claimed AR-15 rifles require .50 caliber ammunition and are “as heavy as 10 boxes that you might be moving,” already introduced one piece of legislation targeting the gun industry and legal firearm users with the hopes of enacting sweeping gun control measures. While the “Sabika Sheikh Firearm Licensing and Registration Act” seeks to outlaw ammunition of .50 caliber or greater and require gun owners to pay for insurance, take a government training course, federally register their firearms, and obtain several licenses to merely display an antique firearm in their home, the bill currently has no sponsors and does not appear to have gained traction with any of the congresswoman’s Democratic colleagues.

Top 9 Reasons Democrats’ Latest Gun Control Bill Is A Terrible Idea,"Two years ago, House Democrats pushed a bill requiring so-called “universal background checks” at the federal level, which would have effectively outlawed private sales throughout the country. That bill was H.R. 8, or the “Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.”

Now, after taking control of all three branches, the Democrats are trying again and have just introduced, you guessed it: H.R. 8, the “Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021.” Who says Democrats can’t come up with new ideas?

This new bill, just like the old bill, would require that a federal background check be conducted prior to all transfers of firearm possession. To many Americans, this may seem like a reasonable idea. After all, law-abiding gun owners abhor the criminal misuse of firearms.

However, on closer examination, none of the claims from gun control proponents backing this bill holds water. We’re going to explore the top nine reasons this latest piece of gun control legislation is a bad idea.

Federally mandated universal background checks won’t end gun violence nor stop the criminal misuse of firearms, but they will significantly increase the burden of millions of law-abiding Americans who wish only to exercise their Second Amendment right to self-defense.

1. Demands For New Gun Control Are An Admission That Gun Control Doesn’t Work

Background checks are used to ensure that a potential firearm possessor is not one of a class of “prohibited persons” who are prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition under federal law. This class includes felons, fugitives, those subject to certain restraining orders, those convicted of crimes of domestic violence, and more.

This means current gun control laws already make it illegal for these people to possess a firearm. Requiring more background checks is an admission that the current law prohibiting these people from possessing firearms is not enough to prevent their possession. This is true for all gun-control laws, because if we know one thing about criminals, it’s this: they do not care if they break the law.

Every mass killing is caused by one thing: an evil person intent on killing many innocent people. The tool, whether it be an airplane, a pressure cooker, or a firearm, can change. Making even more laws restricting access to the tool will not stop mass killings, but it will make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves from potential violence. By definition, criminals don’t obey the law.

The horrific mass shooting at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, was not prevented by banning murder, banning guns on schools, banning the theft of firearms, nor requiring so-called universal background checks for every gun sale (Connecticut is one of the states that requires this). Adding yet another law on top of dozens of other laws that failed to prevent mass gun violence is an admission that these laws simply don’t work.

2. Gun Dealers Already Conduct Background Checks

Federal law, promulgated via Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) rules, already requires all gun dealers to meet stringent requirements for getting their Federal Firearms License (FFL). As an FFL, they must ensure that a customer has satisfied the background check requirements prior to allowing the customer to have possession of a firearm.

Under current federal law, gun dealers are required to confirm, prior to any and all sales, that a customer has passed a background check as part of every FFL transfer If you head into a gun store to purchase a new firearm, that dealer must confirm that you have satisfied the background check requirements before you can take possession of that new gun and take it home. This is the case regardless of where you live.

If you’re traveling across state lines and see a gun in another state that you’d like to purchase, you must either have that gun shipped to an FFL in your home state if it’s a handgun or, if it’s a rifle or shotgun, you must still pass a background check there before you can purchase and possess the firearm.

Nearly two dozen states place additional requirements beyond federal law on firearm transfers and already either require a background check to be conducted for every firearm transfer (even between private same-state resident individuals, like the Universal Background Check bill proposes) or a valid firearm possession license that is issued contingent upon a background check.

3. There Is No ‘Gun-Show Loophole’

When someone brings up a desire for more background checks, it is often offered as a solution to close the “gun-show loophole.” There’s one big problem with that claim: there is no “gun-show loophole.” It is a myth.

As covered above, federal law requires that all sales from firearm dealers, or sales between residents of different states, must satisfy the background check requirements, regardless of whether those sales happen in a gun shop, at a gun show, or out of the back of somebody’s trunk in a parking lot. Many states also require background checks for individual sales.

There is simply no law anywhere that says if a gun is bought at a gun show, then the buyer doesn’t have to undergo a background check. A dealer who tries to sell a gun at a gun show without confirming that the buyer has passed a background check would be breaking the law.

Furthermore, federal law also prevents sales to anyone that any seller (not just FFLs) believes to be a “prohibited person” (e.g., a convicted felon). As a result, gun dealers regularly turn away potential customers if they think they are not legally allowed to purchase or possess a firearm. There is simply no special exemption or “loophole” in federal law that allows gun show sales to occur without background checks. Therefore, there’s no loophole to close.

4. There Is No ‘Online Gun Sales Loophole’

Another common call for universal background checks is based on a so-called “online gun sale loophole.” Similar to the “gun show loophole” above, it doesn’t exist. Firearms can be legally purchased (paid for) online as long as the purchaser is not a “prohibited person,” the firearm is legal to possess in the purchaser’s state of residence, and the state otherwise allows the sale.

The current legal process for online gun sales requires that the firearm be shipped to a federally licensed dealer (FFL) in the purchaser’s home state, where the purchaser must show up to fill out the required federal paperwork and satisfy the background check requirements prior to possession.

Just because you click “BUY” on a website that sells guns doesn’t mean you’ll have it shipped to your door without having to process the transaction through a federal gun dealer, who is required to confirm that you have passed a background check before you take possession of that new gun. Again, no loophole equals no loophole to close.

5. Universal Background Checks Won’t Stop Criminals From Getting Guns

There are two categories of people looking to purchase a firearm: law-abiding citizens with clean criminal records and therefore not a “prohibited persons,” or people who are already legally prohibited from purchasing a firearm. As discussed above, the former category follows laws. The latter doesn’t.

Even under a legal regime that requires universal background checks, the person who is banned by law from owning a gun will continue to get a gun the same way criminals do today: by stealing it, having someone else by it for him or her, or purchasing it in the black market. A federal background check requirement will do nothing to prevent that already illegal sale.

Thinking this will stop the criminal misuse of firearms is like insisting upon a background check before someone can purchase crystal meth. Users of crystal meth, much like criminals with guns, act contrary to the law. If they can’t legally buy it, they’ll do it illegally. And the people in the business of illegally selling aren’t about to start complying with laws that require them to conduct their black market sales in a particular way.

Remember, it’s already illegal for a prohibited person to possess a firearm. If that law doesn’t stop them, requiring background checks in more types of transactions won’t either.

There’s also a real problem with “straw purchases” of firearms, wherein someone with a clean record buys a gun from a gun store for someone who can’t legally purchase it on his or her own. This is already illegal and our nation’s gun dealers are the front line of defense against these illegal transactions. However, despite the current background check requirements for gun dealers, straw purchases still happen, and illegal straw purchases will only become more popular and more difficult to discern if H.R. 8 becomes law.

6. Background Checks Won’t Stop Mass Shootings

Demands for more gun control typically seem to follow mass shootings. It makes sense that we want to do something—these mass shootings are horrific, and we should do what we can to stop them. However, universal background checks will not end mass shootings nor gun violence.

Before proposing a new law that will create a hurdle to the exercise of a fundamental right, we should at least ask if the law would have prevented in the past whatever we’re trying to stop in the future. For example, universal background checks would not have stopped the deadliest mass shootings following the enactment of federal background check requirements in 1994:

Las Vegas 2017: Shooter purchased his firearms from a gun dealer (where background checks are already required).

Orlando 2016: Shooter purchased his firearms from a gun dealer.

Virginia Tech 2007: Shooter purchased his firearms from a gun dealer.

Sandy Hook 2012: Shooter stole his firearms.

Sutherland Springs 2017: Shooter purchased his firearm from a gun dealer. He had a criminal record and the background check system failed to stop him (the same system that would be used for private transfers).

Parkland 2018: Shooter purchased firearm from a gun dealer.

San Bernardino 2017: Shooters’ firearms were “straw-purchased” by someone else.

Fort Hood 2009: Shooter purchased firearm from a gun dealer.

Columbine 1999: Shooters’ guns were straw-purchased for them by someone else.

Thousand Oaks 2018: Shooter purchased firearm legally with a background check.

Navy Yard 2013: Shooter purchased firearm from a gun dealer.

Aurora 2012: Shooter purchased firearms from a gun dealer.

Democrats often cite stopping these mass shootings as a reason for enacting universal background checks. However, after seeing that universal background checks would have had zero effect, it invites the question: why are they really so eager to add burdens to lawful gun ownership?

7. In-State Commerce Is a State Issue

Under current federal law, only firearms transactions between private, non-dealer residents who reside in the same state are exempt from federal background check requirements. That is because the federal firearm licensing system and background check requirements apply only to interstate commerce.

This is not because the federal government doesn’t want more power (since when has that happened?). Instead, it is a valid constitutional restriction on what types of activities and commerce the federal government may control.

As noted above, many states have their own gun laws and have placed additional restrictions on firearm possession above and beyond what the federal government already requires. These purely in-state transactions between private residents of those states should continue to be handled at the state level, as different states have different challenges that are best addressed with local solutions implemented by local representatives.

Furthermore, each state should retain the authority to decide whether it is willing to incur the additional costs and burdens that will arise from new gun control restrictions.

8. Universal Background Checks Are Too Burdensome

The current National Instant Criminal Check System (NICS) used for firearm background checks can only be used by federally licensed gun dealers or government entities. This restriction by the FBI on their system is due to them not being able to handle the burden of additional checks.

Opening the background check system, which already experiences significant backlogs and delays, especially with the record-breaking gun sales figures lately, will introduce an extra burden on the government, and on those who wish to exercise their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The universal background check bill will amount to a delay and a tax on the exercise of a fundamental right.

First, a seller and buyer must find, and travel to, a local gun store during the store’s hours and wait for paperwork and a background check to be processed. Second, unless the federal government intends to force dealers into servitude, the dealer will charge a fee for his services conducting the background check. This fee, typically around $25-50, will be, in effect, an additional tax on every sale of a firearm.

There will also be a burden on gun dealers. Most gun dealers are small business owners who are focused on keeping their businesses running. This extra burden will take their time away from customers and other business duties including helping to spot and stop straw purchases. It will also significantly increase their ATF compliance burden, as they are liable for every piece of paperwork and transfer that takes place.

9. Universal Background Checks Create a De Facto Federal Gun Registry

It is currently illegal for the federal government to maintain a database of ownership of standard firearms (not including silencers, machine guns, etc. that require an FFL to have an “SOT License”). There is a good reason for this ban on a federal gun registry: a tyrannical government can only confiscate firearms if it first knows where they are all located.

Although a registry is not mentioned in the bill, it is a logical conclusion. After all, how could such a universal background check law ever be enforced absent a national gun registry showing who passed a background check, when, and for which particular firearms?

For law enforcement to prove that a firearm was purchased in a private transaction, they would need to know who was the most recent lawful possessor. Of course, someone with a lawfully possessed firearm could have a receipt from a gun store, but that could be lost or faked.

The natural conclusion to this law’s enforcement would be the creation of a database tracking the lawful transfers, and therefore current possessors, of all firearms in this country. It would be bad enough if the government were to maintain and use such a list, but what if hackers stole that list, just as they stole the personnel records of millions of federal employees? Suddenly, violent criminals in search of weapons would have a perfect map showing which homes to ransack when nobody’s home.

Mass shootings and gun violence are horrible, and we should try to stop them. However, demands for more gun control only make plain the truth that gun control cannot stop violence.

Current gun control doesn’t stop criminals. The latest gun control proposal is no different. It would do nothing to end gun violence, but it would drastically increase the burdens on law-abiding citizens who only wish to defend themselves and their families from violent criminals who don’t care whether something is against the law.

Democrats To Push Gun Control Bills Today Without Even A Debate,"Gun control groups are downright ecstatic with Congress’s opening salvo against law-abiding gun owners. It’s not because anything Congress is proposing would actually stop criminal misuse of firearms. It’s because, for them, it’s just the beginning.

That’s their words. Not ours.

U.S. Rep Mike Thompson, D-Calif., introduced H.R. 8 — the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 — that would criminalize the private transfer of firearms between law-abiding gun owners. A companion bill, S. 529, was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., although “bipartisan” might be misleading.

At introduction, just three Republicans signed on to co-sponsor S. 529. This was soon to be joined by the introduction of H.R. 1446 by Democratic Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., whose the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021 would extend background check delay periods to up to 30 days and put the onus on law-abiding citizens to prove their innocence to the government.

The government wouldn’t be so brazen as to require a citizen to prove he or she can exercise a constitutional right if it were any other fundamental civil liberty. Imagine having to get the government’s permission before you could call your elected officials to oppose legislation. Yet, Clyburn told NPR his legislation “is a good first step.”

Gun Control Giddiness

“This is a huge moment for our movement,” said Moms Demand Action’s Shannon Watts, reports The Hill. Everytown for Gun Safety’s John Feinblatt said, “There’s never been a better time for federal action,” adding the legislation is “unfinished business” for what is being called a gun control “trifecta” between Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and President Joe Biden.

“Passing this legislation is the bare minimum. It’s the first step in comprehensive action,” said Max Markham, the policy director for March For Our Lives. All three gun control groups are financed by antigun billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who spent more than $1 billion for gun control in the 2020 election.

When she heard of the bill to outlaw private firearm transfers, Newtown Action Alliance’s Po Murray, chairwoman of the Connecticut-based gun control group, told a reporter, “We’re thrilled that this bill is being introduced,” adding, “[it’s] the first step in a long process that is needed to pass more federal legislation.”

Another Connecticut-based gun control organization, Sandy Hook Promise, said the legislation was a “necessary first legislative step.” Indeed, the bills are essentially the same gun control bills that passed the U.S. House of Representatives in the last Congress but never moved in the Senate. Why? Because both pieces of legislation are fraught with problems.

Criminalizing Private Sales

Thompson’s universal background checks bill sounds good on paper but gets tangled up quickly in the details. The first, and biggest, problem is that universal background checks won’t work without a national firearm registry — which is exactly what President Barack Obama’s Justice Department told him in 2013.

The legislation ignores other Justice Department warnings, especially the fact that criminals overwhelmingly obtain firearms illegally. The Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that about 90 percent of the firearms possessed by inmates during their crimes were illegally obtained, mostly through theft or the black market.

This legislation won’t stop that. What it will do, however, is make criminals out of law-abiding citizens who might sell a firearm to their neighbor of 10 years, if the sale isn’t facilitated through a licensed firearm retailer.

It also threatens to swamp the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, causing outages and delays. It will also burden licensed retailers by exposing them to license revocation if they make a paperwork error while performing this government service and product liability lawsuits for accidents involving the firearm and, if the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is repealed, for the subsequent criminal misuse of the firearm.

The horrific tragedies gun control groups point to for their universal background check arguments ring hollow too. The tragedy in Newtown, Conn. began with that murderer stealing his mother’s firearm. The murderer in Aurora, Colo., passed background checks, as did the murderers in the incidents in Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Parkland, Florida. What’s needed isn’t more background checks, but better background checks that make sure all disqualifying information and adequate resources are submitted to the FBI when appropriate.

The Loophole Lie

Clyburn’s bill isn’t any better. His “enhanced background check” claims to close loopholes, but no loophole exists. National Review’s David Harsanyi reported that the bill’s premise is based on a false narrative. The murderer at the Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., didn’t slip through a loophole. Local prosecutors failed to respond to the FBI’s request for case information when they delayed the background check for his firearm purchase.

Regrettably, NICS never followed up to complete its investigation. Had they, the tragedy could have been prevented. In truth, 91 percent of background checks receive an immediate response within minutes.

Just 9 percent enter a “delay status,” and many times this is because of common names and birthplaces. Eighty-eight percent of those are resolved within three business days and 94 percent are resolved within 10 days. The law also doesn’t tell firearm retailers they must transfer a firearm after a three-day delay, only that they are allowed. NICS informs ATF daily of all denied background checks.

Instead, Clyburn proposes that if a background check enters a delay status, it can be held for 10 business days. If it isn’t resolved in that first 10-day period, it could enter another 10-day delay, during which the purchaser must prove his or her innocence to the government. That’s un-American.

The frightening part is, this is crack in the dam that gun control advocates are thirsting for — the opportunity to open the floodgates to all the gun control legislation they’ve proposed, no matter how unconstitutional or ineffective in making our communities safer.

All of this ignores the fact that in 2020, Americans voted for their gun rights 21 million times, with more than 8.4 million for the first time. They did this when they went to the gun counter, passed the background check, exercised their Second Amendment rights, and bought a gun.

"House Passes Bills To Delay Gun Sales, Create National Gun Registry","On Thursday, the House passed two controversial bills aimed at enacting background checks for all gun sales and transfers, including private sales between neighbors, as well as closing the so-called “Charleston Loophole” to extend the waiting period the government may take if a background check is not completed in a timely fashion.

H.R. 8, The Bipartisan Background Checks Act, passed 227-203. Eight GOP House members broke ranks and voted in favor of the legislation. This includes Reps. Vern Buchanan of Florida, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Carlos Gimenez of Florida, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Maria Salazar of Florida, Chris Smith of New Jersey, and Fred Upton of Michigan. Salazar, Gimenez, and Garbarino are all freshman members.

The bill was first proposed by Rep. Mike Thompson of California. Fitzpatrick, Smith, and Upton co-sponsored the background check legislation with Democratic Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, Lucy McBath of Georgia, and Robin Kelly of Illinois.

“Today, I voted for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act to close a loophole exploited by dangerous criminals to side-step the system and illegally obtain firearms. The simple fix helps promote safe, sensible, and responsible gun ownership,” said Gimenez in a statement.

As explained by gun expert Ryan Cleckner, this bill would not stop criminals from getting guns. Nor would it have stopped the recent mass murders, most of which were obtained with illegal guns.

Republicans argued the measure would violate constitutional rights by making it more difficult to access a firearm. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky gave the example of someone attempting to escape a toxic relationship.

“Imagine, just imagine now that you’re the victim of an abusive relationship,” said Massie, “and after five years you’ve summoned the courage and the resources to separate from that relationship. Things have escalated. Now you’ve decided it’s time to acquire the means to protect you and your children.”

“So you go to the gun store and you try to buy a gun,” Massie continued. “The clerk presses the computer button. It says denied. You ask the clerk, ‘Why was it denied?’ ‘I don’t know, this happens sometimes, maybe you had a similar name as someone else in the database, you can’t buy a gun today, tomorrow, next week, not ever.’ … So you go to a friend … your friend says ‘I’d like to help you, but don’t you know HR-8 passed and it was signed by the president? I can’t spend eight years in a cage! Good luck tonight.'”

Every part of this tweet is a lie. We already have background checks — Massie is talking about Dems' desire to extend the three-day waiting period. And there are scores of reported examples of women in this situation. https://t.co/ZMl7bEogUy — David Harsanyi (@davidharsanyi) March 11, 2021

H.R. 8 would additionally create a database of all firearm transactions.

“This is about creating a gun registry to track guns of the American people. There is no way to implement what the Democrats are trying to implement without doing that,” Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said Wednesday on the House floor.

“The Democrats have rushed two bills to the floor, no regular order, no hearing time,” Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., said Wednesday. “They have allowed no meaningful input from Republicans and – and these bills, again, would have not stopped a single mass shooting, not Newtown, not Charleston, not Parkland, not Las Vegas, not Sutherland Springs, would not have stopped the shooting of our former colleague, Gabrielle Giffords, because her shooter passed a background check.”

The second bill, H.R. 1446, intends to extend the waiting period from three days to 10 days in which a government official can approve a gun sale. This has been labeled the Charleston Loophole, after a church shooting in South Carolina that left nine dead.

“The 3 day proceed to sale provision is a safety valve that ensures gun purchasers in the U.S. are not arbitrarily denied their Second Amendment Rights. Without the 3 day provision, the FBI has no incentive to complete checks in a timely manner,” The National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action said in a statement.

As David Harsanyi noted on H.R. 1446 a few weeks ago:

The three-day provision exists to ensure that the government — the same government that was home, for instance, to Lois Lerner’s IRS — does not begin arbitrarily delaying Americans the chance to use their Second Amendment rights. Indeed, it was explicitly written into the law for that purpose. Clyburn’s bill, as is the case with all gun-control measures these days, would primarily target lawful people — such as churchgoers who want to protect themselves and other parishioners — and make it more difficult or more time-consuming for them to own guns, while doing nothing of consequence to the people who already ignore the law.

Unless Democrats can acquire 10 Republican votes in the Senate, the two measures are unlikely to obtain the 60 votes necessary to be signed into law.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/03/12/house-passes-two-gun-control-bills-to-delay-gun-sales-create-national-gun-registry/,2021-03-12
Report: Secret Service Tried To Clean Up Biden Family Mess In Hunter's Gun Incident,"Secret Service reportedly tried to interfere in an investigation into Hunter Biden’s gun, which went temporarily missing after his late brother’s wife and his then-love interest threw it away in a trash can near a grocery store in 2018, a new report from Politico suggests.

Hallie Biden allegedly rummaged through Hunter’s truck, where she discovered and subsequently trashed his .38 revolver due to “suspicions she had.” Later, when Hallie returned to the scene to recover the gun as Joe Biden’s son instructed her to do, it was nowhere to be found. When Hallie notified the grocery store of the missing gun, the manager called the police.

“The missing gun caused heightened concern, according to the police report, because the grocery store sits across the street from Alexis I. du Pont High School,” Politico reported.

Shortly after police and the FBI, which was keeping an eye on Hunter for potential tax crimes in an investigation that is still ongoing, arrived on the scene to question the couple and others, two Secret Service agents equipped with “badges and identification cards” reportedly visited the gun store where Hunter purchased the revolver earlier that month and demanded the owner turn over the Firearms Transaction Record used during Hunter’s purchase.

The store owner, however, held onto the records until the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, which was authorized to review them, could get to them because the owner “suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” according to multiple people with a “firsthand knowledge of the episode.” A Secret Service agent also reportedly briefed another source about the event later.

The Secret Service denies any official involvement in the situation and noted that the Biden family’s protection spanned from 2009 to 2017 and did not restart until early 2020, but law enforcement officials said that Secret Service in Wilmington, Delaware, and Philadelphia “kept an informal hand in maintaining the former vice president’s security,” organizing a police presence for at least one of Biden’s appearances in 2019.

The White House also denied any knowledge of or involvement in the incident, citing the same reasons as the Secret Service.

“President Biden did not have any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Secret Service’s alleged role in this incident, and neither he nor any family member was a protectee at that time,” a spokesman told Politico.

When asked by a law enforcement official on the scene if “he had called his father about the incident before he arrived,” Hunter claimed he had “never called my dad for anything.”

Weeks before the 2020 presidential election, a report from the New York Post detailed emails from Hunter’s laptop that showed him “leveraging his connection to his father in a bid to boost his pay from a Ukrainian natural gas company, according to an email he sent around the time he joined the firm’s corporate board,” a story that was largely suppressed by Big Tech oligarchs and corporate media news outlets.

"Mr. President, Most Gun Owners Aren’t As Reckless As Hunter Biden","Although President Joe Biden would rather monologue about infrastructure than talk about this and Kamala Harris will deny it, a power-hungry Biden administration in cahoots with a Democrat-controlled Congress is working hard to enact sweeping gun control. Capitalizing on tragic shootings, this administration is bypassing Second Amendment infringement and has opted instead to just stomp it right out.

During his first press conference more than two full months into office, Biden briefly promised gun control. Immediately before changing the subject to something as non-polarizing as bridges and roads, Biden replied to a question about whether he would pursue gun control, including through executive action, saying he would do “all of the above. It’s a matter of timing.”

Vice President Kamala Harris just this week said no one is “trying to come after your guns.” “Stop pushing the false choice that this means everybody’s trying to come after your guns,” Harris said. “That is not what we’re talking about.”

But in the right setting, the Biden-Harris duo has eagerly pledged their commitment to sweeping gun control. Biden is presently urging lawmakers to pass a federal ban on what he calls “assault weapons,” which the left usually says to mean semi-automatic guns, which are among the most popular firearms.

In 2018, civilians owned 16 million of these modern sporting rifles, meaning legislation like this would limiting gun access for hordes of law-abiding Americans. Biden has also pressed Congress to ban certain kinds of magazines.

During a presidential primary debate in 2019, Harris said she would use executive power if Congress didn’t do her bidding. The now-vice president has advocated for banning imports of AR-15s, implementing universal background checks (a move Biden is pushing for now), banning semi-automatic rifles, repealing gun manufacturer immunity, banning high-capacity magazines, and prohibiting those convicted of a federal hate crime from purchasing guns. These measures would gut the Second Amendment.

Where’s Hunter’s Gun?

As Democrats forge ahead with these efforts, a bizarre story surfaced on Thursday in the pages of Politico regarding a gun, a trash can, and a scandal-ridden Biden family.

The story begins in 2018 with Hallie Biden, widow of the late Beau Biden and then-girlfriend of his brother Hunter Biden, allegedly rummaging through Hunter’s truck due to “suspicions she had,” then finding and subsequently dumping his .38 revolver in a trash can behind a grocery store.

When Hallie later returned to the store to recover the gun, as Hunter had directed her to do, it was nowhere to be found. Hallie told the grocery store about the missing gun, and the manager called the police, which then arrived to question the couple.

Things only got weirder from there. The missing gun was particularly worrisome because the grocer was located right across the street from a high school, prompting fears that it could be used in a crime. While police were questioning Hunter, he also appeared to racially profile two Mexican grocery store employees, telling officers they were “prolly illegal.”

Soon after police and the FBI — which was then looking into Hunter for potential tax crimes, an investigation that is ongoing — arrived at the grocery store, two Secret Service agents with “badges and identification cards” reportedly paid a visit to the gun store where Hunter bought the firearm earlier that month and told the owner to turn over the Firearms Transaction Record from the purchase.

The store owner “suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” according to multiple people with a “firsthand knowledge of the episode.” So he held onto the paperwork until the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the agency authorized to review the forms, could get to them. Both the Secret Service and the White House denied involvement.

It also appears Hunter might have lied on his federal background check form. Joe Biden’s son’s history of drug use is well-known. In fact, he’s scheduled to release a tell-all memoir about it next month.

In 2003, 2010, and 2014, soon after being discharged from the military for using cocaine, Hunter was in drug and alcohol rehab programs. His infamous laptop dropped off for repairs in 2019, which the media and tech giants aggressively tried to cover up during the conclusion of his father’s 2020 presidential election cycle, included graphic photos and video of Hunter allegedly smoking crack cocaine while engaged in a sex act.

Despite this troubling record, Hunter answered “no” to a question on the Firearms Transaction Record asking if he was an “unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.” While lying on this form would have been considered a felony, Hunter was never investigated over his answer.

Most People Aren’t Hunter Biden

There’s so much to unpack there — from Hunter accusing brown people of being illegals, to maybe lying about drug abuse on a government form, to the Secret Service cleaning up Biden family messes. It’s all a highly suspicious circus.

But at the heart of the story is a well-connected person with a sketchy track record getting past a background check (maybe by lying), obtaining a revolver, and somehow losing it in a trash can next to a high school. Remember, this person is the son of President Joe Biden, the same one who doesn’t want law-abiding Americans to have guns he doesn’t like.

That revolver could have been used to shoot up the high school. Thankfully it was not (apparently it had been found by an older man who was rummaging through the trash for recyclables). But if it had been, no amount of the Biden administration’s gun-control efforts would have stopped it.

A check on Hunter revealed nothing of substance nor any consequences if he had indeed lied to the federal government on the form. Nor does an “assault weapons” ban apply to a .38 revolver. And no amount of gun control measures would have stopped the reckless Biden duo from losing a firearm in a grocery store trash can where any rando could find it.

Alas, just like our current first family, Democrats’ gun-control proposals rarely if ever operate within the realm of reality or common sense. Repealing manufacturer liability wouldn’t protect victims of gun violence any more than Democrats’ Justice in Policing Act would have protected George Floyd. It’s all theater.

Maybe Biden family gun use is all the president knows about firearms. We’re talking about the same Biden who called them “AR-14s,” after all. But Biden, Harris, and their gun-grabbing friends in Congress would do well to realize that most gun owners aren’t lying on background check forms and dumping our firearms willy-nilly in trash cans by schools. Even if we were, none of Biden’s anti-gun pipe dreams would stop us.

READ: The Gun Background Check Form Where Hunter Biden Claimed He Wasn’t Using Drugs,"Hunter Biden was the subject of a strange missing firearm case in 2018 after Hallie Biden, the wife of his late brother and subsequently Hunter’s girlfriend, tossed it into a trash can behind a grocery store near a high school, according to a strange new report from Politico. It appears Hunter, the son of President Joe Biden, might have lied on the federal forms he filled out to purchase the gun a few months prior, forms The Federalist has now obtained.

Hunter answered “no” to a question on the Firearms Transaction Record asking whether he was an “unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.” See question 11.e on the form below:

Hunter’s history of drug use is well-known, and he’s scheduled to release a tell-all memoir about it in April. His lifestyle contributed to his divorce from his wife Kathleen in 2017. Hunter “created financial concerns for the family by spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations), while leaving the family with no funds to pay legitimate bills,” his ex-wife said in the divorce filing.

The now-president’s scandal-ridden son was in numerous drug and alcohol rehab programs, including in 2003, 2010, and 2014, soon after being discharged from the military for using cocaine. According to the New Yorker, he also went on a cocaine binge in 2016. His infamous laptop he dropped off for repairs in 2019, a story which tech giants and the media aggressively tried to cover up during the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, included graphic photos and video of Hunter allegedly smoking crack cocaine while engaged in a sex act.

It’s unclear whether Hunter was using drugs around the time of his firearm purchase or what timeframe the question “are you a user of” illicit substances implies. Hunter was, however, suspected of smoking crack cocaine in a Washington, D.C., strip club in late 2018. He purchased the firearm the same year on Oct. 12.

The alleged incident occurred just blocks from the White House at Archibald’s Gentleman’s Club, where Hunter spent thousands of dollars on multiple visits. One security worker at the club said Hunter was a regular who would hole up in a VIP room, but the club’s managing partner James Ritter said one night in late 2018 included a “suspicion of drug use.”

“There was a smell of burning Styrofoam in the VIP room. We told him nothing illegal can go on here,” Ritter told Page Six. “We didn’t see anything illegal. After he was spoken to, the smell stopped.”

“VIP employees suspected it was crack,” Ritter added.

While the club typically required patrons to pay with credit cards that matched official IDs, Ritter said “Hunter was a bit of an exception” and would pay “thousands and thousands of dollars in the Archibald’s VIP rooms” with “credit cards that didn’t have his name on it.”

Now newly uncovered text messages that appear to be from Hunter Biden not only corroborate Politico’s reporting that the Secret Service got involved in the missing gun incident, ostensibly to cover up the Biden family mess, an involvement both the Secret Service and the White House have denied, but they also include mention of drug use in connection with the gun fiasco.

“She stole the gun out of my truck lock box and threw it in a garbage can full to the top at Jansens. Then told me it was my problem to deal with. Then when the police the FBI the secret service came on the scene she said she took it from me because she was scared I would harm myself due to my drug and alcohol problem and our volatile relationship and that she was afraid for the kids,” the message reads.

While lying on the gun purchase form would have been considered a felony, Hunter was never investigated over his answer.

Meanwhile, President Biden is in the process of choosing a new director for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), a confirmation that could be imperiled over the news of his son’s 2018 gun purchase and subsequent missing firearms case, a case that involved more problems than Hunter’s potential lying on background check forms.

The grocery store where Hallie Biden dumped the gun was across from a high school, which made the case particularly worrisome and prompted fears that the firearm could be used in a crime. While police were questioning Hunter, he also appeared to racially profile two Mexican grocery store employees, telling officers they were “prolly illegal.”

Shortly after police and the FBI — which was then looking into the Biden for potential tax crimes, an investigation that is still ongoing — arrived at the grocery store, two Secret Service agents with “badges and identification cards” reportedly visited the gun store where Hunter bought the firearm earlier that month and told the owner to turn over the Firearms Transaction Record, the document included above, from the purchase.

The store owner “suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” according to multiple people with a “firsthand knowledge of the episode.” So he held onto the paperwork until the ATF, the agency authorized to review the forms, could get to them.

Meanwhile, despite his own son’s irresponsibility with firearms, a recklessness most American gun owners don’t share, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris continue to pressure lawmakers to pass sweeping gun control legislation and have both threatened to take executive action if Congress doesn’t do their bidding.

As Biden prepares to nominate someone to head up the ATF, Republican senators will have plenty of important questions to ask during a confirmation hearing, such as whether the nominee will commit to using the ATF, which is a federal law enforcement organization, to investigate Hunter’s potential fraud on his Firearms Transaction Record — or whether, instead, like the reported incident with the Secret Service, the Biden nominee would continue to cover up Biden family scandals.

Senators Demand Secret Service Details In Hunter Biden Gun Scandal,"Two Republican lawmakers sent a letter to the head of Secret Service on Thursday demanding records of the agency’s involvement in the case of Hunter Biden’s missing firearm in late 2018, a story Politico reported last week.

“In light of the recent press report, please provide all records relating to your agency’s involvement in the alleged October 2018 incident with respect to Hunter Biden’s firearm no later than April 8, 2021,” wrote GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin on March 25.

The report to which the senators are referring is a bizarre story about a .38 revolver Hunter Biden purchased in late 2018 that Hallie Biden, Hunter’s love interest and the wife of his late brother Beau Biden, says she disposed of in a trash can behind a grocery store and across from a school after having discovered the firearm while rifling through Hunter’s truck over her “suspicions” of him.

In what appears to be a text message sent by Hunter, he acknowledged these suspicions, saying Hallie “stole the gun out of my truck lock box … because she was scared I would harm myself due to my drug and alcohol problem and our volatile relationship and that she was afraid for the kids.”

BREAKING: Text message from Hunter Biden confirms involvement of Secret Service in his illegal firearm incident pic.twitter.com/1vb8GGJidX — AmericaFest Poso (@JackPosobiec) March 26, 2021

The same text includes the concession that the police, the FBI, and the Secret Service were all involved after the incident, involvement the Secret Service has denied but the two Republican senators are now looking into.

“One law enforcement official said that at the time of the incident, individual Secret Service agents at the agency’s offices in Wilmington, Del., and Philadelphia kept an informal hand in maintaining the former vice president’s security,” Politico reported. “The person cited an instance in 2019 when the Wilmington office of the Secret Service called the Delaware State Police to arrange security for a public appearance by Biden.”

According to Politico, soon afterward police and the FBI — which was also looking into the Biden for potential tax crimes, an investigation that is still ongoing — arrived at the grocer because when Hallie later returned to retrieve the gun, it was gone. Then two Secret Service agents with “badges and identification cards” reportedly visited the gun store where Hunter had bought the revolver earlier that month. The agents reportedly told the owner to turn over the Firearms Transaction Record from the purchase.

The store owner “suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” according to multiple people with a “firsthand knowledge of the episode.” So he kept possession of the paperwork until the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the agency authorized to review the forms, could get to them.

“Any involvement by the Secret Service on behalf of the Biden family or on its own initiative would be inappropriate interference in an incident that was already being investigated by Delaware State Police with the involvement of the FBI, according to law enforcement officials,” Politico reported.

A spokesman for Secret Service has said the agency does not have a record of involvement in the ordeal. “U.S. Secret Service records confirm that the agency did not provide protection to any member of the Biden family in 2018, and that the Secret Service had no involvement in this alleged incident,” the agency said. If that’s true, it could indicate Secret Service officers were appearing to act in their official capacity when they were not authorized to do so.

If Secret Service was instead secretly keeping a hand in Biden family security and affairs at that time, Grassley and Johnson said the agency “must explain to Congress why such informal actions were taken and whether they were necessary in light of the circumstances.”

“Further, [Secret Service] failed to fully respond to our October 20, 2020, letter relating to emails that reference travel plans for Hunter Biden involving [Secret Service] agents one year after Hunter Biden’s protection ended,” the two Republican lawmakers said. “We continue to expect a complete response to that letter and ask that you produce all requested records no later than April 8, 2021.”

Grassley and Johnson’s impulse to investigate the latest Hunter Biden drama is one that other GOP senators should adopt in the days ahead. President Joe Biden is expected to nominate someone to be director of the ATF, the federal law enforcement organization within the Department of Justice that oversees the forms Hunter Biden filled out to purchase the gun. This nomination would require a Senate confirmation.

It appears likely that Hunter Biden lied on the federal background check form, answering “no” to whether he used numerous illicit drugs. Hunter’s history of drug abuse is well-known and led to many bouts of rehab, a discharge from the military, and a failed marriage. Reports also indicate Hunter was suspected of smoking crack cocaine in a strip club VIP room in “late 2018.” The Biden son purchased the firearm in October 2018.

Any Biden nominee to lead the ATF could present a glaring conflict of interest since that agency should be investigating Hunter Biden and whether he lied on a federal form about drug use to obtain a gun, which would be a felony.

It's Time For Gun Control Activists To Hold Hunter Biden Accountable,"“Now is the time to push the Senate to do the right thing and pass background check legislation. Because this moment is different,” wrote Shannon Watts on Monday in The Nation, where she insisted the U.S. government should be “closing loopholes in order to stop guns from ending up in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them.”

Watts is the founder of Moms Demand Action, a massive movement of anti-gun activists throughout every state. She’s ardently anti-National Rifle Association, pro-background checks, and pro-bans on guns she thinks are too big. Her organization calls Joe Biden and Kamala Harris “the strongest gun safety administration in U.S. history,” as the executive duo works to enact sweeping gun control measures.

Watts has also been completely silent on Hunter Biden’s reckless missing gun scandal. No mention of Hunter appears on the high-level activist’s Twitter account, despite it being days since the latest report on the Biden son surfaced last week, not to mention the wildly irresponsible and shady nature of the whole ordeal.

Hunter Biden, who has a known history of drug abuse, probably lied about it on a background check form to obtain a firearm, which then went missing after it ended up in a trash can near a high school. Secret Service agents may have tried to clean up and cover up the mess — and Watts, who wants to close “loopholes” and “stop guns from ending up in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them,” has nothing to say about it?

Watts is in good company. The Democratic Party is teeming with firearm opponents champing at the bit to get as many guns as possible out of the hands of average citizens — such as the more than 16 million semi-automatic sporting rifles owned by law-abiding Americans — and to make the remaining guns as hard to acquire and ineffective as possible through universal background checks, bans on certain magazines, and other measures that would render the Second Amendment a relic of the past.

Biden and Harris are in her camp, as are the countless Democrats and media mouthpieces who compulsively seize on every mass shooting to advance their political agendas and earn gun-control brownie points with special interest groups, all while victims’ bodies are still warm.

Meanwhile, while well-connected leftists and other elites break the gun laws our country already has in place, Watts and her class look the other way. It’s inconvenient to deal with the fact that gun laws didn’t stop the president’s troubled son from probably lying to get one and then losing track of it near a school. These activists seem wholly unbothered by the fact that we aren’t even enforcing the gun laws we already have.

The left and ruling class’s lack of interest in Hunter is reminiscent of how they treated David Gregory when, on national television, the host of “Meet The Press” flashed a 30-round-capacity magazine, despite anything over 10 rounds being prohibited in the District of Columbia. Here was Gregory, going toe to toe with NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre, and preaching at his opponent about the dangers of high-capacity magazines while holding one in violation of D.C. law.

Gregory was never prosecuted. Although D.C. Attorney General Irvin Nathan insisted his office took the responsibility of prosecuting such offenses “very seriously,” he let Gregory off the hook because “under all of the circumstances here a prosecution would not promote public safety in the District of Columbia nor serve the best interests of the people of the District to whom this office owes its trust.”

The message reeks of elitism: We can handle our guns, but you can’t handle yours. Left-wing celebrities never get prosecuted for violating left-wing gun laws. And Hunter Biden won’t be prosecuted either. He won’t even be questioned or investigated.

Hunter Biden Must Be Investigated

It isn’t for lack of probable cause to inquire. Not counting the other times the Biden son has been let off the hook for his scandals, the missing gun incident alone is ripe for investigation and almost assuredly prosecution.

At the center of the story, as reported by Politico, is a gun that Hunter’s girlfriend Hallie, the wife of the late Beau Biden, found when she was rifling through Hunter’s truck because she was suspicious of him. She took the gun and dumped it into a trash can behind a grocery store, which was across from a high school — completely reckless behavior.

According to a firearm transaction record obtained by The Federalist, Hunter had purchased that gun, a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver with a talo finish, after replying “no” to a question on an ATF transaction form inquiring whether he was the “unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.” The Federalist also obtained a copy of that form, which can be viewed here.

Hunter’s track record of drug abuse, however, is well established. Not only did his drug habit contribute to his marriage falling apart, his discharge from the military, and a handful of stints in rehab, but Hunter was also suspected of smoking crack cocaine in the VIP room of a strip club he frequented.

“There was a smell of burning Styrofoam in the VIP room. We told him nothing illegal can go on here,” the club’s managing partner told Page Six. “We didn’t see anything illegal. After he was spoken to, the smell stopped.”

“VIP employees suspected it was crack,” he added.

While the club typically required customers to pay with credit cards that matched official IDs, the managing partner said, “Hunter was a bit of an exception” and would pay “thousands and thousands of dollars in the Archibald’s VIP rooms” with “credit cards that didn’t have his name on it.”

This occurred in “late 2018” — and the firearm purchase? That occurred on Oct. 12, 2018, which would be “late 2018.”

In a text allegedly sent by Hunter, he essentially acknowledged as much, implying his drug use was an ongoing issue. Hallie “stole the gun out of my truck lock box … because she was scared I would harm myself due to my drug and alcohol problem and our volatile relationship and that she was afraid for the kids,” the message reads.

BREAKING: Text message from Hunter Biden confirms involvement of Secret Service in his illegal firearm incident pic.twitter.com/1vb8GGJidX — AmericaFest Poso (@JackPosobiec) March 26, 2021

The same text exchange corroborated what Politico reported: that Secret Service agents got involved. Shortly after police and the FBI — which was also looking into Hunter for potential tax crimes in an investigation that is still ongoing — arrived at the grocery store where the gun had been dumped but then had disappeared when Hallie went back to retrieve it, two Secret Service agents reportedly paid a visit to the gun store where Hunter had bought the firearm earlier that month. According to Politico’s sources, they had “badges and identification cards” and told the owner to turn over the Firearms Transaction Record from the purchase.

The store owner “suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” according to multiple people with a “firsthand knowledge of the episode.” So he held onto the paperwork until the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the agency authorized to review the forms, could get to them.

Both the Secret Service and the White House denied involvement, but the text says otherwise. Two Republican senators last week sent a letter to the head of Secret Service, demanding answers about the agency’s involvement.

Biden’s ATF Pick Will Be Compromised

President Biden will soon be choosing a nominee to head the ATF, the law enforcement agency within the Department of Justice that issues the background check forms on which Hunter denied drug use. It’s also the same agency that regulates firearm sales, transportation, and possession of firearms and ammo, meaning a director hostile to firearms would not only pose a threat to the Second Amendment, with the full force of the federal government behind him, but the installment of a left-wing director would also result in Hunter Biden off the hook once again, recklessly flouting firearm laws with impunity.

Republican senators have a responsibility here to double down on the Biden son incident when vetting his father’s nominee. Will a potential director commit to using ATF resources to pursue an investigation and subsequent prosecution against a potential felon, no matter his political connections? Republican lawmakers must ask.

Harris bailed out violent leftist rioters, peddled the Jussie Smollett hate crime “MAGA country” hoax, and now wants to make it illegal for people convicted of federal hate crimes to obtain firearms. Will a Biden ATF pick use government resources to disproportionately target conservatives while turning a blind eye to Biden family scandals?

We know how President Biden likes to handle prosecutors and family business. He once bragged about bribing Ukraine to fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma, where Hunter was raking in $50,000 per month to sit on its board.

The ATF and other federal law enforcers must confirm whether Hunter lied on a federal form to get his hands on a gun. They must unearth the names of the Secret Service agents who may have abused their power to try to collect the form in question and thus clean up the messes of the Biden family.

That we don’t have answers to these questions — and that left-wing gun hawks aren’t even beginning to ask them — is unacceptable. Anyone Biden appoints to head the ATF will be compromised.

No more freebies for the Biden family. No more free passes for leftists like Shannon Watts to spew rhetoric that seeks to deny fundamental freedoms to law-abiding Americans while remaining utterly mum about gun malfeasance within their own ranks. It’s time to investigate Hunter Biden for breaking gun laws, and powerful left-wing gun-control activists should say so.

Biden Slams US As 'International Embarrassment' In Gun-Control Speech,"President Joe Biden announced on Thursday that he is issuing multiple executive orders to combat what he called a “public health crisis” and “international embarrassment” of gun violence in the United States.

Among Biden’s executive actions are directives for the Department of Justice to “stop the proliferation of ‘ghost gun’” building kits within 30 days by subjecting those who purchase them to regular firearm procedures such as background checks and serial numbers on the guns. Biden also gave the Justice Department 60 days to reclassifying pistols with stabilizing braces as short-barreled rifles and cited the recent shooting in Boulder, Colorado, as one example of how the braces could be abused to harm people. He also asked the department to publish an “annual report on firearms trafficking and annual updates necessary to give policymakers the information they need to help address firearms trafficking today.”

Other actions Biden suggested include publicizing model “red flag” legislation for states and Congress to evaluate implementing to “allow family members or law enforcement to petition for a court order temporarily barring people in crisis from accessing firearms if they present a danger to themselves or others.” Similarly, Biden recommended multiple federal agencies invest and engage in “evidence-based community violence interventions” around the nation funded by the president’s proposed “American Jobs Plan.”

During his announcement of the new gun regulations, Biden claimed he does not intend to infringe on anyone’s Second Amendment rights but warned that “no amendment to the Constitution is absolute.”

“You can’t yell ‘fire’ in a crowded movie theater and call it freedom of speech,” he said.

In addition to making false claims that buying a firearm at a gun show does not require a background check, Biden also called for a ban on high-capacity magazines and said that if he could pick one item to implement from his reform list, it would be allowing gun manufacturers to be sued.

“The idea that we have so many people dying every single day from gun violence in America is a blemish on our character as a nation,” Biden said.

Vice President Kamala Harris also weighed in, claiming these proposed actions are “reasonable” and need to be passed by Congress.

“I have fought my entire career to end this violence and to pass reasonable gun safety laws. Time and again, as progress has stalled, we have all asked — what are we waiting for? Because we aren’t waiting for a tragedy. I know that,” Harris said.

Biden also announced his intent to name David Chipman, an anti-gun group adviser, to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), where he used to work as a special agent. Shortly before his nomination, Chipman locked his Twitter account, most likely in an effort to prevent journalists and others from discovering any politically charged tweets that sank previous Biden nominees.

Biden ATF Pick Mocked Americans Buying Guns During Mass Lockdowns,"President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) made fun of first-time gun owners who bought up weapons during mass government lockdowns as cartoon doomsday preppers.

During an interview with Cheddar in April last year, gun control activist David Chipman, who was nominated Thursday to the executive post at ATF, said those purchasing firearms put “themselves and their families and danger.” Chipman also compared them to Joe Exotic, the Oklahoma zookeeper profiled on Netflix’s “Tiger King.”

“Most of the new buyers who went out to the gun store and bought a gun have no training whatsoever,” Chipman said. “In their mind they might be competent, they might think they’re die-hard and ready to go, but unfortunately they’re more like Tiger King.”

Biden’s pick to lead the ATF suggested that increased gun sales were due to a fear of zombies pic.twitter.com/gMmBg03HO5 — Jewish Deplorable (@TrumpJew2) April 8, 2021

Chipman’s recommendation as a longtime government bureaucrat who served 25 years at ATF was for new gun owners to “secure that gun locked and unloaded and hide it behind the cans of tuna and beef jerky that you’ve stored in the cabinet, and only bring that out if the zombies start to appear.”

The administration’s latest nominee to the bureau tasked with enforcing the nation’s gun laws comes with a long resume of aggressive activism for stricter restrictions on Americans’ Second Amendment rights. After two and a half decades in the ATF, Chipman worked as an adviser to the anti-gun group launched by former Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords after she was shot in a 2011 Tucson shooting.

After the news broke of Chipman’s impending nomination on Wednesday, Chipman took cues from past nominees in the Biden administration and locked his Twitter account to prevent anyone from searching his prior posts.

https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/1379901074593701889?s=20

Biden made the nomination in a Thursday press conference in which the Democrat launched a new effort to implement stricter gun control in the aftermath of deadly shootings in Georgia and Colorado last month. Biden called gun violence in America an “epidemic” and an “international embarrassment” at the White House.

At the afternoon event, Biden employed doomsday language to raise hysteria around firearms with terms such as “ghost guns” to warn Americans of rampant gun violence, which, in Biden’s eyes, can only be deterred through government restrictions on the firearms — as if criminals followed the law.

Biden's ATF Pick Refuses To Say If Hunter Biden Should Be Prosecuted For Illegal Gun Purchase,"David Chipman, Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, refused to say during a Senate Judiciary hearing on Wednesday whether Hunter Biden should be prosecuted for an illegal firearms purchase in 2018.

According to a March report by Politico, subsequent reporting by The Federalist, and Hunter Biden’s own memoir, the president’s son appears to have lied about his drug use on an ATF form, a felony that earlier in the hearing Chipman had considered a serious crime. When Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, specifically asked the ATF nominee about the Biden son’s gun purchase, however, Chipman evaded the question.

“Mr. Chipman, you testified to Sen. Lee that is it a serious felony to lie on a background check application, and I agree,” Cotton said. “The ATF form 4473 asks, are you an unlawful user of or addicted to any drug or uncontrolled [sic] substance. If an applicant checks yes, they cannot purchase a firearm.”

The senator continued, recounting the events that transpired around the Hunter Biden gun scandal, saying:

On March 25, Politico reported that Hunter Biden, President Biden’s son, applied for a handgun that was later thrown in the trash and had to be recovered by Secret Service agents in 2018. Politico reported that Hunter Biden completed this background check and answered no to the question of whether he was an unlawful user of or addicted to any drug. Hunter Biden has since published a book and gone on a nationwide book tour conducting numerous interviews stating that he was in fact very much addicted to drugs at the same time that he purchased this firearm. This would mean that by his own admission, hunter Biden lied on that form and, by your earlier testimony, committed a serious felony. Should Hunter Biden be prosecuted for breaking this law?”

“If I’m confirmed as ATF director, it will be my responsibility to enforce all federal laws without political favor,” Chipman said without specifically addressing the Biden question. “I do not know any factors in this particular case, but I am familiar with the press account of it.”

Because the Biden gun fiasco happened in 2018 and the statute of limitations is only five years, Cotton said, “This should be a fairly easy case to investigate.”

“Can I get your commitment that if you’re confirmed, you will in fact look into this matter and refer it for prosecution if you find that Hunter Biden violated a law?” Cotton pressed Chipman.

“Senator, what I will assure you is that if ATF director, I will ensure that all violations of law are investigated and referred,” Chipman replied, again evading the Hunter Biden inquiry. “I’m not sure that it has not been investigated.”

The incident to which Cotton referred to was first reported by Politico and involves a gun that Hunter’s girlfriend Hallie, the wife of his late brother Beau Biden, found when she was rifling through Hunter’s truck on ill-defined “suspicions she had,” according to a Delaware police report. She dumped the firearm into a trash can behind a grocery store, which was across from a high school.

According to a firearm transaction record obtained by The Federalist, the Biden son had purchased that gun, a Colt Cobra .38 Special revolver with a talo finish, after replying “no” to a question on an ATF transaction form inquiring whether he was the “unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.”

[READ: The Gun Background Check Form Where Hunter Biden Claimed He Wasn’t Using Drugs]

Hunter’s history of drug abuse is well established. His drug habit contributed to his failed marriage, discharge from the military, and several stints in rehab. Hunter was also suspected of smoking crack cocaine in the VIP room of a strip club he frequented, an incident that occurred in “late 2018.” Hunter purchased the handgun on Oct. 12, 2018, which would be “late 2018.”

In a text allegedly sent by Hunter, he essentially acknowledged as much, implying his drug use was an ongoing issue. Hallie “stole the gun out of my truck lock box … because she was scared I would harm myself due to my drug and alcohol problem and our volatile relationship and that she was afraid for the kids,” the message reads.

BREAKING: Text message from Hunter Biden confirms involvement of Secret Service in his illegal firearm incident pic.twitter.com/1vb8GGJidX — AmericaFest Poso (@JackPosobiec) March 26, 2021

The same text exchange also corroborated Politico’s reporting of Secret Service agents’ involvement, although both the Secret Service and the White House have denied that. Shortly after police and the FBI arrived at the grocery store where the gun had been dumped, two Secret Service agents reportedly visited the gun store where Hunter had bought the firearm earlier that month. They had “badges and identification cards,” according to Politico’s sources, and told the owner to turn over the Firearms Transaction Record from the purchase.

The store owner held onto the form until the ATF could review it because he “suspected that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” according to multiple people with a “firsthand knowledge of the episode.”

Despite Chipman’s unwillingness to commit to investigating and prosecuting the son of the president who nominated him to the ATF post, the nominee is enamored by sweeping gun control proposals, being a policy adviser for the anti-gun group Giffords and supporting a ban on “assault weapons,” an undefined category of firearms and a left-wing talking point. During his Senate testimony, Chipman affirmed his belief that some of America’s most popular semiautomatic modern sporting rifles should be banned outright.

“The AR-15 is one of if not the most popular rifle in America. It’s not a machine gun, it’s a rifle,” said Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas during the hearing. “Your public position is that you want to ban AR-15s, is that correct?”

“With respect to the AR-15, I support a ban as has been presented in a Senate bill and supported by the president,” Chipman said. “The AR-15 is a gun I was issued on ATF’s SWAT team, and it’s a particularly lethal weapon. And regulating it, as other particularly lethal weapons, I have advocated for.”

During the Senate hearing, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said that confirming Biden’s ATF pick would be “like putting a tobacco executive in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, or Antifa in charge of the Portland Police Department.” Twenty Republican attorneys general sent a letter to U.S. Senate leaders on Tuesday, asking the lawmakers to pass on confirming Chipman due to his history of anti-gun activism.

“If the facts are as clear-cut as they appear to be based on Mr. Biden’s own admission, I would expect to see criminal charges forthcoming,” Cotton said after questioning Chipman. “But I would say that when a case is as high-profile as this, if there is not an answer for the American people and public, it severely undermines the confidence in our gun laws, as well as the ATF and the Department of Justice, if there are not criminal consequences.”

How Biden’s Pick For ATF Director Is Helping Gun Sales Skyrocket,"The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) may get David Chipman as its first full-time director in seven years, pending Senate confirmation.

Chipman served 25 years as an ATF agent, monitoring firearms trafficking between Virginia and New York. Following his time at the ATF, he worked for two anti-Second Amendment groups—Everytown for Gun Safety, Mike Bloomberg’s lobbying group, and Giffords, an advocacy group founded by Gabby Giffords.

The Biden administration nominated Chipman to direct the ATF not because of his experience in law enforcement, but for his political lobbying. During his time as a lobbyist, Chipman fought for handgun licensing and registration, universal background checks, and a ban on modern sporting rifles.

Chipman’s qualifications aren’t his achievements in law enforcement. They’re his zeal for attacking the Second Amendment and ridiculing gun-owning Americans.

The Biden administration is looking to radically remake America, and this includes an unprecedented assault on the Second Amendment and law-abiding gun owners. Chipman holds several fringe views on the Second Amendment, such as his belief that the National Firearms Act can be used to regulate and effectively ban all semi-automatic rifles.

Chipman holds other bizarre beliefs that include outright fabrications. During a Reddit AMA (ask me anything), Chipman stated: “At Waco, cult members used 2.5 caliber Barretts to shoot down two Texas Air National Guard helicopters.”

This is false. There is evidence from investigations following the Waco Siege that prove, although the helicopters were fired at, no helicopter was shot down.

All of this should be very troubling to gun owners and Second Amendment advocates. However, there is an ironic layer to the impending circus of Chipman’s confirmation hearing. Much like Barack Obama, Chipman might be the biggest gun salesman in the world today.

If you’ve been to the gun store lately, you know how difficult it is to purchase a gun—any gun, let alone the specific one you walked in the door for. Gun sales soared throughout 2020. The initial spike in sales began with the COVID-19 outbreak, continued through a summer of left-wing rioting, and kept pace when the rash of anti-Asian hate crimes hit. The perpetrators of these crimes have now handed the baton to Chipman as gun sales continue to rise through 2021.

It is far from a foregone conclusion that Chipman will be confirmed by the Senate later this month. That would require a simple majority vote, and some say his “absolute ceiling” is 51 or 52 yes votes. Certainly, a lot of hard horse trading will be needed to get him to that point. Democrats representing gun-friendly states like West Virginia, Arizona, and Montana will have to carefully consider the effect that voting to confirm Chipman will have on their electoral prospects.

To the gun market, perception is reality. The COVID-19 outbreak didn’t actually turn America into “Mad Max,” and you’re more likely to get hit by lightning than become the victim of a hate crime. What matters is that people were, rightly or wrongly, scared of these things happening and took the opportunity to arm themselves, anticipating the potential for worse. Similarly, while Chipman still has a number of hurdles to become the first full-time ATF director in seven years, people are rightly afraid of what he will do to their guns if he is confirmed.

Americans who otherwise might have let their desire to own an AR-15 or interest in building an 80 percent lower go another week, month, or year in more normal times are instead doing anything they can to get their hands on one before Commissar Chipman lowers the boom and begins the process of registration and confiscation without legislative authority.

While there is value in an armed American population, perhaps we can do better than a well-regulated militia composed of men who panic purchased AR-15s and 80 percent lowers out of fear that the new ATF director is going to make their family home the next Waco.

For many on the left, Waco and Ruby Ridge aren’t shameful episodes in the history of federal law enforcement in America. They’re a good start toward disarming and cowing the American population into submission. To them, leaving the citizenry armed with six-shot revolvers and single-shot bolt-action rifles is a necessary step toward steamrolling the American public into everything else on the far-left agenda of Big Banks, Big Media, and Big Tech.

Guns aren’t the core issue at all. The left’s real issue with an armed population is it presents a constant specter of resistance and revolt. It is no mistake that the United Kingdom, a place where one must present ID to purchase a kitchen knife, has been turned into a prison island by its nominally “conservative” government. This is a country where preteen girls are raped and pimped out on an industrial scale by Muslim grooming gangs and elderly preachers are jailed for the crime of preaching the gospel.

This is what the Biden administration and its foot soldiers want for this country. You are not fellow countrymen with differing views of the Good, but evil obstacles preventing them from realizing heaven on earth—a “heaven” far more closely resembling the hell of a Brazilian favela or a Hieronymus Bosch painting than any Christian conception of paradise.

But first, they have to take your guns. To do that, they must confirm Chipman, whose primary qualification for public office is not his relatively undistinguished record in law enforcement, but his willingness to disarm his fellow Americans. It is no wonder that Americans are taking to the nearest gun store to buy whatever they can get their hands on in advance of a figure like this taking the oath of office.

Republican AGs Call On Biden To Reject Anti-Gun ATF Nominee,"Twenty Republican attorneys general sent a letter to U.S. Senate leaders Tuesday urging the lawmakers not to confirm President Joe Biden’s pick to head up the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The attorneys note ATF director nominee David Chipman has a history of anti-gun rights lobbying and activism that contradicts a position aimed at upholding public safety and Second Amendment rights.

“Mr. Chipman has a First Amendment right as a private citizen to work for these political organizations and to lobby for the taxation, registration, and even confiscation of firearms,” the letter states. “Americans likewise have the Second Amendment to protect their God-given rights to keep and bear arms. Accordingly, we ask you to oppose Mr. Chipman’s confirmation to this important position and demand President Biden nominate someone who is not hostile to our rights and way of life.”

Led by Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, the leaders note Chipman worked as a senior policy advisor for a major gun-control organization. The group, Giffords Law Center, bills itself as “fighting to end the gun lobby’s stranglehold on our political system.” It seeks universal background checks, a known precursor to a national gun registration system that could ultimately enable gun confiscation.

“He has spent the last five years as a senior policy advisor for the Giffords Law Center,” the letter on the nominee continues. “This radical group attempted to defend Washington, D.C.’s complete ban on the possession of handguns in the home at the U.S. Supreme Court. This organization argued that ‘nothing in the Second Amendment restrains the authority of States or their political subdivisions’ when enacting firearm regulations. This extreme position would allow politicians to run roughshod over the rights of their citizens.”

The president nominated Chipman in April, saying Chipman is “the right person” for the job. The lobbyist served at ATF for 25 years and is known for erroneously claiming the Branch Davidians gunned down government helicopters during the Waco, Texas siege of 1993.

Chipman called for an “assault weapons” ban during a 2019 House Judiciary Committee hearing. Every weapon is a potential “assault weapon.” His employer also opposes large-capacity magazines. The group claims open and conceal-carry licenses are “dangers to public safety.” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who has been a major gun control backer, said that the nominee “is exactly what the ATF needs.”

The signees hail from the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Montana.

“As chief law enforcement or legal officers in our respective states, we are concerned that Mr. Chipman will make Americans less safe by diverting ATF resources to attack the rights of law-abiding gun owners instead of cracking down on violent criminals and criminal organizations,” the letter states.

On the contrary, 17 Democrat attorneys general sent a letter to the Senate last week calling on Biden to confirm Chipman. Biden’s pick will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/26/republican-ags-call-on-biden-to-reject-anti-gun-atf-nominee-ahead-of-hearing/,2021-05-26
USA Today Prepares Fact-Challenged Attack On Gun Industry,"USA Today is working with an anti-gun group funded by failed Democrat presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg to attack a major gun industry trade group ahead of a Wednesday Senate hearing for President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), The Federalist has learned.

Nick Penzenstadler, a USA Today reporter who has partnered with Bloomberg’s anti-gun publication The Trace, has peppered the National Shooting Sports Foundation with loaded questions and factually inaccurate assumptions about NSSF’s work, according to correspondence reviewed by The Federalist. NSSF is a Connecticut-based gun industry trade group that helps members navigate and comply with federal firearms laws and ATF rules and regulations.

The apparent premise of the still-in-progress USA Today attack is that NSSF, which works directly with ATF to advise federal firearms licensees (FFLs) on how to comply with the agency’s regulations, has never worked to help the ATF obtain the resources it needs to ensure compliance from gun manufacturers or dealers.

To support its narrative, USA Today interviewed Richard Marianos, a former ATF official who allegedly claimed NSSF had never sought additional resources for ATF.

“[Marianos] says, in short: The NSSF is like the [National Rifle Association], [NSSF] never once has said the ATF needs more money, help support, or resources,” Penzenstadler claimed in correspondence reviewed by The Federalist.

The notion that ATF doesn’t have the funding it needs to conduct its compliance operations could become a major theme of the Senate confirmation hearing for David Chipman to be director of the ATF. Chipman, a controversial anti-gun activist who works for an anti-gun group founded by the wife of Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, was nominated by Biden in early April to helm an agency that has not had a full director since 2006, when Congress passed a law requiring the position to be subject to Senate confirmation.

An examination of NSSF’s appropriations request history as well as interviews with former top ATF officials, however, directly contradicts the narrative being manufactured by USA Today and the Bloomberg-funded The Trace. Mike Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor and former acting director of ATF from 2006 to 2009, told The Federalist that Marianos’s claim, as characterized by Penzenstadler, was not true.

“My experience was the complete opposite of what Marianos is suggesting,” Sullivan said. “NSSF regularly lobbied Congress on its own about the need for additional ATF resources.”

“NSSF never once worked against an ATF budget,” Sullivan continued. “They never stood in the way of ATF’s requests for additional funding.”

Sullivan said he viewed NSSF as a partner in ATF’s mission of enforcing firearms laws throughout the country. He cited NSSF’s work in streamlining electronic forms that are used to conduct background checks on gun buyers so the forms would be more accurate and less prone to clerical errors, freeing up ATF resources for more important investigations. Sullivan also cited NSSF’s “Don’t Lie For The Other Guy” program to help reduce so-called straw purchases, in which individuals who can pass a background check illegally purchase weapons on behalf of individuals who are legally prohibited from purchasing or possessing guns.

“Through that program, NSSF and its industry members were key allies in the fight to crack down on straw purchases, especially along the Southwest border,” Sullivan said. “They were a valued partner who absolutely enhanced safety and helped ATF meet its mission obligations.”

Harry McCabe, who worked at the ATF for more than 35 years and served as the ATF’s deputy assistant director for industry operations until 2012, told The Federalist that he also viewed NSSF as an ally of the ATF, not an enemy.

“We didn’t agree on every policy issue,” McCabe, who now works as an independent legal compliance consultant for the gun industry, told The Federalist, “but when it came to legal compliance, NSSF was always an ally.”

“When I worked at the ATF managing inspections and compliance, NSSF and the ATF had the same goal: we wanted gun dealers to understand the law and comply with it.”

Records reviewed by The Federalist also contradict claims by Marianos and USA Today that NSSF never sought funding for the ATF or other law enforcement operations related to firearms law. Last month, for example, NSSF submitted an appropriations request to Congress for an additional $10 million for investigative support services for ATF for the 2022 fiscal year.

“Request is to provide an increase of $10,000,000 above the Fiscal Year 2021 appropriation to support necessary funding for ATF Industry Support Services,” NSSF wrote in a formal request to a bipartisan group of dozens of senators and members of Congress. In its request, NSSF even cited the significant growth of the firearms industry as more and more Americans purchase guns to defend themselves and their families as a reason the ATF needed additional resources.

NSSF similarly requested an ATF funding increase of $3.2 million in fiscal year 2019 for investigative support services, records show, contradicting claims that NSSF does nothing to support compliance with firearms laws in the United States. For fiscal year 2018, NSSF requested an additional $50 million in ATF funding, according to congressional appropriations requests reviewed by The Federalist.

The Connecticut-based firearms industry trade group did not limit its funding requests to just the ATF. The group also repeatedly sought additional funding for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, which is administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and used by all gun dealers and FFLs to process background checks before selling or transferring guns to private individuals.

“The request would ensure that additional funds requested by the Department of Justice are prioritized to increase the capacity to perform the statutorily required National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) background checks for firearm purchases,” NSSF wrote in a fiscal year 2019 appropriations request to more than one dozen lawmakers. “Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) rely on NICS to be effective to ensure the lawful transfer of firearms to law-abiding citizens.”

“The agency has consistently requested more funding and staff positions, which Congress has been responsive to, but critical shortages remain,” NSSF noted in its request for additional NICS funding. “The only way to ensure that firearms stay out of the wrong hands is background checks being run against a complete system with adequate personnel. This funding will increase the effectiveness of the NICS system benefiting the lawful commerce of firearms throughout the country and by helping to prevent prohibited persons from obtaining a firearm.”

USA Today has recently come under fire for peddling fake fact checks and dangerous anti-American propaganda instead of fact-based news.

In 2020, the paper published an absurd fact check claiming the Donald Trump campaign’s depiction on a T-shirt of a bald eagle — a creature that has appeared on the seal of the United States for more than 200 years, long predating the Nazis — was actually a Nazi symbol.

“The claims that a Trump campaign T-shirt has come under criticism for using a symbol similar to a Nazi eagle is TRUE,” the paper declared.

USA Today has also partnered with Big Tech to censor and deplatform news that is inconvenient to China or the Democrat Party. In 2020, the company colluded with Facebook to censor documented and factually accurate reports that a Joe Biden COVID-19 advisor said Americans 75 years of age or older should not have priority vaccine access since they are closer to death than younger people are.

The free national paper also has a history of refusing to allow facts to get in the way of anti-gun propaganda.

In 2017, USA Today infamously claimed AR-15s are often modified to include chainsaw bayonets, a self-evidently ludicrous claim to anyone who knows anything about AR-15s or chainsaws. After getting dragged on Twitter for its fact-free fear-mongering about non-existent firearm accessories, the publication was forced to admit that an AR-15 with a chainsaw bayonet was not used in a 2017 mass shooting that was actually ended by a private citizen who was carrying an AR-15.

Earlier this month, a top editor at the paper published a column claiming that Republicans who voted to remove Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, from Republican leadership in the U.S. House were more dangerous than the al-Qaeda terrorists who attacked the United States and killed thousands of Americans on September 11, 2001.

Republicans: 'Alarming Ignorance' Disqualifies Biden's Anti-Gun ATF Pick,"President Joe Biden’s pick to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has resulted in Republican blowback. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida told The Federalist that David Chipman is unfit to serve in a role concerned with public safety and Second Amendment rights.

“During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Chipman demonstrated an alarming ignorance of the very guns he wants to ban, and showed a clear anti-gun bias, both of which are disqualifying attributes for the important position of ATF director,” Scalise said. “Sadly, this is not the first Biden administration nominee who lacks a basic comprehension of the agency they have been nominated to oversee.”

Donalds sees Chipman as yet another Biden nominee who is attempting to impose left-wing policies on the country.

“Like many of President Biden’s other nominees, David Chipman is another pawn that answers not to the country as a whole but the most liberal wing of the Democrat Party, the anti-gun lobby,” Donalds said. “We need a director of the ATF that follows facts, not liberal talking points, and preserves the Constitutional rights of every law-abiding American to keep and bear arms. Mr. Chipman is no better than Beto O’Rourke, who said very clear the intentions of the left, ‘Hell yeah, we’re going to take your AR-15.’ Democrats seem to forget that they need to listen to the Constitution, not the gun lobby.”

Chipman sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a hearing on Wednesday and voiced his support for an AR-15 ban in an exchange with Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. He also refused to say whether Joe Biden’s son Hunter ought to be prosecuted for his illegal 2018 gun purchase.

Biden's ATF Pick Refuses To Say If Hunter Biden Should Be Prosecuted For Illegal Gun Purchase @FDRLST https://t.co/COA0HdjkiP — Kylee Zempel (@kyleezempel) May 26, 2021

The National Rifle Association also opposes Chipman’s nomination. “Yesterday’s frightening hearing proves how hostile gun control lobbyist David Chipman is to the rights of American gun owners,” NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter told The Federalist. “Not only did he double down on a ban of America’s most popular rifle, but he also supports forcing Americans to register their already owned firearms. The NRA is vigorously fighting his confirmation.”

In 2019, Chipman said in a House Judiciary Committee hearing that there should be an “assault weapons” ban. Biden’s pick was also a lobbyist for Giffords, a gun-control group co-founded by former Arizona Democrat Rep. Gabby Giffords. From 2012 to 2013, he worked for Everytown for Gun Safety, another gun-control group that is funded by billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Chipman is well-known for being a case agent in the 1993 Branch Davidian compound siege in Waco, Texas, which resulted in the deaths of 82 people.

Biden nominated the former lobbyist in April, claiming he is “the right person” for the ATF position. Prior to Wednesday’s hearing, 20 Republican attorneys general penned a letter to the U.S. Senate urging lawmakers to reject Chipman. The attorneys, led by Montana’s Austin Knudsen, argued Chipman will be intent on “diverting ATF resources to attack the rights of law-abiding gun owners instead of cracking down on violent criminals and criminal organizations.”

“The ATF director should both understand the Second Amendment and the firearms industry, but also be able to relate to the millions of Americans who lawfully exercise their Constitutional rights on a daily basis,” Scalise said. “Mr. Chipman has shown that he doesn’t respect these Americans, nor did he display the most basic understanding of our nation’s firearms laws. His list of disqualifications is long, but any nominee who calls for banning commonly-purchased firearms and implementing national firearm registries should not serve as ATF Director.”

Chipman’s appointment would make him the second permanent director of the ATF since the Senate ruled 15 years ago it was subject to confirmation. If 50 Democrats support his nomination, Vice President Kamala Harris could be the tie-breaking vote in the affirmative.

“But most importantly, his prior statements expressing disdain for America’s gun owners should be enough to prevent his confirmation as the head of the agency responsible for enforcing the nation’s gun laws,” Scalise added.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/27/house-republicans-say-bidens-atf-pick-should-be-disqualified-for-alarming-ignorance-and-anti-gun-bias/,2021-05-27
Don’t Believe Leftist Lies About Judge’s End To California’s Gun Ban,"On Friday, a federal judge struck down California’s assault weapon ban in Miller v. Bonta. In the nearly 100-page opinion, District Court Judge Roger Benitez dissected post-Heller Second Amendment jurisdiction, while scrutinizing the state’s claimed justification for banning ownership of so-called “assault weapons,” before enjoining enforcement of several sections of California’s Assault Weapons Control Act (AWCA). Yet for 30 days Judge Benitez also stayed the execution of the declaratory judgment and permanent injunction to allow the named defendant, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, to appeal.

In striking down California’s “assault weapon” ban, which criminalizes the possession of various semi-automatic weapons based on their appearance, features, or ability to hold a magazine with more than 10 rounds of ammunition, Judge Benitez conducted a thorough review of controlling Second Amendment precedent and analyzed the hefty evidentiary record. He began with Heller, in which the Supreme Court noted the Second Amendment’s guarantee of the right to bear arms extends to firearms commonly owned by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, as opposed to weapons predominately used only in military settings.

Judges Ignoring Supreme Court Gun Protections

The Heller test, Judge Benitez noted, is a “hardware test,” but since Heller, the federal appellate courts have ignored this simple holding and created an array of various standards under which to judge the constitutionality of laws regulating firearms. Before applying the two-prong test the Ninth Circuit invented, though, Judge Benitez laid out how California’s law would fare under a straightforward application of Heller. In the process, he revealed some statistics of which most Americans are likely ignorant.

“Modern rifles have become immensely popular in the United States. Even in California, despite being banned for 20 to 30 years, according to the State’s own evidence, there are 185,569 ‘assault weapons’ currently registered with California,” with another 50,000-plus assault weapon registrations backlogged. Nationally, while possession of an “assault weapon”—rebranded “modern rifles” in the opinion to separate the emotive response from the rationale—is legal in all but six states, “modern rifles are ubiquitous.”

“In 2018 alone (the most recent year with data), 1,954,000 modern rifles were manufactured or imported into the United States,” the statistics show, while “[o]ver the last three decades, 19,797,000 modern rifles have been manufactured or imported into the United States and the numbers have been steadily increasing,” and [a]lmost one-half of all rifles (48%) produced in 2018 were modern rifles.” Benitez provided more details before crystalizing his point by noting that in 2018, more than twice as many modern rifles were sold than Ford F-150s.

Even By Ninth Circuit Rules, a Ban Is Unconstitutional

Under the Heller test, this record establishes the unconstitutionality of the ban on assault weapons, Benitez concluded. However, being bound by Ninth Circuit precedent, Benitez continued to consider the constitutionality of California’s law under that appellate court’s two-prong test. In his analysis, Benitez bypassed the strict scrutiny standard, noting in passing the law would fail that test as well, to apply the “intermediate scrutiny standard” created by the Ninth Circuit.

Under that standard, a law affecting the right to bear arms is constitutional if the government proffers an “important” governmental purpose, and its “fit” of the law to the objective is reasonable. “As always, the State’s objective with these laws (i.e., to reduce gun crime) passes the first prong of the test,” Judge Benitez wrote, noting that reducing gun crime is a very important objective. But after a detailed analysis, the court concluded California’s assault-weapon ban lacked a reasonable “fit” to that goal.

Benitez observed “the ‘assault weapon’ epithet is a bit of a misnomer. These prohibited guns, like all guns, are dangerous weapons. However, these prohibited guns, like all guns, can be used for ill or for good. They could just as well be called ‘home defense rifles’ or ‘anti-crime guns.’” He added that in criminalizing certain firearm features, California branded as “assault weapons” “certain shotguns and pistols, and (recently) guns that are neither rifles, nor shotguns, nor pistols.”

He also stressed initially that that since 1989, when California first passed its Assault Weapons Control Act, the understanding of the Second Amendment has changed substantially. At that time, the California legislature focused on a firearm’s value only “for sports and recreation,” but as the Supreme Court in Heller and McDonald made clear, “individual self-defense is ‘the central component’ of the Second Amendment right.”

Thus, in adopting the ban on “assault weapons,” “the California Legislature neither mentioned a modern rifle as a means of self-defense, nor did the core Second Amendment right appear to have been any part of its consideration. The formal legislative findings say nothing about self-defense.”

Ignoring the Protective Uses of Guns

California’s continuing lack of respect for an individual’s right to self-defense resounded throughout the arguments the state attorney general made in the district court. In arguing for the constitutionality of the ban, Bonta ignored the countervailing interest of law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and their families. Instead, the state portrayed the assault weapons ban as a panacea to mass shootings. Since “assault weapons” are so accurate and allow for the discharge of multiple bullets, they prove ideal for mass shootings, the state argued.

But this rationale, Judge Benitez established in his opinion, ignores that, “in the self-defense context, which seems to be more common, taking accurate shots at attackers is vitally important for the innocent victim.” Thus, “[w]hile the state ought to protect its residents against victimization by a mass shooter, it ought also to protect its residents against victimization by home-invading criminals,” the district court judge stressed.

California, however, seems to view armed citizens defending themselves differently than the Founders did, with Benitez noting that “the State’s litigation stance is more like the view recently expressed by a police chief in Oakland, California: we do not want victims to arm themselves; we want them to be good witnesses.” “Of course, a dead victim is a lousy witness,” he added.

Yet, as Benitez detailed in his opinion, “there is clear evidence that AR-15 rifles are and have been used for self-defense.”

For example, in one case an AR-15 was used in Florida by a pregnant wife and mother to defend her family from two armed, hooded, and masked home intruders. As soon as the armed intruders entered the back door of her home, they pistol-whipped her husband — fracturing his eye socket and sinus cavity. Then they grabbed the 11-year-old daughter. Before they could do any more harm, the pregnant wife retrieved the family AR-15 from a bedroom and fired, killing one of the attackers while the other fled. It does not require much imagination to guess what would have happened next if the wife and mother did not have the firearm, or if she had emptied the AR-15’s magazine before the attackers had fled.

Benitez also found the evidence failed to support the state’s purported rationale, because “a less accurate rifle in the hands of a mass shooter may very well result in different victims, but not necessarily fewer victims.” Also, contrary to the California legislature’s prediction in 1989 that “an assault weapons ban would eliminate or reduce mass shootings[,] it has not turned out that way.” Instead, “mass shootings with assault weapons continue to occur at the same average rate as before the ban.”

Guns Don’t Cause Crime; Criminals Do

In fact, as Judge Benitez exposed, the California attorney general’s assertion “that modern rifles are disproportionally used in crime” is not supported by the evidence. On the contrary, at the time the Supreme Court handed down the landmark Second Amendment decisions, “81% of firearm-homicide victims were killed by handgun.”

The opinion also eviscerated the studies California relied upon as evidence of the use of assault weapons in mass shootings. For instance, in one study an expert defined a “gun massacre” “as a shooting event resulting in at least six deaths and where at least one assault weapon was discharged.” “The definition,” Benitez explained, “almost creates a tautology along the lines of assault weapons are used disproportionately in assault weapon events.” That study and another, Judge Benitez stressed, wrongly focus on mass shootings, as opposed to crimes in general.

Even then, Benitez found the evidence established that “assault rifles were not the predominant type of weapon used” in mass shootings. “In fact, according to a recent study, handguns were the most used type of firearm in mass shootings (32.99% of mass shootings); rifles were used in only 8.25% of mass shootings.” “That may come as a surprise to the public that is constantly told that assault weapons are often used in mass shootings,” Benitez added.

In short, the court found the prohibited features that under the law “convert” a firearm into an illegal “assault weapon” “do not change an AR-15 rifle from a benign weapon into an ‘incredibly effective killing machine.’” Here, Benitez highlighted a short video entered into evidence in which “two AR-15 type rifles were fired repeatedly and reloaded with a detachable magazine at a target. One rifle had all of the prohibited features prohibited by [California’s law]. The other rifle was a ‘featureless’ California-legal variety of AR-15 rifle. The results were remarkably similar. Each rifle fired at approximately the same speed and accuracy. Any difference was hardly noticeable.”

While the state argued this similarity in performance established the ban did not interfere with the plaintiffs’ Second Amendment rights because they could just purchase the “featureless” AR-15 rifle, in reality this evidence showed the ridiculousness of the California law. The ban on “assault weapons” does nothing but create a false sense that the government cares and can prevent the horrifying scenes of mass shootings.

On the Way to the Supreme Court

Bonta and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have vowed to appeal Benitez’s decision. With the appeal destined for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, reversal seems certain, either by a three-judge panel or later in an en banc hearing before 11 judges of the leftist court. The Ninth Circuit, however, merely serves as the stepping-stone for the ultimate destination of the Miller case: the U.S. Supreme Court.

Although so far the Supreme Court has steadfastly refused to hear appeals from other circuits concerning the constitutionality of “assault weapon” bans, the justices’ hands-off approach to Second Amendment cases has recently changed. For the first time in more than a decade the high court recently agreed to hear a Second Amendment case in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Corlett. That case concerns the constitutionality of New York’s concealed-carry licensing scheme that, in essence, limits the right to keep and bear arms to citizens’ homes.

Getting Miller to the Supreme Court will be equally important, as that case concerns much more than the question of the constitutionality of “assault weapon” bans: It squarely presents an issue dividing the circuit courts, the appropriate standard for reviewing laws that affect Second Amendment rights. Here, Benitez’s 94-page opinion provides a perfect primer for Americans seeking to understand both the law and the fallacies pushed by politicians and the press to justify infringements on Second Amendment rights.

Corporate Press Lies to Help Democrats

Although Benitez’s detailed analysis of Second Amendment jurisprudence should serve as the more important takeaway from Friday’s decision, as coverage of the decision has already shown, when guns are involved, the narrative and public opinion prove key. That same coverage proves a second corollary: When guns are subject, the left-leaning press serves as a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party.

“Federal judge overturns California’s ban on assault weapons and likens AR-15 to Swiss Army knife,” a CNN headline read, parroting Newsom’s talking point. “This judge compared the AR-15 – a weapon of war that’s used on the battlefield – to a Swiss Army Knife [and that comparison] completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who’ve lost loved ones to this weapon,” the embattled California governor said in a press release.

Bonta likewise ignored the depth of the nearly 100-page opinion to intone “there is no sound basis in law, fact, or common sense for equating assault rifles with swiss army knives — especially on Gun Violence Awareness Day and after the recent shootings in our own California communities,” in a news release issued shortly after the opinion dropped.

CNN added to its coverage the statement from activist Fred Guttenberg, who lost his daughter in a shooting in 2018: “My daughter is in a cemetery because a Swiss Army Knife was not used, because it was an AR-15. If a Swiss Army Knife were used, my daughter and most of those other kids and adults would be alive today.”

The Washington Post, USA Today, and virtually every legacy outlet ran the same spin. And spin it was because Judge Benitez’s opener, noting that “like the Swiss Army Knife, the popular AR-15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment,” provided but a simple illustration of a minor point the long-time federal judge made later: that merely because a civilian rifle has characteristics that are useful in the military “does not detract from the constitutional protection afforded for self-defense.”

Bodies Kill More than Guns Do

But instead of delving into Benitez’s reasoning, the corrupt media constructed a Swiss strawman to torch, ignoring both the federal judge’s analysis and the many press-peddled urban legends about “assault weapons” Benitez countered. In fact, most of the media ignore the larger point Benitez made concerning knives, namely that murderers use knives much more often than they do any kind of rifle.

“Federal Bureau of Investigation murder statistics do not track assault rifles, but they do show that killing by knife attack is far more common than murder by any kind of rifle,” Benitez noted. In fact, “[i]n California, murder by knife occurs seven times more often than murder by rifle,” with California seeing 252 people murdered with a knife in 2019, compared to “34 people were killed with some type of rifle – not necessarily an AR-15.” “In 2018,” he continued, “the statistics were even more lopsided as California saw only 24 murders by some type of rifle. The same pattern can be observed across the nation.”

These statistics, and the fact that “a Californian is three times more likely to be murdered by an attacker’s bare hands, fists, or feet, than by his rifle,” Judge Benitez noted, show that “news media and others” who portray our nation as “awash with murderous AR-15 assault rifles,” push hyperbole. Still, “facts matter,” the George W. Bush appointee stressed. But apparently not to Second Amendment deniers who caricatured Benitez’s opinion instead of reporting the facts and the law underlying his ruling.

Hollywood Hypocrites Push Gun Control Activism Bankrolled By Bloomberg,"Some of the biggest TV networks in Hollywood and the larger entertainment industry have partnered to promote a gun-control initiative being financed by billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The effort, called “Wear Orange,” was started by Everytown for Gun Safety, a Bloomberg-backed gun-control group. The organization has been urging President Joe Biden to enact strict gun-control measures and formerly employed David Chipman, Biden’s pick for director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Wear Orange encouraged people to wear the color orange from June 4 to June 6 for both National Gun Violence Awareness Day and Wear Orange Weekend.

WarnerMedia, the multinational conglomerate owned by AT&T, partnered with Everytown in order to “help end gun violence and build safer communities across America.” While virtue-signaling about gun control, the studio has pumped out continuous gun violence scenes in its financed productions, such as in the movie “Joker” or television series “The Sopranos.”

Bad Robot Productions, a company run by Star Wars director J.J. Abrams, is also leaning in on the gun-control initiative. While it purports to care so deeply about ending violence, Abrams’ studio is the brains behind the series “Alias” and the “Mission: Impossible” movies, which include a significant amount of gun violence.

ViacomCBS affiliates Comedy Central and CMT partnered as well. Viacom owns Paramount Pictures, which recently released the film “Without Remorse,” which includes gun violence in a military setting.

MTV and VH1, two other channels involved, continuously put out hip-hop and rap music videos romanticizing illegal guns and killings. Rapper Jay-Z’s “99 Problems” took home MTV honors in 2004, with the song notably declaring, “But ain’t nothin’ sweet ’bout how I hold my gun.”

Despite the already-strict gun restrictions in California, murders have spiked 95 percent in Los Angeles County compared to a year prior. The state has the most gun-control laws in the nation, such as red-flag laws, universal background checks, a ban against K-12 schools letting teachers carry, and a 10-day waiting period.

“Usually people that are going out and killing on the streets are obviously not responsible gun owners,” Julie Haff, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Republican Party, told The Federalist. “Having strict gun control is not going to stop people from going out and killing people on the streets,” Haff continued. “Look at places like Chicago, that’s a good example of strict gun control and they have shootings and killings pretty much every weekend.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/07/hollywood-hypocrites-push-gun-control-activism-bankrolled-by-michael-bloomberg/,2021-06-07
Arizonans Call For Sen. Kelly To Recuse From ATF Vote Over Giffords Ties,"Republicans in the Arizona legislature are gearing up to demand Arizona Democrat U.S Sen. Mark Kelly recuse himself from the confirmation vote for David Chipman, President Biden’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) director nominee, for his leadership ties to a gun-control group where Chipman is a lobbyist.

Rep. Quang Nguyen is leading the legislative effort, The Federalist has learned, and he plans to introduce the proclamation Thursday with the backing of other lawmakers. Nguyen notably raises concerns about Kelly’s ability to vote in an uncompromised manner since Chipman works for Giffords, an anti-gun organization founded by Kelly and his wife Gabby Giffords in 2013.

We “DEMAND U.S. Senator Mark Kelly recuse himself from a confirmation vote,” the proclamation states. “Chipman’s current employment at Giffords, an organization co-founded by Senator Kelly, raises serious ethical questions regarding this vote and presents a clear and credible conflict of interest that puts the constitutional rights of Americans in jeopardy.”

Spokesman Hilton Beckham for Andy Biggs, the Republican congressman from Arizona, told The Federalist Biggs supports the legislature’s effort urging Kelly to recuse himself.

Kelly’s group spent close to $7 million to elect Democrats in 2018 and Kelly individually received $5,706 in funding from Giffords as a 2020 candidate. The Arizona Democrat claimed on his website, “This campaign is about the people of Arizona, not corporate PACs and the mess they’ve created in Washington,” but refused to notify OpenSecrets at the time about what his level of involvement with Giffords would look like in the future.

Chipman is still employed by Giffords. His resume in the congressional record highlights this, as well as his affiliation to Kelly. It specifies Chipman is a “[s]enior advisor to former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and Navy combat veteran and retired NASA astronaut Captain Mark Kelly, co-founders of Giffords” and is “[c]harged with providing firearms policy training to members of Congress, gun violence prevention advocates and other groups impacted by gun violence.”

Chipman also affirmed his current employment while testifying.

“Yes,” the ATF nominee told Republican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. “I am currently employed by Giffords and have remained in contact with my colleagues and other stakeholder groups regarding my nomination. I have met with stakeholder groups, including several law enforcement groups, in connection with my nomination in order to meet their leadership and hear about their interests and concerns.”

Nguyen and other Republicans determine Kelly cannot fairly assess Biden’s ATF nominee given the perceived conflict of interest. The representative, who is also the president of the Arizona State Rifle and Pistol Association, indicated that based on private conversations with House Speaker Russell Bowers and Majority Whip Leo Biasiucci he has their full support.

He does not foresee any Democrats supporting the initiative and noted they will not “even have an understanding of why I’m doing this.”

“I want to make sure that the citizens of Arizona understand that this is a conflict of interest,” Nguyen told The Federalist. “[Kelly] is voting for someone that works for him and his wife’s Giffords Foundation — which is an anti-gun organization — and he is still employed. It is a conflict of interest in my opinion. We should know about it, we should understand it. The other thing I’m really bothered by is that the ATF has a possibility to be run by an anti-gun lobbyist.”

The nomination will head to the Senate Judiciary Committee for a vote Thursday. It will possibly end in a tie given the power-sharing agreement, which means committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., would have to transmit a notice.

Should a “motion to discharge” come about via the leadership of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and be denied, a day will be set for the nomination. Sources familiar with the matter say this could be in July.

In order to be confirmed, Chipman’s nomination will need 51 votes. Vice President Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote if the Senate splits across party lines.

“[T]he founding of the United States did not begin with the federal government, but rather with the states themselves,” the proclamation states. ” …[A]n agency of the federal government should never seek to expand the mission of an administrative state, much less seak to eliminate the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights.”

We “OPPOSE the confirmation of David Chipman as director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives,” the document also states. “Chipman has established by his long career in anti-gun advocacy and lobbying that he is an ideologue for his radical cause and will not serve to uphold the Constitutional rights of Americans while in this office, but rather to erase rights to fit the radical gun control agenda of the groups he still works for and associates with to this day.”

Below is the final draft of the proclamation.

"ATF Nominee’s Record Shows He Despises Americans, The Constitution","Most federal nominees receive rote consideration in the Senate. If the president is of the same party as the Senate majority, nominees are generally easily confirmed.

Only a few nominees ever run into any procedural hurdles. The exception to this rule is, and should be, David Chipman, the current nominee for director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). To understand why, let’s do a quick recap of some pertinent data points.

Self-Defense Is Still an American Keystone

There are tens of millions of AR-15-style rifles in America, amid more than 320 million privately owned firearms. That’s one firearm per person.

Nearly 20 million Americans have a permit to conceal and carry a firearm, a 304 percent increase since 2007. This does not include the 20 constitutional carry states that do not require a permit to carry a firearm. With more firearms in circulation, violent crime has on average gone down.

Firearms are an important part of the American culture. We can use them recreationally; millions of Americans do it daily. But firearms also serve a more important function as personal protection from violent criminals, and, yes, in the extreme, government agents.

After all, the entire point of the Second Amendment is to ensure that individuals have access to private arms in case the people must, after all other recourses have been exhausted, act as a physical check on abusive foreign or domestic powers, including our own domestic government (see: 1776). For the hand-wringers who proclaim that simple rifles are no match for tanks and jets, the last time I checked, the Taliban still controls wide swaths of territory in Afghanistan after 20 years of U.S. military action there.

Clearly, rifles play an important role in our society to ensure human liberty for generations to come. The Founders of this country made sure to codify what the people at large already nearly unanimously acknowledged: the right to keep and bear arms for self-protection is an inalienable right, and no power existed nor was granted to government to infringe on these basic fundamental rights.

This Is the Problem with David Chipman

It is against this background that Chipman’s nomination has naturally become so divisive. This is not just among gun owners but all Americans who are still concerned with the rule of law and America’s foundational principles.

During Chipman’s May 26 Senate hearing on his nomination, he confirmed his radical, anti-gun agenda and revealed himself to be wholly incompetent. Not a single Republican senator left the hearing saying he or she would vote for Chipman, and many Democrat senators used their time to help him clarify his past statements about gun confiscation and his interest in arresting people before they commit crimes.

In questioning with Sen. Tom Cotton, Chipman claimed the ATF defines an assault rifle as any semi-automatic rifle capable of accepting a detachable magazine above the caliber of .22. This would include nearly every one of the 20 million AR-15s in America, and likely most rifles produced within the last 80 years. The M-1 carbine was designed in 1938, for instance.

Chipman also told Sen. Ted Cruz that he supports a total ban of the AR-15. During his exchange with Sen. John Kennedy, Chipman said he was unable to define an assault weapon. Remember, Chipman was a 22-year ATF agent who has lobbied against most citizen-owned firearms.

An Anti-Constitution Activist

When Chipman left the ATF to work for Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords Law Center campaign, he walked away from law enforcement and became a very well-paid anti-constitutional activist. The Giffords campaign, where Chipman works, is dedicated to gun confiscation and still claims “the right to possess a firearm is not based on an individual right of self-defense, but rather related to service in a militia based on the prefatory language in the Amendment.”

This is factually wrong, based on the history and text of the U.S. Constitution. At the time of the Constitution’s drafting, the Founding generation had many public conversations about gun ownership being an individual private right. This position was so unanimous, it was one of the few public positions explaining a portion of the proposed Constitution that faced no recorded opposition. The individual right to possess a firearm was also definitively affirmed in the Supreme Court’s DC v. Heller.

Are Chipman and the Giffords campaign for gun confiscation so blinded by their ideology that they won’t even recognize the plain reading and history of the Constitution as confirmed by the Supreme Court? It would seem so.

Chipman’s failures extend much further than ignoring recent Supreme Court opinions. He lobbied Congress for bills that would require direct registration and licensing for guns, which would massively expand, computerize, and weaponize the already massive ATF gun registry the government currently operates. Americans should know that over the long arc of history, the first step to a violent confiscation of firearms is registration.

Contempt for the People He’s Supposed to Serve

Most Americans have clear differences with the Biden administration’s policies on firearms. But these differences are to be expected.

Americans cannot, however, tolerate a political class that hates the people who put them in power. A political class that dehumanizes and insults the American people cannot ever make decisions that originate in ideas and policy. They will use emotion, bias, and bigotry to dominate “the other.” Americans cannot be subjected to that political class.

Chipman is clearly a member of this political class animated by contempt for the Americans they are supposed to serve. During his career as a well-paid anti-gun lobbyist, Chipman dismissed gun buyers as fearful and preparing “for end times scenarios and zombie apocalypses.”

“If you didn’t think you needed a gun prior to March of [2020], you certainly don’t need to rush out and get one now,” said Chipman. Really? Violent riots engulfed the country at the time, and continued throughout the year. Chipman lacked any sympathy for what Americans were seeing outside their front doors.

He mocked our willingness to protect our loved ones and communities: “[New gun owners] might think they are die-hard, ready-to-go, but unfortunately, they’re more like Tiger King and they’re putting themselves and their families in danger.”

When he was done impugning gun owners’ motives, he used ignorant stereotypes to insult them: “Secure that gun, locked and unloaded and hide it behind the cans of tuna and beef jerky that you have stored in a cabinet and only bring that out if the zombies start to appear.”

He knew then, and knows now, that in 2020 millions of new gun owners entered the fold. Once you include Americans that already owned a firearm, it’s clear that Chipman has an obvious distaste for tens of millions of Americans.

Contempt for Congress, Too

According to his opinion in “Legal and Lethal: 9 Products That Could Be the Next Bump Stock,” Chipman says he can ignore Congress and directly regulate firearms out of existence. So, we are confronted with the likelihood that President Biden’s nominee for the ATF will root his decisions in distaste for Americans, not policies framed by the Constitution.

As a bare minimum for consideration, a Senate nominee must be at least plausibly dedicated to impartially enforcing the laws as passed by Congress. Given Chipman’s overt animus against the very Americans he would be tasked with regulating, he has a severe conflict of interest with this job.

If confirmed, Chipman’s actions would be seen as illegitimate by tens of millions of Americans, increasing the tension between law-abiding citizens and an overreaching government. His nomination should not proceed.

Biden Pledges To Take Away Guns As Violent Crime Surges,"President Joe Biden tried to justify his newest gun control pledge by claiming that Americans don’t have the weapons they would need to “take on the government” anyway.

“Those who say the blood of Patriots, you know, and all the stuff about how we’re gonna have to move against the government,” Biden said during a Wednesday press conference. “If you think you need to have weapons to take on the government, you need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons.”

Biden’s comments follow the introduction of a new White House crime prevention plan focused on imposing strong gun control measures on Americans as violent crime surges in the U.S., especially in Democrat-led cities.

“The gun lobby wants you to believe that cities that have the toughest gun laws still have the highest rates of gun violence … don’t believe it,” the president claimed without evidence.

The Democrat continued his anti-gun pledge by claiming that his administration is “not changing the Constitution, we’re enforcing it” by working to keep firearms that fire dozens of rounds out of Americans’ hands.

“No one needs to have a weapon that can fire over 30, 40, 50, even up to 100 rounds, unless you think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests or something,” he said.

Biden claimed that his plan “doesn’t affect responsible gun owners or 2nd Amendment rights” and that “it helps keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them in the first place,” but the Democrat and his administration have been very transparent about their intentions to ban high-capacity magazines and ban assault weapons such as AR-15 pistols.

In April, Biden announced multiple executive orders set on combatting what he called a “public health crisis” and “international embarrassment” of gun violence in the United States. During his screed against firearms, Biden made multiple false claims about background checks. During his joint address, Biden also falsely claimed that former President Bill Clinton’s ban on assault weapons contributed to the decline in gun violence and mass shootings over 10 years.

“A ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds … we beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. Check out the report over 10 years,” Biden said.

"Virginia Democrat McAuliffe Lies, Claims It's Easier To Buy Gun Than Vote","Virginia gubernatorial candidate Democrat Terry McAuliffe falsely insinuated it is easier to buy a gun than it is to vote.

“Call me crazy, but I think it should be easier to vote than it should be to buy a gun,” McAuliffe tweeted Tuesday morning.

Call me crazy, but I think it should be easier to vote than it should be to buy a gun. — Terry McAuliffe (@TerryMcAuliffe) July 6, 2021

McAullife’s lie is presumably supposed to draw attention to election integrity measures by Republicans meant to curb fraud but ignores how Democrats used the COVID-19 pandemic to lift some election security provisions and mail ballots without justification.

It also ignores how nearly half of the country’s states have same-day voter registration, a luxury not afforded to those who try to purchase a gun and receive a delayed background check due to tedious, bureaucratic regulations placed on the firearm industry.

McAuliffe is just one of the many Democrats who have repeated this gun lie to push an agenda. In a viral video in March, Sen. Alex Padilla claimed that “we make it easier to buy a gun than we do to cast a ballot,” a lie that warranted several fact checks.

Sen. Padilla: ""In a majority of states, new voters are able to obtain a rifle quicker than they're able to cast their first ballot. It seems to me we have our priorities entirely backwards when it comes to this — when we make it easier to buy a gun than we do to cast a ballot."" pic.twitter.com/W87OCNCkJ0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 23, 2021

McAuliffe’s tweet gained traction on Twitter where users expressed their outrage at the “brazen, vicious, and completely discrediting lie.”

“Democrats such as McAuliffe get away with lying like this because the corrupt media that control discourse are propagandists who protect them every day,” Federalist Senior Editor Mollie Hemingway tweeted.

What To Make Of Biden’s Latest Call For Banning Guns,"Last week, asked what he planned to do about crime, Joe Biden said “I’m the only guy that ever got passed legislation, when I was a senator, to make sure we eliminated assault weapons. The idea (that) you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon, whether it’s a nine-millimeter pistol or whether it’s a rifle, is ridiculous. I’m continuing to push to eliminate the sale of those things.” Any gun can fire 20 shots, of course, and Biden has never been articulate, so it would be fair to assume that he meant “fire 20 shots without reloading.”

Online, a disagreement about what Biden meant ensued between House Republicans and PolitiFact. But before getting into that, three things should be noted. First, as has often been the case during his political career, in this instance Biden lied. The legislation Biden bragged about—Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s, D-California, gun and magazine “ban” of 1994-2004, imposed as part of Biden’s 1994 crime bill—didn’t “eliminate” any guns.

The “ban” didn’t apply to the possession of guns already owned. On paper, it banned the importation of semi-automatic firearms it defined as “assault weapons,” but the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) had already done that in 1989, as ordered by President George H. W. Bush, with the blessing of Bush’s “drug czar,” Bill Bennett.

Feinstein’s ban applied to the manufacture of such firearms, but unintentionally allowed manufacturers to keep making the firearms in modified form. As a result, during the “ban,” Americans bought almost three-quarters of a million newly made AR-15s, and no telling how many rifles of similar orientation.

Six months after the “ban” took effect, in a CBS “60 Minutes” segment titled “What Assault Weapons Ban?,” reporter Lesley Stahl called 1994 “the best year for the sales of assault weapons ever.” Frustrated, Feinstein told Stahl, “There is no question that I would have preferred to see an outright ban on the possession of semi-automatic assault weapons in America” and “if I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in, I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren’t there.”

Second, since 1989, Democrats’ federal gun- and magazine-ban legislation, the first of which was introduced by purported communist Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Arizona, has defined such magazines as any that can hold 11 or more rounds of ammunition. Therefore Biden was trying to mislead, saying he wanted to ban guns that can fire “20” or more shots.

Third, while firearms that Democrats call “assault weapons” are used in only 2-3 percent of murders (compared to about 30 percent of murders without firearms of any type), no use of a gun in crime is grounds for banning it, because the right to keep and bear arms is constitutionally protected and, as the Supreme Court said in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), “the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.”

Besides, as the late Jeff Cooper, considered the founder of the modern defensive handgun technique, said in “The Art Of The Rifle,” rifles “may be used by evil men for evil purposes, but there are more good men than evil, and while the latter cannot be persuaded to the path of righteousness by propaganda, they can certainly be corrected by good men with rifles.”

While there is nothing in the legislative history of the Second Amendment to support Heller’s claim that the right to arms includes only such arms as are “in common use” for legitimate purposes, AR-15s, comparable rifles, and handguns that can use magazines that hold 11 or more rounds are the firearms most in common use for such purposes today. For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, in Kolbe v. Hogan (2017), said “in 2012, the number of AR- and AK-style weapons . . . was more than double the number of Ford F-150 trucks sold, the most commonly sold vehicle in the United States.”

However, for the record, violent crime, which began declining several years before Feinstein’s “ban” was imposed, continued to decline as purchases of those firearms in particular, and firearms generally, increased. And since the “ban” expired in 2004, Americans have bought millions more AR-15s, comparable rifles, semi-automatic pistols, and hundreds of millions of magazines that hold 11 or more rounds for those firearms. Also, until Democrat officials stopped prosecuting rioters and began defunding police departments, the U.S. murder rate had declined.

Who’s Right About What Biden Meant?

In response to Biden’s statement, House Republicans, overlooking that Biden said he supported banning rifles that can fire 20 or more shots, said on Twitter, “Biden says he wants to ban handguns.” “Handguns” could be interpreted as meaning “some handguns” or “all handguns,” so PolitiFact assumed the latter and said Republicans’ claim was “false.” It added, “Biden doesn’t want to ban handguns, Biden wants to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. . . . The most popular handguns would face no restrictions under Biden’s policies.”

Adding to the confusion, two conservative websites quoted Biden without including his first sentence, with which, it could be argued, he put the remainder of his statement in the context of “assault weapons.” Both websites, like the Republicans, ignored Biden’s claim relative to banning rifles.

PolitiFact was particularly wrong in claiming Biden’s policies would have no effect on the most popular handguns. The most popular handguns today are those that use detachable magazines, detachable magazines are integral parts of firearms designed to use them (like a gas tank is to a car), firearms that can use detachable magazines can use ones of any size, magazines of 11 rounds or more are made for most of them, and magazines of 20 rounds are made for many of them.

It’s Not News That Democrats Want to Ban Guns and Magazines

In the 1800s, Democrats imposed state laws designed to prevent blacks from being armed. In 1934, a Democrat Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt (who threatened to pack the Supreme Court and threw Japanese-Americans in internment camps) imposed the National Firearms Act. In 1968, a Democrat Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson (who campaigned for universal gun registration and gun owner licensing) imposed the Gun Control Act, which, among other things, prohibited a firearm dealer from selling a handgun to a young adult, prohibited a dealer from selling a handgun to a resident of another state, and limited the importation of firearms to those the BATFE considers “generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes” (emphasis added).

In 1974, thinking they had momentum and seeing the opportunity to rake in cash by sending fundraising letters to hoplophobic leftists, anti-gun activists formed the National Coalition to Ban Handguns and the National Council to Control Handguns (NCCH, later renamed Handgun Control, Inc., or HCI). In 1975, NCCH called for “a ban on the manufacture, sale, and importation of all handguns and handgun ammunition,” and in 1976 advocated a law “to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition . . . totally illegal.”

Into the 1980s, both groups campaigned in particular for a ban on compact handguns which, at the time, typically held six or fewer rounds of ammunition. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, of Chappaquiddick infamy, and Rep. Peter Rodino, D-New Jersey, introduced the necessary legislation.

In 1991, a future president of HCI told the New York Assembly’s Committee on Codes, “There is no reason why a legitimate gun owner needs to have a clip (sic) capable of holding more than six rounds, and thus I would suggest the banning of clips (sic) that hold more than six rounds.” Coupled with a ban on compact handguns holding six rounds or fewer, a ban on magazines holding more than six rounds would have begun to look a lot like a ban on handguns.

Two years later, even six rounds was too many. In 1993, Feinstein told the Senate, “I intend to add an amendment that would exempt semi-automatic bolt action (sic) shotguns and bona fide hunting rifles whose clips (sic) don’t exceed three rounds.”

Since Democrats have worked toward civilian disarmament for more than a century, Biden’s latest comment about banning guns and magazines should come as no surprise.

Fast-forward to the end of July, and a Senate committee advanced to head up the Bureau of Land Management a Biden-selected eco-terrorist who once booby-trapped trees with spikes in a potentially murderous screw-you to the logging industry. Last week, Biden announced on live television that he intended to break his oath of office by violating the Constitution with another eviction moratorium.

In light of all the radicalism, it’s worth noting Stone-Manning and the embrace of lawlessness weren’t one-offs. As conservatives warned from the get-go, Biden has proved to be a Trojan horse for the ambitions of the party’s far-left faction, as his Cabinet picks and agency nominees testify.

Here are the top 10 most radical Biden nominees, in no particular order, that further reinforce this reality.

1. Tracy Stone-Manning

We’ve already touched on the eco-terrorist. Stone-Manning, whom Biden nominated to head the Bureau of Land Management and whose nomination the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced on July 22, took part in an Idaho tree-spiking incident in 1989.

Tree-spiking, a form of ecoterrorism indulged by some far-left environmental activists, features metal rods hammered into trees that turn into deadly projectiles when processed for logging. Intended to instill fear among people in the timber industry by setting traps of steel that explode on impact with a saw, this tactic has also injured firefighters who already face the dangerous job of extinguishing deadly wildfires.

“Contrary to many stories in the news, Ms. Stone-Manning was not an innocent bystander, nor was she a victim in this case. And she most certainly was not a hero,” wrote Retired Special Agent Michael Merkley or Stone-Manning’s involvement. “She was vulgar, antagonistic and extremely anti-government.”

2. David Chipman

Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said confirming Biden’s pick to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives would be like putting “Antifa in charge of the Portland Police Department.”

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who survived a politically motivated shooting in 2017, called the nominee out for “alarming ignorance” and “clear anti-gun bias,” with Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida adding the pick is “no better than Beto O’Rourke.” Moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins called David Chipman “unusually divisive,” and Sen. Ted Cruz blasted him over “disturbing” allegations of racism against black ATF agents and participation in Chinese propaganda.

They’re not wrong. Chipman, who clocked in 25 years at the ATF and is now a senior policy adviser at the anti-gun group Giffords and was formerly on the advisory council of Everytown for Gun Safety, admitted during a Senate committee hearing that he supports a ban on AR-15s, a modern sporting rifle that is ubiquitous in the United States. As a lobbyist, Chipman fought for handgun licensing and registration and universal background checks. In fact, thanks to gun-grabby politicians and would-be ATF director, Americans can’t get their hands on guns fast enough. Sales have been soaring at the prospect of a Chipman confirmation.

After news broke of Chipman’s appointment, the nominee locked his Twitter account, probably taking cues from other inflammatory Democrats whose Twitter conduct jeopardized their careers.

Chipman’s scorn for gun-owning Americans runs deep. In April, he compared first-time gun owners who purchased firearms during overbearing lockdowns to zombie preppers, and mocked them as being like Joe Exotic from “Tiger King.”

“Secure that gun locked and unloaded and hide it behind the cans of tuna and beef jerky that you’ve stored in the cabinet, and only bring that out if the zombies start to appear,” Chipman said.

During Senate testimony, Chipman refused to say whether he would prosecute the president’s son Hunter Biden for an illegal gun purchase — a gun Hunter later misplaced after his girlfriend tossed it in a trash can near a school. Speaking of misplacing guns, GOP senators have reason to believe Chipman lost his firearm as an ATF agent.

Chipman was also a case agent in the 1993 Branch Davidian compound siege in Waco, Texas, which resulted in 82 deaths. He has also falsely claimed that Waco cult members “used 2.5 caliber Barretts to shoot down two Texas Air National Guard helicopters.” Evidence from a Waco follow-up investigation showed no helicopters were shot down.

3. Catherine Lhamon

Biden nominated Catherine Lhamon to be assistant secretary for civil rights at the Department of Education, a post she held during the Obama administration, where she was in charge of enforcing Title IX against sex discrimination.

During her 2013-2017 stint there, however, Lhamon eroded due process rights for people accused of sexual misconduct on college campuses. She pressed schools to implement a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard and keep legal representation out of the process. For sexual misconduct cases, Lhamon also pushed universities to embrace an adjudication model that relied on a single campus administrator.

The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education blasted Lhamon, saying her Office for Civil Rights “gutted due process protections and violated the First Amendment.”

The office did so through so-called Dear Colleague letters, which are essentially excuses for unelected bureaucrats to legislate. The resulting campus kangaroo courts were so egregious that even some leftist icons condemned them. The late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg famously denounced them “for not giving the accused person a fair opportunity to be heard.”

As The Federalist’s Eddie Scarry wrote, Lhamon would change the due process standard, swapping “presumption of innocence for ‘possibility’ of innocence.”

4. Xavier Becerra

Biden nominated and the Senate confirmed Xavier Becerra to head the Department of Health and Human Services, but that wasn’t Becerra’s first claim to infamy. Almost every GOP senator, except Collins, opposed Becerra’s confirmation due to his lack of qualifications or health experience, radical abortion positions, refusal to call for free and fair elections in Cuba after meeting with dictator Fidel Castro, and his promotion of Obamacare, gun control, open borders, and radical climate plans. Becerra has also advocated for a government takeover of health care and using taxpayer dollars to fund the health care of illegal foreign workers.

Among the most extreme items on Becerra’s resume is the now-secretary’s efforts when he was attorney general of California to sue the nuns of the Little Sisters of the Poor for refusing to comply with Obamacare’s contraceptive mandate on religious grounds.

During his 24 years in Congress, Becerra voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, voted for taxpayer-funded abortions, and voted not to criminalize hurting an unborn child while committing a different crime. As California attorney general, Becerra took the torch from Kamala Harris and continued prosecuting undercover journalist and pro-life activist David Daleiden on behalf of Planned Parenthood. Becerra charged Daleiden with 15 felonies in 2017, the first time anyone in California had been criminally prosecuted for allegedly violating the state’s video recording law.

Before the Senate confirmed Becerra for his current post, 60 pro-life leaders sent a letter urging Senate committees to reject the radically pro-abortion nominee.

5. Rachel Levine

Before becoming the assistant secretary of health in the Biden administration, Rachel Levine was Pennsylvania’s health secretary. Levine, born Richard Levine, is the first transgender Senate-confirmed federal official after having begun identifying as a woman in 2011. Despite Levine’s denial of basic biology and unwillingness to condemn the genital mutilation of children, Biden has placed him at the helm of so-called public health.

A new study has found that #Transgender youth with access to a puberty blocker have decline in chances of suicide + #mentalhealth problems now and in the future. This study is important because it's the first to show this specific association. https://t.co/axYncR0m4l — Dr. Rachel Levine (@SecretaryLevine) January 24, 2020

Before being elevated to that role, Levine botched Pennsylvania’s COVID response. While relegating other elderly Pennsylvanians to the pandemic Petri dishes of nursing homes — where at the time of Levine’s Senate committee advancement, more than 12,600 of them had died — Levine removed his own mother from a care facility to keep her safe.

6. Deb Haaland

After completing just one term in the House of Representatives, Deb Haaland was tapped to lead the Biden administration’s Department of the Interior. Haaland, an extreme environmental activist who was dubbed “Green New Deal champion” by radical squad member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was one of the co-sponsors of the original legislation, which sought an overhaul of the American economy and rapid decarbonization.

In addition to opposing all oil and gas exploration on public property, an industry that provides 40 percent of the budget in her home state of New Mexico, Haaland has also said she’s “wholeheartedly against fracking and drilling on public lands.”

7. Pete Buttigieg

After his stint as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, then as a failed presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg was elevated to be the Biden administration’s secretary of transportation.

In addition to Mayor Pete’s performative clown show of riding his bicycle to Cabinet meetings (after being transported in entourages of black SUVs most of the way), a story that was never debunked despite what Facebook’s phony fact-checkers tell you, he’s also been known to shroud his anti-Christian views in flowery religious language.

The most radical thing about Buttigieg, however, isn’t his leftist sermonizing or his partner Chasten, it’s his support for late-term abortion of disabled children — another thing he pretends the Bible supports (it very much doesn’t).

On an episode of “The Breakfast Club Podcast” during his presidential campaign, Buttigieg defended abortion until the moment of birth. “There’s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath. And so even that is something that we can interpret differently,” Buttigieg claimed. “The most important thing is the person who should be drawing the line is the woman making the decision.”

He doubled down during an episode of “The View” a few months later, refusing to take a position against partial-birth abortion — in which a baby is partially delivered and then brutally killed — when confronted with the issue by Meghan McCain.

8. Alejandro Mayorkas

Alejandro Mayorkas, who insisted the massive surge of illegals over the southern border was not a crisis but a “challenge,” has more things to answer for.

Along with Becerra, Mayorkas, whom Biden tapped to lead the Department of Homeland Security, assisted former President Bill Clinton’s “pardongate” scandal by lobbying for clemency for Carlos Vignali, a convicted cocaine trafficker whose father had contributed to Democrat campaigns.

“U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas provided critical support for the Vignali commutation that was inappropriate, given his position,” said a 2002 House Committee on Government Reform report. “Mayorkas supported the Vignali commutation despite his ignorance of the facts of the case and his knowledge that the prosecutors responsible for the Vignali case opposed clemency.”

Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel in the Clinton administration, testified that it was the influence of Mayorkas, who reached out to Lindsey after talking with Vignali’s father, that sold him on the commutation. Despite federal prosecutor Todd Jones’s warnings against clemency because the drug dealer was “bad news” and a “major player,” Mayorkas opted to meet with Vignali’s father to discuss a potential pardon.

“Over the next two years, Mayorkas would see Horacio Vignali at various community events and at several one-on-one meetings with Vignali,” the report stated.

9. Vanita Gupta

In April, the Senate confirmed Vanita Gupta to be associate attorney general — but not before a handful of state attorneys general urged Biden to withdraw her nomination over dangerous and divisive policy preferences, specifically her support for defunding the police and the openly Marxist organization Black Lives Matter.

Gupta has specifically advocated for “community policing” and stripping police out of schools. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, an interest group where Gupta was president, published a report calling for “end[ing] the use of police in schools as a solution to student discipline.”

“Police officers should have no role in student disciplinary matters,” it said.

Gupta allegedly said every institution in the United States is racist, a claim Sen. Tom Cotton addressed in her confirmation hearing and which Gupta did not deny. She was also forced to apologize for smearing Republicans on Twitter — if you can call admitting to “fall[ing] prey” to “harsh” rhetoric an apology.

10. Kamala Harris

Kamala Harris’s radicalism is enough to fill a book — or several volumes. And now the Kavanaugh-attacker, rioter-bailer, Russia hoaxer, anti-vaxxer (under Trump), border evader, and pro-baby-killer vice president is just one heartbeat away from leading the free world — which probably wouldn’t be free for long if she were president instead of puppet-master.

Republicans Slam ATF For Attempting To Alter Legal Definition Of ‘Firearm’,"Joined by Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, more than two dozen Republican House members on the Second Amendment caucus released a comment criticizing a new proposed rule by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that would prohibit homemade guns, develop a backdoor gun registry, and regulate gun parts with a background check.

The proposed rule, the “Definition of Frame or Receiver and Identification of Firearms” was introduced in May and signed by Attorney General Merrick Garland. Public comments on the rule closed Thursday.

It would amend the Code of Federal Regulations, including the term “firearm” in order to regulate firearm kits, and amend the term “gunsmith” to clarify that gunsmiths must mark unlicensed guns — effectively making the individual the manufacturer. It would implement regulations on nearly all portions of a firearm.

“Contrary to ATF’s claims that the [proposed rule] will ‘clarify’ various aspects of federal gun laws, in reality the proposed rule would inject ambiguity after ambiguity into an otherwise unambiguous definition of ‘firearm,’ which has existed unmolested since its enactment over half a century ago,” the congressmen wrote. “These changes will cause significant problems not only for the law-abiding public and the courts in trying to apply the agency’s intent instead of a statute, but also for the firearms industry.”

The rule would further complicate types of guns by crafting definitions for what ATF deems a “complete weapon,” “complete muffler or silencer device,” and a “privately made firearm.” A deadline would also be put in place for the timeframe of marking guns.

Mark Oliva, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, told The Federalist the caucus is correct in asserting its role to alert the Department of Justice and ATF as to the problematic nature of the proposed rule.

“The proposed rule redefining ‘frames and receivers’ by the Biden administration is a naked attempt at legislation through regulation,” Oliva said. “The proposed rule is an attempt to shift the goalposts and enact gun control the Biden administration knows runs counter to the will of Congress, the duly-elected representatives of the People.”

Oliva said it would bypass the lawmaking process and, “in essence allow the president to enact gun control via executive fiat. It is executive overreach. It is nothing more than a gun grab.”

The Republicans notably take issue with ATF redefining “frame or receiver.” Under the proposed rule, an “upper receiver” of an AR-15 would be deemed a “firearm” since the gun portion can be seen from the exterior.

However, ATF has always deemed the lower receiver of an AR-15 to be a “frame or receiver” since it is compromised of the fire control group: the trigger, disconnector, hammer, and fire selector. The lower receiver is the portion that is currently marked by my manufacturers with a serial number, but the upper portion would be marked as well under the new rule.

“Of course, ATF has never considered the AR-15 upper receiver to be a firearm,” the members insist. “Rather, since the rifle’s creation, the agency has opined that only the lower receiver is considered the ‘frame or receiver’ for this platform.”

ATF has the potential to move further to restrict Second Amendment rights should President Joe Biden’s director nominee, David Chipman, be confirmed in the Senate. Chipman was caught claiming on television that he is “frustrated” by the First Amendment rights of gun owners. The gun lobbyist told Congress he supports a ban on AR-15’s.

“These members of Congress are taking their oaths to uphold the Constitution seriously by standing up to the tyrants at the ATF. Their stand earns applause from gun owners nationwide,” Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America said in a statement to The Federalist.

Democrats Are Using Economic Chokeholds To Restrict Your Gun Rights,"President Joe Biden’s State Department announced new sanctions banning the importation of ammunition and firearms from Russia, a decision that comes in the midst of a large ammunition shortage that has forced U.S. retailers to depend on foreign suppliers to meet demand. Since 2019, ammunition imports have increased by about 225 percent.

President Biden and his elitist allies in woke banks and investment firms know that severe restrictions on Second Amendment rights aren’t possible given the current composition of the Supreme Court, thanks in large part to President Trump. So they are turning to other tactics instead, most of which aren’t being covered by the press, to get the job done. It’s working.

For more than a decade, investors, banks, and other financial institutions have been dragging U.S. corporations toward the full adoption of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards, posing a significant threat to the long-term survival of the firearms industry.

ESG metrics provide an alternative system for measuring a corporation’s success. Instead of focusing exclusively on traditional business measures — such as profits, the quality of goods and services, consumer satisfaction, etc. — ESG metrics provide scores, usually in the form of letter grades or a numerical scale, based on a company’s adoption of non-business factors.

For example, the metrics created by the World Economic Forum’s International Business Council, which is led by Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, rank companies in part on the “Percentage of employees per employee category, by age group, gender and other indicators of diversity (e.g. ethnicity).”

Or, put another way, a company that doesn’t have “enough” — whatever that means — Hispanics workers relative to its number of African-American workers might receive a lower ESG score than another business with a race ratio more in line with the subjective opinions of the elites who manage ESG metrics.

ESG systems aren’t merely built to deal with racial issues. ESG models typically also measure a company’s commitment to fighting climate change, along with a variety of other environmental metrics, as well as their devotion to a number of left-wing social causes.

For example, some ESG metrics might punish companies in the firearms industry, or even companies loosely associated with it, because, according to our ruling-class overlords in Davos and Washington, D.C., only murderers and deplorable conservatives “cling to their guns or religion.”

You might be surprised to learn that these woke ESG systems have already been widely adopted throughout the United States. Most of the largest corporations in the world, along with a growing list of investment groups, have already built complex internal ESG systems within their organizations. A report by KPMG found that more than eight in 10 large corporations in the United States now have ESG metrics, along with thousands of companies located in more than 50 other countries.

Although not all ESG-minded institutions and investors exclude firearms from their business practices, a growing number of ESG investment groups and banks have started to limit their exposure to firearms manufacturers and other related businesses, making it difficult for companies in the firearms industry to attract investors and much-needed capital, even as gun sales have continued to soar.

In 2018, the world’s largest investment management firm, BlackRock, announced it would exclude all firearms manufacturers and retailers from their ESG funds, including Walmart, as well as put additional pressure on corporate leaders to limit their exposure to guns.

BlackRock’s voice is one of the most powerful on Wall Street. It controls nearly $10 trillion in assets. (Yes, you read that correctly — that’s trillion with a “t.”) To put that into perspective, the total consumer spending of the United States in 2020 was about $12.5 trillion.

It’s also important to remember that BlackRock is just one of many woke investment management companies pushing ESG standards and anti-gun policies.

The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) group suggests ESG standards include “the production or sales of controversial weapons and tobacco products, or gambling services.” It might be tempting to write off “controversial weapons” as nothing less than rocket launchers and land mines, but conservatives know all too well that virtually all modern firearms are now considered “controversial.”

It’s worth noting that PRI’s principles have been signed by thousands of investors and investment management groups, which, together, have $100 trillion under management. (Again, that’s trillion with a “t.”)

With trillions of dollars behind woke causes, it’s no wonder so many corporations are willing to turn their backs on gunowners, including retailers that have long served communities as reliable firearms dealers, like Dick’s Sporting Goods, which has removed guns from hundreds of its stores.

Banks have also started tightening the screws on some gun manufacturers and sellers. In 2018, Citigroup, one of the largest banks in the United States, started to require its client retailers to restrict gun sales to people 21 and older. It also announced it would no longer do business with retailers selling bump stocks or high-capacity magazines, even to well-vetted, law-abiding customers.

Further, according to an investigation by gun-control activist group Guns Down America, Citi now has “no financing” arrangements with the “gun industry.” Similarly, Bank of America has said it will no longer loan to businesses that make “military-style firearms for civilian use,” a decision that cut financial support to some of the biggest gunmakers in the country.

Although many of these decisions have their roots in ESG and sustainable investment practices that date back more than a decade, as well as regulatory changes made by the Obama-era Department of Justice as part of its Operation Chokepoint initiative, recent moves by woke banks have been buoyed by the Biden administration.

In President Trump’s final months in office, his administration approved the Fair Access to Financial Services Rule, which would have made it difficult for banks to discriminate against businesses based on the industry they are in. Under the Trump rule, financial institutions would be required to base their decisions on financial information.

However, before the rule could go into effect, the Biden administration killed the regulatory change, opening the door to even greater discrimination in the financial services industry against firearms-related businesses.

The Biden administration has advocated for strict gun-control measures and enacted executive policies meant to drive up the cost of ammunition. Private financial institutions are now helping them do through the economy what they can’t do through the elected members of Congress. And the worst part is, their plan is starting to work.

The CDC That Can't Figure Out What A Man Is Wants To 'Study Guns',"Crime continues to spike in communities across America. The weekend tallies from Chicago’s gang-related crimes continue, and New York City’s Times Square and even upscale attractions in Washington, D.C. aren’t immune to criminals exchanging gunfire. This is happening because “no-bail” policies are putting criminals back on the street, yet politicians are looking elsewhere for causes, even floating proposals to pay criminals to not shoot others.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky says she wants to study why shootings are increasing. Walensky told CNN, “Something has to be done about this. Now is the time — it’s pedal to the metal time.” The Biden administration thinks this is a novel approach, but the CDC has done this before.

CDC Director Claims Gun Control Not the Aim

Walensky claimed she’s not looking for gun control and wants to include gun owners as part of the conversation to tackle so-called “gun violence.” In Walensky’s words, the issue is a “serious public health threat.”

She incorrectly claimed that “We haven’t spent the time, energy, and frankly the resources to understand this problem because it’s been so divided.” On the contrary, the topic has been well researched and CDC’s own online Web-Based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System tracks fatal and nonfatal injuries from guns and other sources.

Congress passed the Dickey Amendment to tell the CDC it couldn’t advocate for gun control, as it did before the amendment. But the Dickey Amendment doesn’t stop gun-related studies at the CDC.

Indeed, the CDC has studied guns and suicide, noise and lead exposure at ranges, firearm violence prevention in Wilmington, Delaware, and firearms homicides and suicides in metropolitan areas. In 2020, the CDC announced research grants to prevent firearm-related violence and injuries. The FBI, Department of Justice, and Congress did additional studies. President Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2013 directing $10 million to “gun violence” research. The CDC website has a section dedicated to “Funded Research” and another section dedicated to “Firearm Violence Prevention.”

The CDC also previously studied the effectiveness of laws for gun and ammunition bans, restrictions on acquiring firearms, waiting periods for firearm purchases, ammunition restrictions, licensing and registration schemes, child access prevention laws, and concealed carry laws. The CDC “found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.”

The Firearm Industry has Enacted Real Solutions

In the interview, Walensky tried to assure gun owners she wants to find “common ground.”

“Let’s agree, we don’t want people to die,” she said.

Despite asking gun owners to “come to the table” and “join us in the conversation,” neither Walensky nor anyone else at the CDC has reached out to the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the firearm industry’s trade association.

As a leading authority on firearm safety, NSSF welcomes the opportunity to engage with policymakers in a dialogue. We would explain to Walensky that NSSF has led a robust campaign to help reduce suicides, firearms accidents, and the criminal acquisition and misuse of firearms, through a campaign called Real Solutions.

That effort has demonstrated proven results. The firearm industry’s Fix NICS campaign changed laws in 16 states to ensure disqualifying adjudicated mental health and criminal records are submitted to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Disqualifying records submission increased 270 percent, from just 1.7 million in 2013 to more than 6.1 million today.

Project ChildSafe forged partnerships with 15,000 law enforcement agencies in all 50 states and five U.S. territories to distribute more than 40 million free firearm safety kits, including locking devices. This program has been heralded by the Government Accountability Office for its efficacy and was a National Safety Council’s Green Cross award finalist.

The firearm industry partnered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATF) for the “Don’t Lie for the Other Guy” campaign to prevent illegal straw purchases, reminding the public that purchasing a firearm for someone who can’t, or doesn’t want to be associated with the sale, is a federal crime that carries a punishment of 10 years in jail and a $250,000 fine.

Operation Secure Store, also an ATF partnership, voluntarily increases firearm retailer security to deter and prevent thefts and burglaries. The ATF showed this program works, with a 61 percent drop in instances of thefts and burglaries in the first six months of 2021 compared to 2020 and a 74 percent drop in the number of stolen firearms.

The firearm industry also partnered with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention to provide information to firearm retailers and ranges to urge people to have a “brave conversation” to prevent suicides by firearm. The firearm industry knows that nearly two-thirds of all suicides involve a firearm and is committed to intervening before a moment of crisis. This partnership was extended to include the Department of Veterans Affairs to stem and reverse the instances of suicides.

These are programs proven to help make our communities safer without infringing on our Second Amendment rights.

CDC Can’t Address the Real Causes of Gun Violence

The firearms industry has reason to be concerned about this sudden imperative by the nation’s disease prevention agency when it – again – wants to take on firearms as a cause. The real concern is criminal misuse of firearms and since committing a crime is a behavior and not a disease, it’s hard to see where the CDC is going to recommend a prophylactic regimen to stop it.

Of course, the CDC doesn’t want to tackle criminal behavior. Officials there don’t even want to use the word “criminal.” Most media didn’t report that, at the same time Walensky announced her push to study guns, the CDC published new guidelines for the agency to use more “inclusive language.”

The guide “suggests replacing terms such as ‘Inmate,’ ‘Prisoner,’ ‘Convict/ex-convict,’ and ‘Criminal’ with terms such as ‘People/persons,’ ‘Persons in pre-trial or with charge,’ ‘Persons on parole or probation,’ or ‘People in immigration detention facilities,’” Fox News reported. Gone too are references to drug abusers.

It begs the question: If the CDC appeases “woke” political agendas and can’t be honest in its terminology, then how is America supposed to trust CDC studies of gun ownership? Walensky claims the CDC insufficiently studies the issue when that’s demonstrably false. Restricting language regarding criminal factors is disingenuous and prevents open and honest reporting.

The CDC’s announcement is just another Biden administration overreach on guns. President Joe Biden has nominated an anti-gun activist to run the ATF. Now his CDC director, the same one who has gotten away with unlawful decrees in the name of a pandemic, is targeting guns.

Walensky is rewriting the basic facts to fit a gun control narrative, even as she claims her effort isn’t about gun control. It absolutely is. This is why there is a Dickey Amendment in the first place.

Biden’s Ammunition Ban Is Part Of The Left’s Plot To Disarm Americans,"The Biden administration recently prohibited the import of ammunition from Russia. That’s bad news for American firearms owners, but there may be much worse to come.

The gun prohibition lobbies, having mostly failed in their campaigns to convince legislatures to ban guns, have intensified their efforts to disarm Americans by other means. The Biden ammunition ban is one step in the process.

If you’ve tried to buy ammunition in the last year and a half, you know how bad the shortage already was, even before the new ban. In a sense, Joe Biden has been a contributor to the shortage since 2020.

Gun and Ammunition Sales Were Already Surging

When presidential nominees declare an aggressive anti-liberty agenda, many Americans prudently exercise their rights while they still can. If an anti-rights candidate wins and starts implementing a gun-control agenda, the urgency increases. Thus, arms and ammunition purchases surged in 1993-94 (early Bill Clinton), 2008-09 (early Barack Obama), 2012-13 (Obama making gun control a top second-term priority), 2016 (Hillary Clinton campaign), and 2020 (Biden campaign).

Biden was, however, not the only problem. Rising COVID-19 cases worried many Americans that police forces might be temporarily spread thin. Thus, March 2020 saw a huge (and still enduring) surge in ammunition buying, beginning to outstrip supply.

Then came the summer of violence, as Marxists, leftists, and other opportunistic malefactors robbed, burned, looted, and murdered with impunity. Many law enforcement agencies stood idle. While rioting has abated in most cities, it will resume whenever the organizers decide to turn it on again. Meanwhile, the police have been partially defunded in some cities, and vilified and demoralized everywhere.

Given that so many governments have demonstrated that they cannot or will not protect citizens from individual criminals or from violent mobs, it is no wonder that so many Americans have decided to take responsibility for protecting themselves and their families. But they can’t do that if they can’t buy ammunition.

A Maxed-Out Market

In 2020 about 8.4 million guns were purchased by first-time gun buyers. Like Americans who already owned guns, these newcomers might, in ordinary times, buy a few boxes at a time, for target and safety practice. But in today’s extraordinary times, many new and old gun owners are seeking to buy more, since they do not know if they will be able to buy ammunition at all in the future. Politicians from coast to coast used the pandemic as a pretext to shut down gun stores. No one can predict when they will do so again.

America’s ammunition manufacturers have responded to the full limits of their capacity. Many factories are operating 24 hours a day. But because the continuing effects of COVID-19 have disrupted supply chains, there are many materials bottlenecks that limit manufacturing output.

Input prices have also soared. For example, a pound of copper cost $2.55 on Sept. 2, 2019, and $4.30 on Sept. 2, 2021. Ammunition prices in many calibers have at least doubled. The backorders at ammunition manufacturers now stretch out to a year or more. Hornady Manufacturing Company — known for very well-engineered self-defense and hunting ammunition — said in May 2021 that it already had orders for its next two and a half years of production.

The ongoing ammunition shortage is seriously impairing the exercise of Second Amendment rights. Many gun owners have cut back on practice because they cannot be sure they will be able to replace the ammunition they use. Some firing ranges are not even able to sell customers a box of ammunition. The shortage is particularly burdensome for the millions of Americans who purchased their first firearm in 2020 and are being deprived of practice opportunities.

Drying Up Imports

On August 20, 2021, the Biden administration announced it would not issue new licenses for the import of ammunition from Russia. Existing licenses were not affected. Ostensibly, the import bans are sanctions against the Russian government for its attempted murder of dissident Aleksey Navalny (although the seriousness of the Biden administration’s sanctions policy is questionable).

In 2020, 765 million units of Russian ammunition were imported into the United States — more than from any other nation. The calibers most affected by the Biden import ban are 7.62×54, 7.62×39, 5.45×39, 5.56×45, and match-grade .22 rimfire. Those first four calibers are mainly for AK platform semi-automatic rifles. AK rifles are manufactured by U.S. companies and by overseas exporters. Functionally, these popular rifles (and sometimes large pistols) are alternatives to the even more popular AR platform.

In general, AK rifles are manufactured to looser tolerances than ARs. This makes them less accurate, especially at longer distances. But they are also amazingly durable, and function well even under conditions of hard use, such as exposure to dirt.

Jim Grant, an editor of the AmmoLand website, urges Americans not to worry: other foreign countries export the above calibers to the United States, and by the time the existing Russian import licenses expire, some of the Russian manufacturers may be able to shift production to other nations.

Biden’s Ban Isn’t the Only Threat

Although the ammunition shortage may ease up in a year or two, the gun prohibition lobbies have more restrictions on their agenda. Michael Bloomberg’s “Everytown” lobby wants America to adopt the British system, in which guns and ammunition must be stored in separate, locked safes.

“We are all safer” in such a system, the Bloomberg lobby claims. True enough, if “we” means “violent home invaders.” But having to open two safes in a few seconds when invaders have crashed through your home’s back door makes life perilous for your family.

Perhaps the biggest current threat is a recent California law misleadingly billed as “background checks for ammunition.” As the history of gun control shows, what happens in California doesn’t stay in California. California prohibits mail-order sales. So rural Californians might have to drive hours to find a retail store with the ammunition they need.

If you can find a store with the necessary ammunition, the California statute requires the ammunition buyer affirmatively to prove American citizenship. Don’t have a handy certified copy of your birth certificate? California will take up to 22 weeks to issue you one. If you can’t get a certified birth certificate (or a passport, which usually requires a birth certificate to obtain), then you can never buy ammunition in California.

If you do have a certified birth certificate, the ammunition background check can begin. It is very different from the background check for firearms purchases.

Don’t Californicate the Gun Market

For the typical firearms background check, the buyer’s identity is checked against lists of prohibited persons (e.g., persons with felony convictions, unlawful aliens who were apprehended, persons under domestic restraining orders). In contrast, the ammunition check blocks sales to everyone who is not on the California registry of gun owners.

California’s handgun registry was created in 1990, and the long gun registry in 2014. If you bought your firearm before that, you won’t be on the list, and your ammunition purchase will be denied. You will also be denied if your current address is different from where you lived when you bought your gun.

As a result, 99.8 percent of California ammunition purchase denials are erroneous. The California appeal system for wrongful denials is opaque and slow. The apparent net effect of California’s “background checks for ammunition” has been to deter or prevent at least 2 million law-abiding Californians from purchasing ammunition.

As California illustrates, the gun prohibition lobbies are more sophisticated than ever, and they have discovered that even if they can’t ban guns outright, choking off ammunition is an effective way to prevent people from using guns.

Ammo Alone Won’t Keep You Safe. Do This When It’s Hard To Find,"The Biden administration’s decision to stop the importation of ammunition from Russia—which it claims is in retaliation for that country’s attempted assassination of a political opposition figure—has some supporters of the right to arms chafing. However, it is relatively inconsequential and its effect can easily be minimized.

Biden’s decision is relatively inconsequential because, first, it pales in comparison to everything else he, the left’s civilian and uniformed quislings, and other Democrats are doing to harm the country. Second, it makes only slightly worse the limited availability and higher cost of ammunition that has been going on for the last year and a half, so it’s less a problem for people who need a relatively small amount of ammunition in case they have to defend themselves—against common criminals, at least—than for packrats who hoard ammunition they will never use and profiteers who hoard it to sell at inflated prices to people who don’t know they’re being ripped off.

Third, there have been ammunition crunches before, the right to keep and bear arms is still holding its own, and the current crunch will be no different. The first crunch in modern times occurred in 1993-1994, when President Bill Clinton signed two major anti-gun laws into effect. One was the Brady bill, which began as a waiting period on handgun purchases and after five years transitioned into the background check system Democrats are trying to morph into a gun registry with their “universal checks” legislation. The other was Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s (D-California) 1994-2004 so-called “assault weapon” ban.

Contrary to their intent, both laws led to a dramatic increase in the number of gun owners and Americans’ purchases of the very guns the laws were intended to reduce. Another crunch occurred when President Barack Obama was elected the first time, and another when he was reelected and immediately began attacking gun ownership, in both instances inspiring increases in gun owners and gun acquisitions.

Fourth, in the long run, Biden shutting off ammo from Russia will have the same unintended result as Clinton shutting off ammo from communist China in the 1990s: It will force Americans to purchase pricier, but superior ammunition made in this country and in countries allied with us, rather than from our adversaries, and incline gun owners to think about how to improve their skill while firing fewer rounds, instead of burning through larger numbers of rounds just for fun.

The Most Efficient Way to Get Better

Fifth, while a lot of ammunition is needed for serious practice over time, the most efficient way to improve one’s firearm skill—in terms of the time, money, and energy invested in relation to the return on that investment—is without ammunition, by what is commonly referred to as “dry firing,” the required safety precautions for which can be explained by any competent instructor.

According to former Army Special Forces soldier Mike Green, whose company, Green-Ops, conducts defensive firearm classes and dry-fire clinics in Northern Virginia and South-Central Texas, “dry-firing is the most often overlooked element of a comprehensive training program. But it shouldn’t be. It’s simple and almost cost-free.”

“All you need is an unloaded firearm, a room that has no ammunition present, a target and a safe direction in which to place it, and a shot timer app downloaded to your smartphone. Set the timer to a ‘random’ starting beep and to a ‘par’ time. Begin each drill on the first beep and try to complete it before the ‘par’ beep.”

The timer is important because marksmanship is accuracy and speed—the ability to fire a sufficient number of sufficiently accurate rounds in a sufficient amount of time to accomplish the task at hand—and speed is objectively measured with a timer. In dry-firing, accuracy is objectively determined by seeing where the sights are, relative to the target, when the firing mechanism “clicks.”

Sixth, the most important purpose of ammunition is to be used to help you stay alive, but there are things besides an abundance of ammunition that can help you achieve that end. For example, be as physically fit as possible. Given a choice between being exceptionally physically fit and so-so in terms of gun skills, and the inverse, take the former.

Never underestimate the importance of being able to move quickly, with strength and agility, when fighting for your life. Physical fitness also benefits you generally, whereas defensive gun skills come in handy only if you are unlucky enough to need them.

Also, if Duke Ellington was right when he attributed his success to “doing the right thing, at the right time, in the right place, with the right people,” the inverse must then also be true: Don’t go to the wrong places, hang around with the wrong people, or do things likely to get you into trouble.

Also, just to name a few more things to consider, keep your residence secure, pay attention to your surroundings, don’t use outdoor ATMs, don’t get into arguments with strangers, don’t wear earphones when outdoors in public, keep moving and watch your back if approached on the sidewalk, keep your windows up and doors locked when driving and especially at intersections plagued with panhandlers, watch for suspicious people in your rearview mirrors, and have a sequence of procedures to follow when approaching, getting into, and departing your vehicle.

Additionally, don’t fall for the idea that your raison d’être is to protect strangers who don’t carry guns to protect themselves. If you see a crime that doesn’t threaten you, don’t reflexively rush in, especially if you are not highly trained. You don’t know how many criminals there are, or who and where they are, or what their plan is, and neither does the other aspiring hero or the off-duty, plain-clothed cop who may be there too, or the uniformed police officers when they arrive on the scene, any of whom, seeing a gun in your hand, might mistake you for a criminal.

Don’t Make The Next Crunch Worse

In the last year or so, crime has been increasing, due to Democrats encouraging their rioters, refusing to prosecute their rioters for crimes, and defunding the police. As a result, millions of Americans bought their first guns and the ammunition required for them, having decided enough is enough and that they’re not going down without a fight. But the supply of ammunition has not been able to keep up with demand mostly because of hoarding by gun owners who already had more ammunition than they will ever use.

First came the Chi-Com virus situation, on the basis of which the hoarders theorized they would need ammunition to fend off marauding bands of riff-raff who might try to forcibly relieve them of their toilet paper stashes. Second, every Democrat candidate for that party’s 2020 presidential nomination advocated banning AR-15s, and half of them— most conspicuously Biden—advocated confiscating the guns.

Nothing sells guns and ammunition like Democrats rallying their base with calls for civilian disarmament. Then, because Antifa and Black Lives Matter rioters were tearing things up in Portland, Seattle, Kenosha, New York City, and Washington, D.C., the hoarders convinced themselves they needed more ammunition because their residential neighborhoods were next.

Events likely to cause another crunch or perpetuate the current one are almost certain to occur. The Chi-Coms will hit us with another biological warfare experiment, leftists will start rioting again, some blowhard ignoramus will start carrying on about confiscating guns, there will be one or more terrorist attacks, you-know-who will somehow become president before Inauguration Day 2025, or who knows what.

So, when you can, get top-notch ammunition with which to defend yourself. Consult this list, reflecting the research of terminal ballistics expert Dr. Gary Roberts. For practice ammunition, go with the less expensive fully-jacketed bullet variety, made by a quality American, European, or Taiwanese company. But don’t buy more ammunition than you’ll ever use for training and practice, and be realistic about how much ammunition you would need to fight for life and liberty in a worst-case scenario.

Test your ammunition with your guns, with your magazines, to make sure everything works without malfunctions. Make sure your guns are zeroed with your defensive ammunition and that you know the relative impact points of your practice ammunition. As another longtime firearm instructor, James Yeager, often says, “Remember, your responsibility to be ready for the fight never ends.”

"After You Buy A Gun For Self-Defense, Here’s What To Do With It","Not long ago, firearm instructor Karl Rehn of KR Training and I discussed why some people attend defensive firearm classes for little reason beyond recreation. In addition to having taught thousands of students, Karl’s an engineer, thus analytical by nature, and he hit the nail on the head. He said people do what they want or need to do, and while many gun owners want to shoot guns for fun, most don’t think they’ll need to defend themselves, so they don’t take defensive training seriously.

I’ve also heard conservatives say they don’t have time to train, because they have jobs and families, the kids have to be taken to baseball practice, and so on. Some, being first-time gun owners, say they don’t know where to begin.

Those things may be true. However, just as cemeteries are full of people who—thinking “it won’t happen to me”—smoked, drank alcoholic and sugary drinks, ate junk food, and never exercised or got their blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, and body fat numbers under control, they’re also occupied by people who weren’t prepared when a criminal attacked. And unmarked graves around the world are full of people who thought the mass murders that always accompany leftist dictatorships wouldn’t happen to them either.

If you’re a gun owner thinking “Okay, point made. Now what?,” here are some suggestions for getting your defensive act together.

Start With Safety

Know and be able to apply the National Rifle Association’s (NRA’s), Jeff Cooper’s, and the military’s basic firearm safety rules. If you have semi-automatic rifles and pistols—the most generally useful firearms for defensive purposes—know their eight-step firing cycle (p. 4-2) and Cooper’s sequence of Weapon Conditions for loading and unloading them.

Know The Laws

Don’t assume that you know the laws on using guns for self-defense and carrying them in public. To be issued a handgun carrying license in Texas, you must take, from a Department of Public Safety-certified instructor, a class covering such laws. If you’re in Texas, even if you don’t want a license (Texas, a constitutional-carry state, doesn’t require a license to carry), take the class. If you aren’t in Texas, take a comparable class in your state.

On a related point, your clothing, vehicle, and home exterior should bear no references to guns or self-defense, and don’t carry a handgun openly. Be low profile. Don’t let criminals know you have guns and don’t give an overzealous Democrat prosecutor anything with which to portray you as an overzealous gun owner in court.

Select An Instructor Carefully

Owning a gun isn’t the same as knowing how to use it. Train with someone certified as an instructor by the NRA, Rangemaster, the military, a law enforcement agency, or another recognized authority.

For the defensive use of guns, you’ll probably have the best result with someone who, in addition to having those credentials, has a military or law enforcement background, or has trained with people who have those backgrounds, and whose intermediate and advanced classes explain how to apply firearm skills in defensive situations, rather than in shooting sports. Before attending a class, determine if your dominant eye and dominant hand are on the same side of your body. If they aren’t, tell your instructor.

Have your instructor explain, demonstrate, and coach you on safely handling, loading, and unloading a gun; assuming a proper shooting stance; shouldering and gripping a rifle; unholstering, assembling a two-handed grip with, and reholstering a handgun; and firing a handgun with one hand only. Also to be covered are sight alignment, sight picture, trigger press and reset, “calling” your shots, dry-firing safety protocols, rifle and pistol positions, and basic shooting and other gun-handling drills.

More advanced topics include “speed” (empty gun) and “tactical” (not empty gun) reloading, malfunction clearing, moving with a gun safely and tactically indoors and outdoors around objects and people, firing positions other than standing, and shooting while walking. If the instructor can’t cover everything mentioned above, find another instructor.

Don’t Think of Firearms As a Hobby

The Framers of the Constitution and Bill of Rights understood the right to arms to encompass everything within the scope of the right during the founding era. Examples included defense against violent criminals, hunting, target practice, shooting competitions, and gun collecting.

No one in those days—not even the Revolutionary War British—opposed keeping and bearing arms for those purposes, so if there had been no other purpose for the right, there would have been no need for the Second Amendment. Instead, the right to arms could have been left to the Ninth Amendment: “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.”

Lots of gun owners invoke the Second Amendment to justify having guns for self-defense or various hobbies. A few do it even for carrying rifles and shotguns to send a message to politicians at a protest when doing so is premature. But bring up the purpose for which the amendment was adopted, and they give you a deer-in-the-headlights gaze or start squirming like a cat that doesn’t want to be picked up.

Hobby-obsessed and other self-absorbed gun owners don’t like hearing it any more than anti-gun activists, Democrat politicians, and their allies in the mainstream media, but the Second Amendment was adopted because the keeping and bearing of arms for defense against tyranny was considered essential to a free society. In that way, it’s like the rights and freedoms protected by the first, third, and fourth amendments. If you’re serious about defending life and liberty, focus on keeping and bearing arms for its core purpose.

Dry-Fire

Ammunition wasn’t cheap before the increased prices brought on by the Chi-Com virus, Democrat calls for gun confiscation, Democrat-encouraged leftist riots, the refusal of Democrat district attorneys to prosecute rioters, and Democrat defunding of police departments. That’s one of the reasons to sometimes practice without ammunition, at home, by “dry-firing.” As noted, have your instructor explain how to do so safely.

Download a “shot timer” app to your smartphone and refer to the rifle and pistol positions link, above. Attend a dry-fire clinic, such as those conducted in Northern Virginia and South-Central Texas by Green Ops. Spend ten minutes dry-firing a couple of times per week, and you’ll probably improve quickly.

Don’t Waste Time and Ammunition

At a range, know what you’re going to practice in advance. You’ll need ballistic eye glasses (see the Army’s Authorized Protective Eyewear List) and hearing protection. Foam earplugs can work, but you’ll benefit from adding electronic muffs (e.g., Howard Leight/Impact, Peltor, Ops-Core, and MSA/Sordin) that amplify normal sounds while dampening loud ones.

Perform shooting and other gun-handling drills slowly at first. When you’re ready to gradually increase your speed, use a live-fire shot timer, such as the Competition Electronics Pocket Pro.

AR-15s and 9mm Pistols

AR-15s are the most versatile fighting rifles available. They’re relatively lightweight, ergonomic, and accurate, and don’t kick very much. The Biden administration is threatening to restrict AR pistols, which generally have barrels no longer than 11.5 inches. However, an AR rifle with a longer barrel (16-20 inches) and handguard is easier to wield, produces greater velocity (thus a flatter trajectory) and less muzzle flash, and with a mid-length gas system is more mechanically reliable.

How to outfit your AR is discussed here and, along with other useful information, in former Army Special Forces soldier Kyle Lamb’s “Green Eyes And Black Rifles.” Lastly, not all ARs are alike in terms of metallurgy and quality controls. Some of the more highly-regarded brands are Knight Armament, Bravo Company USA, Daniel Defense, Lewis Machine Tool (LMT), Midwest Industries, and Colt’s.

Compared to larger-caliber pistols, 9mms hold more rounds, recoil less, are generally more mechanically reliable, and with top-quality defensive hollowpoint ammunition (Hornady Critical Defense, Federal HST, Speer Gold Dot, etc.) perform well for defensive purposes.

While there are other pistols, more people have fired more rounds with more 9mm Glocks than with any other handgun. It’s a proven design. When the Supreme Court recognized in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) that “handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home,” it was largely because of Glocks. Glocks are also particularly easy to service without special tools, with a small number of inexpensive, widely available factory-original parts.

Whatever handgun you have, make sure its grip is thin enough that you can wield the gun efficiently with one hand, in case your other hand is injured or occupied with another task. Also note that the length of a handgun’s grip is usually what determines whether you can conceal the gun underneath clothing without its shape showing. For safety and security, have a top-quality Kydex holster (JM Custom Kydex, Blade-Tech, Priority 1, Eclipse, etc.) and belt-mounted pouches for extra magazines.

Things Besides Guns

Paper targets don’t shoot at you or move. Don’t count on that in the real world. With your doctor’s permission, get on a physical fitness program for things such as being able to quickly move away from an attacker’s “kill zone.” A certified trainer (Gold’s Gym, Crossfit, etc.) who specializes in functional fitness rather than body building can help in this regard.

Find an Army combat medic like Caleb Causey of Lone Star Medics, Navy corpsman, or civilian emergency medical technician who conducts training in applying tourniquets and packing wounds, or take a Stop The Bleed class.

Build A Team?

If a situation for which the Second Amendment was adopted comes about, some people advocate going it alone, because you’re the only one you can trust. After all, millions of Americans expose their personal details on social media platforms, and if they won’t keep their secrets, they won’t keep yours.

However, others advise having people on whom you can count. If you go that route, keep things informal and vet folks carefully. Maybe meet with friends at the shooting range once or twice a month.

Good luck, and remember the Latin adage: “Si vis pacem, para bellum.”

Actor Explains How Alec Baldwin Failed To Follow Gun Safety On Set,"Actor Adam Baldwin, who has handled multiple guns in his roles onscreen, said that Alec Baldwin clearly neglected to check the chamber of his gun on the set of “Rust” before firing a live round that killed a cinematographer and injured a director.

“Why he didn’t check to see if it was cleared?” Adam asked on “The Dana Show.” “That’s, you know, to me, that’s just clear negligence. Everyone that is handling a firearm should know and is trained to check the weapon, clear the weapon, make sure that it’s empty. The barrel, the breech, the magazine, and the cylinder of a revolver in this case.”

Adam said he wasn’t sure if COVID-19 protocols played a role in whether the prop master was “nearby” or not but that it’s clear Alec did not properly check the gun before firing.

Reports indicate that assistant director Dave Halls told Alec the gun was a “cold gun” without any live ammunition in it but when the actor fired it, a real bullet struck two staff on set. Halls was previously fired from a movie set in 2019 after a crew member was injured by a gun.

Adam said it is possible the crew tried to practice with the weapon by shooting live rounds in the New Mexico desert but even then he said “oversight from a professional trainer” is usually required.

“It’s inexcusable that any live ammo would be mixed in with the blanks,” he said. “However, it’s inexcusable not to check and see if your weapon is loaded. … Whoever hands me a weapon, I check it.”

Adam also said that Alec should have known better since he has decades of experience filming on sets with prop guns.

“Alec Baldwin is 63 years old. He’s been doing this for 40 years or more. He’s had a gun in his hand on camera for decades and he would know that protocol had been broken when that gun was handed to him and he didn’t check it himself or whoever was handing it to him didn’t hand it to him opened so that he could see it and so that the people he was aiming at” could see it, Adam said. “It’s common practice to show the people behind the camera if you’re pointing in that direction, ‘see how empty this gun is? It’s completely empty.'”

Adam said he doesn’t know who put a live round in the gun but said the corporate media’s treatment of the armorer seems unjust.

“This armorer in the media is now being crucified and it reminds me of the way they treated Monica Lewinsky. … ‘I did not have manual relations with that weapon.’ It just seems so familiar, there’s some sort of PR firm right behind this that’s spinning it in the media and it’s disgusting,” he said. “It’s horrible that you would give armorers a bad name just because an anti-gun activist is incompetent with a weapon and shoots and kills the cinematographer. It’s a horrible tragedy, I mean, clearly he didn’t do it on purpose, but he did it out of negligence.”

What The Baldwin Mishap Says About Guns Isn’t What You Might Think,"The investigation into the fatal shooting of movie camerawoman Halyna Hutchins by actor Alec Baldwin with a prop gun on the set of the latter’s movie, “Rust,” last Thursday is ongoing, with new information and speculations appearing daily, so prudent people will let the investigation run its course before reaching conclusions. The fact that Mr. Baldwin has been a hard-core leftist activist, particularly against the right to keep and bear arms, should not lessen conservatives’ self-restraint in this regard.

We have been told several key elements so far. During a rehearsal, Baldwin pointed in Mrs. Hutchins’s direction a single-action revolver that a film crew member had claimed was unloaded. The gun fired, perhaps because Baldwin cocked the hammer prematurely or pulled the trigger unintentionally, something got caught on the trigger, the gun malfunctioned, or Baldwin fired the gun intentionally for rehearsal purposes, thinking it was unloaded—and Hutchins and film director Joel Souza were struck, the latter non-fatally. Also, the same gun may have been used by some film crew members for target shooting with conventional ammunition earlier in the day.

However, as with people’s reactions to many other topics in modern society’s news cycle, in this instance self-restraint against conclusion-jumping is not universal. Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, who normally gadflies on topics more within his area of expertise, knee-jerked, “What is needed now is a clear law that categorically prohibits any real gun or real bullet from being used on a film set.”

Of course, no such need has been established. Movies have a good, if not perfect, track record where firearm safety is concerned and, although we should still wait for the results of the investigation, what has been reported thus far suggests, if anything, not that the movie industry’s safety procedures are inadequate, but that they may not have been followed by Baldwin and some members of his crew.

One fact about the tragedy appears to have emerged: an effort to exonerate Baldwin, one of the hard left’s favored Hollywood personalities. Most conspicuously, Democrats and leftwing civilian disarmament activist groups, who would otherwise be using the tragedy as the launchpad for an indignant and self-righteous campaign against the right to keep and bear arms, are being silent.

More subtly, a Fox News article quoted a movie prop master explaining how people in his line of work are responsible for checking firearms before they get into actors’ hands. “If you do enough safety checks along the way, nothing should happen. But, obviously, the gun on Alec Baldwin’s set was not checked. Because if it was, they would have seen the bullet in there,” he reportedly said.

Another Fox News article stated that “a camera operator who was working on the film’s set [the day of the tragedy] noted to detectives that Baldwin was very careful when it came to the use of prop firearms while filming prior to the tragic accident,” and “the actor observed all the safety protocols and even did an extra check-in with the crew to make sure no one was near him. Specifically, he made sure a child who was on set that day wasn’t anywhere near him when discharging the weapon.”

However, whatever the movie industry’s protocols may be, in the firearm training world it’s universally understood that once a person takes a gun into his or her hands, he or she is responsible for it. And while the cameraman Fox quoted may be correct that Baldwin was safe previously, it wouldn’t necessarily mean that he was without fault in Hutchins’s death.

Furthermore, in the firearm training world, the Baldwin incident would not be considered an “accident”—a mishap that occurs despite someone doing everything correctly. Unless someone deliberately loaded the gun with conventional ammunition, knowing it would be fired by Baldwin in that condition—which at this point there is no publicly known reason to suspect—the tragedy was the result of “negligence”—something that occurred because one or more people failed to follow safety rules and procedures.

There’s A Reason to Always Follow the Rules

Leading voices among firearm instructors, their organizations, and the firearm industry commonly advise many safety rules. Some apply to all firearms, some to certain types of firearms because of how they function mechanically, and others to certain situations, such as training classes, shooting competitions, and the making of movies. Furthermore, several rules are widely considered cardinal and may be relevant in this instance.

The National Rifle Association (NRA), which has thousands of certified instructors nationwide, has long advised three safety rules that apply to all firearms at all times. The military, which trains almost as many Americans annually as NRA instructors do, uses basic firearm safety rules that track with the first two of the NRA’s rules.

The NRA’s first rule is “Always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction.” Normally that means, among other things, “not at another person.” Its meaning and purpose is so obvious that even someone with no experience handling firearms can understand it.

It’s often described as the most important rule, on the reasoning that even if someone failed to follow every other rule, and as a result fired a gun unintentionally, if that person were pointing the gun in a safe direction at the time the gun fired, he or she might be embarrassed and would almost certainly be read the Riot Act by the range safety officer at a shooting range, but no one would have been hurt.

The NRA’s second and third rules are “Always keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot” and “Always keep the gun unloaded until ready to use,” the intents of which are also easy for almost anyone to understand.

Whether the intents of these rules were violated in Baldwin’s instance would depend on whether the scene he was rehearsing called for him to fire the gun (loaded with blank ammunition, of course) in the direction of Hutchins’s camera with her manning the camera, whether crew members in the chain of custody of Baldwin’s gun inspected the gun according to movie industry safety protocols, and whether there was any lapse, even for a moment, in that chain of custody.

Regular Training Reduces Risk

People who train seriously with firearms load, unload, and otherwise handle firearms so frequently that they must adhere to safety rules religiously, lest Murphy’s Law force a mishap. In training and competition events, participants are frequently required to unload firearms while observed by supervisory personnel, and go through various steps to demonstrate beyond any doubt that their guns are unloaded.

Serious gun owners don’t follow safety rules only most of the time, or when they feel like it, or when someone else is looking, or when they’re not in a hurry, or when they’re not distracted. They do things correctly each and every time. This is because doing things the safe way is more safe, and because by doing things correctly every time, they program themselves to do those things even if tired or distracted.

No one is born knowing how to handle firearms safely. Liking guns is not the same as knowing how to handle them. Even having owned guns for many years, and having shot guns many times, is not proof of knowing how to handle firearms correctly. The right to keep and bear arms is, at a last resort, our most important right, thus it’s one that should be exercised with the utmost care and attention to detail.

6 Things We Just Learned About The Supreme Court’s Gun Rights Case,"Last week the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the first gun rights case to reach the high court in more than a decade. The case, New York State Rifle and Pistol Assoc. v. Bruen, concerns the constitutionality of New York’s law banning the carrying of handguns outside the home for self-defense, absent a license—something the state will only issue if the applicant establishes a unique need for self-defense.

For an overview of the case, read here. A more in-depth analysis of both the case and the current state of Second Amendment jurisprudence is available here. For six take-aways from the argument, read along.

1. New York Concedes The Second Amendment Secures an Individual’s Right to Bear Arms Outside the Home

When the individual New Yorkers challenging the law, Robert Nash and Brandon Koch, along with the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, first asked the Supreme Court to hear their appeal, they sought to entice the high court to take the case by stressing how important the underlying constitutional principle at issue is, writing: “Perhaps the single most important unresolved Second Amendment question remaining” after Heller and McDonald established the individual right to bear arms, “is whether the Second Amendment secures the individual right to bear arms for self-defense where confrontations often occur: outside the home.”

Not only was that question unanswered by the Supreme Court in Heller and McDonald, but after Heller and McDonald the lower courts disagreed on the scope of the Second Amendment outside of one’s house.

But last Monday’s argument made the issue a non-issue, with New York conceding the question. The “history is so clear that New York no longer contests that carrying a handgun outside of the home for purposes of self-defense is constitutionally protected activity,” Paul Clement, the attorney arguing on behalf of the petitioners challenging the state’s restrictive licensing law, stressed during oral argument.

2. Nice Little Right—I Mean, Privilege—You’ve Got There

While New York conceded the Second Amendment applies beyond one’s threshold, Solicitor General Barbara Underwood quickly forgot that the Bill of Rights protects rights—it doesn’t define privileges. For instance, in discussing the regulation of firearms outside the home, Underwood started to say that “these regulations are all an effort to accommodate the right,” but then backtracked, saying the regulations seek to “respect the right of self-defense.”

The slip of the tongue was telling, however: It means New York state doesn’t truly view the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms as a right, but as a privilege it will accommodate — when governmental officials deem it appropriate.

Justice Samuel Alito exposed this reality more clearly when he asked New York’s solicitor general whether an employee leaving a New York City building at midnight had a right under the state’s licensing scheme to carry a concealed weapon if she feared walking home through a high-crime area. Underwood acknowledged that under the New York licensing scheme, the cleaning woman would not be entitled to a permit.

“How is that consistent with the core right to self-defense, which is protected by the Second Amendment?” Justice Alito countered.

“Because the core right to self-defense doesn’t . . . allow for all to be armed for all possible confrontations in all places,” New York’s attorney replied.

While true, the response ignores the reality of New York’s position, which Justice Alito spelled out: Celebrities, retired police officers, and judges can carry guns, but not “the kind of ordinary people who have a real, felt need to carry a gun to protect themselves.”

Several times throughout the argument, the lawyer for those challenging New York’s law stressed the same point, telling the justices: “In order to exercise a constitutional right that New York is willing to concede extends outside the home, you have to show that you have an atypical need to exercise the right that distinguishes you from the general community. That describes a privilege. It does not describe a constitutional right.”

3. Feels Matter More Than Truth for Some Justices

Sadly, the state of New York was not the only one viewing Second Amendment rights as second class—so were several of the justices. In this regard, Justice Stephen Breyer proved the most transparent of the Democrat-appointed justices, pivoting between the statistics presented by social “scientists” and his discomfort with guns.

What is New York “supposed to say,” Breyer asked early on: “You can carry a concealed gun around the streets or the town or outside just for fun?” “I mean, they are dangerous, guns,” he added. Justice Breyer later returned to this point, noting “a concealed weapon” “is a dangerous thing,” and “you want to carry a concealed weapon, you go shooting it around and somebody gets killed.”

Justice Breyer brought home his point by noting some of the amicus curiae briefs by “social scientists” that claimed, statistically, the more liberal a government is “in allowing people to carry concealed weapons who are good character people and there is a greater risk of crime or harm, where that happens, there are more deaths of innocent people.”

Brian Fletcher of the U.S. Department of Justice encouraged this line of “reasoning” during his time arguing on behalf of the federal government as an amicus curiae, or friend of the court, in support of New York’s restrictive licensing law. “What I can tell you is that we do share the concern behind the New York law, which is the concern that having more guns on the street does escalate — does complicate and increase the danger inherent in citizen/law enforcement encounters,” he said.

In his rebuttal, though, while arguing on behalf of the petitioners seeking the ability to carry handguns in self-defense Clement told the court—specifically addressing Justice Breyer—that for “empirical evidence,” the court should look at the “English brief.”

The “English brief” referred to the amicus curiae brief filed by Professor William English. In that brief, English noted that he has “conducted the largest-ever nationally representative survey of firearms owners in order to estimate reliably the frequency of firearm carriage and use for self-defense.” The Georgetown University professor also recently “authored the first statistical study utilizing estimates of state carry permits issued each year in order to accurately assess the effects of shall-issue laws—also known as right-to-carry laws—on violent crime and murder rates.”

As Clement highlighted, the English brief provides empirical evidence that negates the running narrative that the more legal guns on the street, the more crime. What you see, if statistics are done right, Clement noted, is that there is no difference in the crime rate, and “the only difference you really see is that people who have a handgun for self-defense end up with a better outcome. They’re not shot. They’re — they’re not made victims.”

4. New York Twisted Itself Into a Paradox

How the justices handle the competing statistics in the Supreme Court’s eventual opinion will prove entertaining, but likely not as entertaining as the pretzel New York twisted itself into in trying to justify its blanket ban on licenses for all except those who can prove an individual need to self-defense.

Throughout the argument, Solicitor General Underwood stressed that New York’s licensing scheme was necessary because the government did not want guns in densely populated areas of the state, such as New York City, while in “back country areas,” the carrying of concealed weapons was not as problematic since no one was around.

Justice Roberts was quick to point out, however, that Heller relied on the right to self defense as a basis for its reading of the Second Amendment and that need is most acute in a high-crime area in New York City.

“If you’re out in the woods, presumably, it’s pretty unlikely that you’re going to run into someone who’s going to rob you on the street,” Roberts reasoned, continuing: “On the other hand, there are places in a densely populated city where it’s more likely that that’s where you’re going to need a gun for self-defense . . . And it seems to me that what you’re saying is that’s probably the last place that someone’s going to get a permit to carry a gun.”

Underwood countered that, “Where there is dense population, there is also the deterrent of lots of people and there is the availability of law enforcement.” The contradiction did not escape Justice Roberts, though: “It’s paradoxical that you say a place is a high-crime area, but don’t worry about it because there are a lot of police around.” After all, Justice Roberts then quipped, “How many muggings take place in the forest?”

Justice Alito also pointed out the problem with the state’s purported concern that it didn’t want a lot of guns in New York City. “There are a lot of armed people on the streets of New York and in the subways late at night right now, aren’t there?” the justice asked. At first, Underwood claimed she didn’t “know that there are a lot of armed people,” but after realizing his point, she acknowledged, “There are people with illegal guns, if that’s what you’re referring to.”

“How many illegal guns were seized by the New York Police Department last year?” Justice Alito pushed. While she didn’t have a number, Underwood acknowledged that “it’s a substantial number.” But while “they’re walking around the streets,” Justice Alito queried, “the ordinary hard-working, law-abiding people I mentioned, they can’t be armed?”

Here the state’s attorney returned to the emotional plea, noting that the “idea of proliferating arms on the subway is precisely, I think, what terrifies a great many people.” The fear factor may sell gun control to a mass market of moms, but it tells the court nothing of the constitutionality of New York’s licensing scheme.

5. Text, History, and Tradition, or Something Else

How, then, will the court analyze the constitutionality of New York’s licensing scheme?

Throughout the argument, the court focused on the “text, history, and tradition” of the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms. But for anyone listening (or reading the transcript), what exactly was the history and tradition at the time of the Founding, or later when the 14th Amendment was ratified—which period was the appropriate one to consider, Justice Thomas asked—was a muddle. More on that shortly.

In addition to the “text, history, and tradition,” test discussed throughout last week’s argument, however, lower courts have applied or considered other standards, as Justice Neil Gorsuch stressed. “Some lower courts have refused to apply the history test, for example,” Justice Gorsuch noted, saying “they will not extend Heller outside the home until this Court does.”

Other courts have applied strict scrutiny, he noted, a standard of review that requires the government to have a compelling interest for a law to pass constitutional muster, and then only if the law is narrowly tailored to that interest. Still other courts, Gorsuch added, have suggested an “intermediate scrutiny,” that looks to whether there is an important governmental interest and if so, if the law is substantially related to that interest.

What standard should we apply, he then asked? The attorneys all seemed to agree that the appropriate analysis was to consider the text, history, and tradition of the Second Amendment and then, if that analysis proved insufficient, the court should turn to the scrutiny analysis. Unsurprisingly, the petitioners sought review under strict scrutiny, while the government pushed for review based on the easier-to-satisfy intermediate scrutiny standard.

No matter the approach taken, however, the Supreme Court needs to clear up the question for the lower courts, as ten-plus years have left the lower courts confused—some purposefully so, because of a desire to uphold gun restrictions.

6. Rights for the Win—But How Big?

While there was some discussion on a governing standard of review, the majority of the justices seemed focused on the “text, history, and tradition” analysis set forth by Heller and MacDonald as the appropriate approach for judging the constitutionality of the law. From there, the breakdown seemed to fall with Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Breyer all reading the history of the Second Amendment as providing New York the power to ban the possession of handguns outside the house absent an applicant establishing a specific need of self-defense.

The remaining six justices all seemed more inclined to strike the statute, although with varying levels of tells for how they would vote. This bodes well for a win for the right to keep and bear arms, but how big is unclear.

The Supreme Court could provide a detailed analysis that not only specifies the text, history, and tradition analysis as controlling, but also provides for the highest level of scrutiny for laws for which the text, history, and tradition provide no answer. But even just clarifying that the text, history, and tradition test adopted by Heller and MacDonald governs will go a long way toward returning the Second Amendment to its rightful place in the realm of fundamental rights.

If that happens, future cases will need to explore the contours of that right. Hopefully, the high court will not wait another decade before next delving into the question.

Biden Admin Is Stockpiling Millions Of Gun Owner Records,"The Biden administration is using the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to collect and store millions of gun owners’ records that could be used to swiftly carry out President Joe Biden’s anti-Second Amendment wishes, The Washington Free Beacon reported.

According to the documents obtained by the Free Beacon, Biden’s ATF collected 54.7 million out-of-business paper records and 887,000 electronic records detailing gun transactions and other private firearm information in the 2021 fiscal year alone. These records are reportedly kept in a federal warehouse managed by the ATF in West Virginia.

The large-scale stockpiling not only signals the Biden administration’s eagerness to crack down on gun owners across the nation but has also concerned gun store owners that the ATF is overstepping its bounds by creating a federal database recording gun owner information. The creation of a national directory is strictly prohibited under the Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986, but an ATF spokesman claimed to the Free Beacon that “those out of business records do not constitute an initiation or continuation of any federal gun registry.”

While gun shops are required under the Gun Control Act of 1968 to turn over their records to the ATF when they go out of business, they are not required to keep their reports beyond a 20-year period. The Biden administration and anti-gun groups, however, want to change that and are largely in favor of heavier federal oversight that mandates a digitized registry that can be searched.

If a national database is created, thousands of gun owners could be sought out by the administration to “register or destroy” any firearms or related equipment that the Democrat administration seeks to restrict or even ban.

Rittenhouse Prosecutors Destroyed Their Case With Their Star Witness,"Jurors in the murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse have now got to be wondering to themselves, “Um, why are we here again?”

Prosecutors on Monday called for the testimony from their most important witness. It turns out he may have cost them everything.

Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, is one of the three men Rittenhouse shot that night of race rioting last year in Kenosha, Wis. Unlike the other two, Grosskreutz survived.

The state apparently called Grosskreutz to the stand so he could tell the tale of his realized dreams of becoming a paramedic, how he had set out in Kenosha only to offer medical aid to innocent protesters who needed it, and that he ended up meeting a grisly and unfortuate fate after happening upon the firing end of a crazed vigilante’s AR-15.

It can’t be overstated just how disastrous his testimony ended up being. It didn’t even take cross-examination by the defense for Grosskreutz to reveal himself to be either a liar or a lunatic.

As the jury has seen multiple times on video already, on the night of the events on trial, Grosskreutz was running toward Rittenhouse, who was heading in the direction of police after having shot another man, Joseph Rosenbaum. After Rittenhouse was punched in the head by a rioter giving chase, he fell to the ground.

At that point, and in succession, one man jump-kicks Rittenhouse to the face (he is shot at, and possibly hit before running away); another hits Rittenhouse in the head with a skateboard while trying to grab Rittenhouse’s gun (he is fatally shot); and finally, another man, Grosskreutz, makes his own attempt at grabbing Rittenhouse’s firearm, while Grosskreutz also carries a pistol.

Asked by lead prosecutor Thomas Binger, who is supposed to be portraying the witness in the utmost favorable light, about roughly when it was that Grosskreutz drew his gun, Grosskreutz said it wasn’t until he can be seen approaching Rittenhouse on the ground.

Binger: “Before this moment, had you drawn your firearm?”

Grosskreutz: “No.”

Binger: “Where was it?”

Grosskreutz: “I keep my pistol holstered in the small of my back.”

Binger: “But don’t you have it in your hand at this point?”

Grosskreutz: “I can’t see from this video.”

After a little back and forth, Binger apparently realized there was a problem with his witness’s testimony.

Binger: “I want to back up for a second, Mr. Grosskreutz, because we have other video that shows you pulling your gun out before those shots [at Rittenhouse’s pursuers] are fired. Um… So, do you remember specifically— were you intending, when you pulled your gun out, were you intending to use it?”

Well, that’s awkward. But things were just getting started. The real show was during defense attorney Corey Chirafisi’s questioning. Only minutes into cross-examination, when Chirafisi was simply asking the witness to affirm basic facts from submitted evidence, Grosskreutz dialed up the crazy.

Reading from a statement Grosskreutz had previously given to law enforcement, Chirafisi said, “It says, ‘Some time during the incident, my gen-four Glock 27 that had a belt clip attached fell off my waist.’ That’s a lie, right?”

Grosskreutz: “I wouldn’t say that’s a lie.”

Defense: “You didn’t take your Glock out of your back and run with it?”

Grosskreutz: “I did.”

Defense: “So, it didn’t fall off your waist. It was in your hand.”

Grosskreutz: “That’s correct.”

Defense: “So, you would say that’s not a lie?”

Grosskreutz: “No, I would say it isn’t.”

Defense: “And you told that to multiple officers. Isn’t that true?”

Grosskreutz: “I don’t know.”

Defense: “The next sentence [of your statement to authorities]: ‘I told multiple officers that I dropped my firearm.’ Right?”

Grosskreutz: “Correct.”

Defense: “You didn’t drop your firearm. You were chasing Mr. Rittenhouse with your gun, right? You were chasing him with your gun, yes?”

Grosskreutz: “No.”

Defense: “You didn’t chase him down Sheridan Road, pulling your gun, chasing after him. That’s a lie? You’re saying that didn’t happen?

Grosskreutz: “I’m not saying that didn’t happen, but I wasn’t chasing the defendant.”

All of that conversation actually happened in court. Grosskreutz, the state’s witness, both denied what’s demonstrably seen on video and admitted to what’s demonstrably seen on video. And then after having admitted to it, he would deny it again. That happened several times throughout his testimony. The state’s co-counsel appeared in agony as it happened.

If I were a juror, how could I not be thinking to myself, “Why hasn’t this case been dismissed?” At least the attempted homicide charge as it relates to Grosskreutz, who went on to testify that Rittenhouse had aimed at him without firing a shot until Grosskreutz lunged at him with his own gun drawn.

Defense: “When you were standing three to five feet from him with your arms up in the air, he never fired, right?”

Grosskreutz: “Correct.”

Defense: “It wasn’t until you pointed your gun at him, advanced on him, with your gun — now your hands down — pointed at him, that he fired at you, right?

Grosskreutz: “Correct.”

There was a lot more to the testimony that should have been absolutely humiliating to the prosecutors, but you get the gist.

Grosskreutz was supposed to be the living account for why jurors should believe that Rittenhouse was senselessly shooting people, rather than acting in self-defense. Whatever Grosskreutz was, he wasn’t that.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/11/09/how-kyle-rittenhouse-prosecutors-destroyed-their-own-case-with-their-own-star-witness/,2021-11-09
"Kyle Rittenhouse Prosecutor's Case: Rioting Good, Self Defense Bad","If you follow the prosecution’s case against Kyle Rittenhouse, the only logical end is the assertion that self-defense is almost never an option and visiting the scene of a riot is only okay if you are there to burn property.

There are other facets to lead prosecutor Thomas Binger’s arguments — that Rittenhouse, 18, was in illegal possession of a gun, that he showed up in Kenosha, Wis., that night of violent rioting because he was pursuing danger, and that he could have easily done things differently. But the bulk of Binger’s questioning of Rittenhouse on Wednesday relied on the assumption that unless a person has physically touched you, and if you were at the scene for reasons not in line with others present, there is no reason to protect yourself with force that may prove deadly.

Rittenhouse faces charges for the murders of Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, as well as the intentional homicide of Gaige Grosskreutz. It’s not disputed, and it’s on video, that Rittenhouse shot all three, and only Grosskreutz survived.

It’s also on video and backed up by eyewitness testimony that each of the three men was running after Rittenhouse and making attempts to take his gun. Grosskreutz, who was armed at the time, himself said he tried grabbing Rittenhouse’s AR-15.

Binger played the videos, which the jury has seen multiple times already, and acknowledged in questioning that Rittenhouse was being chased that night in August 2020. But his emphasis has been that: 1) Rosenbaum, the shooting of whom set off the whole episode, never physically touched Rittenhouse and 2) that Rittenhouse’s presence, by its very nature, was needlessly provocative.

The absurdity was captured in one specific exchange between Binger and Rittenhouse.

Binger: “So, you saw someone who was trying to put out a fire, who got assaulted?”

Rittenhouse: “Yes.”

Binger: “But, if you’re going to help people, why would you expect anyone would try and hurt you?”

Rittenhouse: “I don’t know. Somebody did try to hurt me and I was helping people.”

Binger has apparently never prepared for an unexpected disaster. He may not even buckle his seatbelt, I can’t be sure.

Rittenhouse testified that he was in Kenosha that night at the request of a car lot owner who had been looking for men to protect his business, which had previously suffered damage from nights of rioting. He said he brought his AR-15 and a medic kit for the purpose of patrolling the area and offering care to anyone injured.

He said that beforehand he had seen destruction done to the city, where his father lives and where Rittenhouse had been working as a lifeguard. That’s why he brought the gun — in the event that he needed it for his own protection. There had been, after all, reports of physical assaults against police and a business owner in addition to the property damage.

But Binger adopted a tone to suggest he was utterly confounded as to why anyone would show up in Kenosha to offer aid while armed with a gun.

Binger: “I asked you why you brought the gun. You said you needed it for protection. I said, ‘Protection against what?’ You said that you didn’t think you needed protection. I’m confused. Can you help me understand why you’re telling us you needed a gun for protection but you didn’t think you needed protection?

Rittenhouse, who is apparently lightyears ahead of Binger in IQ: “I brought the gun for my protection but what I was saying is I didn’t think I would have to use the gun and end up defending myself.”

Binger is presumably also confused by people who purchase home insurance. Why do they need that unless they plan on setting their own homes on fire?!

The prosecutor was equally stupid in making the case that Rittenhouse was at fault for being in a place he had the right to be, but shouldn’t have been.

At one point, Binger asked, “You know that you’re running into a crowd that is not friendly to you, right?” and also, “Were you surprised a crowd would react that way when they just saw you shoot someone?”

The implication is that Rittenhouse, having shot someone who was chasing him, should have known that all of this was coming because he made the choice to show up at a riot.

He did make that choice, but so did everyone else who showed up to loot, vandalize, and torch private and public property. Rittenhouse’s reason for showing up — to limit the damage — just happened to be unpopular. That doesn’t make him a criminal. It makes him a dissident.

When you reach the logical conclusion of the prosecution’s case, that’s Rittenhouse’s crime. He was in a dangerous place where the rioters — otherwise known by Binger as “the good guys” — didn’t want him, and therefore Rittenhouse was the instigator.

It’s preposterous. The jury probably knows that.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/11/11/kyle-rittenhouse-prosecutors-case-rioting-good-self-defense-bad/,2021-11-11
A Shift In Constitutional Interpretation Could Overturn Anti-Gun Laws,"In a current case before the U.S. Supreme Court, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, gun owners are challenging New York’s “proper cause law” for concealed-carry permits. Whereas the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to “keep and bear arms,” New York prohibits the bearing of firearms without a license, granted on a “may issue” basis at the whims of local officials, arbitrarily determining whether a person has a legitimate need for self-defense.

On its face, this law clearly violates the spirit of the Second Amendment. Conservatives arguing to overturn it, however, find themselves in the awkward position of arguing against long-standing conservative principles like constitutional federalism and state sovereignty. Implicitly, in this case, the argument for gun rights relies on a century of progressive precedent known as the “incorporation doctrine.”

Activist courts have used this legal theory to impose left-wing policies top-down onto the states. Conservatives are right to insist on a consistent standard; if the Constitution means no school prayer in Kansas, then it also means the right to carry a gun in New York City.

In a brief to the court, J. Michael Luttig, a former judge of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, argues against overturning New York’s law by pointing to the founders’ view that states were free to regulate the carrying of firearms within their own jurisdictions. His assessment is historically correct, but the continued insistence on this creates a double standard under the law.

The states ratified the Bill of Rights in 1791 to constrain the power of the federal government, not themselves. The First Amendment, for example, prohibits “Congress” from making any “law respecting an establishment of religion,” but early states set their own policies.

Under Thomas Jefferson’s lead in 1786, Virginia became the first state in America to separate church and state, but Massachusetts maintained Congregationalism as its state religion for a half-century post-ratification before adopting the wisdom of the Old Dominion. Rather than resting on the top-down imposition of a federal court, religious freedom won the slow battle of decentralized policy-making among the “laboratories of democracy.”

In 1833, the Supreme Court upheld this principle of federalism in Barron v. Baltimore, finding that states are constrained by their own state constitutions, not the Bill of Rights. In 1925, however, the court instituted the “incorporation doctrine” in a case over free speech (Gitlow v. New York), interpreting the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (adopted after the Civil War) as incorporating the Bill of Rights into the states. In the century since, this doctrine has been cited by federal courts to override wide-ranging state policies on issues ranging from school prayer to gay marriage.

Kevin Gutzman, a constitutional scholar and professor of history at Western Connecticut State University, argues this doctrine is a subversion of the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment, which was intended narrowly to guarantee rights for emancipated slaves in the postwar South. Additionally, Gutzman asserts the doctrine has twisted the Bill of Rights from a restriction into a grant of federal power.

Whether or not the incorporation doctrine is a progressive perversion of constitutional law, today it is baked into a century of judicial precedent. Applied to all manner of left-wing causes, until District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008, it had never been applied to gun rights.

In that case, the Supreme Court overturned Washington D.C.’s handgun ban, ruling that states and districts cannot prohibit the individual right to keep arms in the home. Today, with a 6-3 conservative majority, it seems certain the court will extend that thinking to the right to bear arms.

“That’s just not how we do constitutional rights,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh during oral arguments, referring to New York’s policy of “blanket discretion” for government officials to accept or deny requests for a carry permit. Chief Justice John Roberts went further, calling the entire premise of requiring a license to exercise your right “unusual in the context of the Bill of Rights.” Under the incorporation doctrine, they are both certainly correct.

To apply constitutional precedent consistently, the Supreme Court has three options. First, they can strike down New York’s proper cause law, requiring all states with licensing schemes to establish objective “shall issue” criteria (as currently exists in Florida and Ohio). Second, they can go one step further and strike down licensing requirements in their entirety, establishing Constitutional Carry across the country (as currently exists in 21 states, including Maine and Texas). Finally, they could take the nuclear option: overturning the incorporation doctrine completely, allowing New York to keep its anti-gun law unchanged, and restoring federalism across the board in America.

Anything short of these options would amount to a double-standard of the law.

"No, The SCOTUS Ruling On Abortion Doesn’t Affect California Gun Laws","You would never know it from the reaction of President Joe Biden and Gov. Gavin Newsom, but the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision on Friday about the Texas abortion case didn’t overturn Roe v. Wade. It dealt with arcane legal precedent over who can sue and be sued – what is called “standing” – and the constitutionality of Texas’ law is far from settled. On Saturday, hopefully because Newsom hadn’t yet read or understood the decision, he announced he would now use the ruling to help Californians enforce gun control laws.

SCOTUS is letting private citizens in Texas sue to stop abortion?! If that's the precedent then we'll let Californians sue those who put ghost guns and assault weapons on our streets. If TX can ban abortion and endanger lives, CA can ban deadly weapons of war and save lives. https://t.co/N5Iur9PEUZ — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) December 12, 2021

Biden and Newsom’s comments are more likely to gin up anger from their supporters than have anything to do with the Supreme Court or the law.

Texas’s controversial law lets private citizens sue anyone who “aids or abets” most types of abortions performed after about six weeks. The only issue decided by the court is who you can sue.

Abortion rights advocates tried suing various state officials to get the law declared unconstitutional, but the court stopped their lawsuit because Texas state officials aren’t the enforcement for the law. The court has long held that you can only sue those who have directly harmed you.

The decision won’t stop people from further challenging the Texas law. Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion said those seeking to overturn the law couldn’t sue people such as state-court clerks who handle the paperwork by those suing or the state-court judges who decide those disputes. In a dissent authored by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by the three leftist justices, they agreed that state-court judges couldn’t be sued, but that court clerks could be.

But the ruling is hardly the end of this debate. Gorsuch’s decision said pre-enforcement lawsuits are allowed, and it explicitly lays out who the abortion advocates can sue in state courts. For example, eight of the justices agreed they can go forward with a lawsuit against state medical licensing officials.

Newsom wants to use this private legal action to enforce California’s ban on so-called “assault weapons” and privately made guns (what gun control advocates call “ghost guns”). But his whole strategy is a bit of a mystery. California already bans anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault weapons or ghost gun kits or parts. Their assault weapon ban has been in place for decades. There is no evidence that gun dealers in California have continued selling these banned weapons.

In addition, the Democrat-dominated Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld all of California’s gun control laws, so this indirect method of enforcement through private parties isn’t even necessary. The whole point of the Texas law is to avoid using state law enforcement to restrict abortions.

A number of legal experts believe courts will eventually strike down Texas’s law. In any case, Gorsuch’s opinion allows pre-enforcement challenges, and it has implications for what Newsom wants to do.

Pre-enforcement challenges will avoid any “chilling effect” on gun ownership. In addition, unlike the Texas law that targets anyone who “aids or abets” abortion, Newsom’s limiting his proposal to just manufacturers, distributors, or sellers means that he will be up against businesses who will be less intimidated by litigation costs.

One aspect missing from the whole debate is that the private enforcement of laws is hardly new. It is used for everything from minimum wage laws to rent control.

For example, if employers pay workers less than the minimum wage, the workers can sue to get back double the underpayment of wages. If a worker earns $5 per hour when the minimum is $7.25, he’d have about $4,500 in underpayments for a year — and a $9,000 payoff for suing. He will get compensated for however long he gets underpaid.

As a result, only a tiny fraction of 1 percent of Americans covered by the minimum wage are paid too little, and these rare violations mainly involve mistakes by employers, not outright lawbreaking. The only “cops” needed are fewer than 1,000 federal agents who are busy enforcing recordkeeping, child-labor standards, over time, and other labor regulations. Similarly, rent control laws are enforced by the renter being able to sue for overpayment of rent.

The entire debate over Newsom’s enforcement of gun control at this point is more theatrics than logic or legal substance. But that shouldn’t be surprising. Politicians can never pass up the opportunity to energize their base.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/12/14/no-the-scotus-ruling-on-abortion-doesnt-affect-california-gun-laws/,2021-12-14
How Vaccine Mandates Caused Dangerous Hospital Care Shortages,"Andrea Babinski never imagined she would be forced to get a vaccine to keep her nursing job.

“When people would say stuff like, ‘Oh, mask mandates today and slippery slope to vaccine mandates tomorrow,’ I thought, ‘No, that’s crazy. That sounds like a conspiracy theory, like wacko people,'” she said.

For the medical-surgical nurse who worked at Gundersen Health Systems for 12 years, it was never about politics. Due to several autoimmune issues, Babinski decided medically the shot was not the best decision for her.

She told me this over the phone, not from a hospital break room but from her home, because on Nov. 16, Babinski was fired from the La Crosse, Wisconsin hospital for declining to take a Covid shot.

Babinski isn’t an anomaly. She’s one of an untold number of health-care workers and other hospital staff across the country who have been denied basic informed consent where it should be valued most, and have thus either resigned or been fired for their private medical decisions.

Meanwhile, while the expert class, COVID hysterics, and even the president of the United States repeatedly rattle off talking points about overflowing ICUs and the “pandemic of the unvaccinated,” they ignore the real crisis plaguing hospitals and their role in creating it.

That crisis is a massively understaffed hospital system as qualified and willing-to-work medical personnel have been thanklessly terminated. Thanks to coercive vaccine mandates, which the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld, hospitals are hemorrhaging employees and patients are not receiving care they desperately need.

Inside Hospital Walls

Gundersen Health Systems illuminates this widespread problem. Thanks to bad reporting and a severe lack of transparency, this Wisconsin health system and its egregious management have flown under the radar.

Former Gundersen employees, who were terminated as a result of the mandate, know what life is like inside the hospital walls. They watched dirty laundry pile up and eventually be thrown away when there were no hands to tend to it. They saw the cafeteria whittle its offerings to PB&Js when there was nobody to staff it. They witnessed beds go unfilled because the qualified nurses who could have tended to ailing patients — and did unflinchingly through the most serious months of the pandemic — were fired for their personal medical decisions.

It started in August when Gundersen implemented a staff vaccine mandate, which employees first learned about not through the hospital but when it was leaked to the press. Gundersen’s official announcement was accompanied by the claim that about 85 percent of staff had already been vaccinated, a statistic the media uncritically parroted.

The problem is that it apparently wasn’t a real statistic. According to multiple former employees, the hospital didn’t learn about staff vaccination statuses until after touting that percentage. Babinski said staff members were threatened with termination if they didn’t report their vaccination status through Gundersen’s Covid Attestation Form by early September, weeks after the hospital had declared what percentage of staff had gotten the shot.

Gundersen did not respond to The Federalist’s inquiries about how it calculated 85 percent.

At the beginning of November, after the mandate deadline, Gundersen and local news reported “30 out of 9,000 employees terminated over vaccine rule,”and “62 resigned rather than receive COVID-19 vaccine.” Reports also noted that “[n]inety-nine percent of Gundersen staff are fully vaccinated or in the process of becoming fully vaccinated.”

But this also apparently wasn’t true. First, many people resigned long before the hospital began terminating, due to poor working conditions, low wages, and frustration with the mandate.

“It was like rats jumping off a sinking ship,” Babinski said. “We had hundreds of people that I [know] personally now … people that just quit leading up to the mandate. They were never given a chance to say the reason they quit, so I don’t know where they got their number.”

Many of these employees were people Babinski had gotten to know by rubbing shoulders with them at mandate-related protests. Others she connected with in a private Facebook group for Gundersen workers against mandatory vaccination, a group The Federalist confirmed has more than 600 members.

Gundersen also failed to grant exit interviews, according to former employees who were denied them and others who were simply never asked why they left. This means the hospital would have no way of knowing how many resignations were a result of vaccine refusal.

Worse, Gundersen was still actively hemorrhaging employees at that time, through continued terminations and resignations, meaning those early numbers are undercounted.

“That was a huge kick in the gut because a lot of us weren’t even fired yet,” Babinski told The Federalist, recounting what it was like to see those reports while knowing she wasn’t among the 30 but would soon be terminated.

It’s a Lot More Than That…

Other metrics also indicate those numbers were dramatically undercounted.

For instance, take a look at the increase in job openings following the announcement of the vaccine mandate. Notice how the positions for CNAs within Gundersen Health Systems jumped from 53 in mid-September to 60 just a few weeks later. It’s also possible these postings are for multiple vacancies, meaning if there’s a need for six day-shift nurses in the cardio-pulmonary unit, for example, the job might only be listed once.

Since then, Gundersen’s vacancies have only continued to skyrocket. Postings for CNAs have now jumped to 85, and posted vacancies for nurses spiked from 89 after the mandate was announced to 141 as of Wednesday, a more than 58 percent increase that occurred mostly after the reports of only 30 terminations and 62 resignations

This staff hemorrhaging was on top of other worker shortages resulting from alleged poor wages and working conditions. Nursing staff watched as environmental assistants, who are responsible for custodial duties, left their posts in droves after their wages were lowered in 2021.

“Why work for Gundersen when you can easily make more money at Culvers, Kwik Trip or Walmart?” one RN wrote in a community impact statement. She had been granted a religious exemption but was so disgusted by the letter’s language that she resigned anyway. This RN reported that as a result of low-wage staff jumping ship, nurses had to use the bare minimum of linens, even going so far as to craft makeshift pillowcases out of hospital gowns.

“This shortage of low-wage staff had direct impacts on patient care. Patients would go without clean linens and towels,” David Anderson, who was a nurse in Gundersen’s Behavioral Health Unit for nearly a decade before being fired in November as a result of the vaccine mandate, told The Federalist.

“During one of my shifts as a charge nurse, my staff had to give patients washcloths to use as towels, because washcloths were the only clean laundry to be found,” he added. “Trashes around the hospital were overflowing, floors were dirty, and laundry sat in hampers for days with nobody to wash it — hospital laundry, festering with feces, urine, vomit, and blood. Tens of thousands of dollars of it had to be thrown away.”

Trying to mitigate these severe staffing shortages, Gundersen sought volunteers among its medical professionals to help with hospital cleaning, meaning that after it dropped wages for environmental assistants, nurses could make their normal rate of anywhere from $32 to $50 per hour for doing janitorial work.

‘How Much Worse Is It Going to Get?’

The shortages extended to nurses as well, long before the vaccine mandate made them much worse.

“Within the hospital, nursing shortages have led to unsafe staffing situations where nurses and CNAs are being forced to take more patients than what is safe due to there not being enough nursing staff present. Patients are being forgotten on bed pans or are falling because there is simply not enough staff to safely take care of them,” wrote the RN who resigned after acquiring a religious exemption.

She said that one weekend in October, Gundersen had to shut down a dozen beds in the hospital due to nursing shortages. She added that the hospital has also canceled heart valve replacement surgeries because it didn’t have enough staff to take care of post-op patients.

“Now just imagine, if this is the current staffing reality at Gundersen, how much worse is it

going to get when Gundersen fires hundreds more in November due to the vaccine mandate?” she said.

The Post-Screw-Up Scramble

As a result of the largely self-inflicted staffing crisis, Gundersen has been scrambling for workers and trying to find loopholes.

“We cannot simply create more RNs,” came the desperate email from corporate, reviewed by The Federalist, asking the hospital’s medical-surgical nurses to move shifts to plug holes. Even some terminated nurses were still on the open-shift texting list, which blew up non-stop with urgent requests.

Now Gundersen and other local hospitals, including Mayo Clinic Health System, are calling on the National Guard for help due to this self-imposed shortage of staff and thus beds — a shortage they’re simultaneously blaming on the vaccinated being out with the virus and unvaccinated staff who didn’t obey the mandate, a stunning lack of self-awareness.

“It’s been very challenging to try to staff the units with staff being out with Covid or not being compliant to being vaccinated,” said Renee Groth, a nurse manager at Mayo.

One nurse who worked at both Mayo and Gunderson throughout the pandemic told The Federalist that Mayo is even worse with its aggression toward unvaccinated employees. Gunderson is now throwing job offers to staff members who were fired or resigned from Mayo over the same types of mandates.

In an attempt to make up for the huge staffing holes, Gundersen is also bringing in travel nurses after kicking their own dedicated staff to the curb. It’s a convenient loophole for the hospital; after firing unvaccinated staff, it can then use unvaccinated travel nurses because they’re technically employed by a travel agency, not directly by Gundersen.

Many full-time nurses who lost their jobs have since become travel nurses or are considering doing so because they can maintain their medical freedom but still work — plus, travel nurses receive double or triple the wage rates of a normal nurse. This, of course, raises questions about what will happen to health care costs when prices are unnecessarily inflated.

Power Before Patients

This is all to be expected from hospitals that go along with absurd medical edicts from on high that they can see are decimating standards of care. When asked during a September leadership town hall about his plan to help departments that could lose upwards of 25 percent of their staff due to the vaccine mandate, Gundersen CEO Scott Rathgaber responded:

“Hear me say that if we have to decrease the ability to deliver services in order to preserve the staff that we have, we will do so in the short term until we can build that back up. … If we do have staffing shortages, we will have to adjust ultimately what services we can provide. … It’s as simple as math, and having enough people to do the work.”

In other words, if Gundersen had to turn needy patients away or shut down medical services in order to force performative morality through vaccine compliance, that was a price it was willing to pay. Except the hospital hasn’t ultimately paid it; its staff and patients have.

So are medical workers and patients across the rest of the country. Gundersen is just the tip of the iceberg.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/10/how-vaccine-mandates-caused-dangerous-hospital-care-shortages-in-wisconsin/,2022-02-10
Gun Control Groups Target JR-15 Rifle Designed To Teach Kids Safety,"The most recent target of gun control activists’ ire is the newly announced JR-15. If you’re not familiar, the JR-15 is an AR-15 style rifle designed by the WEE1 Tactical company as part of its mission to “develop a line of shooting platforms that will safely help adults introduce children to the shooting sports.”

The JR-15 is a lightweight, shortened, .22 long rifle version of an AR-15 style rifle. The rifle features a “tamper resistant safety that puts the adult in control of the firearm’s safety switch.” It also ships with a one-round magazine (something that gun control groups would love to make mandatory for all firearms).

In every way, the rifle is designed to be a safe way for parents and mentors to teach children about the responsible operation of firearms from a young age. It will undoubtedly serve as a key development in increasing gun safety in the United States for generations to come.

But gun control activists don’t care about safety. Instead, supposed gun-safety groups have demonized the launch of the JR-15. The Violence Policy Center has called the product’s launch a “grotesque joke,” and Kris Brown, the president of the Brady Campaign, responded that “[g]uns should never be marketed or catered to children, full stop.”

A Losing Battle

These activists don’t care to learn anything about the product, or about the benefits of teaching children safe firearm ownership from a young age. Rather, they have taken an all-out offensive to rally support against the JR-15.

So why the push? Maybe, just maybe, it’s because they recognize that they’re fighting a losing battle. Because gun culture is evolving.

With the events of the past two years — including historic riots, pandemic restrictions, and a nationwide spike in murders — we have seen record numbers of first-time gun buyers. Many of them are women, racial minorities, and Democrats. Now, we’re seeing a clearer path to help those new gun owners, and others across the country, teach their children gun safety. That is what poses the real threat to their narrative, not the JR-15.

JR-15’s Features

If these so-called gun safety activists truly cared about gun safety, they would cheer what WEE1 Tactical has achieved. The JR-15 is specifically designed with safety in mind. The shorter length and lighter weight make it much easier and safer for young people to operate the firearm.

Moreover, being chambered in a .22 long rifle (a very small round with little-to-no recoil and a short effective range) gives young firearms users the ability to recognize the potential dangers of firearms, without the same risk as larger calibers.

Instead of the traditional lever-flick AR-15 safety, the JR-15 features an advanced safety, which must be pulled out, using a significant amount of force, and rotated into the locked fire position before the rifle can fire. Finally, the rifle takes proprietary magazines that can be purchased in one-, ten-, or fifteen-round versions.

In other words, the JR-15 is a small-caliber rifle with advanced safety features and small-capacity magazines. In another world, the rifle would be a gun-control advocate’s dream. But because it is aimed at helping children become better, safer, and more responsible gun owners, it has become gun-control advocates’ nightmare.

We need more of today’s youth to learn how to safely operate firearms. Teaching the risks and uses of firearms early removes the mysticism of guns and will undoubtedly reduce youth-related firearm accidents. If safety is your goal, the JR-15 is a step in the right direction.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/14/gun-control-groups-target-jr-15-rifle-designed-to-teach-kids-safety/,2022-02-14
Mexico Sues U.S. Gun Makers For Crime While Fueling Violent Cartels,"Mexico is using U.S. courts to shift blame to gun manufacturers for Mexico’s failure to drag drug cartel leaders and narco-terrorists into its courtrooms. The audacity of the maneuver would be comical if it didn’t have such deadly consequences on both sides of the border.

Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s secretary of foreign affairs, took a victory lap for both himself and the government of Mexico being named The Arms Control Association’s 2021 “Person of the Year.” Ebrarb didn’t earn the distinction because he curbed the illegal gun trafficking, narco-terrorism, and murder that’s plaguing his country. His distinction is mocking America’s judicial system by dragging U.S. firearm manufacturers into court for a $10 billion shakedown that would put America’s gun industry out of business and America’s Second Amendment at the mercy of foreign powers.

Mexico’s government, with the help of the gun control group Brady United, alleges U.S.-based gun manufacturers are negligent in their business practices because Mexican-based drug cartels and narco-terrorists are murdering Mexican citizens. Their lawsuit outrageously claims these companies are knowingly flooding Mexico with illegal guns.

That’s just a plain perversion of basic facts. Moreover, it’s an assault on America’s God-given rights, which, of course, Mexican citizens can’t exercise in their country.

Instead of tackling the rampant crime that has been plaguing Mexico for decades, Ebrard—with the blessing of Andrés Manuel López Obrador and his “Hugs, not bullets” approach to violent drug cartels—is shifting the blame for Mexico’s failures. He’s using U.S. courts to do it, scapegoating a lawful industry that’s the convenient target of the ire of the Biden administration and gun control groups, and subjugating constitutionally protected God-given rights to cover up Mexico’s unwillingness to enforce its own laws.

Mexico’s unchecked violence is directly linked to the illicit drug trade, human trafficking, and organized crime cartels that victimize Mexico’s citizens. Ebrarb and Mexico’s government have shown no willingness to meaningfully face this scourge. Their approach instead is a $10 billion squeeze that is doomed to fail.

The negligent practices Ebrarb says are targeting Mexico start right in Mexico City. Mexico has strict gun control laws, but everyone knows that doesn’t stop the cartels. That’s because corruption fueled by the drug trade has rotted away the rule of law.

Instead, Mexican authorities are working with the cartels. Bribery is a way of life. Mexico is ranked as 124 out of 180 countries on a corruption index by the watchdog Transparency International, putting Mexico on the same level with Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan.

Ebrarb claims to want to change the way U.S. firearms manufacturers do business. These are the manufacturers that provide firearms to law-abiding Americans, who must pass an FBI background check to purchase these firearms. This was the case more than 39.5 million times in just the past two years in the United States, with nearly 14 million Americans choosing to become lawful gun owners for the first time.

That’s not how the firearm business is done in Mexico. There’s just one gun retailer and that’s in the heart of a Mexican Army base, in the heart of Mexico City. Even then, only small-caliber handguns and shotguns are allowed for purchase.

Narco-terrorist cartels’ preference for military-grade firearms clearly doesn’t come from the inventory available to the American public. Sales of new automatic firearms to the American public were banned in 1986.

The source, it appears, is south of Mexico and overseas. Automatic guns and rocket-propelled grenades follow drug trade routes back to China, Guatemala, and the black markets in Central and South America. South Korean-made grenades have been recovered at drug cartel crime scenes.

All will agree that Mexico is awash in illegally obtained firearms. Law enforcement on the U.S. side continues to target, arrest, and prosecute those illegally trafficking guns across the border, but this isn’t a practice of firearm manufacturers. Rather, the firearms turning up at cartel crime scenes raise serious questions about Mexico’s commitment to stemming corruption and theft within their own military’s ranks.

Mexico’s military is allegedly losing up to 30 percent of its small arms that are purchased from U.S. manufacturers through military contracts. These aren’t firearms available to the general public. They’re only purchased by Mexico’s military. The corruption isn’t limited to the rank-and-file Mexican soldiers. It’s been witnessed at the highest echelons.

Mexican Gen. Juan Ernesto Antonio Bernal Reyes, a former candidate for Mexican defense secretary, was arrested in Oaxaca on extortion charges in December 2021. Mexico’s Secretary of Defense Salvador Cienfuegos was arrested for drug trafficking and money laundering charges and turned over to Mexican authorities, which declined to pursue charges. Mexico only recently levied charges for seven linked to the Obama administration’s ill-fated Operation Fast and Furious that cost the lives of U.S. Border Patrol agents.

Ten years after the illegal gun-running scheme, we are now seeing charges brought against Genaro García Luna, security chief for Mexico’s President Felipe Calderón from 2006-2012, and former Federal Police commander Luis Cardenas Palomino, a close assistant to García Luna and former drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.

García Luna sits in a Texas jail on allegations of protecting Mexican drug gangs. Palomino is sitting in a Mexican jail for torture charges. U.S. authorities also accuse him of taking bribes from the Sinaloa cartel. Guzman escaped twice from Mexican prisons before being captured and extradited to the United States, where he now sits in a federal maximum-security prison.

Ebrarb congratulates himself for pursuing the destruction of God-given rights of Americans and using the U.S. legal system to attempt it. He pats himself on the back for backing United Nations policies that label private ownership of firearms a threat to peace and security.

Ebrarb and the Mexican government would be better served by cleaning up the corruption on their side of the border and enforcing their own laws before subverting Americans’ Second Amendment rights and suing law-abiding gun manufacturers to dictate how they do business. We will keep our rights and protect the industry that provides the means to exercise those rights against foreign governments that can’t—or won’t—protect their own citizens.

Biden’s State Of The Union Promise To ‘Fund Police’ Was Pure Lip Service,"In Tuesday’s State of the Union address, President Joe Biden claimed he wants to restore safety and control crime. He denounced efforts to “defund” the police. But with congressional elections coming up, he lacked any useful proposals.

During the State of the Union, Biden claimed that “the American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption.” However, last year, even liberal fact-checkers acknowledged: the bill “did not stipulate that the relief funding had to be used on police officers or for other law enforcement initiatives.”

Biden’s own Treasury Department summarized the spending this way:

The Rescue Plan will provide needed relief to state, local, and Tribal governments to enable them to continue to support the public health response and lay the foundation for a strong and equitable economic recovery. In addition to helping these governments address the revenue losses they have experienced as a result of the crisis, it will help them cover the costs incurred due responding to the public health emergency and provide support for a recovery – including through assistance to households, small businesses and nonprofits, aid to impacted industries, and support for essential workers.

Where does this mention police or prosecutions as priorities?

Biden’s claims look a real change from what he said during the presidential campaign. Back in July 2020, when asked if Biden supported “redirect[ing] some of the funding for police into social services,” he responded: “Yes, I proposed that kind of reform.”

But you don’t need to go back to the campaign to see how superficial Biden’s words were on Tuesday. See what he said when he went to New York City last month and gave a major address on crime. What did he propose?

Did Biden point out that the Democrats in New York City cut the police budget by $1 billion per year? No.

Did he note how New York’s bail reform has let violent criminals out on the street only to commit more crime? No.

Did he criticize district attorneys in New York City or elsewhere who are not prosecuting violent criminals? No.

Did he express concern over the large numbers of inmates released from jails and prisons? No.

Of course, those calls would have upset many Democrats. But, unfortunately, besides lip service that he wants to reduce crime, he didn’t offer any of these obvious concrete proposals during his State of the Union address. On Tuesday, Biden offered no specific proposals to ensure funds go to the police.

Targeting Guns Instead of Criminals

Instead, the only specific proposals focused only on gun control. Biden ignores that over 92 percent of violent crime has nothing to do with guns.

He talked about the need to “repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued,” which is a lie. People can sue gunmakers if they sell a gun illegally or make a defective gun. Biden wants to make gun manufacturers civilly liable for misuse of firearms they sell. That means people could sue manufacturers and sellers whenever a crime, accident, or suicide occurs with a gun. The end goal is to put gun makers out of business. Imagine if you could sue Ford the next time someone gets intentionally run over with an F150.

He talked about an assault weapon ban, but in his New York City address, Biden talked about banning any semi-automatic gun that “can hold” a large capacity magazine. He has repeated that theme many times over the last few years. The problem is that any semi-automatic gun manufactured today “can hold” or has the “ability” to hold a magazine of virtually any capacity. About 85 percent of all handguns made were semi-automatics that “can hold” magazines. Almost as many rifles also fit that definition.

At the same time that Democrats are eviscerating law enforcement and prosecutions, Biden wants to make it difficult for people to defend themselves. Semi-automatic guns provide critical self-defense benefits. If we force law-abiding victims to rely on single-shot guns, they could find themselves in trouble. If they face multiple criminals or fire and miss their target, individuals may not have the time to manually reload their gun.

Biden talked about passing background checks on the private transfer of guns, but not using these background checks to create a national gun registry. He put together nearly one billion firearm purchase records. The government now has a searchable digital database containing 866 million transactions, including some 54 million made in 2021 alone. Federal law explicitly prohibits the creation of a federal firearm registry, but Biden is making one anyway.

This national gun registry isn’t complete because not all states have background checks on the private transfer of guns, and Biden hasn’t yet gotten all the transaction records that licensed gun dealers have. Federal agents can now type in a person’s name into a computer and possibly come up with all the guns they purchased.

It isn’t rocket science to understand why crime is increasing, and it isn’t the fault of gun owners. Many parts of the country are in dire need of basic law enforcement. But despite nice rhetoric, Biden is refusing to face the crime problem seriously.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/02/bidens-state-of-the-union-promise-to-fund-police-was-pure-lip-service/,2022-03-02
Ukraine Shows The World Why Gun Rights Are Human Rights,"The world is captivated by Ukraine’s resistance to Russian invasion, especially since much of Ukraine’s resistance comes from ordinary citizens taking up arms in defense of their homeland.

Ukraine has a fighting chance in part because it has taken dramatic steps to provide its people firearms. More than 25,000 automatic rifles and 10 million rounds of ammunition have been distributed to volunteers in Kyiv.

In the United States, even supporters of draconian gun control are announcing they “stand with the brave Ukrainian people” in their armed resistance. The glaring contradiction between these positions — supporting gun confiscation one day and gun distribution the next — seemingly hasn’t dawned on many of these ideologues.

Their contradiction is apparent in actions, as well as in words. President Joe Biden’s rush to arm Ukrainians stands in contrast with his desire to disarm ordinary Americans.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is another prime example: engaging in tyrannical gun control at home while supplying the Ukrainian resistance with machine guns, pistols, carbines, and 1.5 million rounds of ammunition. The European Union shows a similar hostility to the self-defense rights of its people, even as it gives Ukraine about half a billion dollars’ worth of “lethal aid.”

Ukraine Late to Expand Gun Rights

Arming average citizens hasn’t always been the Ukrainian way, either. A 2014 report noted that the country had “inherited the Soviet civilian gun control system, which provides for restrictive gun owner licensing and the registration of all firearms.” According to that report, Ukraine initially considered imposing comprehensive gun laws during the 1990s. But politicians gridlocked over “whether or not private [gun] ownership would increase crime or improve security.”

Hopefully the events of 2022 have settled that question once and for all. An individual’s natural right of self-defense applies equally to the defense of his life as to the defense of his nation — and neither individual nor nation is secure without the ability to exercise it. This should never have been a question.

As it happened, Ukraine was tragically late to expand legal protection of gun rights. Its parliament acted on an emergency basis just before Russia invaded.

Better late than never, certainly. But imagine if the people of Kyiv had been training with these weapons their whole lives. Imagine if they knew them like the back of their hands, instead of quickly learning to handle them during an invasion. Their resistance, as well as their example to the world, would be all the more powerful.

Natural Right to Bear Arms

It’s also unfortunate that Ukraine’s government has left some significant restrictions on the self-defense rights of the Ukrainian people, and has only codified these rights in a statute rather than giving them full constitutional protection. In reality, the right to bear arms — in public and private — is a natural right that the Ukrainian people need no government permission to exercise. They just need the government to stay out of the way of their natural rights.

But in a time even many U.S. jurisdictions violate that natural right, it’s not surprising if other countries are confused about it.

Ukraine is certainly moving in the right direction on gun rights, something that can’t be said of the entire United States. The chairman of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, says the new law is meant “to ensure that every citizen receives the sacred right to self-defense.”

The people of Ukraine have a chance because they are armed. It’s a lesson the world should never forget.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/04/ukraine-shows-the-world-why-gun-rights-are-human-rights/,2022-03-04

223. Chuck Schumer Is Minority Leader

Before his State of the Union speech even began, Biden greeted Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as “Senate minority leader.” Schumer has been the majority leader since Biden took office in 2021.

222. More Jobs Created in Two Years Than Any Other President

“I actually created, with the help of many people in this room, 12 million new jobs,” Biden said during his State of the Union address. “More jobs created in two years than any president has created in four years. Because of you.”

Biden didn’t create new jobs, as he often likes to claim. The only reason the job rate is growing is that millions of people are returning to work after tyrannical bureaucrats shut down the economy for months in the name of stopping the spread of Covid-19.

221. Fastest Growth in 40 Years

On Feb. 7, 2023, during his annual speech to Congress, Biden repeated his infamous lie that he initiated the “fastest job growth in 40 years.”

Records show, however, that employment from May 2020 to January 2021 under Trump grew by 12.5 million. During approximately that same time period, the unemployment rate also declined by 8.3 percent.

In January alone, American payroll jobs under Biden fell by more than 2.5 million.

220. Inflation Is ‘Coming Down’

Another lie Biden repeated during his State of the Union address is that inflation in the U.S. “is coming down.”

Yet, two years after the president greenlit the beginning of Democrats’ expensive spending spree, Americans are suffering from gas prices still well above $3 per gallon, weathering a recession, and paying 60 percent more for eggs than they did in 2021. Biden may not be responsible for the fastest job growth in the last four decades, but inflation under his watch rose at its fastest rate in 40 years.

Biden tried to blame the nation’s economic misfortune on the pandemic and the “unfair and brutal war in Ukraine,” but the truth is, inflation in the U.S. directly coincides with the time he took office.

219. Democracy Faced ‘Greatest Threat Since Civil War’ on Jan. 6

President Biden forgot about the attacks on Pearl Harbor, 9/11, and the repeat episodes of violence at the Capitol when he claimed at the 2023 State of the Union that the riot on Jan. 6, 2021, was the “greatest threat since the Civil War.”

Look at McCarthy’s reaction as Biden repeats the lie that the Jan 6 riot was the greatest threat since the Civil War.

218. I’m Responsible for the Largest Deficit in U.S. History

Biden wants to take credit for cutting the national deficit “by more than $1.7 trillion — the largest deficit reduction in American history” in his first two years in office.

“Under the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a row. Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor,” Biden said at the 2023 State of the Union.

The truth is, federal spending under Biden increased more than $10 trillion since his first month in office. That’s more than any other president spent in his first two years in U.S. history.

217. Republicans Are Trying to Cut Social Security

Biden pledged to halt desperately needed cuts to bloated entitlement programs as Congress debates raising the debt ceiling.

“If anyone tries to cut Social Security,” the president said during his annual address to Congress, “I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.”

The Democrats’ reconciliation bill passed last summer, however, raided nearly $300 billion from Medicare to boost insurance companies by removing leverage from negotiations on drug prices.

""If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.""

216. Fires Have Burned an Area the Size of Missouri

President Biden tried to claim during his State of the Union speech that more wood had been burned by forest fires than the area of the entire state of Missouri.

“More timber has been burned than I’ve observed from helicopters than the entire state of Missouri,” Biden said.

Biden on forest fires: ""More timber has been burned — that I’ve observed from helicopters — than the entire state of Missouri"" 🤔 pic.twitter.com/yXlPS3KHXY — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) February 8, 2023

In 2022, however, 7.5 million acres burned, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Missouri’s forests span 14 million acres, and the state itself is 44.6 million acres large.

The remark appears to have been made off-script according to what the White House released as the president’s prepared speech.

215. Biden Repeats Claim that Fast-Food Workers Sign Noncompete Agreements

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy could be seen chuckling in the background at the State of the Union when Biden complained that fast-food workers were signing noncompete agreements with employers.

“A cashier at a burger place can’t walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make a few bucks more,” Biden said.

Biden claims that McDonald’s cashiers sign noncompete agreements which prevent them from working for other burger chains. 😂 pic.twitter.com/cXyPHE7lvk — John Curtis (@Johnmcurtis) February 8, 2023

Biden made the same claim at a business roundtable in July 2020, earning the then-candidate a “false” rating from PolitiFact.

214. Biden Blames Crime Wave on Covid After Democrats Defunded Police

During the 2023 State of the Union, Biden blamed the coronavirus lockdowns for the nation’s recent crime wave.

Covid left scars, the president said, “like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.”

It was the Democrats’ rush to “defund police,” however, that left cities and neighborhoods vulnerable to criminals who remained free to roam the streets. Democrats in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and New York cut police funding by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of the social justice fever that took over the country. More than a dozen cities saw the highest homicide rates ever reported as a result.

According to a poll from Politico last year, 3 in 4 Americans blamed the crime spree on the efforts to defund police.

213. I Re-Upped Funding for Cancer Research

One of Biden’s top priorities going into his 2023 State of the Union speech was his “Cancer Moonshot” initiative, which allocates funding to cancer research and care.

“Jill and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead,” Biden said.

Biden may have restarted the program to “provide more support for patients and families,” but it was his pet legislation, the ill-named Inflation Reduction Act, that cut cancer research spending by nine times as much as his program is supposed to put toward it.

212. Immigration ‘Reform’ Will Secure the Border

During his annual address to Congress, Biden pointed to his “new border plan” as evidence that he’s finally doing something about the millions of illegal border crossers flooding the U.S.

But his plan to grant “legal” status to illegal border crossers from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela only emboldens corrupt cartels and does nothing to stop the pipeline of fentanyl responsible for taking American lives, something several hecklers pointed out during his speech.

Biden said his “comprehensive immigration reform” would “fix” the national security threat that American border woes have become. In reality, that legislation would only encourage the millions of migrants overwhelming Border Patrol agents to keep paying the criminal organizations that control northern Mexico to escort them to the U.S.

211. Mass Shootings Went Down After Assault Weapons Ban

Biden claimed during the State of the Union that the federal assault weapons ban, which barred the manufacturing of semi-automatic rifles for civilian use from 1994 to 2004, caused mass shootings to drop.

“In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled,” Biden said.

That’s a lie based on a flawed study that claimed the ban reduced mass shooting deaths. Accurate data recorded during the ban shows that more so-called mass shootings occurred during the firearm prohibition. Even after the ban expired, mass shootings did not increase, as Democrats suggested they would.

210. Life-Saving Pro-Life Laws Are Extreme

During his State of the Union address, Biden wrongfully characterized pro-life legislation in several red states as “extreme” for limiting women’s ability to kill their unborn babies.

“Already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans,” he said.

In reality, it’s Biden’s abortion-on-demand throughout all nine of months of pregnancy agenda that is extreme. New polling suggests 7 in 10 Americans support limiting abortion to the first three months of pregnancy.

Biden also criticized Republicans for trying to pass what he said is a “national abortion ban.”

As pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America noted, the GOP has not proposed a total ban on abortions. It has just worked to bring U.S. abortion law up to speed with other civilized countries, which recognize abortion beyond 15 weeks gestation as a barbaric practice.

209. ‘I’m Here to Be President for All Americans’

In addition to promising unity via bipartisan cooperation, Biden falsely claimed during his address to Congress on Feb. 7, 2023, that he is “here to be president for all Americans.”

Yet the few times Biden gave formal addresses in 2022, he demonized the half of the country that didn’t vote for him. His smears against “MAGA Republicans” shows he has no tolerance for conservative voters or their values.

A president for all wouldn’t sic his Department of Justice on parents concerned that their children’s education stays indoctrination free or a pro-life father who rightfully defended his son from a deranged abortion activist.

208. Biden Claims ‘No’ Blame For Inflation

Biden refuses to take responsibility for the inflation crippling the nation despite its clear connection to his administration and policies.

“Do you take any blame for inflation?” a reporter asked the president on Feb. 3, 2023.

“Do I take any blame for inflation? No,” Biden replied.

“Why not?” the reporter countered.

“It was already here when I got here, man! Remember what the economy was like when I got here?” Biden asked.

REPORTER: ""Do you take any blame for inflation?""



BIDEN: ""No.""



REPORTER: ""Why not?""



BIDEN: ""It was already there when I got here, man!"" pic.twitter.com/ErvzSQVC4n — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) February 3, 2023

The economy before Biden’s inauguration may have suffered from government-mandated lockdowns, but that suffering drastically increased in March of 2021 shortly after Biden took office, when the new administration greenlit Congress’s $1.9 trillion spending bill.

Since then, inflation rose at its fastest rate in 40 years and still hovers far above pre-pandemic price hikes.

207. Biden Says He Began Career as Civil Rights Activist

President Biden told congregants at Georgia’s Ebenezer Baptist Church on the Sunday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day that he began his career as a mid-20th-century civil rights activist. Biden said he “started off as a 22-year-old kid on the east side in the civil rights movement.”

While at Ebenezer Baptist Church, Joe Biden once again claims he was a civil rights activist: “When I started off as a 22-year-old kid on the east side in the civil rights movement.”



This is a debunked lie. pic.twitter.com/CY6x07IN2N — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) January 15, 2023

On his first campaign for president, however, Biden disputed his participation in the movement.

“I was not an activist,” Biden said at a Washington press conference in September 1978. “I worked at an all-black swimming pool in the east side of Wilmington, Delaware. I was involved in what they were thinking, what they were feeling. I was involved, but I was not out marching. I was not down in Selma, I was not anywhere else.”

206. Biden Says He Went to a Black Church as a Teen

President Biden also told congregants at the Ebernezer Baptist Church that he went to a predominantly black church as a teenager.

BIDEN: ""I used to go to 7:30 mass every morning in high school and then in college, before I went to the Black church. Not a joke.""

205. Biden Claims He Taught Classes at UPenn

While speaking at the North America Leaders’ Summit in Mexico City on Jan. 10, Biden claimed he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania “four years after being vice president.” While Biden was paid nearly $1 million by the university, he reportedly never taught a class there.

Biden: ""The four years after being vice president, I was a professor at Penn.""

204. Biden Blames J6 Rioters for Capitol Police Officer’s Death

During an overtly political speech marking the two-year anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, Biden falsely claimed that Officer William “Billy” Evans died as a result of “threats by these sick [Jan. 6] insurrectionists.”

Joe Biden just said that Capitol Police Officer William Evans died as a result of ""threats by these sick insurrectionists.""

Contrary to the president’s assertion, Evans was killed three months after the Jan. 6 riot in April 2021 by a Nation of Islam supporter who killed the officer by running him down with a car. The instance marks the second occasion in which Biden has conflated Evans’s death with the events of Jan. 6.

203. Biden Says Guns’ Only Use Is to ‘Kill People’

In a commemorative statement honoring the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting, Biden falsely claimed that the only use for weapons like those used in the shooting is to “kill people.”

“I am determined to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like those used at Sandy Hook and countless other mass shootings in America,” Biden said in an official statement. “Enough is enough. Our obligation is clear. We must eliminate these weapons that have no purpose other than to kill people in large numbers.”

Americans have and use guns for a variety of reasons including hunting, range shooting, collecting, deterrence, and protection. In some cases, the guns that Biden refers to as “assault weapons” are more effective at activities like hog hunting than other types of firearms.

Additionally, those who use guns as self-defense tools are taught not “shoot to kill,” but only to shoot if necessary to stop, slow, or disarm someone who is threatening their life.

202. Biden Accuses Republicans of Suppressing Voters

“They are trying to succeed where they failed in 2020,” Biden said during a speech at Union Station in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 2, 2022. “To suppress the right of voters and subvert the electoral system itself. That means denying your right to vote and deciding whether your vote even counts. Instead of waiting until the election is over, or starting well before restarting now. They’ve emboldened violence and intimidation of voters and election officials. It is estimated that the more than 300 election denier on the ballot all across America this year.”

Instead of waiting until an election is over…they're starting now."" pic.twitter.com/HGT1TLFwa2 — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) November 2, 2022

In reality, it’s Democrats and Democrat operatives such as Marc Elias who oppose Republican-led election integrity laws around the nation and conservative attempts to make voting safer and more secure.

In Georgia, where Biden encouraged businesses to boycott the state over its “Jim Crow 2.0” election integrity law in 2021, early voters are turning out in record numbers. Even during early voting in the primaries, Georgia’s non-white voter turnout boomed.

201. White House Says Biden ‘Always Condemned Political Violence’

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told a room full of corporate media reporters on Nov. 2, 2022, that Biden “has always, always condemned political violence.”

“It doesn’t matter, again, if you’re a Republican, an independent, or a Democrat,” Jean-Pierre said.

Biden has, however, failed to equally apply his condemnation of political violence.

When radical abortion activists violently attacked at least 75 life-saving pregnancy centers and pro-life groups, assaulted at least 89 Catholic churches, and threatened to harm Republican-nominated justices following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson opinion leak, Biden failed to personally address it.

Biden was also silent when climate rioters led an insurrection at the Department of the Interior in October 2021.

Even before his presidency, Biden neglected to quickly condemn the rioters, looters, and vandals who inflicted billions of dollars worth of damage on the nation’s cities in 2020. It took Biden months to condemn those attacks. He was also silent when Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker, and Maxine Waters urged violence against Trump and his supporters.

200. Biden Says Incomes Outpaced Inflation Last Quarter

“Although it may not feel that way, people’s incomes went up the last quarter more than inflation. Economic growth is up, price inflation is down, real incomes are up, and gas prices are down,” Biden said during a gubernatorial campaign event for Charlie Crist in Florida.

While inflation was up a reported 8.2 percent in September, wages and salaries only increased by 5.1 and 4.2 percent since September of last year.

199. Biden Says He Attended HBCU

During a Democrat campaign event in Florida, Biden said he received his education at a historically black college or university, or HBCU.

“I’m a big fan of HBCUs. I got my start at one of those other HBCUs, Delaware State University,” Biden told a cheering crowd.

198. Biden Falsely Claims His Son Died in the Iraq War

Biden incorrectly claimed his son died in Iraq, presumably during the Iraq War.

“Inflation is a worldwide problem right now because of a war in Iraq. … Excuse me the war in Ukraine. I’m thinking of Iraq because that’s where my son died.”

197. Biden Says U.S. Has ‘Lowest Inflation Rate’ Globally

During a speech on Nov. 1, Biden incorrectly claimed the United States has “the lowest inflation rate of almost any country in the world.”

Biden: ""We have the lowest inflation rate of almost any country in the world."" pic.twitter.com/t1436gw0Qc — Greg Price (@greg_price11) November 1, 2022

As of September, the rate of inflation in the U.S. is 8.2 percent. Even though countries use different measures to calculate their inflation rates, the U.S. still had a larger increase in the cost of goods and services than many developed countries including Canada (6.9 percent), Japan (3 percent), Australia (7.3 percent), and Italy (5.79).

While many countries around the globe are suffering from price hikes, the U.S. inflation rate quadrupled, rising faster than Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Brazil, New Zealand, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Japan, India, China, and others

196. Biden Blames ‘Soaring’ Gas Prices on Putin (Again)

“Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in March sent gas prices soaring, literally, around the world. Not just here, but around the world,” Biden said in a speech on Nov. 1.

https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1587489793239310343?s=20&t=zoxuWsJKnzqcEUQyjGOuXg

The president claimed that it’s “because of the action we’ve taken since then, [that] gas prices have actually come down.”

Not only were gas prices “soaring” long before Russia’s leader chose to invade Ukraine, but Biden’s decision to deplete the Strategic Petroleum Reserve shortly before the midterms is a political one, not a sustainable one.

As Chuck DeVore, the chief national initiatives officer at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, wrote for The Federalist, Biden’s reliance on reserves is just an artificial and temporary solution for an ongoing problem.

“Should the SPR draws stop, or … shift back to refilling the reserves, what would happen? Oil prices would immediately spike, with gasoline prices following quickly,” DeVore wrote.

195. Biden Lies About Price of Gas

During an address on Oct. 27, Biden falsely claimed that gas prices were far higher when he took office than they are now.

“The most common price of gas in America is $3.39, down from over $5 when I took office,” Biden said.

Biden: ""The most common price of gas in America is $3.39, down from over $5 when I took office.""

Not only is the national average for gas currently hovering around $3.76 per gallon, not $3.39, but gas was only around $2.39 per gallon when Biden assumed office.

194. Biden Claims He ‘Signed a Law’ Wiping Student Loan Debt

Biden falsely claimed that his executive order shifting student loan debt onto taxpayers was actually a bill Congress passed and that he “signed” into law.

“It’s passed. I got it passed by a vote or two,” Biden said during a Now This presidential forum on Oct. 23.

Here is the full clip for all you clowns who say it’s out of context. Biden first falsely claims he “signed a law” to cancel student loan debt, then says he “got it passed by a vote or two.”



??????? pic.twitter.com/JKdKde24db — Jake Schneider (@jacobkschneider) October 24, 2022

Biden’s attempt to bail out Americans with college loans by making other debt-free Americans foot the bill is controversial and could, as the president himself once admitted, be illegal. That’s why a federal appeals court temporarily blocked Biden’s plans to shift student loan debt onto taxpayers on Oct. 21.

193. Biden Claims He Hasn’t ‘Stopped or Slowed U.S. Oil Production’

To defend releasing even more oil reserves, Biden lied that he has not “stopped or slowed U.S. oil production.”

“Let’s debunk some myths here. My administration has not stopped or slowed U.S. oil production,” Biden claimed. “Quite the opposite.”

Joe Biden:



""My administration has not stopped or slowed U.S. oil production."" pic.twitter.com/J85rmKhEl1 — TheBlaze (@theblaze) October 19, 2022

Oil production may technically be up from its pandemic plunge, but it’s still nowhere near the pre-Covid levels achieved under Biden’s predecessor — and any growth since then is not thanks to Biden. Even before he set foot in the White House, Biden declared a war on oil and fossil fuels. Once elected, the president used some of his first days in office to halt the Keystone Pipeline and effectively shut down public oil land leasing. He’s also tried to stop new oil projects and has threatened to eliminate the fossil fuel industry by 2050.

All of these actions have hiked gas and energy prices for Americans.

192. White House Says Fetterman Not Disabled

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at an Oct. 17 press conference Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. and Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman was “just as capable as always” five months after a major stroke.

“The president has found him to be an impressive individual,” Jean-Pierre said, claiming Fetterman is “just as capable as always and who’s carrying out his office.”

Fetterman, however, still struggles to communicate and experiences issues processing what people say. The Democrat Senate nominee remains unable to speak clearly.

John Fetterman gave a speech in Montgomery County yesterday.



Here are the highlights. pic.twitter.com/8udMddHAcQ — Greg Price (@greg_price11) September 12, 2022

In mid-October, a reporter for NBC News defended her coverage of a one-on-one interview with Fetterman wherein she claimed, “In small talk before the interview without captioning, it wasn’t clear he was understanding our conversation.”

Fetterman will require closed captioning for his debate with Republican celebrity television doctor Mehmet Oz. The debate will be held on Oct. 25 which is weeks after early voting in Pennsylvania has already begun.

191. Biden Lies About Effects Of Dobbs

During an address at a Democratic National Committee event on Oct. 18, 2022, Biden claimed that when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, “Women all across the country, starting in my house, lost a fundamental right.”

Not only is Jill Biden far beyond child-bearing age but many states have used the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, which gave states the power to decide abortion law, to expand their baby-killing radicalism.

Delaware, where the First Lady technically resides, allows abortion through “fetal viability,” which is considered between 24-26 weeks gestation.

190. Amid Recession, Biden Says Recession ‘Hasn’t Happened Yet’

In an attempt to cover up his role in exacerbating the nation’s economic crises, Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Oct. 11 that the U.S. is not in a recession.

“Should the American people prepare for a recession?” Tapper asked, shortly after Biden accidentally yet accurately called Democrats’ latest expensive spending package the “Inflation Act.”

“No,” Biden said. “Look they’ve been saying this now, every six months they say this. … It hadn’t happened yet. There’s no guarantee that they’re going to be a recess- I don’t think there will be a recession. If it is, there will be a very slight recession. That is, we’ll move down slightly.”

Not only did the nation’s gross domestic product drop by 0.9 percent in the second quarter of 2022, but inflation reached yet another record high, which severely damaged Americans’ purchasing power.

189. Biden Lies that He Lost an ‘Awful Lot’ of His Home to a Fire Years Ago

During a speech to Hurricane Ian victims on Oct. 5, 2022, Biden falsely claimed that he lost an “awful lot” in a 2004 kitchen fire at his Delaware home.

“I know from experience how much anxiety and fear concern is to other people. … We didn’t lose our whole home, but lightning struck and we lost an awful lot of it about 15 years ago,” Biden said.

Joe Biden claimed today that he lost ""an awful lot"" of his home in a fire from a lightning strike 15 years ago.

According to the fire chief at the time, the fire, caused by a lightning strike, was contained in under 20 minutes.

Biden similarly told voters in New Hampshire in November of 2021 that his house burned down with First Lady Jill Biden inside of it.

“I know, having had a house burn down with my wife in it — she got out safely, God willing — that having a significant portion of it burn, I can tell: 10 minutes makes a hell of a difference,” Biden said.

188. Biden Claims Humans Make Hurricanes Worse

President Biden claimed Hurricane Ian was the firm proof of manmade climate change while touring the devastation in Florida on Oct. 5, 2022.

“I think the one thing this has finally ended is whether or not there is climate change and we should do something about it,” Biden said.

Data on hurricanes, however, only dates back about 100 years. Even President Barack Obama’s science adviser Steve Koonin said, “Humans have no detectable impact on hurricanes over the past century.”

187. Biden Claims Roman Catholic Church Changed Position on Ending Unborn Lives

During remarks at the Democratic National Committee Reception on Sept. 22, Biden falsely claimed the Roman Catholic Church caved on allowing exceptions for abortions in the case of rape and incest.

“My generic point — and I happen to be a practicing Roman Catholic — my church doesn’t even make that argument now. And so we’re in a situation where things have changed a lot. But they’ve gotten more extreme in their positions,” Biden said.

While certain Catholic-identifying politicians such as Biden and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi regularly tout abortion, the Catholic Chuch still maintains that killing a baby, whose life began at conception, is a sin.

“Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law,” paragraph 2271 of the Church’s Catechism states.

Even Pope Francis has publicly condemned Biden’s support for abortion as an “incoherence.”

186. Biden Pretends Inflation Isn’t Hurting Americans

During his “60 Minutes” interview with Scott Pelley on Sept. 18, Biden argued inflation is not as bad as it seems.

“Let’s put this in perspective,” Biden said. “Inflation rate month to month was up just an inch. Hardly at all.”

“You’re not arguing that 8.3 is good news?” Pelley asked, noting that the annual inflation rate for August was up 0.1 percent from July and more than 8 percent since the same time last year.

“No, I’m not saying it’s good news, but it was 8.2 or 8.2 before. You’re making it sound like all of a sudden, my God, it went to 8.2 percent,” Biden said.

As Pelley noted, “It’s been the highest inflation rate, Mr. President, in 40 years.” Americans are struggling to pay their grocery and energy bills, which have cost hundreds of extra dollars compared to previous years.

“I got that,” Biden retorted. “But guess what we are. We’re in a position where, for the last several months, it hasn’t spiked. It is just barely, it has been basically even.”

Moments after denying that inflation is spiking, Biden claimed that it’s his administration’s plans, including massive spending plans such as the misnomered Inflation Reduction Act, that will “get control of inflation.”

“Is the economy going to get worse before it gets better?” “60 Minutes” interviewer Pelley asked.

“No, I don’t think so. We hope, we hope we can have what they say a soft landing,” Biden said. “…I’m telling the American people that we are going to get control of inflation. And their prescription drug prices are going to be a hell of a lot lower. Their health care costs are going to be a lot lower. Their basic costs for everybody. Their energy prices are going to be lower.”

Despite Biden’s self-professed optimism about the economy, reports from financial analysts including those at the Congressional Budget Office say Democrats’ spending will make inflation over the next five years much worse, not better, as Biden and his party claimed.

183. Biden Repeats Civil Rights Activist Fib

During a Labor Day speech Biden claimed that, as a child, he became “very engaged in my case in the civil rights movement.”

“As a kid, I worked a lot in the movement,” Biden said.

Not only did Biden himself admit in 1987 that he was “not out marching” and “not down in Selma,” but even the media have repeatedly debunked Biden’s false assertions that he was “an activist.”

182. Biden Says AR-15 Bullets Travel Five Times Faster Than ‘Any Other Gun’

At an Aug. 30 speech in Pennsylvania, President Biden claimed “the bullet out of an AR-15 travels 5 times as rapidly as a bullet shot out of any other gun.”

181. Biden Says Inflation Reduction Act Will Not Raise Taxes On Americans Earning Less than $400K

During an Aug. 16 signing ceremony for the Democrat Party’s $740 billion “Inflation Reduction Act,” Biden claimed that “no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes” once the legislation takes effect.

Biden’s assertion, however, runs contrary to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which estimates that Americans earning less than $400,000 a year “will pay an estimated $20 billion more in taxes over the next decade” as a result of the bill, “which also sets aside $80 billion to hire 87,000 IRS agents.”

180. Biden Says ‘Zero’ Inflation in July Following 8.5 Percent Rise

July’s consumer price index yielded a whopping 8.5 percent inflation increase since the same time last year, but according to Biden, July actually had no inflation whatsoever.

“I just want to say a number: zero,” Biden said in an address on Aug. 10. “Today, we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation in the month of July. Here is what that means: While the price of some things went up last month, the price of other things went down by the same amount.”

Though the CPI figures were down slightly from the 9.1 percent recorded in June, the prices for everyday necessities such as groceries and electricity continue to shoot upward, with the latest numbers showing a 10.9 and 15.2 percent increase, respectively, since last year.

179. Biden Claims He Has Cancer

In a “climate crisis” speech about fossil fuels in Massachusetts on July 20, Biden incorrectly claimed that he has cancer caused by oil pollution in his home state. Biden said that growing up, pollution in Delaware was so bad that his mother had to use windshield wipers to “get literally the oil slick off the window.”

“That’s why I and so d-mn many other people I grew up [with] have cancer,” Biden said.

Biden says that his mother using windshield wipers to ""get literally the oil slick off the window"" is ""why I and so damn many other people have cancer."" pic.twitter.com/YIoBlZadRJ — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) July 20, 2022

The White House physician quickly released a statement clarifying that Biden “remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.”

The physician noted that Biden “has had several non-melanoma skin cancers removed” before.

178. Biden Pretends He Wrote Law Review Articles About Right to Privacy

During a speech about the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision, Biden claimed he had written “a number of law review articles” about the right to privacy referenced in the now-overturned Roe v. Wade decision.

“And I have written, way back, a number of law review articles about the Ninth Amendment and the — and the 14th Amendment and why that privacy is considered as part of a constitutional guarantee. And the — they’ve just wiped it all out,” he said.

Biden may have helped pen close to 19 law review articles — and even flunked a law school class after plagiarizing portions of someone else’s law review article in one of his papers — but has never had a review published on the “right to privacy.”

As The Washington Post noted, the closest thing Biden has to a law review on the 14th Amendment is a 1991 opinion article in the Philadelphia Inquirer.

177. White House Silent on Biden’s Hunter Lies

When asked about Joe Biden’s voicemail indicating that he knew about Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said she could not “comment on any materials from [Hunter’s] laptop.”

Biden previously promised to “always level” with the American people but has repeatedly lied about his son’s financial activity despite copious evidence that he may have been involved in some of Hunter’s transactions.

176. Biden Lies About Billionaire Tax Rate

Biden tweeted that there are approximately 790 billionaires who are taxed at an average rate of 8 percent. He went on to claim that “I believe that no billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, an electrician, or a cop.”

As Carol Roth, a former investment banker and economic commentator noted in a Twitter thread investigating the president’s claims, Biden’s assertion that billionaire tax rates are low is not only misleading, but it’s also false.

According to Roth, the study the White House used to determine what Biden claims is the billionaire tax rate does not rely on normal factors such as tax records and income. Instead, it included unsold stock.

“What they are using is not INCOME at all, it is stock appreciation, NOT realized. This is a made-up proxy of a wealth tax,” Roth tweeted.

As Roth noted in her analysis, “this is not how income tax works, and it is straight up a lie to say this an income tax rate for billionaires and portray it as an average tax rate of the ‘wealthiest.’”

Roth said the Biden administration intentionally “took a one time event and used it to compare to yearly taxes.”

175. Biden Repeats ‘Fastest-Growing Economy’ Lie

Biden told Jimmy Kimmel during a June 8 interview that the U.S. has the “fastest-growing economy in the world.”

Joe Biden: “We have the fastest growing economy in the world”



The economy shrank last quarter. pic.twitter.com/MYirE2dRU7 — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 9, 2022

Not only did the American economy shrink last quarter, but it is also plagued with record-high inflation and gas prices, a supply-chain crisis, and a baby formula shortage that has put several babies in hospitals.

174. Biden Says Trump Abused Constitutional Authority

During an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Biden agreed with accusations that Trump passed out executive orders “like Halloween candy.” He also accused the former president of abusing “the Constitution and constitutional authority” by issuing executive orders.

“I have issued executive orders,” Biden said after promising he wouldn’t issue executive action on guns, something he has already done. “But what I don’t want to do is emulate Trump’s abuse of the Constitution and constitutional authority. I mean that sincerely because I often get asked — look, the Republicans don’t play it square, why do you play it square? Well, guess what. If we do the same thing they do, our democracy will literally be in jeopardy.”

President @JoeBiden on issuing an Executive Order in response to gun violence… pic.twitter.com/KUXsyNfZrW — Jimmy Kimmel Live (@JimmyKimmelLive) June 9, 2022

While Biden blames Trump for what he says is an excessive amount of executive orders, the facts show Biden is on track to outpace the former president’s executive authority tally. During his first few months in office, Biden clocked more than 42 orders. Trump, on the other hand, issued 33.

173. White House Says Economy Is ‘In a Better Place’ Now than Historically

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters in a press briefing on Tuesday that Biden’s administration believes “the economy is in a better place than it has been historically.”

Jean-Pierre: ""What we're trying to say is that the economy is in a better place than it has been historically."" pic.twitter.com/KIO61OnGNN — Greg Price (@greg_price11) June 7, 2022

Not only do voters reject this lie, but so do the facts. Inflation in the U.S. has reached record highs nearly every month recently as the supply-chain crisis and national staffing shortage drag on. Since Biden assumed office, gas prices have more than doubled.

There’s also a baby formula shortage that began when Biden’s Food and Drug Administration shut down a plant. It took months for the White House to address the critical crisis that left several young children and babies hospitalized.

172. White House Repeats Lie that Semiautomatic Gun Ban Decreased Mass Shootings

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeated the lie that Congress’s 1994 semiautomatic gun ban decreased mass shootings.

“When he — when we talk about the executive actions that he’s taken — more than any president at this time of their administration — those are real steps that this president has taken. And not just as president, during his Senate years, in 1994, the banning of assault weapons; that is something that he led on,” she said during a press briefing on June 6. “And if we even look at what happened those first 10 years of that — of that assault [weapons ban] was in law — into law, it actually brought down mass shootings. And when it — when it expired in 2004, 10 years later, we saw mass shootings triple.”

A 2004 study funded by the Department of Justice, however, found that the Clinton-era ban was not the reason shootings decreased in the U.S.

“We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence, based on indicators like the percentage of gun crimes resulting in death or the share of gunfire incidents resulting in injury,” the report stated. “The ban’s impact on gun violence is likely to be small at best, and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. AWs [assault weapons] were used in no more than 8% of gun crimes even before the ban.”

171. White House Says Biden Believes Excessive Federal Spending Helped Economy

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told members of the press on June 6 that Biden believes his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan actually helped the economy instead of contributing to its problems.

“I want to say the Rescue Plan has really been able to help us, put us in an economic, a place where we’re stronger. And … this is something that we have to really continue to remember, we are in an economic crisis. And the president met that moment by putting forth the American Rescue Plan, by Democrats on the Hill voting for that plan, and really putting us in a place where we look at today in a much stronger economic situation where we can actually deal with inflation head-on,” Jean-Pierre said. “We have a lot of work to do and we understand what the American people are feeling, but we are in a stronger place to take that on.”

It’s a repeat talking point from the administration but one that holds no water against record-high inflation and gas prices.

170. Biden Claims He Initiated Fastest Economic Recovery

During a speech on June 6, Biden claimed that “my plans have produced the strongest, fastest, most widespread economic recovery America has ever experienced.”

Biden also bragged about “record jobs, new record small businesses, and wages rising,” but he did not mention that inflation has far outpaced those hikes for months now. The president also did not mention that gas prices have more than doubled since he assumed office in January of 2021.

https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1533891641781764097?s=20&t=LeMTRb0AW6jh7sT01bHDAQ

Meanwhile, Americans deal with a prolonged supply-chain crisis, inflation, and rising gas prices that the administration refuses to take responsibility for.

169. Biden Says Gun Manufacturers Have Blanket Immunity that Doesn’t Exist

President Biden claimed gun manufacturers enjoy blanket immunity on how their firearms are used.

“We should repeal the liability shield that all protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons,” Biden said in a gun speech on the evening of June 2. “They are the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity.”

BIDEN: Gun manufacturers ""are the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity."" pic.twitter.com/OsmclOQyZx — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) June 2, 2022

Biden’s claim, however, enjoys no merit. Suing a gun company for a gun that fires when the trigger is pulled is akin to suing the Coors Brewing Company because beer got people drunk.

The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which became law in 2005, protects firearm manufacturers from liability for weapons used in a crime. Companies, however, may still be sued for negligence, breach of contract over gun purchases, and weapons defects.

168. Biden Says Deficit Cut Under Him Will Be Largest in History

“The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the deficit will fall by $1.7 trillion this year – the largest reduction in history,” Biden wrote in his WSJ op-ed.

That’s a misleading claim, however, that doesn’t capture just how huge Biden’s budget deficit remains. History shows that this year’s $1 trillion deficit will be “the 7th worst on record.”

167. Biden Claims Economy Was Already Bad Before Covid-19

“Things should also look different from the decades before the pandemic, when too often we had low growth, low wage gains, and an economy that worked best for the wealthiest Americans,” Biden wrote in his opinion editorial detailing “My Plan For Fighting Inflation.”

From 2017 to 2019 under Trump, however, GDP growth averaged 2.54 percent. Hourly earnings were also up 2.97 percent and outpaced the 2.13 percent inflation rate.

“In 2019, median household income saw its largest increase on record. The unemployment rate hit its lowest rate in nearly 50 years, poverty rates for all races were the lowest on record, and income inequality declined,” the America First Policy Institute determined.

166. Biden Repeats Putin Price Hike Lie

“The price at the pump is elevated in large part because Russian oil, gas, and refining capacity are off the market,” Biden wrote in his inflation article in the Wall Street Journal.

Gas prices started rising long before the Russia Ukraine war. When Biden assumed office and waged a war on domestic oil and gas production by shutting down drilling and pipelines, gasoline prices rose significantly. From Biden’s inauguration to the week Russia invaded Ukraine, gas prices in the U.S. rose from $2.38 per gallon to $3.53 per gallon.

165. Biden Claims He Inherited ‘Stalled Economy’

Biden wrote in his inflation op-ed that “In January 2021, when I took office, the recovery had stalled.”

Shortly before Biden was inaugurated, however, the economy measured an annualized growth rate of 4.5 percent.

164. Biden Says Americans Are Better Paid Under His Administration

Biden claimed in his Wall Street Journal op-ed that “millions of Americans getting jobs with better pay” now that he is in office.

While earnings under Biden have risen 5.5 percent, real wages are down 2.8 percent and prices keep rising above the current 8.3 percent rate.

“The average American has lost about $1,350 in purchasing power from President Biden’s inflation tax,” the America First Policy Institute calculated.

163. Biden Claims He Initiated ‘Fastest Decline in Unemployment on Record’

In his opinion editorial detailing “My Plan For Fighting Inflation,” Biden falsely claimed that his administration is responsible for “the fastest decline in unemployment on record.”

“The job market is the strongest since the post-World War II era, with 8.3 million new jobs, the fastest decline in unemployment on record, and millions of Americans getting jobs with better pay,” he wrote.

Records, however, show that employment from May 2020 to January 2021 under Trump grew by 12.5 million. During that time period, the unemployment rate also declined 8.3 percent, which is 5.7 percent more than the fall measured under Biden’s watch.

162: Biden Repeats False Cannon Claim

Shortly before Biden signed an executive order on policing, he repeated his claim that when the Second Amendment was created, “You couldn’t own a cannon.”

“You couldn’t own certain kinds of weapons. There’s always been limitations,” he said while arguing in favor of more restrictions on Americans’ rights to keep and bear firearms.

Not only were cannons legal when the Consitution was drafted, but they are also legal now. Revolutionary and Civil War-era cannons that don’t take a cartridge can be bought and sold as saluting and signaling devices in the United States. Certain modern artillery cannons that do take cartridges are classified as destructive devices and are legal and regulated under the National Firearms Act.

161: Biden Lies About Number of Times He’s Visited the Middle East

During his commencement speech at the U.S. Naval Academy in May, Biden claimed he has been to Iraq and Afghanistan “38 times.”

“I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 — I think 38 times,” Biden stated.

Not only did his own campaign confirm in 2019 that this was not true after the first time he stated this falsehood, but even The Washington Post fact-checked him on the erroneous claim.

Biden also implied that his son Beau Biden died in combat even though he passed away from cancer.

“My son spent a year in Iraq, won the Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal. I lost him,” Biden said.

160: Biden Says He Received Appointment to Naval Academy

Biden told graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy at their May commencement that he had received an appointment to attend the academy in 1965.

“Before I begin my speech, a thought crossed my mind as I was told the class of ‘72 is here. I was appointed to the academy in 1965 by a senator who I was running against in 1972,” Biden said. “Never planned it that way. I wasn’t old enough to be sworn in. I was only 29 years old when I was running. He was a fine man, and his name was J. Caleb Boggs.”

Biden went on to say that he declined to attend the academy “because I wanted to be a football star” and “you had a guy named Staubach and Bellino here.”

“So I went to Delaware,” he added.

Joe Biden falsely claimed he “was appointed to the [Naval] Academy in 1965” while speaking to Naval Academy graduates today.

At the time described in Biden’s claim, however, the future president was graduating from the University of Delaware. The football players he mentioned as deterrents to his dream of being a football star had also previously graduated, Roger Staubach in 1965 and Joe Bellino in 1961.

159: White House Says Biden Came Up With ‘Ultra MAGA’ Label Himself

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki claimed in a May 10 press conference that President Biden came with the “ultra MAGA” label to define his political opponents all on his own.

“It’s the president’s phrase, and the president made those comments himself,” Psaki said.

The Washington Post revealed on May 13, however, that the label is the product of a “six-month research project” by the left-wing group Center for American Progress Action Fund with former Harvey Weinstein apologist Anita Dunn.

158: Biden Says There Was No Vaccine Available When He Took Office

The White House claimed no coronavirus vaccine was available when President Biden took office in a May 12 tweet.

Operation Warp Speed however, a project to fast-track development for the pandemic disease, produced vaccines in record time. In fact, about 1.3 million Americans were given inoculations on Biden’s first day in office, surpassing the vaccination pace President Biden pledged of 100 million doses distributed in his first 100 days to mark another accomplishment of Donald Trump.

Biden even received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine before taking office.

157: Biden Claims Roaring Economy He Inherited Was On ‘Brink Of A Great Depression’

At a May 11 address in Chicago, President Biden portrayed himself the savior an economy nearing collapse, except the economy was on a rebound from the short-lived pandemic recession that lockdowns threatened to restrain.

“We had an economy on the brink of a Great Depression,” Biden said, despite the nation’s economy not contracting until a year into the president’s term.

According to data from the Department of Commerce, quarterly GDP remained positive until this year, when it decreased 1.4 percent in the first quarter. Real GDP growth under Biden’s first quarter in office was higher than it had been in at least three years as the economy recovered from Democrats’ shutdowns.

156: Biden Claims Vote To Block Abortion Bill Was Partisan. But Joe Manchin Also Voted No

President Biden condemned Republicans on May 11 for their unified rejection of an abortion guarantee written into federal law ahead of a potential decision from the Supreme Court to terminate Roe v. Wade as ruling precedent.

“Once again – as fundamental rights are at risk at the Supreme Court – Senate Republicans have blocked passage of the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that affirmatively protects access to reproductive health care,” Biden said.

But West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, also rejected the bill.

Manchin explained his opposition to the bill on Capitol Hill.

“I respect people who support” it, Manchin said of the bill, which would prevent states from passing restrictions on abortions before fetal viability, and would further allow women to kill their unborn babies if a physician determined the baby was “a risk to the pregnant patient’s life or health” — which could easily be interpreted to broadly include a variety of things under the banner of emotional health.

“Make no mistake. It is not Roe v. Wade codification,” Machin continued. “It’s an expansion. It wipes 500 state laws off the books.”

155: Biden Once Again Blames Inflation on Putin and Covid Pandemic

Inflation reached a four-decade high last month, but, contrary to what Biden said during a speech on economics, Vladimir Putin and Covid-19 are not chiefly to blame.

“There are two leading causes of inflation we’re seeing today,” Biden said. “The first cause of inflation is a once-in-a-century-pandemic … [and] a second cause: Mr. Putin’s war in Ukraine.”

BIDEN: ""There are two leading causes of inflation we're seeing today""

2) ""Mr. Putin's war in Ukraine""



MORE: https://t.co/IVmGxHlAWA pic.twitter.com/Hs1Zw0gmdH — NEWSMAX (@NEWSMAX) May 10, 2022

Inflation, especially for fuel, was already a problem long before the Russia-Ukraine conflict began because Biden waged an open war on the domestic oil and gas industry. On his first day in office, the Democrat nuked the Keystone XL pipeline because it threatened his green energy agenda. Since then, Biden has also canceled Arctic drilling leases and rained down taxes and regulations on domestic production.

Since Biden first assumed office in January of 2021, prices of gasoline, food, rent, and other items have skyrocketed. These price hikes only worsened after Congress passed Biden’s $1.9 trillion federal spending bill.

154: Biden Says Inflation Is His ‘Top Domestic Priority’

During an inflation speech, Biden claimed that tackling inflation is his “top domestic priority.”

“I want every American to know that I am taking inflation very seriously and it’s my top domestic priority,” Biden said.

Biden says he’s “taking inflation very seriously” but so far this week, his administration has been far more preoccupied with rejecting the Supreme Court’s leaked Dobbs v. Jackson draft opinion, which could see the court overturn Roe v. Wade, than soothing American consumers’ fears about a recession.

He also gave no indication that he plans to reinstate the American energy independence achieved under the Trump administration to lower gas prices, which rank as one of the highest inflation jumps each month.

153: Biden Said Robert Bork Thought Government Gave Americans Rights

Biden claimed Judge Robert Bork, the Supreme Court nominee he infamously torpedoed and smeared for his “original-intent judicial philosophy,” believed the government gives people rights.

“Bork believed the only reason you had any inherent rights was because the government gave them to you,” Biden said.

While Bork did appear to reject natural law as a guiding legal philosophy, he acknowledged its existence and never claimed to believe that inherent rights come from the government. Instead, Bork referred to rights in his confirmation hearings as something that could be transferred between parties but did not clarify how they were bestowed.

“What a court adds to one person’s constitutional rights, it subtracts from the rights of others,” Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois quoted Bork saying before asking whether Bork still believed that.

”Well, yes, Senator,” Bork said. ”I think it’s a matter of plain arithmetic.”

152: Biden Accuses ‘MAGA Crowd’ of Being ‘the Most Extreme Political Organization … in American History’

In a rant about the Supreme Court’s leaked Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization opinion signaling the end of Roe v. Wade, Biden accused the “MAGA crowd” of being “the most extreme political organization that’s existed in American history,” before adding, “recent American history.”

Joe Biden says that overturning Roe v. Wade could lead to LGBT children not being allowed in school classrooms:



""This MAGA crowd is the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history."" pic.twitter.com/WyW6j52ju0 — Greg Price (@greg_price11) May 4, 2022

Biden failed to acknowledge that there are far more extreme and violent groups operating within the U.S., who have initiated deadly terrorist attacks on Americans, than the millions of people who voted for and support former President Donald Trump.

He also falsely suggested that the SCOTUS ruling on Dobbs would allow states to bar LGBTQ students from attending class with other students.

“If you have states change the law saying that children who are LGBTQ can’t be in classrooms with other children. Is that legit under the way that the decision is written?” he asked.

151: Biden Blames Putin for Months-Long, Record-High Inflation

Inflation reached a 40-year high last month, but Vladimir Putin and Covid-19 are not to blame, contrary to what Biden likes to suggest.

“I know that families are still struggling with higher prices. I grew up in a family where if the price of gas went up, we felt it. Let’s be absolutely clear about why prices are high right now: COVID and Vladimir Putin,” Biden wrote in a tweet on April 20.

The truth is, inflation, especially for fuel, was already a problem long before the Russia-Ukraine conflict began because Biden waged an open war on the domestic oil and gas industry. On his first day in office, the Democrat nuked the Keystone XL pipeline because it threatened his green energy agenda. Since then, Biden has also canceled Arctic drilling leases and rained down taxes and regulations on domestic production.

Since Biden first assumed office in January of 2021, prices of gasoline, food, rent, and other items have skyrocketed. These price hikes only worsened after Congress passed Biden’s $1.9 trillion federal spending bill.

150: Biden Repeats Lie that Buying American Products Is a Priority

Despite his refusal to utilize the U.S. oil industry to achieve energy independence, Biden said buying American-made products is a priority for his administration.

“From Day One, every action I’ve taken to rebuild our economy has been guided by one principle: Make it in America. That means using products, parts, and materials built right here in the United States of America,” the president tweeted.

Biden told a similar lie during his State of the Union address shortly after the White House defended buying at least $1.3 billion worth of Covid-19 rapid tests from China instead of U.S. manufacturers.

149: Biden Claims He Was A ‘Full Professor’ At The University Of Pennsylvania

Biden repeated a claim on April 14 that he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, this time claiming “full” professorship despite his 2017-2019 tenure being an honorary position.

“For four years I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania,” Biden said during an event on supply chains in Greensboro, North Carolina.

Joe Biden says he was a ""full professor"" at UPenn.

Biden however, didn’t teach at the university, according to a spokesperson for the former vice president at the time he was hired.

The Daily Pennsylvanian headlined a piece ahead of Biden’s arrival, “No one is really sure what Joe Biden will be doing at Penn.”

According to the New York Post, Biden raked in more than $900,000 from the university despite rare appearances.

148: Biden Says You Couldn’t Buy Cannons When Second Amendment Passed

During his gun violence speech on April 11, Biden repeated the lie that cannons couldn’t be bought when the Second Amendment was ratified.

Biden said gunmakers are immune from prosecution even though manufacturers can be sued if a firearm is faulty or malfunctions.

“Gun manufacturers have more immunity from liability than any other American industry,” Biden falsely claimed. “So they’ve never had to take responsibility for the death and destruction their products cause.”

Biden also claimed that gun manufacturers are “the only outfit in the country that is immune,” even though many of the manufacturers who created the Covid-19 jab are immune to prosecution.

146: Biden Claims His Family Worried About Gas Prices As a Kid

“I grew up in a family like many of you where the price of a gallon of gasoline went up, it was discussed at the kitchen table,” Biden claimed.

But, as RealClearMarket’s John Tamny noted after Biden told a similar lie in February, Biden “was born in 1942. When Biden was growing up, the price of gasoline was flat. And it was cheap.”

A chart from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows the price of crude oil nearly flat from the 1880s until the 1970s — far after Joe Biden’s childhood.

145: Biden Says ‘Nothing’ Stopping Domestic Oil Production Even Though He Is

Biden said there’s “nothing standing in the way” of domestic oil companies ramping up production as gas prices skyrocket but his claims are far from the truth.

Even before he assumed office, Biden pledged to take down the domestic oil industry in favor of pushing his green agenda. This involved canceling the permits necessary for the Keystone XL pipeline, halting new oil and gas leases, and more recently, delaying permits for drilling on federal land.

144: Biden Falsely Claims Transgenderism Is ‘Safe and Healthy’

Biden told parents of children suffering from gender confusion that “affirming your child’s identity is one of the most powerful things you can do to keep them safe and healthy.”

Despite Biden’s claims, encouraging young children to take hormone blockers, bind, or engage in other physically altering “treatments” or dangerous and risky procedures is not safe nor healthy. In addition to causing a myriad of harmful side effects including sterility, severe dysfunction, and other health problems, pushing children to embrace an identity different than their God-given sex often leads to transition regret as well as an exponentially higher risk of suicide.

143: Biden Says He Never Watched KBJ’s Confirmation Hearings

Biden told reporters that he “didn’t get a chance to see any of” Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearings last week even though the White House said he did.

“The president watched portions of Judge Jackson’s hearing yesterday and today,” a White House staffer announced in a press briefing last week.

It is unclear if Biden simply forgot that he viewed the hearings or if the White House lied about how the president spends his time.

142: Biden Repeats ‘Very Fine People’ Lie to Smear Trump

During a press conference at the NATO summit in Belgium, Biden repeated the lie that Trump called the Charlottesville white nationalists “very fine people.”

It will always be funny to me when Biden says how Trump's ""very fine people on both sides"" line from Charlottesville was his inspiration to run for president.



The man literally began his presidential campaign on a lie. pic.twitter.com/hJlu8EDFCG — Greg Price (@greg_price11) March 24, 2022

Transcripts show that Trump’s “very fine people” line was in reference to the peaceful protesters on both sides who were civilly expressing their opinions about Confederate statues.

“But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group — excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name,” Trump said.

Trump specifically said he was “not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally,” but Biden still brings up the hoax on occasion.

141: Biden Says Unemployment Claims Down

Biden claimed that because unemployment claims are down because “our labor market is strong.”

Today we learned that the number of new unemployment claims is now lower than it was before the pandemic in 2019.



Our labor market is strong. — President Biden (@POTUS) March 17, 2022

The truth is, restaurants, hospitals, and businesses across the nation are struggling to stay open amid staffing shortages caused by an influx of federal cash. Record numbers of people left their jobs and even the labor market last year after multiple rounds of stimulus checks. Currently, more than 11 million jobs need to be filled and there aren’t enough workers willing to take those positions.

140: Biden Denies Cutting Off Domestic Oil Production

Shortly after he announced Russian oil would no longer be imported into the U.S., Biden claimed that he never stifled the U.S. oil and gas industry.

“It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production. That is simply not true,” Biden insisted.

PANTS ON FIRE: Biden says some high gas prices could be b/c of price-gouging & it's a lie to say he's stifled domestic energy.



""It's no time for profiteering or price gauging…It's simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production."" pic.twitter.com/PtJNHDufYy — Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) March 8, 2022

The truth is, Biden has done nothing but sabotage the U.S. oil and gas industry and replaced it with his green energy policy agenda. The president used his first year in office to wreck domestic production by suspending oil and gas leases, axing projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office, canceling Arctic drilling leases, and pushing a cascade of taxes and regulation on the industry.

As a result, domestic gas prices were rising dramatically well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Painful prices at the pump have quickly become a sore spot for Americans, many of whom have indicated they’re looking for a change in the November midterms.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/08/heres-the-full-list-of-every-lie-joe-biden-has-told-as-president-part-three/,2022-03-08
"If Democrats Cared About Ending Crime, They Would Punish Criminals","President Joe Biden told Americans on Monday that regulating firearms is the best way to combat rising violent crime in U.S. cities, but taking away the gun rights of law-abiding Americans doesn’t rein in criminals, especially those let off the hook by soft-on crime progressives.

Violent crime, often perpetrated using firearms, is on the rise in many American cities. In 2021 alone, at least 14 Democrat-controlled urban hubs reported all-time high homicide records.

Even though this historic crime streak is even plaguing cities with strict gun laws, the Biden administration wants gun parts, such as frames and receivers, to be serialized and regulated as regular firearms so they can be traced. This would require customers who purchase gun kits from retailers to undergo a background check like they would if they were buying an already-assembled firearm.

“All of a sudden, it’s no longer a ghost. It has a return address. It’s going to help save lives, reduce crime, and get more criminals off the streets,” Biden said.

What Biden failed to mention in his lie-riddled gun-control speech is that build-your-own guns make up a remarkably small portion of the firearms used to commit crimes in America. To put it in perspective, New York City police seized more than 6,000 illegal guns in 2021. Only about 200 of them did not have serial numbers.

New polling suggests that 61 percent of voters are not pleased with Biden’s handling of crime, so now the White House is clearly trying to take action to combat this negative perception with random rules ostensibly to curb gun violence. Chances are, however, any rules regulating so-called “ghost guns” won’t have the effect on crime that Biden claims they would.

Media outlets often frame the increase in guns without serial numbers as a big problem for crime-plagued cities, but the fact is that a large percentage of these criminals obtained their guns illegally.

A 2019 Department of Justice survey of imprisoned criminals found that at least 43 percent of offenders obtained their firearms via the black market. Only 10 percent made a purchase from a federally licensed firearms store, which is where Biden’s new rules would be enforced. In other words, Biden’s new gun rules won’t change the crime rates because his policies target purchasers who buy from gun retailers, not the black market.

Instead of trampling on the Second Amendment to supposedly combat rising crime, Biden should encourage members of his party and progressive judicial activists to toughen up on the offenders who use guns to facilitate illicit activity.

Earlier this year, California’s soft-on-crime Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation released from prison Smiley Allen Martin, one of the gunmen accused of going on a shooting spree in downtown Sacramento last week. Martin was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2018 for domestic violence and assault. If not for his early release under the state’s prison capacity reduction plan, Martin would still be locked up.

Prosecuting and locking up offenders is pivotal in combatting crime, but it’s not something Biden or Democrats are focused on promoting.

In fact, for most of the last month, the White House has actively defended progressive criminal reform policies and people such as Biden’s Supreme Court pick Ketanji Brown Jackson who are guilty of using them to let dangerous offenders off the hook.

Taking away the gun rights of law-abiding Americans doesn’t stop dangerous criminals from obtaining firearms and committing crimes. Instead of trying to legislate crime off the streets, Biden and Democrats should focus on prosecuting and punishing offenders to the full extent of the law.

"As Crime Grows, Biden’s Radical War On Self-Defense Is Alienating Voters","President Joe Biden’s unpopular gun control moves are doing little to appease his gun control donor class. Worse, those same moves are distancing him from voters that clearly see crime as a central issue and gun ownership as a right to be protected.

Among the unpopular policy positions dragging down his presidency is his myopic focus on gun control instead of crime control. The Biden White House has pursued the most far-reaching and radical gun control agenda of any president, previously naming a gun control lobbyist to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) whose nomination was defeated when not even all Senate Democrats could support the nominee.

Biden has since nominated Steve Dettelbach, who once campaigned for public office on a gun control platform. President Biden is also circumventing Congress’s authority to write laws by issuing an administrative rule to redefine frames and receivers and ban arm braces on AR-style pistols and instituting a top-down policy of “zero tolerance” inspections that would revoke licenses of firearm retailers instead of working with small business owners to correct minor clerical errors.

On top of that, President Biden is facing two additional factors not working in his favor on gun control and lawful gun ownership. Gun control groups are livid that President Biden hasn’t delivered their goal of disarming the American population. He was rated just a “D+” by gun control groups exasperated that he hasn’t ruled like a dictator to unilaterally ban entire classes of firearms and delivered a laundry list of gun control “must-haves,” including a Cabinet-adjacent position that’s outside of Senate confirmation to push even more gun control policies.

Voters Are Worried About Criminals, Not Legal Gun Owners

At the same time, many voters aren’t behind Biden’s radical gun control agenda. Support for gun control is dropping. After high-profile criminal incidents that captured the news cycles, including the New York City subway attack and the gang-related murders in Sacramento, Calif., voters are seeing that gun control isn’t the pressing issue. Crime is.

The Biden administration is attempting to “bait-and-switch” public opinion to ignore inaction on curbing crime and lay the blame on lawful gun owners. The president has repeatedly used the bully pulpit to demand everything from universal background checks (which would require every law-abiding gun owner to be listed on a government watchlist) to the repeal of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which prevents frivolous lawsuits against the firearm industry for the actions of criminals.

He repeats claims that have been debunked time and again, including that Americans couldn’t buy a cannon when the Bill of Rights was enacted. In fact, it is perfectly legal for an individual to own a cannon today.

President Biden isn’t just facing a public that’s more concerned about crime than cracking down on gun owners. He’s also facing an electorate that abandoned him on his push to relegate lawful gun ownership to the fringe.

Gun Owners Are Growing and Diversifying

More than 21 million background checks were conducted for the sale of a firearm in 2020, the year Biden was elected. Another 18.5 million were tallied in 2021. Among those gun buyers were nearly 14 million between 2020 and 2021 who purchased a firearm for the first time.

Those gun owners are increasingly from many parts of America, with more African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans taking up lawful gun ownership. Women gun owners are increasingly a larger force in firearm purchasers, making up one of the fastest-growing demographics of gun owners.

Simple election math indicates these are growing gun-owning demographic groups that don’t easily overlay traditional Republican voters. That means the gun-owning tent is getting bigger and makes the path to winning a White House election more complicated than parroting the talking points fed by special interest gun control groups.

That’s got some analysts warning Democrats – including President Biden – to back off of their gun control push. Richard Feldman, president of the Independent Firearm Owners Association, wrote in an op-ed saying the substantial increases of women and minority gun owners over the past two years are changing the calculus. These are core Democrat voting blocks.

More troubling for Democrats is that, even a few years ago, 48 percent of self-identified independents said they owned or lived with someone who owned a gun. That swayable middle is the crown jewel in any election.

Voting Blocks Are Already Shifting

According to Feldman, last year’s off-cycle elections in New Jersey and Virginia are telling. New Jersey’s Republican state Sen. Ed Durr defeated long-serving Democrat state Senate President Steve Sweeney by 2,300 votes in deep-blue New Jersey. Durr initiated his campaign because he couldn’t obtain a concealed-carry permit.

While critical race theory in education was the hottest-button issue in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, former Democrat Gov. Terry McAuliffe campaigned on expanding gun control in the Commonwealth, including an outright ban on AR-15s. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vowed to protect gun rights. Feldman pointed out that a 1 percent shift in the voter turnout would mean McAuliffe would be governor today.

Virginia’s Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears embodied the shift in voting blocks that helped hand victory to the Republican ticket. She’s African-American and her campaign photos included some of her holding her AR-15. Sears told The New York Times “I look like the strategy” for future elections.

That means rethinking where certain demographics fall in the political spectrum. Attitudes are shifting, and new gun owners of all backgrounds are voting with their wallets when it comes to their values of lawful firearm ownership.

Data Shows White Supremacists Are Not The Most Likely Mass Murderers,"In his Buffalo, New York speech last week following a mass shooting, President Biden showed he still has only two things on his mind regarding crime: guns and white supremacists.

No one can defend white supremacists. But with violent crime soaring and this latest attack in Buffalo, people want something done. Yet Biden’s agenda won’t make people safer.

“Look, we’ve seen the mass shootings in Charleston, South Carolina; El Paso, Texas; in Pittsburgh. Last year in Atlanta. This week in Dallas, Texas, and now in Buffalo. In Buffalo, New York,” Biden said. “White supremacy is a poison. It’s a poison. It really is. Running through our body politic. And it’s been allowed to fester and grow right in front of our eyes. No more. I mean, no more.”

Of the 82 mass public shootings from January 1998 to May 2021, 9 percent have known or alleged ties to white supremacists, neo-Nazis, or anti-immigrant views. Many of the anti-immigrant attackers, such as the Buffalo murderer, hold decidedly environmentalist views that are more in line with the Democrat agenda.

Other groups commit mass public shootings disproportionately more than whites do. While non-Middle Eastern whites make up about 64 percent of the population, they make up 58 percent of the mass public shooters. Another 9 percent are carried out by people of Middle Eastern origin, who make up only 0.4 percent of the country’s population. That makes Middle Easterners the most likely ethnic or racial group to carry out mass public shootings.

Blacks, Asians, and American Indians also commit these attacks at a slightly higher rate than their share of the population. Hispanics commit them at much lower rates (11 percent lower) than their share of the population.

Seventy-one percent of mass public shooters have no identifiable political views. But you would never know this from watching TV police dramas or listening to Biden’s constant claim that white supremacists pose the biggest threat of domestic terrorism.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas claimed in testimony in April that white supremacy is the top terrorism-related threat to the homeland. But when pressed, Mayorkas couldn’t name a single white supremacy case that his department referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution.

White supremacists with guns are not the threat that our government would have us believe. It’s not just that white supremacy is rare. So too are gun crimes. The number of gun crimes has been falling dramatically, and they now make up less than 8 percent of violent crimes in America. Yet we constantly hear the opposite from politicians who support gun restrictions.

“We can keep assault weapons off our streets. We’ve done it before. I did it when I passed the crime bill last time, and violence went down, shootings went down,” Biden falsely claimed in Buffalo. “We can’t prevent people from being radicalized to violence, but we can address the relentless exploitation of the internet to recruit and mobilize terrorism. We just need to have the courage to do that, to stand up.”

Biden’s focus on guns, and particularly assault weapons, is misplaced. Last Tuesday, Biden again bragged about how wonderful his 1994 assault weapon ban was in stopping mass public shootings, but even studies paid for by the Clinton administration couldn’t find evidence of its effectiveness.

If the federal assault weapons ban really drove the changes in the rate of mass public shootings, attacks with assault weapons should have become less common during the ban. Then they should have become more common, at least as a share of total shootings, after the ban ended in 2004.

But that isn’t what happened. Comparing the ten years before 1994 to the ten years after, we find that the percentage of mass public shootings with assault weapons rose slightly when the ban was in effect (going from 22.2 percent to 23.5 percent) and then fell in the ten years after the ban ended (23.5 percent to 18.2 percent).

Biden’s “guns first” approach ignores a basic fact: More than 92 percent of violent crimes in America do not involve firearms. In addition, although Biden blames guns for the increase in violent crime, the latest data show that gun crimes fell dramatically.

A new McLaughlin and Associates survey of 1,000 likely voters from April 20 to 26th for the Crime Prevention Research Center shows how misinformed people are. People across the country, of all races and incomes, have wildly inaccurate beliefs about how frequently violent crime involves guns.

The average likely American voter is way off, thinking that more than 46 percent of violent crimes involve guns. The people who had the most inaccurate views that the rate of violent crime with guns was the highest were the ones who most strongly supported gun control.

It might not be easy to accept, but based on the evidence, focusing solely on guns and white supremacy isn’t a wise use of resources.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/23/data-shows-white-supremacists-are-not-the-most-likely-mass-murderers/,2022-05-23
Don’t Surrender To Do-Somethingism On Guns,"Before we even knew how the killer of 19 children and two adults at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, had obtained his guns, Chris Murphy was engaging in his customary performative emotionalism on the Senate floor, literally begging Republicans to “compromise.”

Compromise on what exactly? Murphy has never once offered a single proposal that would have deterred any of these mass shooters. Literally minutes after his routine, Murphy was asked about the obvious mental illness prevalent among most of these shooters. “Spare me the bullsh-t about mental illness,” the Connecticut senator responded, “ripping” the GOP. “We don’t have any more mental illness than any other country in the world.” That’s how serious he is about compromise.

Whether America is more prone to mental illness or not, these incidents are almost exclusively perpetrated by young men who have exhibited serious anti-social behavior. All of them break a slew of existing laws. All of them have either obtained guns illegally, or legally before having any criminal record. In many, if not most, cases, the shooter is already on the cops’ radar because he has threatened others or written insane, violent manifestos. In a study of mass shootings from 2008 to 2017, the Secret Service found that “100 percent of perpetrators showed concerning behaviors, and in 77 percent of shootings, at least one person – most often a peer – knew about their plan.”

Rather than focusing on these tangible entry points for potentially useful legislation, instead of proposing ideas on better identifying shooters before they act, instead of thinking about how schools could be structurally safer, instead of debating the efficacy of putting more cops in schools — and none of these are panaceas, mind you — Senate Democrats were busy dunking on Republicans for failing to support bills that have absolutely zero to do with mass shootings.

Chuck Schumer planned to introduce H.R. 8, an expanded background check bill, and H.R. 1446, a bill that would close the alleged “Charleston Loophole” (before he realized it wouldn’t be politically expedient.) “Alleged” because Dylann Roof, who murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston in 2015, got a clean background check, not because of any “loophole,” but because local prosecutors had failed to respond to the FBI’s request for information. It was a case of human error, or negligence. So maybe Democrats should be promoting a “law-enforcement-should-do-its-job” bill. Because all “universal” background checks do is stop friends and families from gifting guns. Straw purchases are already illegal, as Schumer, Pelosi, and Murphy already know. And passing expanded background checks after a school shooting is tantamount to demanding stricter drivers tests after a hit and run.

Democrats, obsessed with largely irrelevant issues like AR-15s and “universal background checks,” are largely living in the early 1990s. Joe Biden’s address to the nation consisted of a litany of hackneyed talking points he’s been regurgitating for decades now — including that transcendently stupid joke about deer in Kevlar. “As a nation, we have to ask, when in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?” Biden said — again.

Democrats love to hammer the strawman “gun lobby” because they don’t want to openly attack tens of millions of gun owners. The NRA, whose power has significantly diminished over the past decades, could disappear tomorrow and it wouldn’t alter gun policy one bit. Either another organization would emerge — probably a more rigid one — or gun owners and Second Amendment advocates (we’re in the midst of the largest expansion of gun ownership in American history) would continue voting for politicians who oppose restrictions aimed at peaceful gun ownership.

Meanwhile, Republicans will have to deal with a barrage of preposterous smears. “There is no such thing as being ‘pro-life’ while supporting laws that let children be shot in their schools, elders in grocery stores, worshippers in their houses of faith, survivors by abusers, or anyone in a crowded place,” Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.

This was indicative of the sort of demented accusation thrown around these days. One suspects liberals who take to the internet to accuse Republicans of abetting infanticide aren’t really interested in compromise. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, who champions laws that empower people to terminate the lives of the viable unborn, I don’t know of a single Republican who supports the gunning down of elementary school children.

Indeed, law-abiding Americans have no obligation to take ownership of a madman’s actions. Nor is there any reason for them to surrender their right to self-defense so that Chris Murphy, who, evidenced in many of his comments, is only interested in incrementally limiting gun ownership. That’s his right, of course. He should try and repeal the Second Amendment. Until then, however, Democrats interested in genuine compromise may want to offer realistic, productive, and germane ideas, rather than using another horrific tragedy to dunk on their political opponents.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/25/dont-surrender-to-do-somethingism-on-guns/,2022-05-25
Check Out The Bravest Gun Rights Speech You’ll Ever See,"The National Rifle Association is hosting its leadership summit in Houston on Friday. Following a mass shooting at a Texas elementary school Tuesday, many corporate media outlets are suggesting politicians should cancel their planned speeches there.

ABC News tweeted:

“Houston Mayor Says He Can’t Cancel NRA Convention After School Massacre,” wrote Bloomberg. “Trump will keep ‘longtime commitment’ to Texas NRA event despite school shooting,” wrote the New York Post.

Why would an organization of law-abiding defenders of the U.S. Constitution cancel an event on account of a horrific school shooting committed by an individual with no regard for constitutional principles, readers might ask. Nevertheless, the pressure from the media and others opposed to gun rights will be intense.

It is reminiscent of a previous attempt by the media and other partisans to blame law-abiding gun owners and their defenders for gun violence. On April 20, 1999, two high school seniors murdered 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. The NRA was slated to hold its large convention in Denver just days later.

Everyone in the political and media classes warned the NRA to cancel their convention. Many immediately pushed for gun control as the only valid response to the murders.

President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton immediately called for limits on gun rights, as did many other Democrat politicians. The Democrat mayor of Denver, Wellington Webb, repeatedly told the NRA attendees that they weren’t welcome anymore.

Weak-kneed politicians canceled their planned appearances. More than five dozen Colorado business leaders signed a full-page ad published in local newspapers asking the convention organizers to cancel. Thousands of anti-gun rights activists descended on the convention.

Nevertheless, a few brave gun rights proponents stood strong. Charlton Heston — the actor and civil rights activist who was by then president of the NRA — opened up the convention in Denver on May 1, saying it was “absurd” and “offensive” to act as if supporters of Second Amendment rights couldn’t gather.

But what happened next was breathtaking. The top-ranking Republican in the state at that time was Gov. Bill Owens. He declined an invitation to speak. Secretary of State Vikki Buckley, a black Republican in her second term, welcomed the attendees to Colorado with a breathtaking speech on gun rights. “I greet you as Secretary of State of Colorado and I welcome you to Colorado, a state where some of us believe strongly in the entire Constitution of these United States, including the Second Amendment.”

Buckley was the first black secretary of state in Colorado and the first black Republican woman elected statewide in the Centennial State. The mother of three sons, she had once been on welfare to support them, eventually becoming a clerk typist in the secretary of state’s office in the early 1980s.

Her campaign pitch was to tell people that if she didn’t win the race, she’d have to train whoever did win. She defeated four other candidates for the Republican nomination in 1994 on the strength of a floor speech, even though hardly anyone at the convention had heard of her previously.

Buckley mentored young women and spoke to international women’s organizations about building stronger communities. She helped homeless children and worked to end the scourge of gang violence.

One of the children killed at Columbine was Isaiah Shoels, an 18-year-old black senior. His murderers had used racial slurs before killing him. Buckley had spent time with his parents and quoted Isaiah’s father about the scourge underlying violence.

“Guns are not the issue. Hate is what pulls the trigger of violence,” she said. She talked about “new age hate crimes,” such as raising children “without a value system which places a premium on human life,” or sending children to school “without a value system which teaches the difference between right and wrong.” She listed the ways in which children were not prepared for socioeconomic success, saying, “raise as much heck about that as you did about the NRA, and you will have saved more lives in five years than are taken with guns in a century.”

Buckley then shared the painful story of how she was the victim of gun violence. “I know firsthand the pain and fear–but that experience has not made me an opponent of the NRA or the Second Amendment,” she said. She called for resources to be spent against violence and hate, then said, “But we must stand ever strong against those who would ignore sections of the U.S. Constitution which they do not like. We are a strong democracy because the guiding principles of our Constitution and all of its amendments including the Second must be adhered to in its entirety, not selectively. Thank you and God bless America.”

The thousands of attendees roared to their feet and gave her a standing ovation. You can watch the speech here.

Rabid anti-gun rights activist Jake Tapper — yes, that Jake Tapper — attacked Buckley and her ideas. The Wall Street Journal, on the other hand, suggested Buckley was set for greater political heights.

It was not to be. Buckley died unexpectedly of a heart attack just two months later. Her courage and leadership is remembered.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/26/check-out-the-bravest-gun-rights-speech-youll-ever-see/,2022-05-26
Many On The Left Used To Strongly Support Self-Defense With A Gun,"The horrific shootings at Uvalde Elementary School have once again brought gun control into the national debate. The political divide remains the same; with Republicans defending the Second Amendment and Democrats demanding more stringent gun control to allegedly stop such shootings from occurring in the future.

This issue is so partisan that it is hard to remember that once upon a time there wasn’t such a clear divide between right and left.

In 1934, crediting trigger-happy bank robbers such as Bonnie and Clyde, newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed and signed into law the first federal gun-control act. The bill involved the national registration and taxation of all firearms.

Republicans and Democrats in Congress were alarmed about this threat to gun rights, and gutted the bill to taxing only shotguns and machine guns — weapons at that time only used by criminals. They protected the rights of pistol owners from registration and taxation, asserting that rural landowners did not have quick access to police protection and thus needed to defend their homes.

After the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and senator and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, President Lyndon Johnson in 1968 signed into law a measure that would ban ordering rifles and shotguns through the mail (Lee Harvey Oswald had ordered the rifle he killed JFK with through the mail) and kept felons, drug users, and people judged “mentally incompetent” from buying guns.

Republicans including actor Jimmy Stewart and future National Rifle Association (NRA) president Charlton Heston supported the bill. Heston appeared on TV to back the bill:

This bill is no mystery. Let’s be clear about it. Its purpose is simple and direct. It is not to deprive the sportsman of his hunting gun, the marksman of his target rifle, nor would it deny to any responsible citizen his constitutional right to own a firearm. It is to prevent the murder of Americans.

The Left Once Supported the Second Amendment

But what is most surprising about the history of the gun control debate isn’t that once upon a time Democrats and Republicans banded together against gun control legislation or that Heston, once the most public face of gun rights, supported restrictions on gun ownership by an uber-liberal president. It is that many on the left, in contrast to those today who line up en masse for gun control legislation, have supported the Second Amendment.

Given the police and vigilante violence against the civil rights movement in the 1960s, support of the Second Amendment was one matter that united Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., who otherwise differed considerably. Malcolm X asserted that American blacks should own a weapon, as did King, who owned a gun and traveled with armed guards.

Even white socialists, in contrast to the Democratic Socialist Party today, opposed gun control. Eugene Debs, a four-time socialist candidate for president in the early 1900s, saw gun control legislation as a means for capitalists to install tyranny over a weaponless working class.

The Rifle Is a Symbol of Democracy

George Orwell, a fervent socialist, supported the right of the citizens to bear arms. Orwell saw this issue through a leftist and not a law and order lens: “The rifle hanging on the wall of the working-class flat or laborer’s cottage is the symbol of democracy. It is our job to see that it stays there.”

Orwell’s sentiments were based on experience. As a soldier on the Loyalist side during the Spanish Civil War, Orwell was aware that only the citizenry breaking into the armory initially repelled Francisco Franco’s fascist-backed rebellion.

When Joseph Stalin, who “backed” the Loyalist side, sought to import his murderous purge trials into Spain, and thus kill off any non-communists on the Loyalist side, his first order of business was confiscating the Loyalist fighters’ weapons. Orwell, who belonged to a Trotskyite militia, engaged in street fighting against these gun confiscators.

So, personally aware of how a tyrant crushed a weaponless opposition, Orwell was determined for this never to happen again. In 1940, when a Nazi invasion of his native Britain seemed all but imminent, Orwell joined a citizen’s militia, the Home Guard, which was deliberately modeled on the “people’s army” of Spain (many of the volunteers had fought there). This group was tasked with protecting England’s bridges and railroads and, if necessary, fighting from house to house.

But Orwell saw a bigger role: that of ensuring a home-grown fascist coup would never happen. Predictably, the Colonel Blimps among his countrymen worried about any sophisticated weaponry getting to these “Reds” and sought to halt it. Orwell also believed that the Home Guard should remain weaponized beyond the war so as to protect individual liberty.

Protection from the Government

For government officials such as President Joe Biden who assert the populace doesn’t need sophisticated weaponry (read: assault rifles) to protect themselves, Orwell can again be consulted. In a postwar essay, “You and the Atom Bomb,” he noted that when there is “no answer to it,” “rifles” are “inherently democratic weapons” and “gives claws to the weak”; complex weapons, when owned solely by the government, “make the strong stronger.”

The late Christopher Hitchens, in many ways Orwell’s socialist heir, who once wrote for the far-left Nation magazine, opposed their editorial stance against the Second Amendment. In the 1990s he used his column in the magazine to defend gun ownership. As an immigrant to America he found, “I have, gradually, come to think that there is something truly admirable in a country that codifies the responsibility to self-defense.”

Like Orwell, he thought it wise to prepare for the possibility that gun owners “might have to muster against the state.” What he saw in the United States was instead “cowering citizens” whose fearfulness caused them to turn more and more power for their defense over to the “military-industrial complex.”

Rather than demanding protection from the government and, when that failed, cheering on vigilantism, Hitchens urged the “revolutionary” and very much “in the American grain” idea of citizens’ being in charge of their own self-defense. Reviving the idea of a “well-regulated militia” would destroy the need for a military-industrial complex. Rather than viewing the NRA as the enemy, Hitchens saw the group as essential to this scheme by providing weapons training for the citizenry to “be accompanied by a reading of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.”

Socialist Sanders Opposed Gun Control

Even socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders as late as the 2016 presidential election had a less knee-jerk condemnation of gun rights than he does today. His then-primary opponent Hillary Clinton condemned Sanders’s record in the 1980s regarding gun legislation. In that period, this self-declared democratic socialist voted against the Brady Bill, which required federal background checks for firearms purchases.

Sanders also voted to prevent lawsuits against gun manufacturers, to allow guns to be transported in checked baggage on Amtrak trains, and to prohibit foreign aid from going to any international efforts to restrict gun ownership. In response to the Sandy Hook shootings, Sanders stated: “If you passed the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don’t think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen.”

As one can see from the rarely mentioned history of gun support on the left, the same concern that the NRA expresses today, of a weaponless citizenry being tyrannized by a weapons-confiscating federal government, was shared by a variety of people on the left. Black civil rights leaders, black separatists, and black revolutionary groups believed their only protection and liberation from racist whites was gun ownership. Socialists feared that a weaponless working class would usher in a dictatorship by capitalists.

Newsom’s Gun Buyback Program Makes Zero Sense,"Gavin Newsom promises that California is going to enact the largest gun buyback program in the nation. Though we don’t know the specifics yet, we do know the effort will fail as it conflicts with many basic rules of economics.

Most buyback programs work the same way: The police set up a day and time where people show up and hand over their unwanted guns, no questions asked. Of the weapons collected, the ones that turn out to be stolen or connected to a crime are confiscated, and the rest are either melted down or recycled in some non-weapon form.

The first problem is that buybacks attract people least likely to be involved in criminality. More than a decade ago, Oakland police offered $250 per gun “no questions asked, no ID required.” Among those taking advantage were out-of-state retirees with trunkfuls of old weapons and gun dealers who were trading in their cheapest guns for a profit. You’re not getting firearms “off the streets,” you’re getting a rusty gun out of some geezer’s attic. In 2012, after another buyback, Oakland police were bragging about collecting a rifle with a bayonet and a 3-inch derringer. When police pay for largely out-of-commission rifles and revolvers, all buyback programs do is increase the value of old guns.

Indeed, if buyback programs offer less than market value, a gun owner can simply take their weapon to a dealer. When Tucson ran a buyback program, the city collected around 200 firearms, most of them out of commission. Why? “A few hundred feet away,” reported the Cincinnati Enquirer, “gun dealers set up tables and offered cash for any guns in good enough condition to resell.” When Seattle put on a buyback program, signs like “$$ For Assault Rifles” or “Fast Cash For Your Gun!” began appearing nearby.

Then again, if the state offers above market value for a firearm, sellers can take the profit and buy a new gun. Buyback programs may well be putting more modern guns in the hands of civilians.

What buyback programs don’t do is attract the kind of guns that are used in the vast majority of murders. Criminals aren’t handing back their 9mm handguns because black market firearms are likely worth considerably more than $250 or $500. Buyback programs exemplify the downside of focusing on guns rather than criminals. What they do not do, as virtually every study on the program has shown, is mitigate criminality or suicide.

"There's No Bipartisan Gun 'Deal' In The Works, Just GOP Capitulation","Democrats and the corporate media like to call it a “compromise” when they get exactly what they want and Republicans get nothing. Just witness the bipartisan talks underway in the wake of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas on new gun control legislation.

These talks, which reportedly involve four GOP senators led by Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, are focusing on two new gun control proposals: universal background checks and red flag laws. Whatever one’s opinion about the merits of these policies, it’s a fact that Democrats have long wanted to make it harder for law-abiding Americans to purchase guns and easier for the government to take them away.

Both of these proposals would do just that, while arguably doing almost nothing to prevent the sort of mass shooting we saw last week in Uvalde. One of the policy ideas, so-called “universal background checks,” isn’t a policy so much as a slogan meant to convey an inchoate desire that bad guys not be allowed to buy guns.

As nearly every gun owner in America knows, almost every gun sold in this country already comes with a background check, which is already required under federal law. As my colleague David Harsanyi noted yesterday, lying on your background check or evading it with a straw purchase are already illegal under federal law.

The other idea, a national red-flag law, would empower judges and police to confiscate guns from Americans who have not been charged with, nor committed, any crime at all. What’s more, a person judged guilty of pre-crime under a red-flag law cannot appeal the decision until after his or her guns have been confiscated.

Nineteen states already have some version of red-flag law already on the books, some worse than others, and all relatively new. New York has one, but it didn’t stop the Buffalo shooter from obtaining the guns he used to kill 10 people at grocery store last month. (He also passed a federal background check.)

So much for the policies themselves. The point here is not that they are good or bad ideas but that they are the sort of things Democrats have wanted to do for a long time and haven’t been able to because Republicans have blocked them.

Why have Republicans blocked them? Because too many Republican voters understand that the purpose of such laws is to erode the Second Amendment and eventually take guns from law-abiding Americans who pose no risk of danger to anyone.

But now we have these bipartisan talks underway. Reporting on the talks, The New York Times repeatedly framed them as efforts to strike a “deal” or a “compromise,” noting, for example, how projected GOP gains in the midterms “could inform how willing Republicans will be in the coming days to compromise on gun rights, an issue that has become central to their party.”

But there is in fact no compromise on the table. A compromise is when both parties give up something to get something else. That’s not happening here.

Democrats aren’t talking about how they’re willing to, say, get rid of gun-free zones in schools and colleges that receive federal funding in exchange for Republican support for a national red-flag law. That would be a compromise or a deal, and it would no doubt enrage the base of either party, especially the Democrats’ radical left wing, which is why it’s very unlikely to happen.

What’s happening here is that some Republicans, including Sens. Cornyn and Lindsay Graham, among others, are mulling over whether and when they will cave to pressure from the media and their Democrat colleagues and simply give them what they want without getting anything in return.

Make no mistake, there is no “deal” in the works here, there is only Republican capitulation. That’s something conservatives, at least, should be well familiar with by now. Republicans in Washington have been capitulating to Democrats and the media for decades, on nearly every conceivable issue.

We should not be surprised that they are doing it again, but we should at least be honest about what’s happening and not pretend that Cornyn and Graham and the others are cooking up some kind of genius compromise on gun control. If they were, that really would be news.

'Top Gun' Is A Better Recruiting Ad Than That Woke Army Cartoon,"When “Top Gun” came out in 1986, it helped drive a surge of interest in flying for the U.S. military, including a 10 percent spike in service academy applications. Its sequel, “Top Gun: Maverick,” which came out just ahead of Memorial Day weekend, is chock-full of the same feel-good heroics, guts, and patriotism that made a generation of boys (and a few girls) dream of becoming fighter pilots nearly 40 years ago.

The Pentagon collaborated with producers on the movie, as it has with myriad other military flicks. Now, from ads lined up to accompany the movie to recruitment tables set up outside theaters, the Navy and Air Force are making no secret of using “Top Gun: Maverick” as a recruiting tool, as well they should. It’s a far better promotion for the U.S. military than the embarrassing, woke garbage that equity consultants have been churning out.

A year ago, the U.S. Army released a 2-minute cartoon narrated by Cpl. Emma Malonelord and ostensibly depicting her childhood.

“It begins in California with a little girl raised by two moms,” she says. “Although I had a fairly typical childhood, took ballet, played violin, I also marched for equality. I like to think I’ve been defending freedom from an early age,” she adds, before detailing the day her moms were married (complete with a colorfully animated wedding).

She then talks about being a sorority girl surrounded by “other strong women,” before realizing she had so much privilege that she finally decided to have her “own adventures” like her friend that was studying abroad in Italy. So, Emma joined the Army.

The ad makes our military — the members of which I deeply respect — appear instead like a bunch of kindergarteners. Emma’s reason for joining up is selfish; it’s not because she wants to sacrifice for a cause she believes in, it’s because her friends are studying abroad in Italy or climbing Mount Everest and she wants to do something exciting too.

It’s painfully obvious that the point of the ad was to check boxes in the Army’s department of showing how much the Pentagon loves lesbian weddings. The animation is reminiscent of a B-list kids TV show, and so is the sugary tone of the voiceover.

There is zero in the video to inspire any kind of bravery, sacrifice, duty, honor, integrity, excellence, teamwork, or respect. Like the short-lived “Army of One” slogan of 20 years ago, this ad is all about being your best self and fulfilling your personal needs and desires. It’s more evocative of a cheesy Instagram caption than a profession that is aptly described as service.

Unlike that dumpster fire of an ad campaign — which was only one video in a series of five — “Top Gun” (both movies) gave viewers something to be inspired by besides themselves. There are strong themes of sacrifice, bravery, and overcoming personal challenges for the good of the mission and your team. While Maverick and Iceman might be a smidge too cocky, they have the exploits to back it up; they’re not talking about their sororities or “shattering some stereotypes.”

Besides that, there’s the fact that “Top Gun” actually makes the military look cool. Who sees the epic dogfights, the sharp uniforms, the shiny aviator glasses, the daring flybys, or the dramatic takeoffs without wanting to be that legendary? I doubt anyone who watched the Army’s cartoon walked away with the same impression.

It turns out, Tom Cruise and company are far better at making a compelling promo for the U.S. military than “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion”-crazed bureaucrats at the Pentagon are. (The ad is no one-off; Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley told Congress he wanted to “understand white rage,” while Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday defended the Navy’s inclusion of Ibram X. Kendi’s “How to Be an Antiracist” as recommended reading for sailors.)

The military isn’t going to fix its alarming recruiting lull with kitschy “be yourself” cartoons. Nor are movies like “Top Gun” enough to combat our cultural war of attrition on concepts like duty, responsibility, and sacrifice. But at least the latter is speaking the right language.

Gun Store Shutdowns Spike 500 Percent Under 'Zero Tolerance' For Typos,"President Joe Biden is overzealously targeting firearm retailers to drive them out of business. Federal firearm license revocations for retailers have increased 500 from previous years. That’s got gun control groups excited, but it is casting a pall over the cooperative relationship firearm retailers maintain with law enforcement.

President Biden never hid the fact that he intended to use the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to drive his gun control agenda. He campaigned on a platform of targeting the firearm industry instead of focusing on criminals.

“Our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA, the gun manufacturers,” President Biden said from the presidential campaign debate stage.

That hostility produced a platform that turned the ATF from the bureau that regulates the firearm industry and enforces federal gun laws into the hammer and anvil by which the Biden administration is pummeling flat firearm retailers. Instead of compliance inspections by ATF Industry Operations Investigators to work to ensure firearm retailers remain within federal firearm regulations, those inspections are now driving firearm retailers out of business.

Revocations

Lee Williams, an independent investigative reporter specializing in covering firearms, revealed that ATF once revoked the licenses of federal firearms licensees (FFLs) at a rate of about 40 each year. “But, in the 11 months since Joe Biden declared war on ‘rogue gun dealers,’ the ATF has revoked 273 FFLs — an increase of more than 500%,” Williams reported. “However, rather than targeting the true rogues, Biden’s ATF is revoking FFLs for the most minor of paperwork errors, which were never a concern for the ATF until Biden weaponized the agency.”

That’s due to the Biden administration’s “zero tolerance” inspection policy. That means inspectors are revoking federal firearms licenses for even minor clerical errors that previously would warrant a warning letter.

ATF has the authority to revoke licenses for even these minor clerical errors but used to be more interested in compliance. That changed under the Biden administration and the Department of Justice (DOJ) led by Attorney General Merrick Garland. National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) is providing retailers with guidance to be prepared for these inspections.

Misplaced Priorities

The White House budget request clearly identified that driving gun stores out of business was a higher priority than pursuing criminals. President Biden proposed earlier this year to spend $20.6 billion on the Justice Department for federal law enforcement, crime prevention, and intervention.

Tucked into that spending proposal were plans for the ATF to hire 140 special agents and another 160 Industry Operations Investigators. That’s more inspectors to revoke licenses than special agents to actually lock up criminals. The Biden administration refuses to get tough on crime but is zealous in targeting the firearm industry.

Thomas Brandon, former ATF acting director, told USA Today that the goal of inspections is to get dealers compliant, not to penalize them. “The high majority of FFLs are good hardworking people running businesses, and they’re our front-line of defense for intelligence for diversion of firearms with straw purchases,” Brandon said, referring to when someone attempts to purchase a firearm for someone else who can’t.

The firearm industry absolutely wants firearm retailers that flout the law to be held accountable, but addressing the rare instances of criminal activity at the gun counter neglects the larger problem of criminal misuse of firearms. Indeed, that policy of targeting “rogue gun dealers” could have unintended consequences.

Unintended Consequences

Firearm retailers willingly cooperate with ATF special agents on suspect attempts to purchase firearms. They are often the ones providing tips to special agents on suspected straw purchases. Now, those same retailers are forced to consider the consequences of inviting ATF into their retail locations. When a potential tip to criminal activity by a random person wandering into their store could result in a business owner losing a license and income, that threatens the ability of the ATF to enforce the law.

That’s got special agents in the field concerned. Agents in ATF field offices who chose to remain anonymous have told NSSF the “zero tolerance” policy will do more harm than good. It will dry up their most valuable source of intelligence on criminal activity — the local gun store owner who wants criminals to be locked up.

Now, owners are forced to consider the unintended consequences of trying to do the right thing. Tips of suspect activity could lead to an inspection and a misplaced entry in a record book could put that gun store owner out of business.

There’s little reason to believe the policies will be reversed. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee questioned President Biden’s nominee to become ATF director, Steve Dettelbach, in a confirmation hearing last week. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) confronted Dettelbach about the “zero tolerance” policy and the Biden administration’s policy of rooting out “rogue dealers.” Dettelbach demurred on defining a “rogue dealer,” adding only that federal firearm license revocations should be reserved for “willful violations” and not “inadvertent errors.”

“The key to enforcement programs, it has to be fair, it has to be consistent, and it has to be effective,” Dettelbach told Sen. Grassley. The Biden administration’s “zero tolerance” policy to decimate firearm retailers is proving to be counterproductive.

Debunking Biden’s Tired Gun Rhetoric And Lies,"I’m not going to lie, it’s tedious constantly pointing out the same dishonest contentions of the anti-gun left. The nation would probably take Joe Biden’s gun demagoguery more seriously if the president and his staff occasionally cooked up some new material. Because last night’s plea for more gun control was a rehashing of the same archaic policy ideas, bad analogies, and lies that Democrats tend to drop after every shooting.

The Second Amendment Isn’t ‘Absolute’

The president, as he almost always does, began with this strawman. The Second Amendment, Biden claimed, “like all other rights, is not absolute.” (All? Fans of the 13th Amendment might find this a bit surprising.) There are, of course, already tens of thousands of laws governing individual gun ownership in the United States. More laws and regulations exist restricting the Second Amendment than any other right in the Constitution, and it’s not particularly close. “Voting rights” advocates treat photo ID laws as if they were tantamount to fascism. Well, practicing your right to self-defense is contingent on an FBI background check.

Indeed, the notion that gun ownership is “absolute” would not mesh with the experiences of those living in a blue city like Baltimore, (58.27 homicides per 100,000), Washington D.C. (23.52), or Chicago (18.26), where, despite the Heller and McDonald decisions further codifying the individual right to own firearms, legally purchasing a handgun remains unconstitutionally challenging.

Banning Assault Weapons

Biden quoted Justice Scalia’s majority opinion in Heller, saying, “It was Justice Scalia who wrote, and I quote: ‘Like most rights, the right Second Amendment — the rights granted by the Second Amendment are not unlimited.’ Not unlimited. It never has been.” (Thankfully, he spared us his historically illiterate diatribes on cannons, “deer in Kevlar,” and “yelling fire in a crowded theater.”)

Democrats habitually isolate this line from Heller, a decision they simultaneously contend catastrophically concocted an individual right to firearm ownership. But Scalia’s line, read in context of the decision’s finding that the Second Amendment protects a right to possess a firearm unconnected from militia service, only upholds the legality of states limiting “dangerous and unusual weapons,” not weapons “in common use” by “law-abiding citizens.” The AR-15, and similar rifles, easily meet the latter criteria. It is not only the most popular rifle in the nation, it is one of the types of firearms least used in criminality. Which is why Democrats try to convince the public that AR-15s are “weapons of war,” and thus exceptionally “dangerous and unusual.” This is simply wrong. AR-15s are less a weapon of war than a 9mm handgun (which, earlier this week, the president suggested should be banned, as well).

Moreover, Heller found prohibition on an entire class of “arms” Americans “overwhelmingly choose” to be unconstitutional. So, the notion that Scalia would support outlawing semi-automatic rifles — whose mechanisms are virtually the same as most firearms — is risible. In fact, I’m not sure that existing “assault weapons” bans wouldn’t be (rightfully) stuck down if they were challenged before the Supreme Court.

Biden also made the debatable claim that in the decade the “assault weapon” ban was in force, mass shootings went down. “But after Republicans let the law expire in 2004, and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled,” Biden said. “Those are the facts.” You won’t be surprised to learn that they’re not.

Unmentioned by Biden is the fact that after the “assault weapon ban” sunset in 2004, gun crimes kept precipitously dropping. In the 15 years immediately following the sunsetting, overall homicides fell 10 out of 15 years. Twenty-one years after gun violence peaked in 1993, and a decade after the assault weapon ban ended, homicides by firearms hit the lowest point since 1976. By that time, the AR-15 had become the most popular rifle in the country. (A 1999 Justice Department study also found that the ban failed “to reduce the average number of victims per gun murder incident or multiple gunshot wound victims.”)

And, though Republicans may have let the law expire in 2004, as John McCormack has pointed out, Harry Reid didn’t bring an assault weapon ban to the floor of the Senate until 2013, after the Newtown massacre. At the time, Democrats controlled the Senate, and 16 of their senators voted against the bill, including Michael Bennet, Joe Manchin, and Jon Tester. Do the Democrats even have 50 votes for a ban?

Raising the Age to Purchase an AR-15 from 18 to 21

This is less about mendaciousness than it is about contemporary liberalism being a giant game of Calvinball. Numerous high-profile Democrats support the idea of allowing 16-year-olds to participate in the most vital, sacred, indispensable rite of democracy: voting. Then again, when it comes to government-mandated health care insurance, they believe that Americans should be treated like children until they’re 26-year-olds. But they also seem perfectly fine with 18-year-olds joining the Armed Forces — but not with the same men and women buying a drink or practicing the right to self-defense.

In the real world, maturity differs from person to person, from place to place. The average age of the mass shooter, after all, is 33. But if we’re going to come up with an arbitrary year that marks the beginning of adulthood, it should remain consistent. If you’re ready to vote you’re ready to practice all your rights. Of course, the notion that the founders would have been shocked by an 18-year-old carrying a firearm — a claim I get a lot — is also nonsense. The “teenager” is a 20th-century invention. In the 19th century, you were a child and then you were an adult. And adulthood began early.

(Biden’s contention that firearms “are the number one killer of children in the United States of America … more than car accidents, more than cancer,” is, as Brad Polumbo notes, also quite misleading.)

Repealing Gun Manufacturers’ Immunity from Liability

Gun manufacturers, says the president, “are the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity.” This is a perniciously stupid lie. Gun manufacturers do not hold any special protections. If a firearm malfunctions due to shoddy design or subpar production, or if gun maker misleads consumers, they, like every other manufacturer in the nation, can be sued. If guns work correctly but are used in illegal acts, they, like every other industry, can’t. In the same way, an SUV maker isn’t liable when a killer intentionally plows into a crowd of people killing six people, and neither is a manufacturer when someone uses a baseball bat and a knife to murder three of his coworkers.

Biden went on to say, “Imagine. Imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued, where we’d be today. The gun industry’s special protections are outrageous. It must end.” It’s revealing that Biden, who claims to respect “the culture and the tradition and the concerns of lawful gun owners,” compares cigarettes to a constitutionally protected right. One of these two products could be banned tomorrow if politicians so desired. The other — I’m sorry, Joe — can’t.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/03/debunking-bidens-tired-gun-rhetoric-and-lies/,2022-06-03
"If Joe Biden Cared About Gun Laws, Hunter Would Already Be In Jail","President Joe Biden is on a full-blown crusade to regulate or repeal the Second Amendment out of existence. While Democrats are often not honest about their intentions, this has always been their true agenda. Biden’s son, Hunter, who appeared to purchase a gun illegally in 2018, could be among those hardest hit.

On Thursday night, the president went on a nearly 20-minute tirade on the need to ban “assault weapons,” whatever that means.

“Why in God’s name should an ordinary citizen be able to purchase an assault weapon that holds 30-round magazines that let mass shooters fire hundreds of bullets in a matter of minutes,” Biden said, ranting on the graves of the 19 children and their two teachers gunned down by a madman in Uvalde, Texas last week.

“We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,” demanded the president. “And if we can’t ban assault weapons, then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21. Strengthen the background checks, enact safe storage laws and ‘red flag’ laws. Repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers from liability.”

For starters, suing gun manufacturers for the way their firearms are used is akin to suing the Ford Motor Company because a black suspect motivated by anti-white racism allegedly plowed through a Wisconsin Christmas parade, brutally killing at least six with Ford Escape SUV. In stark contrast to his immediate visits to Buffalo and Uvalde following mass tragedies, Biden made no trip to console the families of Waukesha, Wisconsin, nor did he demand Congress take on the car lobby.

Biden summarized his demands in a tweet calling on lawmakers to pass new gun bans and repeal immunity laws for firearm manufacturers that don’t exist.

An easy giveaway that Democrats aren’t ever actually serious about solving the underlying issues whenever tragedy strikes with firearm, Federalist Senior Editor David Harsanyi points out, are that the laws they routinely propose never would have prevented the carnage in the first place.

Details aside, President Biden doesn’t have room to speak on gun control until his son faces, at minimum, a substantive criminal investigation into his answers on a background check when purchasing a firearm in 2018.

When asked by the Firearms Transaction Record (Form 4473) whether he is an “unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance,” Hunter Biden answered, “no.”

While it’s unclear whether Hunter was an active user at the time, it’s far from inconceivable following repeated rehab visits in 2003, 2010, and 2014 for treatment with highly addictive substances. In 2014, Hunter was discharged from the Navy for cocaine use, and according to the New Yorker, went on another cocaine binge in 2016.

Three years later, the president’s son abandoned his laptop at a Delaware repair shop. It possessed graphic footage of the first son appearing to smoke crack cocaine during sexual encounters. In 2018, the same year Hunter purchased the revolver apparently found abandoned in the garbage by Secret Service, the younger Biden was suspected of smoking crack in a D.C. strip club.

Lying on a Form 4473 to purchase a firearm is a felony offense that can carry up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Dems Attack 'Gun Lobby' Because Calling Gun Owners 'Terrorists' Won't Win Elections,"One of the most transparent acts of cowardice in American politics is promising to “stand up to the NRA” and “gun lobby.” The “gun lobby” played a prominent role in Joe Biden’s mendacious gun-control speech last week, wherein the president continued to mythologize the power of the NRA, while depicting tens of millions of gun owners as dupes.

Bloomberg says “NRA Keeps Its Hold on US Politics, Despite School Shootings and Internal Strife.” The BBC wonders: “US gun control: What is the NRA and why is it so powerful?” In a Hill piece — laughably headlined, “NRA contributions underscore grip in GOP” — we learn that the Second Amendment advocacy group contributed “roughly $149,000 to Senate recipients in the 2020 cycle, with nearly all the funds going to Republicans, according to OpenSecrets.”

Let’s for a moment set aside the fact that anti-gun rhetoric used in major media and cultural outlets amounts to tens of billions of in-kind contributions to Democrats every year. From the years 2017-2022, Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer received $3,754,646 from investment firms and another $3,038,489 from law firms. Where are the articles about the “iron grip” lawyers and hedge funds have over the majority leader and his party? The “gun lobby” hardly even makes a blip on Mitch McConnell’s fundraising portfolio. McConnell’s political support for gun rights is probably predicated on the fact that nearly 55 percent of adults in his state reside in a household with a firearm. (And because gun owners aren’t exactly sharers, you should assume that number is higher.)

In 2016, the NRA, which some Democrats have branded a “domestic terrorist organization,” spent $54.4 million on outside spending. That fell to only $29.3 million during the 2020 election. Gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety spent $60 million in the 2020 election. To put that in perspective, $14 billion dollars was dropped on the 2020 election, spending dominated by the Democratic Party. To put it in context, from 2021-2022 George Soros has contributed $128,722,563 to left-wing political causes.

In 2021-2022, the finance sector, leading spenders on elections, gave 52.5 percent of its contributions to Democrats. Lawyers, 70 percent. The tech industry, over 76 percent. The health care sector, 59. Labor, 87.5 percent. Most of these industries spend many times more yearly than the gun lobby spends in a decade. Do these industries, most of whom deal with policy that is more consequential to everyday Americans, not have an “iron grip” on the Democratic Party?

The NRA’s lobbying efforts in 2020 amounted to $2.2 million. To put it in perspective, The National Association of Realtors spent $84 million that year. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent nearly $82 million. Facebook, nearly $20 million. Amazon, nearly $18 million. The NRA is the 1,043rd largest contributor to political races and the 270th biggest spender on lobbying in 2020. Unlike most of these industries, the NRA’s funding comes from small donors.

Because of mismanagement and internal conflict, NRA contributions to political candidates have cratered in recent years:

Has anyone detected a corresponding drop in support for gun rights in Congress?

The NRA is an expedient punching bag for politicians and activists unwilling to condemn gun owners themselves. But its power is derived from its members, not cooked up from the ether or propped up by a sugar daddy. (Of course, even if NRA had its own George Soros, its cause, lobbying to defend the Second Amendment, would be worthwhile.)

The NRA, which runs an array of programs to cultivate responsible gun owners (it does more for gun safety, in fact, than any anti-gun advocacy group), is only influential because it represents — either through direct membership or through ideological kinship — a lot of American voters. If the NRA disappeared tomorrow, another advocacy group would simply emerge to take its place, and it would probably be more purist in its defense of the Second Amendment.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/06/democrats-go-after-the-gun-lobby-because-calling-gun-owners-terrorists-wont-win-elections/,2022-06-06
It's Past Time To Get A Gun And Prepare For Self-Defense,"Democrats’ rhetoric on guns doesn’t match reality. The “common sense gun control” policies they say they want would just tinker around the edges of the problem of gun violence in general, and not stop mass shootings in particular. Even giving a generous benefit of the doubt to proposals such as an “assault weapons ban” and “closing the gun show loophole,” they would at best marginally reduce the number of mass shootings and their casualties.

For all of their rhetorical Sturm und Drang, such as accusations that Republicans have children’s blood on their hands, Democrats’ proposals would do little to nothing to stop, or even slow down, most mass murderers. Thus, unless they are stupid or faking their moral outrage, the left’s actual gun control agenda is much more radical than they usually claim.

They will use whatever outrage they can gin up to take what they can get now, then push for more. They are not, of course, the only political movement to employ this sort of incremental approach, but they are especially dishonest about it.

Charles Blow of the New York Times recently took the gun control movement to task for this duplicity, along the way admitting what we all know, which is that Democrat efforts to sound moderate on guns are lies. He acknowledges that what they (and he) want is “a nonstop parade of laws, with new ones passed as they are deemed necessary, ad infinitum.”

So yes, they’re coming for your guns. Fortunately, they will likely fail because Americans know we cannot trust the left to protect our families and communities.

Democrats Encouraged Every Policy That Corrupted Our Culture

Gun control is all about displacement. It seeks to scapegoat rural conservatives for the violence that is overwhelmingly a problem of Democratic-supporting urban areas. As Kevin Williamson recently observed:

The gun-control debate is first and foremost a culture-war issue for Democrats. There is a great deal of violent crime in the United States, and that crime is concentrated in big cities over which Democrats enjoy an effective monopoly of political power. The people who commit most of the murders in the United States — and the people who most often die in those murders — check a lot of Democratic-voter demographic boxes.

Gun control is also about blaming the disorder, violence, and nihilism of American life on guns, rather than on a corrupt culture. Having encouraged almost every policy and cultural change that has made America less virtuous and more violent, the left has no idea how to make America peaceful, other than piling more restrictions on guns. Violent crime thrives in Democratic-run cities, and the seeds of nihilistic terrorism perpetrated by mass shooters are most commonly cultivated in the soil of family and social decay.

It is the left that is letting violent criminals out on low, or no, bail. It is the left that excused and even cheered the riots of 2020. It is the left that refuses to secure our borders as lethal rivers of drugs flow into our communities. It is the left that rejoices in the destruction of the traditional family, even as family breakdown leads to more children being poor and abused, and as fatherless boys turn to crime.

It is the left that has torn down the moral wisdom of the ages, and is now trying to build a new morality out of half-baked race and gender theories rooted in third-hand Marxism. It is the left that is more interested in teaching children about gender than geometry.

Vote GOP and Get a Gun

The obvious political response to this deliberate cultural and social destruction is to vote Republican, warts and all. Parents and working families of all races are indeed fleeing the Democratic Party, which has been captured by leftist ideologues.

The next practical personal response to rising crime and cultural disintegration is to prepare to protect yourself, your family, and your community. The 2020 riots sold a lot of guns to normal people who realized their government might not protect them. And many gun owners decided to become dedicated to training for the same reason.

The obvious step after that is to organize. It is possible, even likely, that we are going to see continued increases in both general crime and targeted political violence. Democrats have shown themselves unwilling or unable to restrain crime in general, and the 2020 carnage showed that Democratic leaders will permit rioting left-wing paramilitary groups to destroy neighborhoods and rule cities at night. One need only compare the aggressive prosecutions of those involved in the Capitol riot to the lenient catch-and-release treatment of Antifa thugs to see how the left uses the power of the state to punish its enemies and reward its friends.

Furthermore, the response to the impending Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision has shown that Democrats are happy to sic mobs on their enemies, from Supreme Court justices to churches to crisis pregnancy centers. In response, conservatives should talk with friends and neighbors they can trust about how they might protect each other. Churches, I am sorry to have to say, need to step up their security plans. So do schools, crisis pregnancy centers, and other Christian ministries.

The more the left allows and encourages crime and social disintegration, the more the rest of us must prepare to defend ourselves, our families, and our communities.

The Fatal Flaw In Matthew McConaughey's 'Common Sense' Gun Plan,"Actor Matthew McConaughey visited Washington, D.C., this week to push for what he termed “reasonable, practical, tactical regulations” on gun rights, such as background checks, red-flag laws, and higher age limits.

“We’ve got a chance right now to reach for and to grasp a higher ground above our political affiliations,” he said, and “a chance to make a choice that does more than protect your party, a chance to make a choice that protects our country now and for the next generation.”

Corporate media and other activists praised his call for what they described as “common sense” restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms. But even if people think the solution to the moral rot plaguing the country is to restrict gun rights, there is one very big reason why this plan is not “common sense” at all and why Republicans in Congress would not be able to support it.

Many Americans have a principled objection to restricting gun rights because they are the guard against tyranny that preserves American freedoms. But even for those who don’t hold principled objections to gun-right restrictions, to voluntarily hand over the right and the security it provides American families would require a profound trust in their government that has been obliterated in recent years through widespread corruption.

The biggest problem facing the country right now is a two-tiered justice system, in which friends of the regime are protected and allowed to commit crimes with impunity, and political opponents of the regime face life imprisonment for lesser crimes.

Who would administer, for example, the background checks and red flag laws that “common sense” gun restricters propose? Would it be the same government that fabricated evidence in a FISA Court proceeding to secure a wiretap to spy on Carter Page for the crime of supporting a politician the FBI opposed?

Would it be the same FBI that hatched a plot to kidnap the Michigan governor, with that truth only coming out during the prosecution of four of the Americans entrapped in the scheme?

Would it be the same government that besieged and burned down a building full of women and children in 1993 in Waco, Texas? Would it be the same government that told the world that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that was why we needed to start a lengthy war there?

Would it be the same local, state, and federal officials who allowed Antifa and Black Lives Matter activists to destroy countless homes and businesses in dozens of cities, set White House buildings on fire, attack federal courthouses, burn police precincts to the ground, destroy historical markers, and commit other destruction under the guise of “mostly peaceful” protesting?

And which police organizations and officials would be involved in these “common sense” gun restrictions? Would it be men such as Derek Chauvin, convicted of murdering George Floyd?

Would it be the same police department in Uvalde, Texas, that stood by while children were being murdered and, instead of stopping it, prevented parents from rescuing children?

It would be nuts to hand the power to restrict gun rights to institutions that have deliberately destroyed the rule of law in this country. What sane Republican would vote to empower the worst institutions in the country with further means to protect political allies and destroy political opponents?

Rather than being “common sense” restrictions on gun rights, when thinking through which officials would be administering them, it is clear they are extreme.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/07/matthew-mcconaughey-wont-win-texas-gun-owners-by-pushing-bidens-asinine-gun-lies/,2022-06-08
'Top Gun: Maverick' Proves Hollywood Can Succeed Without China,"Since released on the Memorial Day weekend, Tom Cruise’s “Top Gun: Maverick” has soared at the box office like an F-18 fighter jet. The movie reportedly earned $300 million in North America and more than $550 million globally so far, despite not being released in Russia or China. The film’s financial success shows Hollywood can succeed without kowtowing to authoritarian regimes.

“Top Gun: Maverick” ran into controversies early in its production. Tencent Holding, a Chinese tech giant, signed on to be one of the film’s financial backers. The 1986 “Top Gun” film was immensely popular in China in the early 1990s. Executives at Paramount reportedly had hoped that with Tencent’s money and involvement in marketing, the sequel would make at least $80 million at the box office in China, the world’s largest movie market.

Driven by the pursuit of profit, Hollywood has a long history of capitulation to Chinese censors. For instance, Marvel Studios changed a character from a Tibetan to a Celtic one in “Dr. Strange” (2016) to win over Chinese censors. Disney reportedly shared the script of the live production of “Mulan” (2020) with Chinese authorities “to avoid controversy and guarantee a China release.”

After Paramount released an early trailer of “Top Gun: Maverick” in summer 2019, people quickly pointed out that the image of Japanese and Taiwanese flags that decorated Maverick’s iconic bomber jacket in the 1986 film was replaced with undefined symbols with similar colors in the sequel.

Many saw the change as another example of Hollywood’s appeasement of Chinese censors because China regards Japan as a strategic rival. On Taiwan, Beijing has long insisted that the self-governed island is a province of China and has stepped up pressure campaigns to compel foreign governments and businesses not to categorize Taiwan under their list of countries but only as Chinese territory.

Paramount probably hoped that removing Japanese and Taiwanese flags from the bomber jacket in “Top Gun: Maverick” would keep Tencent happy and ensure the Chinese authorities approved the film. But Tencent withdrew its financial support by the end of 2019, citing concerns that “Communist Party officials in Beijing would be angry about the company’s affiliation with a movie celebrating the American military.”

Meanwhile, Paramount’s capitulation to Beijing faced backlash in the states. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, asked in a tweet, “What does it say to the world when Maverick is scared of Chinese communists?” He introduced legislation that would “prohibit the U.S. government from providing technical or other types of support across agencies on movie projects if a studio anticipates a request or get one by the Chinese government to make edits on a movie.”

A few months later, then-Attorney General William Barr criticized Hollywood for “regularly censoring its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world’s most powerful violator of human rights” and giving the Communist Party “a massive propaganda coup.”

Pen America, an organization dedicated to defending free speech, issued a damning report titled, “Made in Hollywood, Censored by China.” It blasted Hollywood for “making difficult and troubling compromises on free expression” and “appeasing Chinese government investors and gatekeepers has simply become a way of doing business.” One of the examples Pen America cited was the flag swap shown in the early trailer of “Top Gun: Maverick.”

This criticism and the withdrawal of Chinese money in Hollywood might have achieved some desired effect. Early this year, Sony/Marvel reportedly rejected Chinese censors’ demand to remove the Statue of Liberty from the film, “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” The Chinese authorities prompted banning the movie from releasing in China, but the movie became a smashing hit anyway. It earned $1.9 billion worldwide, making it the sixth highest-grossing movie of all time.

“Spiderman’s” financial success seemed to have strengthened Hollywood’s backbone. I went to see “Top Gun: Maverick” last weekend. When Cruise put his iconic bomber jacket on, I was happily surprised to see the Japanese and Taiwanese flags on his back. Chinese censors certainly don’t like it, but who cares. A movie about the prowess of the U.S. military shouldn’t have to bend its knee to Beijing to begin with.

I found “Top Gun: Maverick” enjoyable for several reasons. The ageless Cruise was as charming as ever — the aviator sunglasses, the jacket, the bike, and the smile were irresistible. The shirtless beach sports scenes paid homage to the beach volleyball sequences in the ’86 film. No one seemed to mind “toxic masculinity” when seeing washboard abs and muscles on display.

Of course, the aviation fighting sequences were mind-blowing, and they were made for the big screen. You have to watch the movie in a theater to really enjoy it. After last year’s disastrous and humiliating Afghan withdrawal, Americans have been hungry for some military success, even if a fictional one. Like the first film, “Top Gun: Maverick” is unabashedly pro-America. It showcases our military at their best and is a huge morale booster. I hope “Top Gun: Maverick” will aid military recruitment, as the ’86 film did.

I also like the fact that “Top Gun: Maverick” is free of wokism and political correctness, which is too common in today’s entertainment industry. Americans want to be entertained, not lectured by overly privileged people about everything wrong with America.

The Top Gun pilots for the challenging mission were a racially diverse group, but they didn’t get there by demanding affirmative action to compensate for historical oppressions. Instead, they had to prove they were the “best of the best” through rigorous training, competition, and relentless testing by their instructor, Maverick.

“Top Gun: Maverick” has proved that as long as Hollywood focuses on telling a good story in the most entertaining way, it can succeed financially without capitulating to China. Hopefully, more studio executives will take this lesson to heart.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/08/heres-the-fatal-flaw-in-matthew-mcconaugheys-common-sense-gun-plan/,2022-06-10
There Are Many Potential Problems With The Bipartisan Gun Deal,"Writing on the potential bipartisan gun control law, the level-headed Josh Kraushaar argues the “best way to protect democracy would be for the party in power to seek compromise at the expense of ideological prerogatives” and that leading gun control advocate Chris Murphy was “setting a powerful example of that kind of leadership.”

I’m confused as to how assuming zero political risk by taking what you can from Republicans, while offering nothing in return, is a heroic compromise of ideological prerogatives? It is unlikely that a single liberal voter is going to turn on Murphy for convincing 10 Republican senators to concede that guns, rather than underlying cultural and societal forces, are driving mass shootings.

It’s not as if Murphy agreed to negotiate for concealed carry reciprocity or the funding programs that train teachers to defend themselves and their students — ideas that lead Republican negotiator Sen. John Cornyn allegedly supports. He gave up nothing. Murphy is already re-tweeting The New York Times’ claim that Democrats got more than they had “hoped for.” The bipartisan deal, says The Washington Post, is just a “first step.” In a day or two, if that, liberals will be back to accusing legal gun owners of being abettors of terrorism and child murder.

How bad is the deal? We won’t really know until we see the specifics of the legislation.

According to Murphy — who not ago long was telling reporters, “[s]pare me the bullsh-t about mental illness” — there will be “billions in new funding for mental health and school safety,” including money for “community mental health clinics.” I’m skeptical that more spending is any kind of remedy for mass shootings, but there’s no downside with bringing more focus on mental health concerns. In virtually every recent shooting, from Parkland to Uvalde, the murderer exhibited violent antisocial behavior that was crying out for intervention. Certainly, enhancing programs to spot these troubled kids doesn’t intrude on the Second Amendment. Presumably this is a component everyone wants.

After that it gets more complicated.

“Red flag laws” — perhaps the only measure within the senators’ framework that could, conceivably, stop mass shootings — are beyond the federal government’s scope. So, 10 Republican senators have agreed to bribe states into participating in passing emergency risk-protection legislation that allows courts to take guns from those deemed a threat to themselves or others.

When carefully written, red flag laws may have merit, but prudence is rare. In states like California, Connecticut, and Maryland, authorities can confiscate weapons merely on the strength of an uncorroborated allegation by family members, coworkers, law enforcement officers, or others without any kind of genuine due process. Will Senate Republicans guarantee that funding for state laws is contingent on laws that have protections for basic due process rights, penalties for bringing frivolous or false charges against gun owners, and assurances that those who receive the proper mental health treatment get their weapons returned, because in many places a “temporary” petition means a lifetime ban? Seems unlikely.

Not that long ago, Democrats wanted to pass a bill that would have stripped anyone on terror watch and no-fly lists — some 40 percent of whom have nothing even tangentially to do with terrorism — of both their Fifth and Second Amendment rights. Republicans have no reason to trust their devotion to due process.

The Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban, an amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968, already prohibits anyone convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor, or anyone under a restraining order, from possessing a firearm. The definition of a partner is somewhat opaque. If the new law merely includes boyfriends under the law, that’s great. In the past, however, Democrats have not only tried to expand the definition of partner, but also the reasons for losing your gun rights to include many types of non-violent misdemeanors. Not so great.

It is also somewhat unclear whether the bipartisan deal is aimed at those convicted of a crime, rather than merely accused of it. Murphy says “convicted” but the Times’ news story says the law will harder for those “accused” of domestic violence to obtain guns — obviously, an important distinction.

Straw purchases, buying a gun legally on behalf of a person who can’t, and gun trafficking are both already illegal. The Feds prosecute people on both counts every single day. Democrats, unable to pass “universal” background checks, have been looking to make it so prohibitively difficult for individuals, non-dealers, to sell or gift a gun that they abandon the practice altogether. This would be a good means of achieving that goal.

The framework released by senators also promises enhanced background checks for those under 21. It’s unclear how that would have stopped any mass shooting. Most of these murderers have no record. Do we think they won’t just wait a few more days? Senators also promise to “crack[] down on criminals who illegally evade licensing requirements.” What does that even mean? It’s already illegal. Will the law say that it’s super-duper illegal, or will there be new regulations that make it easier for the federal government to target dealers and revoke Federal Firearms Licenses over innocent paperwork errors?

We don’t know yet. What we do know is that Democrats will push the law as far as possible, because for them this is all part of a long, incrementalist play.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/10/top-gun-maverick-proves-hollywood-can-succeed-without-kowtowing-to-china/,2022-06-13
"McConnell, GOPers Attacking The 2nd Amendment Can't Be In Leadership","The corporate media is abuzz with news that senators have reached a “bipartisan” gun deal that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed on Tuesday — but sacrificing Americans’ constitutional rights to hoaxing Democrats who have and will use their power to target their political enemies is nothing for Republicans to be proud of. It’s the type of ideological surrender that they should lose their jobs and leadership positions over.

The bill text is still not available but from what Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy’s Twitter feed and the official framework indicate, the legislation could include sweeping measures such as problematic red flag laws that overstep too many constitutional bounds for Republicans to comfortably sacrifice.

Despite concerns that the legislation could compromise Americans’ Second, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, McConnell and 10 of his squishiest GOP colleagues including Sens. John Cornyn of Texas, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Rob Portman of Ohio, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Mitt Romney of Utah, Bill Cassidy of Lousiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania plan to join the Democrats’ anti-gun escapades. Together, they caved to the emotional blackmail wielded by Murphy and amplified by the corporate media.

Republicans have no good reason to trust Democrats to skilfully create legislation that is mindful of Americans’ rights. Nor do GOPers have reasons to support legislation that yields little evidence of actually deterring criminals from committing crimes that are already illegal.

After all, the leftist legislators supporting the gun deal are the same politicians who supported spying on a president, falsely accused a Supreme Court nominee-turned-justice of rape, defended the Biden administration when it sicced the feds on parents who wanted a say in what happens in their child’s classrooms, and so much more.

In the past, when Democrats have been given inch-sized opportunities to restrict gun rights, they’ve sought to take miles and ban certain guns and gun parts altogether.

As my colleague Federalist Senior Editor David Harsanyi recently noted, historically, “Democrats have not only tried to expand the definition of partner” in domestic violence-motivated gun grabs but have also tried to broaden “the reasons for losing your gun rights to include many types of non-violent misdemeanors.”

Yet, some of the most powerful GOPers in Congress, even those who have sworn to protect the Second Amendment, are salivating to sign dangerously broad and likely deliberately unspecific legislation crafted by these same Democrats.

Congressional Democrats like Murphy and their allies in corporate media have already admitted that the gun deal includes “considerably more than [Democrats] hoped for initially.”

That’s because the Republicans involved in negotiations pressured for nothing, so they got nothing.

McConnell’s gun restriction lead negotiator Cornyn likes to brag about his A+ rating from the National Rifle Association but the Republican’s former promises not to restrict Americans’ rights to guns have been repeatedly broken and will be violated if this new bill passes. Even Cornyn’s meaningless boasting about everything excluded from the Democrats’ bill signals there’s nothing that was included that he found worthy of praising.

So not only have Republicans signed onto more gun restrictions but they’ve also ceded constitutional ground to Democrats who have a history of abusing their self-assigned power to gatekeep who can access a firearm.

Yielding power to Democrats like Murphy who exploited the Texas tragedy to orchestrate a gun grab is nothing for McConnell or any Republicans to be proud of. As a matter of fact, that’s something worth forcing them out of office over.

The people most at risk of losing in this “bipartisan” deal are Republicans who will never get the benefit of a winning compromise with Democrats and law-abiding citizens who under the Consitution have every right to own and use guns. Most congressional Republicans have sworn to protect these rights but right now, 10 of the ones closest to McConnell are not.

These Republicans were chosen carefully because most of them are not at risk of getting voted out of office soon, but the dozens of other Senate GOPers who see the problems with handing over control of Americans’ rights should do everything they can to bar them from leadership. If Republicans were willing to cave on the Second Amendment, how much emotional manipulation will it take for them to surrender on other key conservative issues?

White House Aims To Shut Down Major Ammunition Plant In Missouri,"While Democrats claim to engage in talks on bipartisan gun legislation in good faith, the White House is aiming behind the scenes to shut down nationwide ammunition sales.

In northwestern Missouri, a major government-owned ammunition plant is now facing closure as the Biden administration escalates its war on American gun owners, The Federalist has learned.

The Lake City ammunition factory is one of the largest manufacturers of M855/SS109 ammo which is the most popular caliber for the most targeted firearm in the country: the AR-15. In operation since 1941 to produce ammunition for the U.S. Army, the government contracts with the private firm Winchester to run the enterprise and sell any excess supplies on the open market. The plant also produces XM855 and XM193 ammunition.

Mark Oliva, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), told The Federalist “Winchester was informed that the government is considering restricting the manufacturing and commercial sale of legal ammunition produced at the Lake City, Mo., facility.”

Such restrictions, Oliva said, would place 400 to 500 jobs in immediate jeopardy, reduce available ammunition in the market, and sever the nation’s wartime readiness.

“This policy to deny the sale of excess ammunition not only would freeze over 30 percent of the 5.56mm/.223 caliber ammunition used by law-abiding gun owners,” Oliva said, “it risks the ammunition industry’s ability to surge production capacity for national defense if the costs to maintain the present workforce isn’t recouped through sales to the civilian market.”

The White House did not respond to The Federalist’s request for comment.

In 2015, the Obama/Biden administration sought to prohibit sales of M855/SS109, also known as “green tip ammo,” through a backdoor bureaucratic ban with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). The ATF tried to amend the definition of the popular ammo — which is far less lethal than other types of common rifle ammunition on the market — as “armor-piercing” to fit a federal statute warranting restrictions. The ensuing controversy led to the early retirement of ATF Director B. Todd Jones, who became the first ATF chief to step down since the position required Senate confirmation, according to the National Rifle Association.

Behind-the-scenes gun laws are a favorite pattern of President Biden, whose administration has overseen a 500 percent spike in firearm retail licensure revocations over typos.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, a group of bipartisan senators — which included at least 10 Republicans and would pass the threshold to overcome a filibuster — announced an agreement for a framework on new gun legislation promoting “red flag” laws and expanded background checks. Details of the bill remain in flux as senators also pledge more money for school safety and mental health resources. The framework has drawn support from Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Turbulence in negotiations surfaced Thursday, however, when Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who initially endorsed the proposal, walked out on Capitol Hill.

“It’s fish or cut bait,” Cornyn told reporters, according to The Guardian while other senators remained negotiating. “I don’t know what they have in mind, but I’m through talking.”

Cornyn said he had not abandoned talks but for now, is headed back to Texas.

The Biden administration’s plan to take an ax to the nation’s ammo supplies, however, threatens to further undermine efforts in the Senate on a compromise as Democrats reveal their true intentions.

“This policy of ceasing the sale of excess ammunition is ill-timed and jeopardizes the fragile negotiations of the framework deal that was agreed to by the bipartisan group of senators,” Oliva told The Federalist. “Senators specifically requested the White House allow the Senate negotiate in good faith and without interference to arrive at their agreement.”

Days before Democrat lawmakers touted the reform effort’s resources for mental health, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a lead negotiator on the legislation, told reporters to “Spare me the bullsh-t about mental illness.”

As Federalist Senior Editor David Harsanyi points out, however, “in virtually every recent shooting, from Parkland to Uvalde, the murderer exhibited violent antisocial behavior that was crying out for intervention.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/14/mcconnell-his-10-gop-pushovers-and-any-others-who-attack-the-second-amendment-cant-be-in-leadership/,2022-06-17
EXCLUSIVE: Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Rejects Senate Gun Grab,"Republican and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pledged opposition to the Senate’s bipartisan gun grab Wednesday after 14 GOP lawmakers in the upper chamber joined Democrats Tuesday night to usher major gun legislation through Capitol Hill.

The bill, now expected to pass the Senate by the end of the week with a filibuster-proof majority, makes it more difficult for 18- to 21-year-olds to own a firearm and encourages state “red flag” laws enhancing the power of the government to confiscate weapons from American citizens.

“I will oppose the Senate bill because provisions in it would place additional unnecessary impediments and burdens on [a] law-abiding citizen’s right to own a firearm,” McCarthy told The Federalist in an exclusive statement. “We must not have knee-jerk reactions in how the federal government approaches red flag laws, where Congress strong-arms states into passing laws that may violate the Second Amendment and deprive citizens their right to due process.”

“House Republicans support increased resources for school safety and mental health,” McCarthy added. “That’s why we recently supported Rep. Richard Hudson’s STOP II Act on the House Floor, that could help address these deadly shootings. This bill, however, goes beyond those contours.”

While the 80-page “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act” moving through the Senate offers some resources for school safety and public health, the text of the legislation revealed hours before lawmakers voted in a procedural measure to move it forward is littered with ambiguous language taking aim at American gun ownership.

“The bill’s numerous vague, open-ended provisions will almost surely be abused by prosecutors, cops, aggrieved family members, exes, and political opponents,” explained Federalist Senior Editor and gun author David Harsanyi about the “‘Do-Something’ Gun Control Bill.”

“And, in the meantime, the likelihood that any of its provisions will help mitigate mass shootings is very small,” he continued.

Moreover, there is scant evidence that red flag laws do much to prevent violence. Most studies that contend to prove red flag laws work, do so by drilling into the consciousness of those who’ve lost their guns and predicting their behavior. The Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler, certainly no NRA champion, went through every mass shooting since 2015 and came up with only two instances where red flag laws might have potentially stopped a shooter. In one of them, the Parkland massacre, the police had ignored outright threats made by the shooter that would already have allowed them to take away his guns.

The bill’s Republican supporters in the upper chamber, however, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have almost ensured its passage to the Democrat-controlled House by next week. Republicans who voted for one of the largest firearm packages since 1994 are already facing blowback in their own states. Sen. John Cornyn, a lead negotiator on the bill, was booed at the Texas GOP convention last week, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s Alaska primary opponent, Kelly Tshibaka, blasted the incumbent lawmaker over support for the measure on Newsmax.

“This is just more of Lisa Murkowski, pretending she supports the Second Amendment when she comes back to visit Alaska, but when she is with her friends, she’s doing everything she can to betray Alaskans,” Tshibaka said on the conservative network.

The “good-faith” negotiations over the Senate gun bill all happened while the White House was reportedly developing potential plans to choke the nation’s ammo supply with a shutdown of a major manufacturer in northwestern Missouri. The Lake City ammunition plant provides 30 percent of the nation’s 5.56mm ammo now in jeopardy of being cut off by government animosity towards civilian-owned firearms.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/17/white-house-aims-to-shut-down-ammunition-sales-while-dems-claim-to-engage-in-good-faith-gun-talks/,2022-06-22
14 Republicans Just Betrayed Their Base By Advancing Gun Control,"Fourteen Republican senators betrayed their voter base on Tuesday night when they voted to advance a gun control bill that concedes key constitutional ground to Democrats and their gun-grabbing wish list.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, his pick for lead negotiator Sen. John Cornyn, and nine GOPers committed to passing restrictive gun legislation last week. When the “bipartisan” group of senators finally produced the rushed bill’s text, Republican Sens. Joni Ernst, Todd Young, Shelley Moore Capito, and Lisa Murkowski joined the legislation’s authors (except for Sen. Pat Toomey, who was absent) to ram it through the upper chamber and then to the House of Representatives as soon as possible.

At a time when inflation exacerbated by federal spending is at all-time highs, more than a dozen Republican senators voted to proceed with legislation that funnels billions of dollars to states and government agencies, including the FBI, under the guise of stopping future deadly shootings like the one in Uvalde where 19 children and two teachers died after a shooter entered an elementary school through a backdoor and was not stopped by law enforcement until an hour later.

In reality, the bill is littered with vague language about “dating partners” and red flag laws, which allow law enforcement to temporarily confiscate guns from someone the government deems a danger to the public or themselves, which could be easily exploited by partisan bureaucrats.

The senators promoting this bill have provided little evidence that provisions such as “enhancing” background checks on gun buyers under 21 years of age will actually deter criminals from committing crimes that are already illegal yet it’s been hailed by Democrats and their cronies in the corrupt corporate media as the biggest firearm legislation since 1994.

That’s why pro-Second Amendment groups such as the National Rifle Association strongly opposed the legislation as soon as the full text was released.

“This legislation can be abused to restrict lawful gun purchases, infringe upon the rights of law-abiding Americans, and use federal dollars to fund gun control measures being adopted by state and local politicians,” the NRA said in a statement. “This bill leaves too much discretion in the hands of government officials and also contains undefined and overbroad provisions – inviting interference with our constitutional freedoms.”

Polling suggests that a plurality of American voters also believe red flag laws, like those encouraged by bullies in Congress, can and will be abused by the government and could even be used to root out political enemies. Specifically, more than 72 percent of Republican voters oppose red flag laws on the grounds that they could be easily turned against anyone who disagrees with the regime.

Some of those voters with strong convictions against gun restrictions were likely in states such as Kentucky, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maine, Louisiana, Missouri, Utah, Ohio, West Virginia, Iowa, Alaska, and Indiana, many of which are Republican-controlled. But instead of their interests being accurately represented by the politicians sworn to consider their concerns in Washington, thousands of voters’ constitutional rights were handed on a silver platter to Democrats by GOP leadership.

Congressional Democrats like Murphy and their allies in corporate media have already admitted that they received “considerably more than [Democrats] hoped for initially.”

That’s why Cornyn was loudly booed and heckled for the duration of his speech at the Lone Star State’s GOP convention last week. Despite facing significant backlash from his home state, Cornyn showed no remorse for failing to protect Texas constituents’ Second Amendment rights.

Instead, he doubled down and smeared the people who elected him to office as a “mob.”

This lack of remorse from Cornyn and other Republicans is not only shameful but alarming. As I noted in my column on this gun bill last week, “If Republicans were willing to cave on the Second Amendment, how much emotional manipulation will it take for them to surrender on other key conservative issues?”

While a significant portion of the gun control bill is a nothing-burger focused on more inflation-fueling funding and only some gun-grabbing, Republican willingness to support it is an act of betrayal against Americans and the Constitution. It shows that the politicians already in or slated for GOP leadership are willing to give concession after concession to Democrats without regard for the voters who elected them.

The ‘Do Something’ Gun Control Bill Does Little But Erode Rights,"It’s clear that the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act” was written in a rush by politicians far more interested in “doing something” about guns than proposing any well-considered ideas. That’s surely the reason the Senate took a procedural vote only a few hours after releasing the text, and why they’ll probably pass the bill in a few days. It’s going to take years, however, to figure out how it all works. The bill’s numerous vague, open-ended provisions will almost surely be abused by prosecutors, cops, aggrieved family members, exes, and political opponents. And, in the meantime, the likelihood that any of its provisions will help mitigate mass shootings is very small.

That said, no one should fool themselves. Though many conservatives will be furious about the bill, it’s unlikely to be unpopular with most voters. Facing a string of horrific school shootings, voters are uninterested in hearing debates about due process or complaints from some 19-year-old who wants an AR. The media, of course, will frame the bill as a common-sense no-brainer.

“Since the shooting, my office has received tens of thousands of calls, letters, and emails with a singular message: Do something,” John Cornyn, the Republicans’ lead negotiator, said yesterday. “Not do nothing. But do something. I think we’ve found some areas where there is some space for compromise.” Cornyn spent more time bragging about the things he rejected than championing the useful ideas he brought to the bill, because it is almost surely the case that he brought none. This bill exists so that Republicans can say they did something. Not nothing. Something.

What does something look like? No one, presumably, opposes new federal support for enhanced school security or mental health funding (other than perhaps Chris Murphy, who believes “mental health” concerns are “bullsh-t;” maybe that was his compromise?). Another big chunk of the law is filler, reiterating the illegality of trafficking and straw purchases. Gun control advocates often point to the low prosecution rates for those crimes, but that has far more to do with authorities failing to enforce laws that already exist than a lack of them.

On federal red flag law funding, perhaps the most controversial provision, the bill makes a big show of demanding protections for “due process rights” and against “infringement of the Constitution.” It demands there be penalties against “abuse of the program.” All of this is unenforceable, as Republicans know. A number of blue states have already passed red flag laws that nullify gun rights on the word of third-party accusations—sometimes, ex parte—and not only demand the accused prove their innocence before having their rights reinstated but allow for property searches without the usual evidentiary standards. Until the Supreme Court undoes these laws, highly unlikely, states will receive funding. But it’s one thing for California or Rhode Island to do so, and it’s another for national Republicans to fund their efforts.

Moreover, there is scant evidence that red flag laws do much to prevent violence. Most studies that contend to prove red flag laws work, do so by drilling into the consciousness of those who’ve lost their guns and predicting their behavior. The Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler, certainly no NRA champion, went through every mass shooting since 2015 and came up with only two instances where red flag laws might have potentially stopped a shooter. In one of them, the Parkland massacre, the police had ignored outright threats made by the shooter that would already have allowed them to take away his guns.

The bill will also close off the so-called “boyfriend loophole,” so that not only spouses, but anyone convicted of a misdemeanor violent attack who is in “a continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature” between two people can have their guns removed.

Republicans will also be helping Democrats, for the first time in a long time, expand a category of person prohibited from owning guns. Anyone 18 to 21 with a juvenile record, sealed or expunged—though it’s difficult to tell—that includes a felony or misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence or was involuntarily committed after the age of 16 might not be able to purchase a gun. The wait time can be 10 days instead of the usual three. It is unclear to me if this means Americans of any age will be barred from purchasing a gun if they had a juvenile record? The entire section is a mess.

In the end, though, nothing will change in our political environment. Today, the corrupt corporate media and Democrats will herald the law as breaking a “logjam,” the first gun “safety” law in 30 years. This is untrue. Congress has passed numerous gun laws. Thousands of gun laws and regulations exist in the United States. No right has ever been more regulated. And, in a few days, Democrats will return to accusing Republicans of supporting terrorism and abetting child murder. Senators like Murphy will be back to demanding bans on semi-automatic rifles and arguing for backdoor national registries. Within weeks, if not earlier, the media will tell us that the bill was a mere, tiny, first step in bringing the United States in line with other civilized countries. For one side, the “Bipartisan Safer Communities Act” will be a fleeting win, for the other, an incremental step in a crusade to limit national gun ownership.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/22/the-14-republicans-who-voted-to-advance-democrats-gun-control-wish-list-just-betrayed-their-base/,2022-06-22
The Best Lines From SCOTUS Takedown Of NY Gun Licensing Scheme,"The U.S. Supreme Court struck down a restrictive gun-licensing law in New York which required individuals who wanted to obtain a license to carry a firearm outside of the home to prove “proper cause” for doing so.

In a 6 to 3 vote delivered on Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled that New York’s policy, which granted state bureaucrats the authority to approve or reject certain individuals for licenses to carry based on subjective material, is wholly unconstitutional because it tramples on the Second Amendment rights of Americans.

As the court noted in its summary of New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen, “the constitutional right to bear arms in public for self-defense is not ‘a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.’”

Justice Clarence Thomas authored the opinion, which was joined by the five other Republican-nominated justices who expressed their belief that New York’s gun licensing scheme severely hampers Americans’ constitutional rights. Justices Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett also filed concurring opinions.

Here are the best lines from those opinions that will change how the Supreme Court rules on the Second Amendment forever.

The Second Amendment Protects “Ordinary, Law-Abiding” Citizens

As Thomas clearly noted in his opinion, “It is undisputed that petitioners Koch and Nash—two ordinary, law-abiding, adult citizens—are part of ‘the people’ whom the Second Amendment protects.”

Thomas said New York’s attempts to limit the Second Amendment rights of individuals like the men who applied to carry guns outside of their homes but were rejected are clearly unconstitutional because such rights are protected under the scope of the Consitution.

“The Second Amendment’s plain text thus presumptively guarantees petitioners Koch and Nash a right to ‘bear’ arms in public for self-defense,” he wrote.

The Burden Of Proof When It Comes To Constitutional Rights Is On The Government

When New York subjectively rejected two individuals’ attempts to obtain a handgun license, the burden of proof was forced on the citizens who were required to prove they had “proper cause” to carry handguns, as determined by the state.

Not only did Thomas confirm that “No New York statute defines ‘proper cause,’” but he affirmed that the burden of proof when it comes to the constitutional right to bear arms should be on the government, not the citizens those rights are designed to protect.

“When the Second Amendment’s plain text covers an individual’s conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual’s conduct falls outside the Second Amendment’s ‘unqualified command,’” Thomas wrote.

He added that “The Second Amendment ‘is the very product of an interest balancing by the people’ and it ‘surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms’ for self-defense.”

History Doesn’t Support Restrictive, Subjective Licensing

In the majority opinion, Thomas emphasized the importance of historical tradition in determining cases related to firearms.

He noted that 43 states issue various licenses to carry a gun outside of the home based on objective, definable criteria but six states, including New York, California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, have all made their licensing requirements based on subjective criteria determined by the government.

As Thomas noted, “apart from a handful of late 19th-century jurisdictions, the historical record compiled by respondents does not demonstrate a tradition of broadly prohibiting the public carry of commonly used firearms for self-defense.”

“Nor is there any such historical tradition limiting public carry only to those law-abiding citizens who demonstrate a special need for self-defense,” he added.

Not Even English Tradition Says Americans Can’t Carry Handguns For Self-Defense

In this case, the New York government tried to argue using a “substantial reliance on English history and custom before the founding.”

“We find that history ambiguous at best and see little reason to think that the Framers would have thought it applicable in the New World. It is not sufficiently probative to defend New York’s proper-cause requirement,” Thomas wrote.

After a long explanation as to why English laws and customs don’t necessarily apply to American legal standards after its founding, Thomas concluded that not even English historical tradition would justify New York’s “proper cause” licensing requirement.

“At the very least, we cannot conclude from this historical record that, by the time of the founding, English law would have justified restricting the right to publicly bear arms suited for self-defense only to those who demonstrate some special need for self-protection,” he stated.

Gun Control Found Its Roots In Racism

“Even before the Civil War commenced in 1861, this Court indirectly affirmed the importance of the right to keep and bear arms in public,” Thomas wrote.

In a review of “the public discourse surrounding Reconstruction,” Thomas noted that “public carry for self-defense remained a central component of the protection that the Fourteenth Amendment secured for all citizens.”

“After the Civil War, of course, the exercise of this fundamental right by freed slaves was systematically thwarted. This Court has already recounted some of the Southern abuses violating blacks’ right to keep and bear arms,” he wrote.

What Other Constitutional Rights Require Prerequisites?

“We know of no other constitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need,” Thomas wrote. “That is not how the First Amendment works when it comes to unpopular speech or the free exercise of religion. It is not how the Sixth Amendment works when it comes to a defendant’s right to confront the witnesses against him. And it is not how the Second Amendment works when it comes to public carry for self-defense.”

Not only does it infringe on the Second Amendment, but Thomas said New York’s licensing scheme adds hurdles for Americans to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment “in that it prevents law-abiding citizens with ordinary self-defense needs from exercising their right to keep and bear arms.”

Mass Shooting Stats Have Nothing To Do With This Case

In his concurring opinion, Alito slammed dissenting Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor for bringing up irrelevant statistics to try and justify restricting Americans’ consitutional rights.

“Why, for example, does the dissent think it is relevant to recount the mass shootings that have

occurred in recent years?” Alito asked. “Does the dissent think that laws like New York’s prevent or deter such atrocities? Will a person bent on carrying out a mass shooting be stopped if he knows that it is illegal to carry a handgun outside the home?”

Alito also questioned how the dissenting justices “account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo?”

“The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator,” he noted.

Alito asked the same questions of gun suicides, domestic disputes, and other firearm-related statistics.

Good Guys Need Guns For Protection

Alito also noted in his concurring opinion that “The police cannot disarm every person who acquires a gun for use in criminal activity; nor can they provide bodyguard protection for the State’s nearly 20 million residents or the 8.8 million people who live in New York City.”

And since “ordinary citizens frequently use firearms to protect themselves from criminal attack,” they shouldn’t be stopped from carrying a gun for self defense in crime-ridden cities in states such as New York.

“Some of these people reasonably believe that unless they can brandish or, if necessary, use a handgun in the case of attack, they may be murdered, raped, or suffer some other serious injury,” Alito noted. “Today, unfortunately, many Americans have good reason to fear that they will be victimized if they are unable to protect themselves. And today, no less than in 1791, the Second Amendment guarantees their right to do so.”

The Supreme Court’s Gun Decision Is A Huge Win For The Constitution,"In District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court recognized the individual right to gun ownership in the home. In McDonald v. Chicago, it recognized that the right of individual gun ownership extended to states and local municipalities. Today, in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, the court found that “New York’s proper-cause requirement violates the Fourteenth Amendment by preventing law-abiding citizens with ordinary self-defense needs from exercising their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms in public for self-defense.”

Surely no one really believes that “bearing arms” in the Second Amendment was meant to restrict gun ownership to the home. But New York’s gun restrictions demand that a law-abiding citizen beg permission from government officials, and then overcome a slew of subjective and discretionary standards, before being able to exercise a constitutional right. There is no historical or legal support for such restrictions. They are plainly authoritarian.

“We know of no other constitutional rights that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need,” Justice Clarence Thomas noted in the majority opinion. “That is not how the First Amendment works when it comes to unpopular speech or the free exercise of religion. It is not how the Sixth Amendment works when it comes to a defendant’s right to confront the witnesses against him. And it is not how the Second Amendment works when it comes to public carry for self-defense.”

As the court noted, there are still five states with “may issue” gun carry laws that are similar to New York’s—California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. All of them are now likely unconstitutional. And perhaps other gun restrictions will be challenged, as well.

Lower courts use a two-step frame­work when ruling on Second Amendment cases—the first step being the “text, history, and tradition” of gun laws and the Constitution, and the second being the government case for restrictions that relies on data and other concerns. “Despite the popularity of this two-step approach, it is one step too many,” Thomas wrote. If only the text and tradi­tion of the Second Amendment matter, as Supreme Court has now found, the means-end scrutiny that props up so many needless gun restrictions should no longer stand.

The hysterical reaction to NYRPA, now perfunctory for the contemporary left when it doesn’t get its way, merely reaffirms that Democrats make no real distinction between responsible legal gun ownership and criminality or between the Constitution and their capricious political positions.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the ruling “reckless” and “reprehensible,” saying “I’m sorry this dark day has come.” A fearmongering Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said the decision was “not just irresponsible, it is downright dangerous. … This court has made it even easier for potentially dangerous people to carry concealed handguns in public spaces.” Nancy Pelosi claimed it was “unfathomable that, while families in Uvalde, Buffalo and countless other communities mourn their loved ones stolen by gun violence, a supermajority of the Supreme Court has chosen to endanger more American lives.”

President Joe Biden also chimed in:

In the wake of the horrific attacks in Buffalo and Uvalde, as well as the daily acts of gun violence that do not make national headlines, we must do more as a society — not less — to protect our fellow Americans. I remain committed to doing everything in my power to reduce gun violence and make our communities safer. I have already taken more executive actions to reduce gun violence than any other President during their first year in office, and I will continue to do all that I can to protect Americans from gun violence.

The modern left doesn’t even bother pretending they believe the Supreme Court has a responsibility to act as a separate branch of government and adjudicate the constitutionality of law. Rather than even ostensibly offering legal reasons for their ire, Democrats simply demand the Supreme Court uphold public sentiment (or, rather what they claim is public sentiment), even though SCOTUS exists to ignore those pressures. The fact that that attitude has congealed as the norm in one of our major political parties does not bode well for the future of the Republic.

Indeed, one person who is more interested in scoring political points than he is in the Constitution is Justice Breyer, whose dissent in NYRPA is a string of emotional appeals, offering a harangue on mass shootings that are unrelated to the case or carry permits or the Second Amendment.

As Justice Alito notes:

Why, for example, does the dissent think it is relevant to recount the mass shootings that have occurred in recent years? Does the dissent think that laws like New York’s prevent or deter such atrocities? Will a person bent on carrying out a mass shooting be stopped if he knows that it is illegal to carry a handgun outside the home? And how does the dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo? The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.

The New York permit case has absolutely nothing to do with mass shootings. Conceal carry permit holders aren’t mass shooters, they’re one of the most law-abiding groups of citizens in the country—less likely to abuse their guns than the police. There are numerous examples of shootings being stopped by gun owners. The notion that a murderer is going to apply for a license to carry out a killing spree is about as plausible as a murderer adhering to the restrictions of a gun-free zone.

Yet, someone unfamiliar with the case, which I imagine most people still are, might listen to Democrats and media and now be under the impression that every regulation governing concealed carry permits had been wiped out. In 43 states there are still “shall-issue” laws, wherein states grant a permit to anyone who meets the legal requirements, that aren’t affected by the ruling. There is no evidence that “may-issue” states, where officials have discretionary powers, keep anyone safer. There is plenty of evidence, however, that the contemporary left is at war with the Constitution.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/23/the-best-lines-from-the-supreme-courts-takedown-of-new-yorks-unconstitutional-gun-licensing-scheme/,2022-06-23
Why The Senate’s Rushed Gun Bill Will Not Make America Any Safer,"Senators are billing the new Senate gun control legislation as a bipartisan breakthrough that will make Americans safer. “Our legislation will save lives and will not infringe on any law-abiding American’s Second Amendment rights,” claim Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., John Cornyn, R-Texas, Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C. But the bill will do nothing to prevent the mass public shootings, which the senators claim motivated their action, and will likely increase suicides. It is a mess.

The Republican senators caved in the negotiations. Take red flag laws. Republicans such as Cornyn promised to oppose federal funding of state red flag laws “unless their red flag law contains a full set of due process and Bill of Rights protections in the Constitution.” But the Senate bill only requires a hearing in which you have the right to know the opposing evidence and can confront adverse witnesses after your guns are already taken away.

These laws are virtually always used to prevent suicide. Yet when people pose a clear danger to themselves or to others, they should be confined to a mental health facility. If someone is really suicidal, simply taking away his gun won’t solve the problem anyway. There are too many ways for people to kill themselves.

If anything, “red flag” laws harm people who need genuine help. Absent such laws, a person contemplating suicide might speak to a friend or family member and be dissuaded from that tragic course of action. With these laws in place, individuals may fear that confiding in someone will result in a report to the authorities, possibly leading to the loss of their ability to defend themselves or their loved ones. Indeed, my research with Professor Carl Moody at the College of William and Mary found these laws slightly increase suicide rates.

More funding for mental health is fine, but don’t expect it to stop mass public shootings. Over half of those committing mass public shootings in the last 25 years saw mental health care professionals before their attack. Yet in not one single case were these mental health professionals able to identify these murderers as a danger to themselves or others.

For example, the Buffalo mass murderer underwent a mental health evaluation last year after threatening to shoot up a school and then kill himself, but he was released when he told the mental health professionals he was merely joking. So unless someone is stupid and says he is serious about committing a threatened crime, it is possible to evade detection by mental health professionals.

So what do you do if you can’t identify who these mass murderers are in advance? Completely ignored in the bill is any discussion of gun-free zones. While 30 percent of the schools in Texas have armed teachers and staff, the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas banned guns. The Tulsa, Oklahoma hospital shooting was another gun-free zone. The Buffalo shooting wrote in his manifesto: “Areas where” carrying with a concealed weapon “are outlawed or prohibited may be good areas of attack.”

Nor are those cases unique. Ninety-six percent of all the mass public shootings occur in places where guns are banned. These murderers might be crazy, but they aren’t stupid. They know that the more people they kill, the more media attention they can get, and if they go to a place where people can’t defend themselves, they can kill more people.

Some people mistakenly think that if you ban guns from areas, you make them safer. But gun-free zones serve as magnets for attacks. The murderers depend on the victims being defenseless.

The National Rifle Association has “a membership and a business model that will not allow them to support any legislation,” Cornyn claimed. “And so I understand where they’re coming from, but I think most people will not allow any outside group to veto good public policy.”

It is well past time that we address these mass public shootings. But, unfortunately, too many Republicans are more concerned about “doing something” than fighting to do something that makes things better. Let’s come up with proposals that matter, starting with eliminating “gun-free zones.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/23/the-supreme-courts-gun-decision-is-a-huge-win-for-the-constitution/,2022-06-24
"New York’s Unconstitutional Gun Law Was Written By A Notorious, Corrupt Thug","On the morning of January 23, 1911, an unstable Harvard graduate with the theatrical name of Fitzhugh Coyle Goldsborough walked up to the novelist David Graham Phillips on a Manhattan street and unloaded six shots from his .32-caliber pistol into him. Goldsborough, who believed the novelist had defamed his sister, reloaded his gun, placed it against his temple, and pulled the trigger. Goldsborough died instantly.

The murder-suicide shocked the city. Although the crime destroyed many lives, none of them would change history quite like George Petit le Brun, the man who performed the autopsies on the bodies at the city coroner’s office.

“I reasoned that the time had come to have legislation passed that would prevent the sale of pistols to irresponsible persons,” he later wrote. After two years of imploring local politicians to institute gun control laws, le Brun finally found an ally in Timothy D. Sullivan, one of the most corrupt politicians of his age, a Tammany Hall operator known to New Yorkers as “Big Tim.”

One of the big talking points in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen decision last week—it is mentioned in nearly every news piece—is that New York’s “may issue” permit law had been on the books for more than 100 years. And that’s a long time. But time does not make a law constitutional or efficacious.

The Sullivan Act, passed in 1911, was the nation’s first statewide gun control law. It required New Yorkers who possessed firearms small enough to be concealed to ask local cops—who could deny the request not just to “irresponsible persons” but to anyone, and for any reason, they liked—for a license.

People caught owning guns without one would face a misdemeanor charge, and those carrying guns without one a felony. In addition to handguns, the law prohibited the possession or carrying of weapons such as brass knuckles, sandbags, blackjacks, bludgeons, and bombs, as well as possessing or carrying a dagger, “dangerous knife,” or razor “with intent to use the same unlawfully.”

Such discretionary and capricious gun laws would allow corrupt cops to disarm rival gangs that threatened Tammany Hall’s authority or undermined its political interests. Big Tim’s cronies could use the law to punish business owners who didn’t pay protection money or deny entire neighborhoods the ability of self-defense.

Although Big Tim was corrupt in every way imaginable—he was involved in bribery, gambling, prostitution, and rigging elections, for starters—historians like Terry Golway assure us Sullivan really wanted to clean up neighborhoods “awash in cheap pistols.” “His law is now off the books,” writes Golway, “His wisdom remains.” One would have to suspend disbelief to accept that some of the most corrupt bureaucrats of the age, people who weren’t beneath exploiting women and children or shaking down businesses, wouldn’t abuse a malleable law that empowered them to deny their political opponents the right to defend themselves. Moreover, whatever Sullivan’s intentions were, there was no decline in gang violence or murder in New York in the ensuing years.

In 1911, there were 366 homicide arrests in New York. By 1920, there were 743. Then, like now, criminals remained unconcerned with attaining proper licensing before engaging in criminality. Only law-abiding citizens cared. We will never know how many shopkeepers and immigrants were left defenseless to thugs in those years. Even after the fall of Tammany, getting a gun for self-defense was prohibitively difficult. Essentially, the Second Amendment didn’t exist. The wealthy—Trumps, Sulzbergers, and Rockefellers, among many other notables—had no problem obtaining licenses over the years. This leaves poor and minorities, who often lack the resources or time to figure out the process, without their rights.

It’s always been a mystery to me why those critical of law enforcement are fine with allowing them to make key decisions. Then, as now, it was up to citizens to beg officials to allow them to defend themselves against subjective reasons that allow politicians, bureaucrats, and law enforcement to pick and choose who gets to practice their rights.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/06/24/why-the-senates-rushed-gun-bill-will-not-make-america-any-safer/,2022-06-27
Illinois Has The Gun Laws GOP Senators Caved To. They Didn't Work.,"In a bizarre move, Lake County State’s Attorney Eric Rinehart told the public and the press on Wednesday that he believes red flag laws in Illinois are “strong” even though the state with some of the strictest gun laws in the country failed to stop a 21-year-old shooter from murdering seven people at a July 4 parade and injuring at least 30 more.

While announcing seven counts of first-degree murder charges against Robert Crimo III for attacking paradegoers in Highland Park, Illinois, over the long weekend, Rinehart praised his state’s gun laws and called for a national ban on certain types of firearms.

“Illinois has a strong red flag law that keeps the community safe and respects everyone’s rights. We must vastly increase awareness and education about this red flag law called the Illinois Firearm Restraining Order,” Rinehart said.

After announcing that the Highland Park shooter will be charged with 7 counts of murder, the State Attorney Eric Rinehart praises red flag laws and calls for a nationwide assault weapons ban both of which are currently on the books in Illinois and Highland Park and failed. pic.twitter.com/bWEA8MZuHm — Greg Price (@greg_price11) July 5, 2022

According to Rinehart, the red flag law was designed to “ensure the safety of the individual and those around them” by confiscating guns and preventing certain people from buying guns.

“It allows individuals to stabilize their treatments — excuse me, stabilize their behavior — seek treatment, and access other resources that our community must invest in to give those who need help,” Rinehart continued. “Separate from these red flag laws, which are very powerful in Illinois, we should also ban assault weapons in Illinois and beyond.”

The first and most pressing question of all: If Illinois gun laws are so good, why wasn’t Crimo, who was labeled a “clear and present danger” to the community long before he shot up the parade and fled wearing women’s clothing, stopped by the state? If red flag laws are the answer to preventing deadly shootings, which we know they aren’t because they lack due process and are susceptible to politically motivated exploitation, why didn’t they stop Crimo (or any other shooters in states with red flag laws)?

All the stereotypical warning signs designed to trigger some sort of intervention were there. Crimo had a troubled history of posting violent content online that “reflected a plan and a desire to commit carnage for a long time in advance.” He had mental health issues that culminated in an attempted suicide in April 2019. He also had multiple run-ins with local law enforcement, who, at one point, communicated their concerns about him to state police. Yet he still freely carried out a horrific act.

Rinehart’s anti-gun tirade doesn’t make sense unless you come to terms with the fact that his plea for national gun-grabbing is a solely political talking point, not one that is designed to effect change that would actually stop bloodthirsty villain wannabes in their tracks.

Even if “assault weapons” were magically wiped off the face of the earth, as Rinehart seemed to suggest, who is to say that a clearly disturbed individual such as Crimo wouldn’t have come at the July 4 crowd with a knife, dagger, sword or even a vehicle, like the Christmas parade massacre in Waukesha, Wisconsin?

After all, Crimo was in possession of 16 knives, a dagger, and a sword in September 2019 when he threatened to “kill everyone” in his home. Law enforcement confiscated those weapons before returning the knives to the then-teenager’s father who “claimed the knives were his and they were being stored in the individual’s closet for safekeeping.”

Crimo’s father went on to sponsor his son’s December 2019 application for a firearm owner identification card, which is required for gun possession by the state of Illinois, and the state police (yes, the same department that knew Crimo was deemed a “clear and present danger”) approved it.

But even if Crimo’s dad hadn’t sponsored the application or the state police had rejected it, there was nothing stopping him from purchasing more blades or seeking out guns from the gangs who sustain the massive weapons black market in the crime-ridden Chicago just 20 miles south of his residence in Highland Park.

The warning signs about Crimo were there but the truth of the matter is that no amount of “awareness” about red flag laws or bans on “assault weapons” will stop criminals with detailed plans to hurt, kill, and destroy.

Recall that 14 Republicans in the Senate and 14 Republicans in the House recently voted to push gun restrictions like those found in Illinois in other states. They claimed that these laws would make communities safer and prevent future tragedies like previous shootings Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas. But they were clearly wrong.

There’s nothing praiseworthy about red flag laws or gun control when one of the strictest firearm regulatory states repeatedly failed to stop Crimo from carrying out a tragic and fatal attack. Begging for the federal government to remove Americans’ option to protect themselves against freaks doesn’t stop shootings, it disarms law-abiding Americans and leaves too much room for bureaucratic error.

Why Anti-Gun Zealots Can’t Admit Concealed Carry Saves Lives,"After a video of law enforcement officers acting like utter cowards at the Uvalde school shooting was released, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., claimed that the incident “puts to bed, forever, the question of whether the way to deal with bad guys with guns is to make sure there are more good guys with guns.”

Well, “forever” ended this weekend, when a 22-year-old fatally shot a man armed with an AR-15 who had opened fire in a mall food court in Greenwood, Indiana, killing three. We don’t know all the specifics — and we’ll never know how many lives the Good Samaritan saved — but it is clear Murphy’s assertion was incorrect on two counts: Cops who stand around while children are being slaughtered aren’t “good guys,” but real good guys with guns do exist.

Gun controllers assure us they don’t oppose the Second Amendment, they merely want to pass “common sense” gun laws that take “weapons of war” out of the hands of bad guys. Yet their policy proposals and rhetoric tell us something very different. Anti-gun zealots are so singularly focused on guns, they refuse to even acknowledge that the right to personal self-defense exists. Indeed, they can’t even concede that a person carrying a gun legally (as, it seems, the hero in Indiana did) or obtaining a concealed-carry license — and these people are less likely to engage in criminality than cops — might serve a positive use, like mitigating the tragedy of a mall shooting.

If you think I exaggerate, here is Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, noting that, “when a 22-year-old illegally brings a loaded gun into a mall and kills a mass shooter armed with an AR-15 after he already killed three people and wounded others is not a ringing endorsement of our implementation of the Second Amendment.”

It says something about Watts’ beliefs that she is under the impression the Constitution needs “implementation.” It also says something about her views on public policy that she seems to believe a “loaded gun” is always “illegal” (it wasn’t). More telling is the fact that Watts is unwilling to allow that an armed man saving numerous lives is preferable to having civilians sitting around in a gun-free zone waiting for the police to arrive as a madman shoots at them.

Kris Brown, president of Brady, called the act of civilian self-defense a “vigilante safety net.” Vigilantism is law enforcement “without legal authority.” Does a citizen who has undergone an FBI background check and been fingerprinted by local police have the legal and moral authority to defend themselves, their family, or their community? Brown does not seem to believe that is the case.

The argument forwarded by “experts” that good guys with guns make only a negligible or no difference in mass shootings is highly misleading. Most planned mass shootings target gun-free zones where there is no one to stop them until the police arrive. It is impossible, unless one is a mind-reader, to quantify how often the presence of good guys with guns dissuades murders. It is likely that shooters, suicidal or not, prefer soft targets that allow them to make the most gruesome impact, which is one reason I simply can’t understand why we wouldn’t want to train (willing) teachers to use firearms.

Jack Wilson, a 71-year-old congregant and security volunteer at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas, took mere seconds to stop a potential mass murderer a couple of years ago. And Jeanne Assam, a security volunteer at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs, dropped a murderer armed with an arsenal, including grenades, who had already killed four people in two churches. There is a woman in West Virginia who stopped a shooting in her apartment complex. A quickly buried Obama-administration CDC study in 2013 found that almost “all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals.”

More concealed carry isn’t a panacea to stop deranged people from shooting up churches, schools, and malls. There is none. That said, those who carry have likely done more to mitigate these tragedies than any gun measure passed or championed by Democrats. Then again, for gun-control advocates, anyone with a weapon is a “bad guy.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/06/illinois-has-all-the-gun-laws-republican-senators-caved-to-push-states-into-and-that-didnt-stop-the-highland-park-killer/,2022-07-18
Nearly Lost Book About Nazi Killing Of The Disabled Holds Truth For Today,"In 1939, Adolf Hitler signed an order leading to the eventual slaughter of an estimated 300,000 physically disabled and/or mentally ill children and adults in Germany and its annexed territories. The “Euthanasia Program” — or Aktion T4, as it came to be known — consisted of the systematic killing of human beings deemed not worthy of life or care: “useless eaters,” as they were called by some.

The name “Aktion T4” was borrowed from the street address of the office that administered the program: Tiergartenstrasse 4. The scheme was initially built on deception: families were told that their children or other family members were going to receive treatment for their maladies, but instead the “patients” were put to death, usually by lethal injection or gas. The families later received word that their loved ones had died from a natural cause such as pneumonia, their bodies conveniently cremated to avoid questions.

While Aktion T4 was launched in secrecy, the truth of what was happening soon spread, and good people resisted as they could. In Germany, a Lutheran community named Bethel discovered itself, like so many others, in the crosshairs of Hitler’s murderous insanity. Bethel, near the city of Bielefeld, was an institution dedicated to caring for those with severe physical and mental challenges. Administered by the Bodelschwingh Foundation (named after its first director, Rev. Friedrich Christian Carl von Bodelschwingh), it still exists today. The story of Bethel — and particularly of Gunther, a boy who lived the majority of his life in the foundation’s care — is detailed in a little-known book by Edna Hong called “Bright Valley of Love.”

“No good for anything … nothing but a nothing,” Gunther’s grandmother said of the little boy who lived in her house but could not do anything useful because his body was crippled by chronic malnourishment. Gunther’s mother had been “not the best of mothers” and his father, a veteran of World War I, was gone for long periods. While Gunther’s grandmother “swept and scrubbed floors and rubbed clothes on a washboard,” believing that “only people who did something useful like that had any right whatsoever to live in the world,” Gunther lay in a back bedroom being fed turnip soup and “soothing syrup” to keep him sedated.

Sunshine, Milk, and Love

Then, when Gunther was six years old, a miracle happened: his father, who had found a new wife (one who didn’t want a crippled child), took him to live at Bethel. For the next 69 years, until his death in 1989, he was told, in a million different ways, that he wasn’t a nothing but a something — not an accident of nature but a someone created by a loving God who had a plan and purpose for his life. At Bethel he received “sunshine, milk and love,” but especially love — in the care for his body, which slowly gained strength (but never recovered from its childhood deprivation); the friendships he experienced with the other residents; and the constant spiritual nourishment of God’s Word, which underpinned it all.

“Bright Valley of Love” was first published in 1976. Author Edna Hong met Gunther in 1974, having become aware of him through a complicated network of historical and personal connections. She writes in the book’s prologue that it is a “true-to-the-larger-facts story,” as “faithful … as I could make it without writing a dry … history book or a medical textbook. Of course I had to imagine all the ‘he saids’ and ‘she saids,’ for there were no tape recorders then!”

Though a top-notch scholar — Edna and her husband, Howard, were the translators of the critical English edition of Soren Kierkegaard’s writings — Hong’s style, evidenced above, is simple and clear but unfailingly profound, as she fills the pages of her story with sentences that children can easily understand but that will have adults marveling. WWI is the war “the whole world lost, although some countries thought that they had won it.” When Gunther reaches adolescence and begins to worry about what the future holds for him, he wonders whether growing up means “to find out things about yourself and others that you would rather not know.”

Resisting the Nazis

By the time the Nazi regime set its sights on Bethel, Gunther was 26 years old. The Bodelschwingh Foundation, like others, was ordered to turn in a list of its “incurables” but refused. The foundation’s ability to largely avoid the horrendous fate of so many institutions like it was due in no small part to the determination and machinations of Pastor “Fritz” von Bodelschwingh and his staff. It was also due, no doubt, to the hand of God.

The community of Bethel was not, however, untouched by the euthanasia order. In a 1992 radio interview with historian Hans-Walter Schmuhl, who wrote extensively about Bethel, Schmuhl noted that patients who were removed from Bethel early on in an attempt to save them likely ended up in euthanasia centers. This number included seven Jewish patients that did not get picked up by their families when the Bethel staff realized their patients’ lives were in grave danger and put out a call to their families to come get them.

Rediscovery of the Book

Readers can thank Concordia Theological Seminary Press for bringing this singular story back into public view. Rev. Dr. Paul Grime, dean of the chapel at the seminary in Fort Wayne, Ind., shared with The Federalist that he first encountered the book while browsing the seminary library in 2019. It piqued his curiosity, and he began reading it on a road trip while his wife was driving.

After finishing only one chapter he stopped and started again, this time reading it out loud so his wife could listen. After the two returned from their trip, Grime set about securing the reprint rights, eventually connecting with one of Edna Hong’s children (Edna died in 2007).

“I described to [Erik Hong] how I was interested in using the book in class,” Grime explained. “I also mentioned to him that I wished the book could be back in print. Over the course of the next two years, negotiations proceeded until finally … we were able to realize that dream. Given the nature of publishing today, I felt that an electronic version would also be useful. Even more, given all the hymns that are quoted in the book, an audiobook version seemed to be a natural, with the hymns sung.”

Unique Audiobook Version Highlights Hymns

As a reader who usually eschews audiobooks in favor of holding a volume in my hand, I can’t recommend the audio version highly enough. The narration, superbly executed, heightens Hong’s skillful use of imagery. Hymnody serves as a connecting thread throughout Gunther’s life, forming him in both his faith and his vocation, and to hear the hymns sung rather than read highlights their import and power. When Gunther, who is physically but not cognitively impaired, realizes that he can learn hymns and that, in doing so, he can bless others, his world opens up even more. Attending a funeral for one of his schoolmates, he is sad that, due to his crippled hands, he cannot hold a candle as others did during the service.

But as he sings the hymn “Jesu, Meine Freude” (“Jesus, Priceless Treasure”) by Johann Franck (1618–1677), he realizes that “his mind could do what his hands could not. He could learn hymns. Lots of them.” He might sing “more like a crow” than a nightingale, but in doing so, he could share “the great words” about Jesus. Gunther would spend the rest of his life not only learning and singing such words but writing his own.

As Timely as Ever

“Bright Valley of Love” will resonate most deeply with Christians, particularly those who belong to a fellowship that embraces the great hymns of the church, a liturgical piety, and ministry grounded in Word and Sacrament. But all who know instinctively that life, in all its manifestations, is never a burden and always a gift, will find that welcome message bursting from every page of this revelatory tale. Faith in Christ is what enables the staff and residents at Bethel to not merely survive but to thrive while facing evil on all sides. And while the book shows the horror and hatred to which our fallen world is so inclined, it simultaneously demonstrates the goodness of which human beings, through Christ, are capable, as caring people and organizations around the world rush to send money, food, and supplies to help the suffering.

“Bright Valley of Love” was originally published only three years after the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling making abortion on demand the law of the land. Today its message is as timely as ever. Roe v. Wade may have been overturned, but the work of changing hearts and minds must never stop, and books like this one illustrate why. Wherever there are Gunthers, there will be those who cringe, look the other way, and wish to see them disappear. When the euthanizers get their way, the whole world suffers the loss.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/18/why-anti-gun-zealots-cant-admit-concealed-carry-saves-lives/,2022-07-19
New York Times Inadvertently Makes A Case For Concealed Carry,"After Eli Dickens stopped a mass shooter this weekend at an Indiana mall, left-leaning outlets began churning out pieces arguing that “good guys with guns” are rare. Now, I don’t know a single pro-gun advocate who claims constitutional carry is a panacea. The nihilistic mass-shooter problem is crying out for a holistic societal remedy. There is no one solution. But it’s clear from the very statistics offered in pieces like this one from the New York Times (which generously quotes me) that concealed carry saves lives.

Consider:

1. Eli Dicken is an absolute badass. The 22-year-old reportedly took down the shooter with eight of 10 shots just 15 seconds after the incident began from 40 yards, showing more bravery and composure than the hundreds of cops milling around while students were being slaughtered in a Uvalde school.

2. The only reason Dicken was armed with a 9-millimeter at the Greenwood mall is that Indiana had recently passed a permitless carry law, which removed license requirements for handgun carriers (though gun buyers still go through the usual FBI background check, a fact omitted in many news stories.) One can assume that Dicken would not have brought any weapon with him had it been illegal to do so, but that the killer, Jonathan Douglas Sapirman, would have shown up with his 100 rounds, two ARs, and a pistol regardless of how forcefully the signs in the mall informed him that he was in a gun-free zone.

3. The New York Times refers to Dicken’s shooting as a “statistical unicorn.” But is it? “An examination of 433 active shooter attacks in the United States between 2000 and 2021,” writes the Times, “showed that only 22 ended with a bystander shooting an attacker, according to data from the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University.”

Only 22 of 433 incidents is 5 percent — which translates to a significant number of lives saved. Or, put it this way: The lives saved by bystanders taking down shooters are as, or more, effective than any Democrat-led policy effort on gun safety.

When The Washington Post fact-checkers looked at 41 of the most deadly mass shooting since 2015, they could come up with only two instances where “universal background checks” might have averted a shooting. The Post’s claim is debatable in both instances because unlike the shooters who are killed by bystanders, we have no idea what alternative actions would-be mass shooters might take. But, for the sake of argument, let’s concede that “universal background checks” stopped just under 5 percent of the worst mass shootings (there is no reason to believe the percentage rises with a bigger sample size). Would the Times categorize the policy’s effectiveness as a “statistical unicorn”? Unlikely.

4. But even the Times’ 5 percent number is misleading. Many, probably most, planned mass shootings happen in places where citizens are forbidden by law to carry guns for self-protection. How many of these rampages would be stopped — or more quickly ended — if teachers or movie theater patrons or mallgoers were allowed to legally carry weapons? The number is surely more than 5 percent. Maybe a lot more.

5. Adam Skaggs, chief counsel and policy director at Giffords, told the Times that good guys with guns are “exceedingly rare” and “the exception rather than the rule. The reality is that more people carrying guns means more conflicts escalating into deadly violence and more people being shot and killed.”

That is not the reality. There is little correlation between high levels of gun ownership and criminality. There are counties where gun ownership is widespread and there is little criminality, and there are urban areas where the percentage of gun ownership is low and there is exceedingly high criminality, and there are places with low gun ownership and low criminality. But the reality is guns exist in this country. Hundreds of millions of them. Society should be incentivizing responsible ownership and punishing irresponsible ownership. The fact that we strip people of the ability to protect themselves is indefensible.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/19/book-about-nazi-slaughter-of-the-disabled-nearly-lost-to-history-sends-a-message-to-post-roe-america/,2022-07-20
SCOTUS Made It Easier To Throw Out Gun Control,"The Supreme Court’s landmark decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen did a lot more than just strike down New York state’s concealed carry law. It changed the legal landscape for gun laws across the country. With that change, many gun control laws are now on life support. But the real question is — which ones are doomed?

At the end of June, the Supreme Court ruled in Bruen that it was unconstitutional for the state of New York to require individuals to demonstrate a “proper cause” for needing to carry a firearm in public. Beyond just striking down the law, however, the Supreme Court also fundamentally altered the way lower courts across the nation review Second Amendment challenges.

For over a decade, most federal courts have used a two-step test to evaluate Second Amendment cases. In step one, courts would determine whether the regulated practice was protected by the Second Amendment. If so, courts would proceed to step two and “balance” the right against the government’s purported interest in regulating the practice. This resulted in many courts upholding nearly every gun control regulation.

And for that same span, gun rights groups have argued the two-step test doesn’t follow the Supreme Court’s landmark 2008 decision in D.C. v. Heller. The Heller opinion not only explicitly prohibited interest balancing but laid out a clear methodology, based on text and history, to analyze Second Amendment cases. The Supreme Court’s Bruen opinion agrees.

Instead of using the flawed two-step test, lower courts are required to examine the text of the Second Amendment, as informed by history, by applying an interpretive methodology known as “originalism.” Governments must base their laws on historical analogs or risk having them ruled unconstitutional. In other words, if there is no evidence that the government could regulate something around 1791 when the Bill of Rights was ratified, then the government can’t regulate it today.

So, current gun control laws that lack any historical precedent now face the chopping block.

‘High-Capacity’ Magazines

First up are so-called “high-capacity” magazine bans. Various governments prohibit individuals from buying or owning magazines that can hold more than 10 or 15 rounds of ammunition. But there is no historical analog those governments can point to in support of those bans.

Firearms capable of firing more than 10 rounds without reloading have existed since at least the 1500s. In 1777, over a decade before the adoption of the Bill of Rights, Joseph Belton demonstrated a repeating rifle able to hold 16 rounds to members of the Continental Congress. Moreover, the Puckle Gun, patented in 1718, had pre-loaded, replaceable cylinders that would allow the operator to quickly reload the weapon.

Because there is clear historical evidence that proto-magazines and firearms capable of firing more than 15 rounds without reloading existed at the time of ratification, and there are no analogous historical bans or restrictions on those firearms, modern magazine bans should be ruled unconstitutional.

‘Assault Weapons’

Next are bans on so-called “assault weapons.” One such ban is currently being considered by Congress. The weapons in question are nothing more than semiautomatic firearms that are lawfully owned by millions of Americans. And there are no analogous historical bans on similar, commonly owned, effective self-defense tools. In fact, quite the opposite is true.

Most civilian-owned firearms in and around 1791 in the United States were not only suitable for self-defense, but they were also the firearms used to fight the Revolutionary War. In fact, around the founding, fowler guns, which were used both for bird hunting and in militia service, were incredibly common.

Yet again, despite the prevalence of these firearms, there were no analogous regulations that modern governments can point to in order to justify a ban today.

These are just two examples of the many gun control laws that will be reevaluated by federal courts due to the Supreme Court’s Bruen opinion.

If and when federal courts consider the historical scope and original meaning of the Second Amendment, they will find that several modern gun control laws — such as magazine and “assault weapons” bans — violate the U.S. Constitution. If courts truly follow the original public meaning of the Second Amendment, it’s only a matter of time before the bans are formally struck down.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/20/new-york-times-inadvertently-makes-the-case-for-more-concealed-carry/,2022-08-08
New York Defies Supreme Court With Unconstitutional Gun Laws,"New York’s new gun control law takes effect in two weeks. The law turns New York into a giant “gun-free zone.” But it also requires an in-person interview with law enforcement and the sharing of all social media accounts in order to obtain a gun license.

By requiring that gun license applicants have “good moral character,” New York is still acting in defiance of June’s Supreme Court decision, New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, Inc. v. Brue. In a new court filing last week, New York Attorney General Letitia James claims that without these requirements, there would be an “entirely predictable chaos.” Democrats and gun control proponents have voiced similar fears in the other six states affected by the Supreme Court’s decision.

Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’s opinion in Bruen stressed the importance of “objective” standards for gun permits, ones that don’t require “the exercise of judgment, and the formation of opinion.” He also noted that “there is no historical basis for New York to effectively declare the island of Manhattan a ‘sensitive place’ simply because it is crowded and protected generally by the New York City Police Department.” New York’s default position is that all private property is off-limits to lawful concealed carry unless the property owner notes “by clear and conspicuous signage” that guns are welcome.

There is no “chaos” coming our way. Since 1976, 18 states have eliminated subjective “proper cause” requirements, which require convincing a government bureaucrat of one’s need for a permit, in favor of “right-to-carry” policies. In these and other states, concealed handgun permit holders have proved extremely law-abiding. No right-to-carry state has ever even held a legislative hearing to consider moving back to a “proper cause” requirement. Over time states have also eliminated their gun-free zones as they have seen predictions of disaster not occurring.

Permit Holders Have Proven Responsible

But some people will just never be convinced that regular Americans can be trusted with firearms. During oral arguments in Bruen, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer speculated: “People of good moral character who start drinking a lot and who may be there for a football game or—or some kind of soccer game—can get pretty angry at each other. And if they each have a concealed weapon, who knows?”

With 21.5 million permit holders and laws in place for many decades, Breyer’s scenario should have played out at least once. But there isn’t a single recorded incident like it.

In Florida and Texas, permit holders are convicted of firearms-related violations at one-twelfth the rate of police officers. The average revocation rate is 0.1% in the 19 states with comprehensive data. Usually, permit revocations occur because someone moved, died, or forgot to bring a permit while carrying.

Crime-Fighting Benefits

Concealed carry comes with extensive crime-fighting benefits. Academics have published 52 peer-reviewed, empirical studies on concealed carry. Of these, 25 found that allowing people to carry reduces violent crime, and 15 found no significant effect. Twelve studies observed increased violent crime after adopting concealed carry. But those are the only studies that Justice Breyer cited in his dissenting opinion, and they all suffer to varying degrees from systematic error. They overwhelmingly focus on the last 20 years and compare states that recently passed concealed carry laws with more lenient states that had passed concealed carry laws before that and sustained a much larger growth in permits over the past two decades. The finding that crime rose relatively in the later states that issued comparitively few permits is consistent with permit holders reducing crime.

The media capitols of California and New York are out of sync with the rest of the country. In those states, where public officials had the discretion to decide who could receive a carry permit, only a few adults out of every thousand have one. Most permit holders reside in rural counties.

In the rest of the U.S., 10 percent of adults have permits. People in most states don’t think twice about being surrounded by citizens carrying in movie theaters, restaurants, malls, and stores. In Pennsylvania, more than 14 percent of adults have permits. In Connecticut, it is 10 percent. In Vermont, no permit is needed. But most New Yorkers don’t fear for their lives when they cross their border with Pennsylvania, Connecticut, or Vermont.

Only Politically Connected Allowed to Carry

In 2013, Los Angeles County released a list of its 341 permit holders (out of almost 8 million adults). Only the political elite got permits: judges, reserve deputy sheriffs, and a small group of very wealthy, well-connected individuals who gave campaign donations to the county sheriff.

While Hispanics made up over half of Los Angeles County residents, they only received about 6.5 percent of the county’s permits. Women obtained about 7 percent of permits, and blacks 5 percent. In right-to-carry states, women have 29 percent of the licenses, and blacks have 12 percent. While detailed lists aren’t available for New York City, the story appears to be the same — only the most politically connected are allowed protection.

Where officials decide who gets permits on a discretionary basis, explicit death threats often aren’t even enough to qualify. Living in a high-crime neighborhood is irrelevant.

The Supreme Court has ruled against arbitrary and unfair permitting processes, but New York officials seem intent on dragging their heels. They will soon see that there was nothing to fear all along.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/08/08/now-that-scotus-made-it-easier-to-throw-out-anti-gun-laws-which-one-will-be-next-to-go/,2022-08-22
"Gun Owners Are Racist, According To Bad Science","White people own guns — and oppose gun-control legislation — because they are racist and fear black people. Two new studies advance this dangerous narrative building among our academic elites. While such rhetoric is perhaps unsurprising among political pundits or celebrities, otherwise serious academics are now ascribing racist motives to gun ownership and opposition to gun control. These studies are not only based on a slew of bigoted assumptions, but also bad science.

The University of Wisconsin recently promoted a new study contending that in U.S. counties where black people were enslaved in 1860, gun ownership is higher today. In fact, gun ownership, they say, is correlated to the number of slaves formerly in each county. To support this more-slaves-means-more-guns theory, the authors construct a historical narrative that whites feared newly freed slaves, bought guns for self-defense, and then this fear somehow trickled down over 160 years.

But interestingly enough, just last month, National Public Radio ran a story on how black people are the fastest growing group of gun owners. If gun ownership is a product of white people being racist, then this is quite curious.

The University of Wisconsin study suffers from a series of flaws, even apart from its poisonous premise that white people believe or feel certain things because they are white. You’d never say the same about other races, and we shouldn’t give a pass to academics who traffic in the same type of racism.

Alternative Explanations

In any correlational study like this, one must be concerned about the potential for alternative explanations. And a study with the punchline “because slavery” leaves a lot of room for alternatives. For example, the extent of slavery in southern U.S. counties was far heavier in areas of the south that remain rural to this day. The so-called “Black Belt” of southern agriculture that stretched across Georgia to Mississippi remains heavily agrarian, rural, and impoverished today relative to other parts of the region that have been absorbed into growing metropolises like Atlanta, Charlotte, and Nashville. In these regions, the wide-scale hunting of deer, quail, and even wild boar remains more prominent and may explain higher levels of gun ownership, yet this fact remains unaccounted for in the study.

Next, the authors peddle a sort of “Facebook-friend racism theory” that is, charitably speaking, laughable. The authors propose that counties that are more socially connected with southern counties have higher rates of gun ownership. Apparently, having a southern Facebook friend makes you afraid of black people. Again, several alternative explanations come to mind. Most importantly, one would expect non-slave-holding counties located near slave-holding counties to have both social ties and a similar culture of gun ownership. The paper did not account for this. Additionally, with the increasing mobility of Americans, it is unclear that ties to someone who lives in an area that once had slaves bear any relationship to that area’s slave-owning past. Why would it? A study unnecessarily laden with such racial biases, paired with shaky scientific foundations, furthers the notion that this academic research is less about finding the truth than about bolstering some woke narrative.

A few days after the release of the slavery-predicts-gun-ownership study, the American Psychological Association (APA) released another study contending that whites support gun rights because they are racist, and when whites oppose gun rights, that’s also racist.

Flawed Determination of Racism

In setting up its key findings about “racist” white Americans, the APA study uses what’s known as an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to identify whether study participants harbored racial resentment. IATs attempt to measure biases that exist below the surface through the matching of terms, phrases, or pictures. In this case, for example, the study had participants pair gun rights terms (e.g. “hunting”) or gun-control phrases (e.g. “gun free zone”) with white faces and black faces. Also, the study had participants measure their agreement with certain statements such as “Irish, Italians, Jewish, and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Black people should do the same without any special favors.” Apparently, how a participant matched faces, or agreed with a particular statement (on a scale of 1 to 5), allowed the study authors to determine whether a participant was racist.

While IATs once represented an intriguing method of uncovering unvoiced racism, the technique has come under increased criticism in recent years. In particular, it is largely accepted that a single IAT is not sufficient to uncover racial bias, even by those who created the test. Manhattan Institute Fellow Heather MacDonald has extensively catalogued the serious academic criticisms of IATs.

There are many valid policy and legal arguments opposing all sorts of gun-control proposals. But academics are attempting to short circuit the debate by simply labeling opponents as “racist” and gun owners as harboring “white fear.” Discrediting opponents with ad hominem attacks like “racist” is offensive and wrongheaded on its own. But employing “science” based on discredited theories or faulty assumptions is a dastardly attempt to foment racial divisions.

Joe Biden’s Ghost Gun ‘Ban’ Lasted Less Than A Minute,"The Biden administration and its allies are celebrating that President Joe Biden has now “banned ghost guns” by executive order. A “ghost gun,” as the gun control movement calls it, is a homemade firearm that does not have a serial number and is not known by the federal government to exist. Since the moment our country was founded, it has always been legal at the federal level to build a firearm for personal use, as long as the firearm manufactured is otherwise legal to own. As of August 24, 2022, a new federal regulation prohibits kits with all of the parts needed to build a gun from being sold to the public without a background check.

As the gun control movement describes it, America’s streets are now safe from the scourge of homemade firearms because companies cannot sell the kits to make these guns without the purchaser receiving them through a licensed gun store and undergoing a background check.

Their celebration was short-lived, however. As soon as the clock struck midnight and Biden’s new rule went into effect, retailers had already adjusted their inventory to comply with the new regulations. Biden’s ban on “ghost guns” lasted no longer than a minute.

As long as the United States has existed, citizens and politicians have debated how the country’s gun laws should be written. That typically includes debate over who should be allowed to own guns and what kind of guns they should be allowed to own. Today, there are local, state, and federal statutes regulating how firearms can be acquired, possessed, used, and sold.

What Is a Firearm?

But there is now a debate over a more basic question: What is a firearm?

Federal law defines the term “firearm” in 18 U.S.C § 921(a)(3) as “any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive” or “the frame or receiver of any such weapon.” This is the statute that Congress passed.

Under the law, the “frame or receiver” is the part defined as the firearm. The reason for this clarification is simple: If you possess a firearm, that lawfully defined object does not disappear if it is fully disassembled. Even when it is pulled apart, there is still a firearm in that pile of parts. Otherwise, every gun control law could be circumvented just by disassembling the gun. The frame is the part legally defined as the firearm, and it is the only part that requires a serial number and a background check to purchase at a licensed gun dealer.

However, for a frame to be a firearm, it has to be a finished frame. If a frame is only partially completed, is incapable of being assembled into a functional gun, and cannot fire or be readily converted to fire a shot, then it is not a firearm.

Put simply, when a firearm manufacturer is creating a firearm frame, there has to be a point in the manufacturing process when the innocent, unregulated piece of metal or plastic legally becomes regulated as a firearm.

When Does It Become a Firearm?

When asked how he came up with the ideas for his sculptures, Renaissance artist Michelangelo Buonarotti famously responded that the sculpture already existed inside the marble block, and it was only his job to chip away the excess material. Without a point in the manufacturing process delineating when an object legally becomes a firearm, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) would be able to use Michelangelo’s logic to prosecute people who possessed unmachined blocks of aluminum.

To protect against this, the ATF has long held that a piece of metal or plastic becomes a firearm when it is more than 80 percent of the way toward being finished. Anything less and the object is not legally a gun, allowing businesses to freely sell them without federal firearm laws applying. The industry and demand for these 80 percent firearm receivers have grown in the past few years. While building a firearm used to be a niche part of the hobby, requiring expensive tools and extensive gunsmithing experience, today’s 80 percent receivers can be completed with hobby-grade tools. Manufacturers of these unfinished frames include jigs to show precisely where to cut and drill to finish the last 20 percent of the manufacturing process. Anyone with a hand drill and a metal file can finish one of these kits in a single evening, from the comfort of their own home.

Unfinished Frames Defined as Firearm

The Biden administration, eager to “do something” on homemade guns, added a regulation to the Federal Register clarifying that if a retailer sells an unfinished frame, the jig, the drill bits, and the parts together, then these kits mean that the unfinished frame “may be readily converted” to fire a projectile, making the kit itself a “firearm.”

This regulation does not change the 80 percent demarcation in any way. It simply states that selling an unfinished frame with the jig, parts, and drill bits makes it too easy for someone to finish manufacturing the firearm frame. Apparently, you only have a right to build firearms, as a part of your right to keep and bear arms, as long as it doesn’t become too easy to do so. Imagine if that logic was applied to any other constitutional right.

Under the new regulation, if a company were to put an unfinished frame, jig, bits, and parts into a single box and ship it directly to a buyer, the Biden administration claims that the contents of that box constitute a firearm, and the law would be broken unless the frame was serialized and transferred through a gun store with a background check performed.

Gun Sellers Work Around Regulation

However, if a buyer were to separately purchase an unfinished frame, jig, bits, and parts, and the seller was to package and ship them each in separate boxes, the stack of boxes from four separate orders would not legally count as a firearm.

It is easy to predict what sellers did the minute the clock struck midnight on August 24, 2022, and the ATF’s final rule banned these kits: The retailers broke up their kits and began selling the unfinished frames, jigs, drill bits, and parts as separate items. Retailers started requiring buyers to purchase all four of these items in separate orders. Some online retailers refused to sell all four items, instead forcing buyers to make separate purchases from different sellers so that no single seller could be accused of selling a “gun.”

By 12:01 am, every item offered in these kits was again available for sale separately online. In less than a minute, the firearm industry had already devised a way to comply with the new regulation and continue to sell these parts. The only difference is that people interested in building their own guns would now need to make multiple purchases and pay to ship multiple packages of parts.

Targeting the Law-Abiding

This regulation has only succeeded in making the gun-building process more complicated and expensive. It has not stopped a single criminal from acquiring parts to illegally build a gun. Considering there is a step-by-step guide on the internet showing how to turn a rusty shovel into an AK-47, it is safe to say that anyone looking to illegally build a gun will continue to be able to do so. Criminals in our society already break countless laws on a daily basis; why would anyone think a regulation like this would finally stop them?

This regulation was never aimed at the criminal class, though. Like all gun control, it targets the law-abiding. Politicians and bureaucrats fear homemade firearms because they exist outside of regulated firearm commerce. There is no serial number or background check, so the federal government does not know who owns them. In a dystopian future where government agents could be dispatched to seize Americans’ known or registered firearms, the homemade guns would remain. Just as the colonial blacksmiths secretly repaired and built guns for the revolutionary war effort, the ability to manufacture arms today ensures that free Americans will never truly be deprived of the ability to defend themselves.

That terrifies tyrants, and it should.

Credit Card Companies Conspire With Dems To Surveil Gun Purchases,"Image Credit Karolina Grabowska/Pexels

After facing mounting pressure from Democrats and anti-gun activists, credit card giants Visa, Mastercard, and American Express all announced plans this week to single out their customers’ purchases at firearm stores.

Using a new four-digit merchant category code, credit card companies will now categorize any purchases at gun ammunition stores, regardless if those purchases are of firearms or not, as separate from other shopping. If the credit card companies deem any of those transactions suspect, they will report them to local law enforcement agencies.

Visa, Mastercard, and AmEx all adopted the new standards on Saturday shortly after the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which is known for setting standards for Western business transactions, approved the change regarding gun store purchases on Friday.

The ISO’s decision came at the behest of anti-gun activists and Democrat lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who just one week prior, demanded financial CEOs be their eyes and ears when it comes to “certain types of suspicious activities including straw purchases and unlawful bulk purchases that could be used in the commission of domestic terrorist acts or gun trafficking schemes.”

“Mass shooters have repeatedly financed deadly massacres using credit cards, and Bank CEOs need to step up to save lives,” Warren wrote. “Financial institutions and payment networks, such as Visa, MasterCard, and American Express can and should do everything they can to help law enforcement prevent some mass shootings by identifying suspicious gun purchases through the implementation of this new code.”

Even before Democrats decided to pressure credit card companies into doing their bidding on guns, Amalgamated Bank President and CEO Priscilla Sims Brown demanded financial institutions surveil the firearm industry using merchant category codes. Her initial plea to the ISO in June 2021 was rejected, based on recommendations from Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. But since Amalgamated Bank, the largest union-owned bank in the U.S. works closely with the ISO, it was no surprise that, shortly after Brown’s ongoing push to make credit companies the Big Brother of gun sales was once again amplified by corporate media in June of 2022, the ISO decided to adopt the new recommendations less than three months later.

As Federalist Senior Legal Correspondent Margot Cleveland noted in her previous coverage of Mastercard and Visa, academic research suggests that “disrupting the sale of illegal goods through the payment networks of Mastercard, Visa, and their partner banks appears more effective than legal action.” That’s because both Visa and Mastercard can “punish banks” out of doing business with entities that the credit card companies classify as illegal or problematic.

That’s likely why even Democrats outside of Congress, including, New York Attorney General Letitia James, celebrated involving credit card companies in the left’s push to crackdown on gun buyers and sellers as “a big victory.”

Gun rights groups and activists including the National Rifle Association, however, condemned the credit card giants for caving to Democrats’ and banks’ attempts to regulate law-abiding gun sellers and buyers using corporate America.

“The ISO’s decision to create a firearm specific code is nothing more than a capitulation to anti-gun politicians and activists bent on eroding the rights of law-abiding Americans one transaction at a time,” an NRA spokesman said in a statement this weekend. “This is not about tracking or prevention or any virtuous motivation — it’s about creating a national registry of gun owners.”

Biden Appoints Gun Control Activist To Hunting And Wildlife Council,"President Joe Biden’s contempt for lawful gun ownership knows no bounds. His latest move threatens over a century of gains in wildlife conservation just to stick it to the firearm industry, which he once infamously labeled “the enemy.”

The White House appointed gun control activist Ryan Busse to the Hunting & Wildlife Council, an advisory committee that assists the Department of the Interior (DOI) and U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) in crafting policies on issues including wildlife conservation, wildlife management and public lands access for hunting, recreational shooting and fishing. Busse was listed as an “unaffiliated” shooting sports adviser.

That couldn’t be further from the truth. Busse is a partisan gun control zealot. He’s an adviser to the Giffords gun control group, which demands a ban on the most popular selling semiautomatic rifle in America today — the Modern Sporting Rifle (MSR). There are more than 24.4 million of these rifles in circulation today, used for lawful purposes including self-defense, recreational target shooting, and — whether Busse wants to admit it or not — hunting.

Don’t expect Busse to advocate for hunters using these rifles on the council. He’s peddling a book, “Gunfight: My Battle Against the Industry that Radicalized America.” That’s the book where he takes exception to the firearm industry for producing variants of the AR-frame rifles in response to consumer demand. He claims insider knowledge since he was once a vice president for Kimber Manufacturing. Adoring media fawned over his epiphany that just this one particular type of firearm is “bad” in their views. It plays well at leftist cocktail parties.

It’s also earned him the rebuke of his former employer for dragging the rifle and pistol maker into the fray in which it never wanted to take part.

Politics over Policy

Busse’s claim as an industry executive insider is dubious. Among industry executives, his self-inflated value was vastly overstated. An overwhelming number of executives with decades of experience in the firearm industry had never heard of him. For that matter, neither did I, and I own a Kimber handgun that was manufactured while Busse was still with the company. Busse didn’t rise to attention until he delved into the world of politics.

Busse signed on to be an adviser to President Biden’s 2020 White House campaign, a campaign platform that espoused the most far-reaching and radical gun control agenda ever proposed by a presidential campaign. The Biden campaign’s gun control proposal was, and is, more aggressive than that proposed by Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Busse was also a campaign donor to former Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, who also latched onto a policy position of banning MSRs. Gov. Bullock flip-flopped on his ideas to ban, or not to ban, AR-15s and their like before his own presidential ambitions flamed out. Ever loyal, however, former Bullock endorsed Busse’s gun control book, alongside other gun control activists including Gabby Giffords, David Hogg, and Shannon Watts.

His political alliances didn’t stop there. Busse joined Giffords at the time when David Chipman, former agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) — turned gun control adviser for Giffords — was still under consideration to become ATF director. That nomination didn’t survive the confirmation hearings, and the Biden administration quietly withdrew Chipman’s name. Giffords’ direct attacks against NSSF, The Firearm Industry Trade Association, became more pointed and direct.

The politics of Busse’s arrival on the Hunting & Wildlife Council are adding up. The Biden administration didn’t appoint Busse to this advisory group for his “unaffiliated” shooting sports acumen. It’s just the opposite. Busse’s appointment is a slap in the face of the industry that’s funded wildlife conservation and public lands access for nearly a century.

Firearm and ammunition makers pay a 10 and 11 percent excise tax on long guns and ammunition, as well as handguns. It’s paid to the U.S. Treasury and deposited into the Wildlife Restoration Trust Fund, under the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act, also known as the Pittman-Robertson Act (PR). These PR funds have totaled over $15.3 billion since 1937, or over $23 billion when adjusted for inflation. Of the $1.5 billion of these funds apportioned to the states last year for wildlife conservation, over $1.1 billion is directly attributed to taxes paid by the firearm and ammunition industry.

Not a single red penny was paid by gun control groups for wildlife conservation. In fact, their efforts to ban entire classes of firearms would result in a catastrophic crash in wildlife conservation funding. Hunters and outdoorsmen and women can’t count on Busse to stand for their interests when it comes to wildlife conservation. His record proves this.

Advocates Gun Control, Not Conservation

Busse won’t stand for sportsmen and women to speak out against the USFWS Final Rule that opens 18 National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) but bans the use of traditional lead ammunition on those refuges without scientific evidence that it causes detrimental wildlife population impacts. The USFWS instituted the rule at the behest of special-interest anti-hunting groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity, which has been labeled “a law firm, not a scientific organization,” by The American Council on Science and Health. That’s because 50 of their 170 staff members have the title of counsel or attorney.

He also won’t stand against the secretive “sue-and-settle” agreement USFWS entered into with CBD to reverse the expansion of hunting and fishing on 2.3 million acres of public lands. Don’t expect this gun control activist to reject CBD’s pending petition to ban the use of traditional ammunition on all NWRs by 2024. These bans and expansion of the bans aren’t based on science but are a means to raise the cost of hunting by forcing hunters to purchase more expensive, but much less available alternative ammunition.

These groups know that weekend hunters trying to squeeze a day in the woods with their kids will likely be priced out of hunting altogether. With Busse working to ban their guns, and these groups working to ban their ammunition, this is a recipe for wildlife conservation disaster.

The Biden administration’s appointment of Busse to this advisory group is intentional. The administration is putting political agendas ahead of conservation. Busse no more represents the “shooting sports interests” than Chipman would have been a fair and impartial regulator of the firearm industry if he would have been confirmed as ATF Director.

Busse’s appointment, and the exclusion of a representative of the firearm industry, demonstrate the contempt The White House has for lawful gun ownership and stewards of wildlife. This is gun control agendas before all else, and wildlife conservation is the true victim.

Courts Are Foiling Biden’s Trivial Attempt To Regulate ‘Ghost Guns’,"President Joe Biden’s push to change the rules regarding “ghost guns” and put serial numbers on gun parts may be hitting a major roadblock. Relying on the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision in June, a West Virginia federal district court judge ruled on Thursday that it is unconstitutional to ban guns without serial numbers. That is hardly the end of the story, however, as federal judges in Texas and North Dakota seem to have no problem with requiring serial numbers.

The West Virginia judge, U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin, isn’t some wild-eyed Trump nominee. He was nominated by Democrat President Bill Clinton.

Goodwin followed the reasoning of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote in his Bruen opinion: “Government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” It wasn’t until the 1968 Gun Control Act that all guns had to have unique serial numbers.

Democrats have pushed for serial numbers on all parts of guns, saying it’s a way to protect public safety and prevent violent crime. “This rule will make it harder for criminals and other prohibited persons to obtain untraceable guns,” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland claimed in August. “It will help to ensure that law enforcement officers can retrieve the information they need to solve crimes. And it will help reduce the number of untraceable firearms flooding our communities.”

Biden’s expanded use of serial numbers is aimed at stopping the production of homemade guns, now called “ghost guns” by gun control advocates. Homemade guns have been around since even before the United States became a country, and it was never terribly difficult to make a gun with simple machine tools. But now their production has become nearly impossible to regulate. With 3-D metal printers, people can now make weapons that are indistinguishable from those purchased in stores.

But, in any case, despite what people see on TV shows such as “Law & Order,” serial numbers on guns don’t help law enforcement solve crimes.

In theory, if criminals leave registered guns at a crime scene, the serial numbers can be used to trace the weapons back to the perpetrators. Similarly, Biden claims ghost guns have “no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can’t be traced.”

But in real life, guns are only left at the scene of a crime when the gunmen have been seriously injured or killed. With both the criminal and weapon present at the scene, police can solve these crimes without registration. In the exceedingly unusual instances where registered guns are left at the scene, they aren’t registered to the person who committed the crime.

Police in jurisdictions from Hawaii to Chicago to Pennsylvania to New York that have had registration for decades can’t point to any crimes they have been able to solve with it. Even entire countries such as Canada haven’t had success.

New York and Maryland spent tens of millions of dollars compiling a computer database that contained the unique ballistic “fingerprints” of each new gun sold over 15 years. But even these states, which strongly favor gun control, eventually abolished their systems because they never solved a single crime.

Despite Biden’s claims, his new ghost gun regulations are no more useful. Combined with Biden’s zero-tolerance policy for any paperwork mistakes by gun dealers, his new rule is quite nefarious. Biden wants to put gun dealers out of business if they make any paperwork mistake, no matter how trivial or inconsequential. With each part of a gun having a different serial number, just transferring a barrel from one gun to another requires redoing all the paperwork on both guns. He is adding significant costs to gun dealers and manufacturers and increasing the likelihood of mistakes that would put them out of business.

There is a possible argument for using serial numbers for tax purposes, to allow for easier proof of whether a gun has been taxed. The 1934 National Firearms Act imposed taxes on certain weapons such as machine guns. But licensed dealers can still make sure guns are properly taxed when sold, just as sales taxes are imposed on items at any other store.

Why do Democrats keep pushing a policy that costs so much and has no crime-reducing benefits? Someday, knowing who owns guns will help them to target their confiscation efforts. Mass registration will set the stage for future gun bans, but in the meantime, the courts may finally be bringing some sanity to gun control regulations.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/09/28/biden-threatens-conservation-efforts-by-appointing-gun-control-activist-to-hunting-and-wildlife-council/,2022-10-19
Texas Dealer Sues Biden For Shuttering Gun Stores Over Typos,"A Texas firearms dealer is suing the Biden administration for weaponizing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to shut down law-abiding gun retailers over paperwork errors discovered during audits.

President Joe Biden ordered the Department of Justice in June of 2021 to enforce “zero tolerance for willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that put public safety at risk,” but after a 500 percent increase in federal firearm license revocations for retailers over the last year, it’s clear the Biden administration isn’t just going after gun sellers who intentionally violate the law.

Punishing minor slip-ups, the lawsuit argues, draws on a drastically different interpretation of the law than the definition federal courts have held based on the Gun Control Act of 1968.

The lawsuit, to which the federal government has 60 days to respond, also argues that the Biden administration’s new policy sets an unreasonably high standard that is not applied to any other industry.

That’s why Michael Cargill, owner of Central Texas Gun Works in Austin, chose to bring this case.

“There’s no business that you walk into today in this country where they don’t make a mistake,” Cargill told The Federalist. “Everyone makes mistakes. It’s not fair — it’s not right — to single out gun stores, which is what I see this current administration doing right now.”

Texas Public Policy Foundation

Cargill hasn’t been suspended by the ATF yet, but like every other law-abiding gun retailer, he fears he could be the next victim of the Biden administration’s anti-gun rampage. That’s problematic because not only does he sell guns, but he also offers safety and training courses for legal firearm owners.

“If we make a mistake here in the gun store, then they’re saying they can totally shut me down? That’s not right. We’re trying our best to do exactly what we’re supposed to do. We’re trying to dot our I’s and cross our T’s to make sure that we’re doing everything right,” Cargill said.

Cargill said he always contacts the ATF when he finds errors or has a problem because he firmly believes in operating up to federal standards. Siccing the ATF on law-abiding gun retailers like him over clerical mistakes that can be easily rectified, Cargill said, only damages that working relationship.

“The gun store is supposed to be the database for law enforcement, for the ATF. We’re supposed to work in partnership with each other, not at each other’s throats [as] enemies of each other,” Cargill said. “I should feel comfortable when they walk in to inspect us knowing that [if] they found something wrong, they’re going to guide us in the right. They caught it so we can fix it next time.”

Texas Public Policy Foundation

‘Willful’

In May of 2021, the ATF website clearly stated, “Some regulatory violations of the GCA pose inherent public safety risks and, when willfully committed, will result in ATF taking action to revoke the license of the offending FFL.”

“Willfulness is not defined in the regulations, but is defined by case law to mean the intentional disregard of a known legal duty or plain indifference to a licensee’s legal obligations,” an archived version of the ATF’s “Revocation of Firearms Licenses” webpage states. “If an FFL has willfully violated the law, shown an intentional disregard for regulatory requirements, or knowingly participated in criminal acts, revocation (or taking away their license) often becomes the only option.”

The webpage also clarified that “ATF does not revoke licenses for every violation found during compliance inspections.”

“It is rare that the process of taking away a license is started unless an FFL has been educated on the requirements of the laws and regulations and given an opportunity to voluntarily comply with them, but has failed to do so,” the webpage continued.

On June 23, 2021, Biden, who had promised since he was on the campaign trail that he would take aim at the gun industry, demanded the DOJ initiate a “zero tolerance for willful violations of the law by federally licensed firearms dealers that put public safety at risk.”

By July 14, 2021, ATF Acting Assistant Director of Field Operations George Lauder instructed all special agents in charge and directors of Industry Operations to adhere to the guidelines for this new crackdown.

That’s problematic, Matt Miller, senior attorney at the Texas Public Policy Foundation and lead counsel for this case, told The Federalist, because the ATF “has started to claim that 15 or 20 violations constitute evidence of willfulness, even if you sold thousands of guns that year.”

“It doesn’t matter that they were just paperwork errors that didn’t result in a prohibited person obtaining a firearm. If someone simply writes ‘USA’ on the ‘County’ line because they misread it as ‘Country,’ that’s a violation,” Miller said.

Error-free work, Miller added, is “virtually impossible to meet when accounting for the volume of transactions that Plaintiffs complete.”

“I would challenge any business or a lawyer who has submitted briefs to have truly error-free work product. We all strive for it, but it’s not realistic. Congress understood that. That’s why they put the word ‘willful’ in there. [The Biden administration] enacted what is effectively a zero-tolerance approach toward these gun dealers,” Miller said.

The ATF website, which was updated to reflect the new policy, openly admits that “relatively few FFLs engage in such conduct” and claims that special agents will work to correct issues with gun retailers who commit violations that “are the result of inadvertence or administrative mistakes.” This includes intentional violations of gun laws such as “Transferring a firearm to a prohibited person,” “Failing to conduct a required background check,” “Falsifying records, such as a firearms transaction form,” “Failing to respond to a trace request,” and “Refusing to permit ATF to conduct an inspection.”

Anecdotes and data, however, suggest that the premier gun regulation agency has initiated a sweeping crackdown on firearm dealers for reasons beyond the illicit activity outlined on its website.

“This new definition of ‘willful’ violates the plain language of the governing statute and puts all law-abiding licensees at risk of revocation for paperwork errors that do not pose a threat to public safety, nor result in prohibited possessors obtaining firearms,” the lawsuit states.

Record Number of Licenses Revoked

Instead of working with retailers to correct inadvertent paperwork blunders, the ATF began targeting gun sellers over clerical errors to match Biden’s “zero-tolerance” agenda.

As The Federalist documented in June of 2022, this policy adaptation resulted in a 500 percent increase in the number of federal firearm dealers who were forced out of business by the ATF over unintentional record book mistakes.

A coalition of 25 Republican representatives also took notice of the crackdown. Their June 29 letter pressing the ATF to answer for reports that agents “feel pressured to take actions against individual businesses that they do not feel are appropriate or are in the interest of public safety,” however, proved to be futile.

All of a sudden, law-abiding gun store owners all across the nation faced unprecedented suspensions for paperwork and transactions with legal firearm purchasers.

In New Jersey, a gun dealer with more than a decade of experience and no prior problems was shut down after the ATF found a handful of his customers marked “USA” as their county on form 4473, the federal firearms transaction record used to initiate a background check. The ATF also took issue with the fact that firearms were transferred to “three customers more than 30 days after they had signed the 4473.”

“To be clear, all the customers passed their background checks. None were prohibited persons, and the ATF never seized the firearms from the three customers,” The Truth About Guns reported. That didn’t stop the ATF from shutting down the store for good.

Similarly, a family gun store in Florida was suspended after the ATF claimed their accidental clerical errors fell under the Biden administration’s new definition of willful.

Shutting down gun retailers is a priority not only for the Biden administration. The corporate media have also been looking for excuses they can use to force Democrats’ hand on gun control.

One month prior to the introduction of Biden’s “zero tolerance” policy, USA Today partnered with anti-gun groups The Trace and Brady to release data they claimed shows the “ATF Routinely Lets Problem Gun Dealers Off Easy.”

Their intent, as clearly stated in the article, was to expose how “A single violation is enough to shutter a gun shop if ATF officials can prove that the store willfully broke federal regulations.”

Now that the ATF admits it revoked federal firearms licenses at a higher rate this year than in any year since 2006 and revoked the highest number of licenses since 2008, USA Today and The Trace are gloating.

“ATF crackdown on ‘rogue gun shops’ appears in new data,” an Oct. 5 story from USA Today and The Trace stated.

Cargill knows the Biden administration and media are allied against him, but he said he believes in this case and is willing to do whatever it takes to stand up for Americans’ Second Amendment rights.

“There’s always going to be some type of fallback or backlash or anything with anything that you do,” Cargill told The Federalist. “But the majority of U.S. Federal Firearms License dealers that are out here are mom-and-pop stores. We’re trying to do our best to provide a service to the public and to make sure we’re following federal guidelines.”

Big Banks Just Greenlit A Plan To Track Your Gun-Store Purchases,"Last month, gun control advocates hailed the creation and adoption of a new sales code targeted at identifying purchases made at U.S. gun stores. The code was promoted as a way to help banks and credit card companies identify and “recognize dangerous firearm purchasing trends,” thus improving public safety. It won’t.

If anything, this new system, which is susceptible to widespread abuse, could have dangerous consequences. Thankfully, Republican members of Congress are taking steps to resist its implementation.

Republican Sens. Bill Hagerty and Tom Cotton announced that they led a group of Senate Republicans in penning a letter to Amalgamated Bank President and CEO Priscilla Sims Brown “criticizing the bank’s manipulation of an international rules organization to force U.S. financial services firms to categorize gun purchases.” This is the latest move in the political back and forth that began when Amalgamated Bank, which self-describes as “America’s socially responsible bank” and donates thousands of dollars to Democrats and left-wing political groups, successfully petitioned for the creation of the new sales code.

The senators’ letter accuses the bank of “fully embrac[ing] an anti-firearms agenda” while forcing “radical and discriminatory policies on the entire financial system.” While the letter concerningly implies that Congress has some authority to legislate “fundamental rights,” the senators make their opposition to the bank’s actions very clear, promising congressional action: “You should consider this notice to retain all communications involving your role in ISO’s categorization scheme, and you should anticipate testifying before Congress in the near future.”

The ISO (International Organization for Standardization), is a non-governmental international organization that establishes various market standards, including codes for payment transactions, and set forth the new merchant category code (MCC) for credit and debit transactions at U.S. gun stores. The MCC applies to all transactions conducted with a merchant identified as a gun store. Previously, under this system, purchases made in gun stores would be identified as “general merchandise.” Breaking with this established tradition in favor of the newer regulations, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express stated they will adopt the code.

But what does this new merchant code really do? Despite what activists may claim, the MCC provides little (if any) insight into purchases made at gun stores.

The code does not target gun or ammo purchases; instead, it applies to all purchases at merchants marked as “gun stores.” Say you go to a gun store and only buy a T-shirt and a bag of coffee, those transactions will be marked as gun store purchases. There is no way of knowing from the code whether a gun or ammo was purchased. The data is essentially meaningless.

But let’s pretend for a minute that the code only applies to gun and ammo purchases, would it improve public safety? Certainly not. Proponents of the MCC have failed to identify any way that dangerous individuals’ buying patterns differ from those of peaceable individuals. Plenty of peaceable individuals collect guns and stash away ammo, which they would never use to harm innocent people while some individuals inflict violence on people and communities after purchasing a single firearm and a relatively small amount of ammo. There are no “trends” that make these behaviors identifiable.

There is no way to discern whether a person is peaceable or not from the amount of money they spend at a coded “gun store,” but gun control advocates insist there is and that is what makes the MCC dangerous.

Data can be dangerous in the wrong hands, and claiming data says something that it doesn’t can empower deceitful propagandists to spin whatever narrative they wish while claiming empirical support for their arguments. It can allow activist financial institutions to target nonviolent, law-abiding individuals simply because those individuals choose to spend their money at gun stores.

In other words, the danger here doesn’t necessarily come from the code change itself — which is mostly benign. Instead, it comes from how opportunists will seek to twist and use the data to say something that it doesn’t and to target peaceable people without cause. And it becomes even more dangerous if the government seeks to use that data to conduct investigations.

States such as California and New York are already all too happy to use and dig through your data to find some reason to deny you your natural self-defense rights. And we’ve already seen the ATF conduct “checks” on perfectly legal and ordinary gun purchases while the federal government seeks to impose mandatory law enforcement “follow-ups” on all failed firearm background checks.

We must remain vigilant against the push for privatized gun control. Just because financial institutions are free to set the terms for their services, doesn’t mean those policies aren’t potentially dangerous or susceptible to abuse. Any attempt to militate banks and credit card companies against gun purchases makes it more difficult for people to protect themselves and their families.

Even more importantly, we must ensure that the government is not empowered to use or rely on MCC purchase data. We cannot stand by while more states go the way of California and New York, freely probing, bending, and disclosing data as they see fit. Especially when activists will claim the MCC conveys information it doesn’t.

While the MCC itself may not be dangerous, the way that gun control advocates want to use it certainly is. And it remains to be seen how Congress will respond, should the Senate Republicans’ promise of congressional oversight come to bear.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/19/exclusive-texas-gun-dealer-sues-biden-for-shuttering-firearm-stores-over-paperwork-flukes/,2022-10-25
"At The Conceal Carry Expo, There's A New Kind Of Gun Owner","FORT WORTH, Texas — Nikkita Gordon was walking home after her shift at a Waffle House in Carrollton, Georgia when she realized a man who had been watching her inside the restaurant for several hours was now following her across the parking lot.

“He said, ‘I’m going to walk you home,’ and I said, ‘I’ve got nothing on me.’ All I had was a jacket,” Gordon told me, as she explained the design behind her patented gun holster and its ability to be sewn into the inner lining of any garment. Gordon had never held a firearm before her encounter with the Waffle House stranger who she would later find out was a registered sex offender. Now she’s the founder and CEO of Cute & Cocky Firearm Accessories and Apparel.

Nikkita Gordon is the CEO and founder of Cute & Cocky.

Gordon, 26, was just one of the countless women attending this weekend’s Conceal Carry and Home Defense Expo, hosted by the U.S. Concealed Carry Association (USCCA). The expo was not your stereotypical white, male gun show crowd, sprinkled with a handful of token vendors aimed at women. This time, it was the attendees, not the event organizers who seemed to be driving the diversity.

Moms walked around wearing baby carriers and breastfed infants while sitting in seminars. Grandmothers pushed strollers around the exhibit hall where rows of floor space were dedicated to belly bands, leggings, purses, and other products designed to help women conceal carry.

Keeping with their mission to train and educate, the USCCA expo featured a live-fire indoor range where attendees could try out new guns, as well as seminars and demonstrations offered throughout the weekend. Experts covered topics such as “Concealed Carry for Women,” “Intruder Awareness & Church Security Reality-Based Training,” and “Children’s Firearm Safety Fundamentals.”

If the Fort Worth Convention Center on a November Saturday is any indication, there’s a new kind of gun owner in America, and the gun industry is taking note.

According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, 2020’s record-breaking surge in new gun ownership was more than just a spike. An NSSF survey of gun retailers found that 40 percent of Americans making firearm purchases were buying one for the first time, and of those first-time buyers, 40 percent were women. Gun stores also found that 58 percent of firearm purchases were by black men and women, “the largest increase of any demographic group.”

Tim Schmidt, president and founder of USCCA, said his organization, which focuses on education, training, and self-defense insurance for gun owners, has seen USCCA membership align with this new demographic of gun owners.

“Five years ago in America, the gun owner was a white, conservative male. Now it’s all over the map, just like our country,” Schmidt told The Federalist.

Katie Pointer Baney, USCAA’s managing director of government affairs, said she attributes the shift to a “self-defense awakening.”

“Whether it’s Covid or civil unrest, I think the concept of self-reliance, the concept of personal responsibility is driving millions of new gun owners,” she said. “We have to welcome them in and show them that firearm ownership is for everyone, irrespective of suburban, urban, rural — it’s protecting yourself and your family.”

We’ve seen this movement in the data for two years, but now we are seeing it in real life: Women and black Americans are putting an end to white men and criminals cornering the market on guns.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/25/big-banks-and-credit-card-giants-just-greenlit-a-plan-to-track-your-gun-store-purchases/,2022-11-17
"To Stop Evils Like UVA Murders, Focus On Families Not Firearms","New details about the recent murder of three University of Virginia (UVA) football players by one of their former teammates are further distressing — including a witness statement that suspect Christopher Darnell Jones Jr. shot one of the players while he was sleeping. According to reports, UVA knew Jones had a gun conviction before the triple murder but never started a discipline process. My alma mater is reeling and canceled their last home game of the season. Yet the pundits of corporate media are laser-focused on one, predictable thing: gun control.

“Our dysfunctional relationship with guns rears its ugly head in Virginia,” was the title of The Washington Post’s Nov. 15 editorial. “It is important that the public not become inured to these tragedies. The nation has logged another gruesome episode in its dysfunctional relationship with guns,” declared the WaPo’s editorial board. The White House meanwhile called for a ban on so-called “assault weapons” (though the weapon seems to have been a handgun, not a modern sporting rifle of the kind smeared by the left as an “assault weapon”).

Some pundits sought not only to grind their axes over gun control but to repudiate conservative attempts to curb the teaching of radical sexual ideology to children. “After Deadly UVA Shooting, Republicans Are Really Worried About … the Pride Flag in Schools,” was the title of a Nov. 16 editorial in The New Republic. “While too many parents — and politicians pretending to care about parents — have been busy conjuring manufactured crises over school curriculum, their children have been in training,” wrote Washington Post columnist Petula Dvorak in a Nov. 14 editorial that demanded more gun control. “Kindergartners have been cosplaying their own slaughter as their parents focused on trying to ban books that said ‘gay.’”

Yet pundits are leaving out quite a few important parts of the story, ones that point to other, deeper crises in our American social fabric.

Broken Family, Absent Father

According to a separate WaPo report, accused shooter Jones spent his early years in Richmond public housing complexes, “where it was often too dangerous to play outside.” Jones was primarily raised by his mother, who was forced to work evenings. The boy was regularly responsible for feeding his three siblings, even walking to nearby grocery stores to buy ramen noodles or bologna.

When Jones was 5, his parents divorced and his father departed the scene, a loss the former UVA football player called “one of the most traumatic things that happened to me in my life.” A close friend of Jones who was his teammate in middle and high school told the Washington Post: “He grew up in an unfortunate situation with his dad not being in his life too much and his mom not being the best off financially.” As he entered middle school, Jones’ relationship with his mother deteriorated, and by 2016 he was living with his grandmother in Petersburg, Virginia.

A broken family, an absent father, a strained relationship even with his mother — this was the harrowing life of Darnell Jones. He was mocked by other schoolchildren and struggled with anger issues. “He was ambitious, but his anger simply got in the way,” said one of his mentors.

A Culture of Broken Families and Absent Fathers

Jones’ story is not unique in 2022 America. About 41 percent of children are born to unwed mothers in the United States today. Approximately 1 in 4 children (about 18.3 million) lives without a father in the home, which is the highest rate of children living in single-parent households of any nation in the world. These statistics are direr for black Americans: About 57.6 percent of black kids are living absent their biological fathers.

There is overwhelming evidence that children of divorced or separated parents are more likely to suffer all manner of adverse psychological, emotional, and social effects. They are 1.5 to 2 times more likely to live in poverty and engage in risky sexual behavior as they get older. They have a lower probability of completing high school, a 12 percent lower probability of college attendance, and an 11 percent lower probability of college completion. A 2017 study found that children living in intact, nuclear families are about half as likely as children in step, blended, or one-parent families to have a mental disorder or require psychological help.

Might any of this explain Jones’ alleged behavior in that UVA parking garage? According to Marripedia.org, “the rate of violent teenage crime corresponds with the number of families abandoned by fathers.” Moreover, “the type of aggression and hostility demonstrated by a future criminal often is foreshadowed in unusual aggressiveness as early as age five or six.” As the saying goes, hurt people hurt people. And in America, we have a lot of hurt young people.

We Have a Much Bigger Problem Here

The kinds of laws that gun control advocates are calling for in response to the UVA shooting would almost certainly have had no effect on whether three people were shot and killed in Charlottesville on Nov. 13. If Jones is the perpetrator, he likely committed the act with a Glock he purchased in July, not a long gun that would fall in the category of what gun control advocates call “assault rifles.”

Moreover, Jones had a prior conviction for illegally possessing a handgun, something UVA has admitted it failed to report to a student-run judiciary committee. In other words, there were laws and school regulations already in place regarding Jones’ misuse of guns.

Unsurprisingly, gun control advocates seem little interested in the fact that their suggested legislation would not have stopped this shooting. Indeed, they mock conservatives who are trying to take action to address the dire mental health crisis among youth. Meanwhile, the left promotes a culture that undermines family stability and mocks men and encourages their infantilization.

More gun laws wouldn’t have stopped the UVA shooting, but the evidence shows a culture that promotes stable families with invested fathers would significantly reduce gun violence (and a host of other negative social indicators) in this country.

Biden's Silence On Idaho Student Murders Speaks Volumes,"Two deadly tragedies are capturing national attention this week. Last Saturday, a man shot and killed five people and injured at least 25 at Club Q, a Colorado LGBT nightclub. One week before, four University of Idaho students were brutally stabbed to death by a still unknown murderer. Both killings were grotesque, traumatized their respective communities, and have garnered national headlines and mourning. Only one of these mass killings, however, was addressed by President Joe Biden.

“While no motive in this attack is yet clear, we know that the LGBTQI+ community has been subjected to horrific hate violence in recent years,” Biden said in a statement about last Saturday’s nightclub shooting. “We must drive out the inequities that contribute to violence against LGBTQI+ people. We cannot and must not tolerate hate.”

We now know that Biden and other Democrats jumped the gun by suggesting the shooting was the result of LGBT “hate.” On Tuesday, it was reported that the 22-year-old alleged nightclub shooter identifies as “non-binary” and uses the plural “they” and “them” pronouns, making him part of the LGBT coalition himself.

The president also used the shooting to promote his anti-Second Amendment agenda. “We must address the public health epidemic of gun violence in all of its forms,” Biden said. “Earlier this year, I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly three decades, in addition to taking other historic actions. But we must do more. We need to enact an assault weapons ban to get weapons of war off America’s streets.”

Perhaps Biden is ignoring the tragic deaths of four young college kids in Idaho because their murders did not involve a gun. Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Xana’s boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20, were brutally stabbed to death with what police are calling a Rambo-like knife.

The killings took place sometime after 3 a.m. while the students were sleeping in a home near the university campus. Mysteriously, two roommates and a dog who also lived in the house were spared by the killer. The murderer is still at large, and local authorities have not yet named a suspect, which is terrifying the local community.

The students are so disturbed by what happened that many left campus early for Thanksgiving break. The president of the university even announced that students and professors have the option to use remote learning for the remainder of the fall semester.

Since their deaths, heartbreaking old photos and TikTok videos have emerged of the young friends enjoying life and the college experience. The victims of this crime don’t check off any intersectional boxes. They were white college kids living in a flyover state. Their cause of death won’t help congressional Democrats push gun laws or score points with minorities or LGBT Americans. Publicly speaking about these murders and showing compassion for the victims and their families also won’t give them the benefit of blaming Republicans for somehow “inciting” violence.

The truth is, tragedy can and will strike no matter how many gun laws are passed. Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Yet every week countless, mostly black residents, are shot and killed. Just this morning a teen was murdered in the Windy City. Chicago is a leftist utopia, complete with a radical mayor, tough gun laws, and an attorney general who refuses to prosecute violent criminals, including murderers, in the name of equity, so the president and corporate media have no comment for the bloody streets of Chicago. It’s not politically advantageous.

If guns are illegal, a criminal will still find a way to get one, just as they do in Chicago, and those who can’t use a gun will use a knife or a car. There is evil in our fallen world, and there always will be. Placing a tragedy on the shoulders of a political opponent is ugly.

It is also gross for the president of the United States to make statements only about national tragedies that are politically useful to him. “I promise you this,” wrote Biden before taking office, “I will be a President for all Americans.”

If Biden were sincere, he would acknowledge the killings that occur every day in Chicago, and he would treat the deaths of the four young Idaho college students with the same compassion and urgency that he afforded those who died at Club Q in Colorado.

We Don’t Need Biden’s Permission To Own A ‘Semi-Automatic’ Gun,"Image Credit Wikipedia / Praiyachat

“The idea we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick,” Joe Biden argued on Thanksgiving. “It has no socially redeeming value. Zero. None. Not a single solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers.”

Need it really be pointed out that it is perfectly within our rights to purchase products devoid of all socially redemptive value? Certainly, it is not the state’s business to determine what we “need.” That said, semi-automatic weapons happen to have an obvious redeeming value and there is a strong rationale for owning them. Semi-auto weapons are easy to use, and their effectiveness and reliability bolster the ability of people to protect themselves, their families, their property, and their community from criminality and, should it descend into tyranny, the government. Gun bans are autocratic and unconstitutional, and, thankfully, also largely unfeasible.

It is difficult to pinpoint what percentage of the 400-plus million firearms in civilian hands today are semi-automatic. These weapons, which fire one cartridge with a single trigger squeeze while preparing the gun for the next shot, constitute a substantial percentage of new gun sales over the past few decades. Banning them would prevent homeowners and those who concealed-carry — not only some of the most law-abiding people in the country, but a growing contingent —without the weapon of choice. The actions of a small number of irrational criminal psychopaths should not corrode the rights of those citizens. Not to mention, corroding our rights would do nothing to stop the irrational criminal psychopaths.

Indeed, semi-autos meet every criterion of legality laid out in D.C. v. Heller, the decision that finally codified the clear historical and legal intention of the Second Amendment. Not only are semi-automatic weapons “in common use” by “law-abiding citizens,” they are not “unusual.” The first semi-automatic pistols hit the civilian marketplace in the 1890s.

Now, there is always the not-so-small chance that Biden has confused the real-world mechanical designation of “semi-automatic” with the political concoction of “assault weapons.” I’m skeptical. Anyone who’s involved in the gun debate knows that “semi-automatic” guns, often purposely conflated with the more dangerous “automatic” weapons, are the target of restrictionists. A few years back during that shameful post-Parkland CNN gun “town hall,” the crowd loudly cheered at the suggestion of banning all “semi-automatic” rifles. And, earlier this year, the president suggested that ordinary citizens should be banned from owning popular “high-caliber” 9mm handguns. “So the idea of these high-caliber weapons is of — there’s simply no rational basis for it in terms of thinking about self-protection, hunting,” Biden said of the type of gun used by the Secret Service to protect him.

It is, as it always has been in the gun debate, incrementalism. From “no one wants to take your guns” to “we only want to take some of them” and so on. Of course, even if the president really intended to talk about a semi-automatic rifle ban, his goals would still be unconstitutional. Again, the gun meets every standard set by Heller for legality. And if the Senate somehow musters the 60 votes to push through the ban on certain semi-automatic guns recently passed by the House, states should challenge the federal government, and, if need be, ignore it.

Biden, who often imparts dreadful, sometimes illegal, advice on gun ownership, also has a long history of saying completely inane, insane, and historically illiterate things about firearms —whether cringingly noting that deer don’t wear “Kevlar” or claiming cannons were banned during the Revolutionary era as a way to argue that the Second Amendment “like all other rights, is not absolute.”

On the latter, Biden often (fittingly) cites one of the most egregious violations of the First Amendment, Schenck v. United States, which allowed the Woodrow Wilson administration to throw socialists into prison for speech crimes, to make his point. And perhaps that speaks to the crucial distinction at the heart of so many of our debates. Biden, and thus the contemporary left, seems to be under the impression that it’s the state that “allows” us to buy semi-automatic firearms or “allows” us to say certain things. But we don’t need their permission.

"Save Your Family From Dems' Homicidal Hellholes, Buy A Gun","President Joe Biden told reporters over Thanksgiving that he can’t think of “a single solitary rationale” for why Americans might want to purchase a semi-automatic gun.

“The idea we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick,” Biden said last week. “It has no socially redeeming value. Zero. None. Not a single solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers.”

BIDEN: ""The idea we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick!"" pic.twitter.com/3Q7zH4GJPj — Breaking911 (@Breaking911) November 24, 2022

I can think of at least one redeeming reason to keep semi-automatic firearms on the shelves. A gun could save you and your family’s lives from the crime wave that is quickly overtaking some of the nation’s most beloved cities.

Simply put, the U.S. is in the midst of a crime crisis.

Even corrupt corporate media outlets such as The Washington Post, which taunted Republicans for trying to turn the nation’s attention to violence in Democrat cities ahead of the midterms and ran articles claiming “violent crime is not soaring,” now readily admit that crime is transforming American cities into hurting, homicide-plagued hellholes.

The solution? Ideally, punishing and locking up criminals instead of letting offenders off the hook in the name of “equity.”

But just as gun control is ineffective against someone who has no problems breaking laws, harsh crackdowns — which are pivotal in combatting crime — won’t stop evil.

That’s why Americans, especially in crime-prone urban hubs run by soft-on-crime Democrats, should equip themselves with guns for self-defense.

A Gallup poll recently found that 46 percent of Americans have at least one gun in their household, and 33 percent say they personally own the firearm.

That’s the highest personal gun ownership recorded since 2011. That new decade-high is no surprise considering how gun and ammunition sales skyrocketed during the 2020 lockdowns and summer of rage riots.

What is surprising, after three years of tyrannical rule by the same bureaucrats and politicians who deliberately refuse to punish criminals, is that the number is not higher.

Cities and counties run by Democrat mayors and district attorneys are almost exclusively responsible for the murder rates in the nation’s top 10 most homicidal states. In 2021 alone, at least 14 Democrat-controlled urban hubs reported all-time high homicides.

Yet, Gallup reports that Republicans’ personal gun ownership (48 percent) outpaces Democrats’ firearm ownership (20 percent) by more than double. The gap increases even more significantly when you examine households; 66 percent of Republicans said they live in a household with a firearm, versus just 31 percent of Democrats.

Overall, it’s Americans in rural areas and Southerners who are most likely to own a gun or keep one in their house, not the people in the cities and counties often known for violence.

Proper use of a firearm in a situation where you are threatened can save your life, your limbs, and your property. It’s estimated that the legal use of firearms helps thwart an estimated 2.5 million crimes a year. That means, on average, the proper use of guns foils nearly 7,000 crimes a day.

Even when they aren’t in use, firearms can act as a deterrent for anyone who wishes you, your family, or your community ill.

[READ: After You Buy A Gun For Self-Defense, Here’s What To Do With It]

Democrats are busy defunding the police and rallying their colleagues to try to pass legislation that restricts Americans’ Second Amendment rights (something 9 percent fewer voters support now than in June). Meanwhile, innocent Americans, especially those in blue areas, are suffering.

The answer to this suffering isn’t more gun control, which Gallup says fewer Americans support now than even earlier this year. It’s getting more guns into the hands of law-abiding citizens who can no longer trust their representatives to keep them and their cities’ streets safe.

Don’t let Biden’s finger-wagging keep you from protecting your family from the consequences of Democrats’ soft-on-crime agenda. Buy a gun, learn how to use it properly, and join the millions of other Americans who know that the Second Amendment was included in the Constitution for a good reason.

8 Times Our Federal Government Ran A Protect-Biden Racket,"For years, our federal government has quietly operated a protect-Biden racket. The public, however, has only recently — and haphazardly — learned of the lengths federal law enforcement officials and government employees have gone to safeguard the Biden family secrets. Here are eight times our government squelched scandals.

1. Censoring the Hunter Biden Laptop Story

The most recent and most well-known example of the feds protecting the Biden family stems from efforts by intelligence agencies to squelch news coverage of the New York Post’s reporting that Hunter Biden “introduced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm less than a year before the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company.” The Post discovered that detail, and many more implicating Joe Biden in a pay-to-play scandal, in a cache of emails and text messages recovered from a laptop Hunter had abandoned at a Delaware computer repair store.

Before the New York Post broke the story on Oct. 14, 2022, about Joe Biden’s knowledge of and potential involvement in his son’s business dealings, the FBI warned Facebook that it “should be on high alert.” “[W]e thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election,” the FBI said, adding that “we have it on notice that basically there’s about to be some kind of dump similar to that so just be vigilant.”

Based on that warning, Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg explained that “when the New York Post broke the Hunter Biden laptop story on Oct. 14, 2020, Facebook treated the story as potentially misinformation, important misinformation for five to seven days while the tech giant’s team could determine whether it was false.”

Federal law enforcement agencies likewise warned Twitter in the lead-up to the 2020 general election “that they expected ‘hack-and-leak operations’ by state actors might occur in the period shortly before the 2020 presidential election, likely in October.” Twitter’s then-head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, further acknowledged that in meetings with federal law enforcement agencies, he learned “that there were rumors that a hack-and-leak operation would involve Hunter Biden.” According to a letter Twitter’s lawyer sent to the Federal Election Commission, the tech giant explained it was “the prior warnings of a hack-and-leak operation and doubts about the provenance of the materials republished in the N.Y. Post articles,” that led its Site Integrity Team to preliminarily determine “the materials could have been obtained through hacking.”

Of course, the Hunter Biden laptop was not part of a “hack-and-leak operation,” and it wasn’t “Russian propaganda” or “important misinformation” — and the FBI knew that fact because it had seized the laptop from the computer repair store nearly a year earlier, in December of 2019. But the FBI nonetheless deceived the tech giants to induce them to censor the pay-to-play scandal that likely would have cost Joe Biden the election.

2. Quietly Seizing Hunter’s Laptop from Repair Shop

While it was the FBI’s lies that prompted the tech giants to censor the New York Post’s coverage of the Biden family pay-to-play scandal, the bureau’s efforts to protect the Biden family from the damning material contained on the laptop may have also included the FBI’s seizure of the laptop from the repair store owner, John Paul Mac Isaac. Had Mac Isaac not made a copy of the hard drive before the FBI seized Hunter’s laptop in December 2019, the FBI could have kept the entire story quiet. One can’t help but wonder if the bureau’s true motivation in seizing the laptop was to protect the Biden family.

A comment by one of the agents who seized the computer suggests just such a motive. When Mac Isaac joked with the agents who seized the laptop that he’d remember to change their names when he wrote a book about the incident, according to the repair store owner, one of the agents rejoined: “It is our experience that nothing ever happens to people that don’t talk about these things.”

3. Seizing and Returning Hunter’s Second Laptop

Another Biden-clean-up mission may have taken place two months later when, in February 2020, the Drug Enforcement Administration raided the office of Hunter Biden’s former psychiatrist, Keith Ablow. In executing the search warrant, the DEA seized from Ablow’s safe a second laptop that belonged to Hunter. Even though Hunter was under investigation at the time, the government returned the laptop to his lawyer.

At the time of the DEA search, no mention was made of the Hunter Biden laptop. Instead, the limited public coverage of the raid consisted of reports that the DEA claimed the execution of the search warrant was part of an “ongoing investigation” and references to Ablow’s medical license being recovered in May of 2019 for alleged “inappropriate sexual activity with patients and illegally giving prescriptions to employees.”

That the DEA waited nine months before searching Ablow’s office for evidence and that the government never charged Ablow for any crimes seems rather suspect, especially given the raid only followed the FBI’s seizure of Hunter Biden’s first laptop. But even if there were nothing nefarious about the raid, returning the laptop, while Hunter Biden remained under federal investigation, fits the pattern of the feds protecting the Biden family.

4. Downplaying or Ignoring Intelligence Threats to Provide Plausible Deniability

The Delaware laptop contained hordes of compromising information on both Hunter Biden and his father. Beyond that scandalous material, the laptop also included another significant revelation: that Hunter Biden believed the Russians had stolen another laptop that contained material ripe for blackmailing the Biden family.

As The Federalist reported exclusively in August of 2021, a lawyer for Mac Isaac confirmed the laptop Hunter had abandoned at the Delaware repair shop contained a video in which the Biden son recounted the story of his stolen laptop. In the video, Hunter spoke of how he almost overdosed during the summer of 2018 while partying in Las Vegas with his drug dealer and two other guys. Also present “was this Russian 35-year-old, really nice, pure brunette,” Hunter explained. Soon after coming to, Hunter discovered his laptop was missing.

“I think he’s the one that stole my computer,” Hunter is heard on the tape explaining. “I think the three of them, the three guys that were like a little group. The dealer and his two guys, I took them everywhere,” Hunter explained. “They have videos of me doing this. They have videos of me doing crazy f-cking sex, f-cking, you know,” Hunter added. “My computer, I had taken tons of like, just left like that cam on,” Hunter continued, “and somebody stole it during that period of time.”

When asked whether he worried the Russian thieves would try to “blackmail” him, Hunter said, “Yeah, in some way, yeah,” noting his father is “running for president,” and that “I talk about it all the time.”

It is difficult to overstate the national security risk that would exist if the Russians had possession of a laptop filled with not just personal information about Hunter Biden, but communications implicating his father in a pay-to-play scandal. And the FBI, had it properly processed the laptop upon subpoenaing it from Mac Isaac, would have known of that risk and, at a minimum, provided Joe Biden a defensive briefing.

However, according to whistleblowers, under the auspices of not interfering with the 2020 election, FBI leaders told employees, “You will not look at that Hunter Biden laptop.” The whistleblowers further claimed that “the FBI did not begin to examine the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop until after the 2020 presidential election.”

If true, to protect Joe Biden from any fallout flowing from the laptop, the FBI failed to properly assess the national security risks posed by the details on the laptop.

The FBI’s see-nothing approach also provided Joe Biden plausible deniability, such that he could claim the laptop represented Russian disinformation. In fact, at his last presidential debate, when President Donald Trump said, so the “laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?” Biden responded: “That’s exactly what [I] was told.”

While the intelligence community should have been providing Biden a defensive briefing on the laptop, it instead appears to have opted to protect the Democrat candidate by ignoring the national security risk.

5. Running Sham Investigations and Burying Information

The FBI did more than delay the investigation into the laptop, however, according to whistleblowers who claimed that “agents opened a sham investigation into Hunter Biden to brand reliable and verifiable derogatory evidence as ‘disinformation.’”

According to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, “multiple FBI whistleblowers, including those in senior positions,” raised “the alarm about tampering by senior FBI and Justice Department officials in politically sensitive investigations,” including “investigative activity involving derogatory information on Hunter Biden’s financial and foreign business activities.” Grassley alleged that the whistleblowers claimed Washington Field Office Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy “Thibault and other FBI officials sought to falsely portray as disinformation evidence acquired from multiple sources that provided the FBI derogatory information related to Hunter Biden’s financial and foreign business activities, even though some of that information had already been or could be verified.”

A news release issued by Grassley’s officer further claimed that “in August of 2020, FBI supervisory intelligence analyst Brian Auten opened an assessment, which was used by a team of agents at FBI headquarters to improperly discredit and falsely claim that derogatory information about Biden’s activities was disinformation, causing investigative activity and sourcing to be shut down.” “The FBI headquarters team allegedly placed their assessment findings in a restricted access subfolder, effectively flagging sources and derogatory evidence related to Hunter Biden as disinformation while shielding the justification for such findings from scrutiny,” according to Grassley.

The whistleblowers’ charges, if accurate, indicate that the FBI went to great lengths to protect Hunter Biden, and by extension his father, at a time Hunter was reportedly already under investigation by the Delaware U.S. Attorney’s Office.

6. Stepping Up When Hunter’s Gun Goes Missing

In October of 2018, Hunter Biden purchased a gun, completing a “Firearms Transaction Record” that shows him responding “no” to a question on the form that asked, “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?” Notwithstanding Hunter’s very public and long-standing addiction to drugs, no charges were ever filed against the president’s son.

Beyond the government apparently looking the other way over Hunter Biden’s seeming false statement, the gun and that form feature heavily in another example of the deep-state clean-up crew.

According to Politico, on Oct. 23, 2018, Hallie Biden, Hunter’s sister-in-law-turned-lover, removed “Hunter’s gun and threw it in a trash can behind a grocery store, only to return later to find it gone.” After the manager of the grocery store called police, who launched an investigation, “a curious thing happened,” as Politico put it: “Secret Service agents approached the owner of the store where Hunter bought the gun and asked to take the paperwork involving the sale…”

“The gun store owner refused to supply the paperwork, suspecting that the Secret Service officers wanted to hide Hunter’s ownership of the missing gun in case it were to be involved in a crime,” Politico’s sources said. The store owner later provided a copy of the paper to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.

While the Secret Service claims it has no record of any involvement of its agents, this story suggests agents again worked to protect the Biden family.

7. Stepping In When Ashley Biden’s Diary Shows Up

While the investigation into Hunter’s missing gun and the potentially fraudulent representation he made on the Firearm Transaction Record ended without charges, the Department of Justice brought federal charges against two individuals who attempted to sell a diary reportedly belonging to Ashley Biden. And not only did the government come down heavy on those individuals, but the FBI also raided the home and office of Project Veritas founder James O’Keefe.

According to O’Keefe, “the diary was allegedly abandoned in a room that [Ashley Biden] had stayed at” and the two individuals who discovered the diary approached Project Veritas and other media outlets to sell the book. “Project Veritas gave the diary to law enforcement to ensure it could be returned to its rightful owner. We never published it,” O’Keefe said. “Now, Ms. Biden’s father’s Department of Justice, specifically the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, appears to be investigating the situation, claiming the diary was stolen. We don’t know if it was but it begs the question: In what world is the alleged theft of a diary investigated by the President’s FBI and his Department of Justice? A diary?” O’Keefe asked.

In addition to raiding O’Keefe’s home, the Biden administration’s DOJ obtained “secret warrants, orders, and a subpoena,” over the course of 16 months, to maintain “‘unchecked’ and ‘unfettered’ access to the emails and contacts of Founder and CEO James O’Keefe and seven other staff members.” Project Veritas maintains the government targeted him and his fellow journalists because of their “news-gathering activities surrounding allegations against then-candidate, Joe Biden, made by his daughter, Ashley Biden, in her diary.”

If true, it is yet another example of the men in black protecting the Bidens.

8. Keeping the Ducks in a Row and Quiet

Attorney General Merrick Garland represents the final and biggest protector of the Biden family, with the investigation into Hunter Biden continuing under the oversight of the Biden administration’s Department of Justice. Similarly, the DOJ, through the Western District of Pennsylvania’s U.S. Attorney’s Office, “is still overseeing the criminal investigation into the bankrupt health care business from which James Biden allegedly siphoned hundreds of thousands of dollars to finance repairs to his beach house.”

Notwithstanding the clear conflicts of interest, Garland has ignored calls by congressional leaders to appoint a special counsel to investigate the financial dealings of the Biden family. Instead, Garland appointed Jack Smith as a special counsel to investigate Trump.

Apparently, the only thing as strong as the get-Trump attitude of the deep state is the protect-the-Bidens stance of the federal government.

Court To ATF: Bump Stocks Aren't Machine Guns,"The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) lacked the authority to declare non-mechanical bump stocks “machineguns,” the full Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held on Friday.

The decision, Cargill v. Garland, is the latest example of the courts foiling attempts by the federal bureaucracy to exercise the legislative power the Constitution vests with Congress, but until the Supreme Court’s separation of powers jurisprudence catches up with the runaway administrative state, the Cargill victory holds limited import.

On Oct. 1, 2017, a gunman murdered more than 50 innocent people in Las Vegas, injuring another 500. The murderer used several weapons, many of which had bump stocks attached. A bump stock, as the court in Cargill explained, “is a firearm attachment that allows a shooter to harness the natural recoil of a semi-automatic weapon to quickly re-engage the trigger after firing, enabling him to shoot at an increased rate of speed.”

Less than two weeks after the Las Vegas massacre, two bills prohibiting bump-stock devices were proposed in Congress. But before Congress could act on the legislation, the ATF published notice of proposed rulemaking, stating the ATF intended “to reverse its previous interpretation that non-mechanical bump stocks are not machineguns for purposes of the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act.”

The National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act make it a crime to “transfer or possess a machinegun,” and define a “machinegun” to mean “any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.” The definition also includes any part intended for use “in converting a weapon into a machinegun…”

Bump stocks were first invented in the early 2000s. Soon after, the ATF concluded that mechanical bump stocks qualify as machine guns under the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act, but that non-mechanical bump stocks, which required the shooter to “apply constant forward pressure with the non-shooting hand and constant rearward pressure with the shooting hand,” were not illegal machine guns. But following the Las Vegas shooting, the ATF purported to modify the definition of machine gun and stated that the statutory term “machinegun” “includes bump-stock-type devices.”

After the ATF published its final rule redefining machine guns in 2018, Michael Cargill, who had lawfully acquired two non-mechanical bump stocks, surrendered them to the ATF and then filed suit against the ATF. In his lawsuit, Cargill argued the ATF lacked authority “to promulgate the Final Rule because its interpretation of machinegun conflicts with the unambiguous statutory definition.” Among other arguments, Cargill also asserted that by defining a non-mechanical bump stock as “machinegun,” the ATF unconstitutionally exercised Congress’s legislative power.

A federal court rejected Cargill’s claims following a one-day trial. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal held the ATF properly classified non-mechanical bump stocks as “machineguns.” Cargill then sought review by the full court of appeals and, on Friday, the majority of the 16 members of the en banc Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding the federal statutory definition of machine guns “unambiguously fails to cover non-mechanical bump stocks,” and that to criminalize such bump stocks, Congress must act legislatively.

In striking the ATF’s rule that non-mechanical bump stocks qualified as “machineguns,” the Fifth Circuit focused on the statutory language Congress used in the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act to define “machinegun” and the mode of operation of a non-mechanical bump stock. Specifically, the court stressed that to qualify as a machine gun under the statute, the weapon must shoot automatically more than one shot “by a single function of the trigger.” But because a semiautomatic rifle equipped with a non-mechanical bump stock only fires one shot each time the trigger functions, the Fifth Circuit concluded it did not qualify under the statute as a machine gun.

Because the ATF’s redefinition of “machinegun” conflicted with Congress’s statutory definition of that term, the Fifth Circuit’s en banc decision held it need not decide whether the ATF’s rule was “an exercise of legislative power, in violation of the Constitution’s vesting of all such power in Congress. U.S. Const. art. I, § 1.” That the federal appellate court in Cargill sidestepped the separation of powers question, renders the decision of limited value, and does little to limit the constitutionally ungirded authority of the administrative state.

Nonetheless, the Cargill decision provides a small check on the ATF and its attempt to legislate by regulation and tees up this narrow issue for the Supreme Court, as three other federal circuit courts of appeal had previously upheld the ATF’s bump-stock rule. But it could be some time before the high court delves into this issue because the Fifth Circuit left the question of an appropriate remedy to the lower court. Accordingly, until the lower court enters an injunction or otherwise declares the ATF’s bump stock rule invalid, review by the Supreme Court is unlikely.

Even then, the issue may never make it to the Supreme Court if Congress acts to criminalize the possession or use of bump stocks. While that would be a defeat to Cargill and others who seek to possess bump stocks — absent a ruling that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to bump-stock devices, something unlikely — it would be a victory for the constitutional separation of powers that granted Congress, not unelected bureaucrats, the power to pass laws.

But until the Supreme Court provides a more fulsome check on the federal agencies ruling our lives by fiat, the Cargill decision and its aftermath will represent but a flash of a reminder of how far our constitutional order has fallen.

How Hollywood Uses TV To Lie About Good Guys With Guns,"When an alleged armed robber barged into Ranchito #4 Taqueria on Jan. 4, almost every customer froze with fear. But one good Samaritan, an unnamed 46-year-old man, quickly jumped into action to protect himself and his fellow patrons. He used a concealed gun to shoot the alleged perpetrator and returned the stolen cash to the terrified patrons, only later to discover that the firearm the alleged robber used was a fake.

Despite the customer’s heroic actions, he has received nothing but condemnation from corporate media after the alleged thief was declared dead on the scene. Unfortunately, this media treatment is nothing new. Over the past few years, only a few good Samaritans have received any press despite the overwhelming number of these brave individuals jumping into action.

In December, for example, a man stopped an active shooter at an Amazon warehouse parking lot in the Phoenix, Arizona area. The police called the man a “good Samaritan” and credit him with likely preventing further bloodshed. In another case later that month, an active shooter at a Tucson, Arizona bar threatened many people but was “stopped short by a heroic customer with a gun.”

You may not hear about many of these stories outside of local media accounts, but they occur all the time. There are dozens of cases in recent years in which concealed handgun permitholders stopped what, according to police, would have otherwise become mass public shootings.

These good Samaritans saving the day would make gripping stories, but we don’t see much news on these cases. National entertainment television also fails to reveal the truth about these good Samaritans: For decades, ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox have refused to feature even a single successful defensive gun use by a civilian. You would never know Americans successfully use guns defensively on average approximately 2 million times a year, or that they use guns four to five times more frequently to stop crime than to commit it.

Entertainment programs always show defensive gun uses going wrong (the sole exception in the last decade is Paramount’s “Yellowstone”). Typically the citizen fails to defend himself and ends up murdered, accidentally shoots a loved one, or poses a danger to himself and the police. After the Supreme Court decision this past June striking down New York’s restrictions on concealed handguns, television shows have begun to demonize concealed-carry permits.

Here are just a few examples from the 2022-23 television season so far:

ABC’s “The Rookie,” Jan. 3, 2023: Against the adamant advice of a police officer, a legally armed civilian intervenes in a bank robbery. Despite his good intentions, he only succeeds in getting himself and another civilian shot. To make matters worse, the armed civilian’s intervention allows the bank robbers to escape. “Leave it to a good guy with a gun to really screw things up,” remarks the police officer. About 4.5 million viewers saw that episode.

CBS’s “FBI: Most Wanted,” Nov. 22, 2022: After a criminal bashes a person’s head with a rock in Central Park, a good Samaritan chases the criminal. The criminal shoots at the permit holder, who shoots back but misses and ends up severely wounding a female bystander. The FBI agent characterizes the permit holder as a “vigilante.” When the permit holder tells an FBI agent the police need to do their job, the agent grabs the permit holder and exclaims: “We are, but it only gets harder with idiots like you playing cops and robbers!” More than 5.1 million people watched this episode.

NBC’s “Law & Order,” Nov. 6, 2022: In this episode, a woman pulls her permitted concealed handgun out and mistakenly threatens to shoot two people who were police officers. The police almost end up shooting her in self-defense, proceeding to arrest her “for pulling a gun on a cop.” They explain that despite her permit, she doesn’t know the rules for carrying guns and that she is “lucky to be alive.” About 4 million people saw this show.

CBS’s “Blue Bloods,” Oct. 28, 2022: When robbers try to take a woman’s $20,000 watch, she pulls out her permitted concealed handgun to protect herself. As a result, she is severely wounded by the robbers. Others who were robbed of their watches by the same criminals didn’t have guns and weren’t harmed. “Got the gun for protection … so much for that,” says the victim. Almost 5.8 million people viewed this show.

NBC’s “Chicago PD,” Oct. 5, 2022: At first, it appears a civilian has successfully defended himself against a robbery. Later, it becomes clear that the “good Samaritan” was actually the lookout who had turned on his robbery crew. Just shy of 6 million people saw this.

CBS’s “FBI: Most Wanted,” Sept. 20, 2022: This episode has two different examples of defensive gun uses failing. In the first, a family is murdered before the father is able to get off a shot. “So much for a good guy with a gun,” an FBI agent remarks dismissively. About 5.3 million people saw this episode.

Many other episodes display failed defensive gun uses, and these are just the ones involving people legally carrying outside their homes. None of this should be too surprising, as it is well-known that gun control groups are working with Hollywood writers and producers to introduce gun control themes into shows.

My organization, the Crime Prevention Research Center, has found a total of 360 active-shooter incidents from 2014 to 2021. Of these, an armed citizen stopped 124 (more than one-third). We are more confident of the completeness of our data in the most recent years, and 49 percent of active shooting cases in 2021 were stopped by armed civilians. When we exclude shootings in gun-free zones, the figure rises to 58 percent.

In not one of these 124 defensive gun uses did a permit holder accidentally shoot a bystander. Not once did a permit holder get in the way of the police. But anyone who watches entertainment television would have no clue that this is the case.

People can’t escape the political bias in television entertainment. The message from these shows is clear: Don’t use guns for protection. If you do, it will cause much more harm than benefit. It is bad enough that news programs provide just one side of this debate. But the bias has a real effect on the gun control debate and prevents Americans from doing what keeps them safe.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/09/court-to-atf-gun-grabbers-bump-stocks-arent-machine-guns-and-you-dont-make-the-rules/,2023-01-19
"Alec Baldwin Baffled That He, Not Gun, Faces Charges In Shooting","Image Credit ABC News/YouTube

District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies announced plans on Thursday to charge actor and anti-gun activist Alec Baldwin with two counts of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western movie “Rust.” Baldwin is responsible for pointing the gun at Hutchins and failing to make sure the gun and supposedly dummy ammunition were properly checked, according to prosecutors.

Despite his blatant disregard for gun safety, Baldwin is bewildered punishment has been levied against him, with his attorney claiming the charges are a “terrible miscarriage of justice.” As an anti-Second Amendment activist who has a habit of demonizing the gun in criminal shootings instead of the person pulling the trigger, Baldwin is probably perplexed that he, not the weapon itself, is being slapped with criminal charges.

According to Baldwin, everyone and everything are to blame for the shooting, except himself. To skirt responsibility, Baldwin has insisted that staff told him the weapon was unloaded and even that he did not pull the trigger (a claim the FBI forensic report stated is implausible). Yet even if Baldwin’s gun had fired without him pulling the trigger, Baldwin would still be at fault for failing to follow safety protocol.

As John R. Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, writes, “The first rule of gun safety is you don’t point a gun at something unless you intend to shoot it. Even if you believe the gun is unloaded, you don’t point it directly at others.” Baldwin failed to follow the first rule when he carelessly pointed his gun at Hutchins.

“The idea that the person holding the gun and causing it to discharge is not responsible is absurd,” said Halyna’s husband, Matt Hutchins, in an interview with Today. As absurd as it might seem, though, that’s exactly what Baldwin and other anti-gun activists want us to believe.

Baldwin has been heavily critical of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other pro-Second Amendment groups. In 2018, he joined a swath of other Hollywood elites in a “No Rifle Association Initiative,” which sought to reduce the NRA’s influence. Baldwin got into a Twitter spat with former NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch that same year, tweeting that Loesch “doesn’t care how many dead bodies she has to step over in [her] pursuit” of defending the Second Amendment, adding that the Second Amendment needs to be “rethought.”

Baldwin and the other anti-Second Amendment activists apparently missed philosophy 101. Inanimate objects, like firearms, are not intrinsically evil. The actions of a gun-wielder, however, can be.

Take for example last July, when three people were killed and two others were injured when a gunman opened fire at a mall in Greenwood, Indiana. Another man that day also fired a gun: a legally armed 22-year-old who was at the mall during the shooting and killed the assailant. Both men fired guns, but one took the lives of three innocent people, while the other heroically saved more bystanders from harm by neutralizing an active threat.

Baldwin did not intentionally kill Hutchins, but he is responsible for his negligence. His disregard for gun safety could be compared to a distracted driver accidentally hitting and killing a pedestrian. The driver did not mean to hit the person, but his irresponsible decisions resulted in death, leaving him to bear some level of culpability.

Baldwin’s apparent guilt, rooted in his own actions, is consistent with foundational principles of natural law. As St. Thomas Aquinas writes in the Summa Theologica, “if a man … be occupied with something unlawful, or even with something lawful, but without due care, he does not escape being guilty of murder, if his action results in someone’s death.”

Ultimately, Baldwin’s failure to take personal responsibility is emblematic of the entire anti-Second Amendment movement. The unconstitutional gun “reforms” (i.e., bans) that Baldwin and other anti-gun activists advocate for lay blame for gun-related homicides on the firearms, not the shooters. Such an approach treats the symptom, not the disease — and makes as much logical sense as Baldwin trying to duck the blame for his own actions.

Baldwin Lost Credible Defense When He Broke #1 Gun Safety Rule,"Image Credit Sky News/YouTube

News broke Thursday that prosecutors will charge actor Alec Baldwin with two counts of involuntary manslaughter over the shooting of “Rust” cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, 42. In New Mexico where the incident occurred, each count carries a maximum sentence of 18 months in prison, but prosecutors have added a firearm enhancement that mandates five years behind bars.

It is hard to see how Baldwin couldn’t have been charged with at least involuntary manslaughter. The first rule of gun safety is you don’t point a gun a something unless you intend to shoot it. Even if you believe the gun is unloaded, you don’t point it directly at others.

Baldwin didn’t follow basic gun safety when he shot his cinematographer, Hutchins. Anyone who has been to a shooting range would have that drilled into them. And Baldwin, an actor for 40 years, who has been in many movies using guns, must surely have had this explained to him many times.

Indeed, the Actors Equity Association, the union to which Baldwin belongs, clearly states the rules for firearms use on its website:

“Treat all guns as if they are loaded and deadly.” “Never point a firearm at anyone including yourself. Always cheat the shot by aiming to the right or left of the target character.” “Check the firearm every time you take possession of it.” “Live ammunition may not be brought into the theatre.”

Baldwin’s repeated claim that he never pulled the gun trigger is not credible, as an FBI forensic report released in August concluded the firearm couldn’t have gone off unless someone pulled the trigger. But even if it were credible, it would be irrelevant anyway because he violated that first rule of gun safety. If he hadn’t pointed his gun at her, it wouldn’t have mattered if he had pulled the trigger.

Baldwin has made numerous attempts to protect himself from criminal charges by blaming others. For example, even if a staffer notified Baldwin that the gun was unloaded, the first rule of gun safety ultimately makes the accident Baldwin’s responsibility.

As Matt Hutchins, Halyna’s husband, told NBC’s Hoda Kotb in an interview, “The idea that the person holding the gun and causing it to discharge is not responsible is absurd.”

As the executive producer for “Rust,” and being on-site, Baldwin may also bear responsibility for two prior accidental gun discharges on the set. He was responsible for the crew. He hired a young novice armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, who doubted her competency. Presumably, this decision saved the production some money, but at the risk that something might go wrong.

There is no doubt Baldwin is genuinely sorry about this tragedy. Indeed, as news reports indicate, he was undoubtedly “inconsolable,” but that doesn’t help him either. If you drive a car recklessly and kill someone, you are still liable for negligent manslaughter. The fact that you deeply regret the accident is entirely irrelevant. If they had only observed the proper caution, to begin with, the death would have been avoidable.

For involuntary manslaughter, the prosecution has to show that Baldwin engaged in a lawful but dangerous act and did not act with due caution. A classic example of involuntary manslaughter would be someone shooting a gun into the air while in a crowded place, and a stray bullet accidentally killing a person. The person wasn’t even aiming the gun at someone, but they are still responsible. These actions are reckless, negligent, and criminal but lack intent.

Baldwin had the ultimate responsibility for Hutchins’ death. He handled the gun and pointed it at her. As a result, he will likely go to jail for years.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/20/alec-baldwin-baffled-that-he-not-the-gun-will-be-charged-with-manslaughter/,2023-01-20
"Alec Baldwin's Criminal Charges Driven By Legal Facts, Arrogance","Alec Baldwin does not know Proverbs 16: “Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”

The movie star allegedly shot and killed his cinematographer, and then pridefully declared in TV interviews that he will never be criminally charged. Baldwin, who was both the lead actor and producer for the movie “Rust,” haughtily blamed his employees for not checking if his gun was loaded with live ammunition. He blamed the victim, Halyna Hutchins, for telling him to point the gun at her. He told the sheriff he never pulled the trigger, but FBI forensics proved that was a lie.

Baldwin’s fall came on Thursday when the Santa Fe district attorney’s office announced he will be charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter. His destruction could be a jury conviction for the top felony charge, which would send him to jail for a five-year mandatory sentence.

“The fact that Baldwin went on an immediate public campaign to exonerate himself and went on ABC News and said he didn’t do anything wrong — that definitely factored into the prosecutor’s decision,” Dennis Postiglione, an Austin attorney who is suing Baldwin for defamation and other charges on behalf of a fallen Marine family, told me in an exclusive interview.

“Baldwin just killed someone he knew. And he did all of these interviews, didn’t cry, and thumbed his nose at the state — saying he would not be charged,” Postiglione said. “If that had been you or me, I think charges would have come a lot sooner.”

Postiglione said the movie star is entitled to due process and afforded the presumption of innocence, adding, “Baldwin is controversial and combative, but that doesn’t mean he’s automatically guilty.”

Baldwin’s lawyer Luke Nikas did not respond to a request for comment, but in a public statement said his client, “relied on the professionals with whom he worked, who assured him the gun did not have live rounds. We will fight these charges, and we will win.”

Baldwin is being charged both as an actor and a producer who was aware of reported safety concerns on the low-budget film, said New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies. “We are saying — here in New Mexico — that everyone is equal under the law,” she told CNN on Thursday.

The Scene of the Crime

On Oct. 21, 2021, Baldwin was rehearsing a scene in a small church in the desert. He allegedly yanked a .45 Colt single-action revolver out of the holster, cocked the hammer, pointed the gun at Hutchins, and pulled the trigger. The bullet from the real ammunition went into Hutchins, came out her back, and lodged in Director Joel Souza’s shoulder. Baldwin then reportedly walked out of the church. His crew stayed with Hutchins and spent 25 minutes desperately trying to save her from bleeding to death on the dusty floor.

Carmack-Altwies has not said how the six “live rounds” — out of the 500 pieces of dummy and blanks — got on the set. Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza’s detectives did not ask the FBI lab in Quantico to test the live rounds for fingerprints or DNA, according to a lawyer with knowledge of the process. The D.A. said she will release more details on the evidence after the charges are filed in court by the end of the month. In addition, Baldwin’s cell phone records for the day of the shooting have still not been made public.

Two of “the professionals” who worked for Baldwin were also charged. The movie’s armorer, Hannah Guiterrez-Reed, got the same charges as Baldwin. Assistant Director David Halls signed a plea agreement for the charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon and got a suspended sentence. Carmack-Altwies told the Santa Fe New Mexican that her deal with Halls requires him to testify against Baldwin and Guitterez-Reed. The D.A. refused to say if she will make additional plea deals.

Baldwin said in multiple media appearances that he has been trained on the gun safety rules for using real guns in movies for 40 years. Guiterrez-Reed, the armorer on set, allegedly asked to train Baldwin for the complex cross-draw maneuver (pulling a gun from a holster on the other side of your body) but was denied, according to the sheriff’s investigation files.

“That’s the key — the cross-draw training. Baldwin would have learned to not have his finger in the trigger guard,” a lawyer involved in the case told me on the basis of anonymity because the charges have not yet been filed. “And by not calling Hannah into the church for that scene where she could have checked everything again and given instructions. Total failure.”

The armorer was reportedly told not to come into the church set due to Covid restrictions. She gave the revolver to Halls who gave it to Baldwin.

The D.A. said on CNN that she spoke to many actors, including “A-list” celebrities, and they “always check their guns or have someone check it in front of them,” adding that “every person that handles a gun has a duty to make sure that if they’re going to handle that gun, point it at someone and pull the trigger, that it’s not going to fire a projectile and kill someone.”

Arrogance on Public Display

Legal experts agree that the criminal charges came as a result of both the facts at hand and public perception of Baldwin’s behavior.

Attorney Andrew F. Branca of the Law of Self Defense has said since the day after the “Rust” shooting that it was a clear case of involuntary manslaughter. Branca explained two charges against Baldwin and Guitterez-Reed.

“Involuntary manslaughter means you don’t intend to hurt anyone, but you acted in a reckless fashion which you know created an unjustified risk of death,” Branca, who has a popular YouTube legal show, told me in an interview. “You know there is a risk, but you do it anyway. The classic example is a drunk driver.”

One of the two counts comes with a much higher penalty because it involves a firearm sentencing enhancement: jail time of five years instead of 18 months maximum.

“It’s almost always reckless if you’re handling a gun,” said Branca. “Recklessness is when you know the risk of death. Negligence is you don’t knowingly create the risk. That would only happen if Alec Baldwin was from outer space and had never handled a gun before, so he doesn’t know he’s creating a risk.”

Baldwin, who is from New York, said he does not feel guilty and is not responsible for shooting and killing Hutchins. Now, a New Mexico jury will decide his guilt for not following the gun safety rules all responsible gun owners adhere to. Unfortunately for Hutchins, Baldwin put pride before the destruction of a young wife and mother.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/20/alec-baldwin-lost-any-credible-defense-when-violated-the-first-rule-of-gun-safety/,2023-01-23
"Get Ready For Democrats' Cynical, Useless, Gun-Control Push","The first question any reasonable person asks after a horrible crime is, “What could have been done to stop it?” Yet after every mass shooting, gun controllers suggest unworkable, unconstitutional, completely ineffectual ideas that target people who will never commit a crime.

After the twin mass shootings in California last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom (flanked by armed guards) told CBS News that it was long past time to institute more gun-control laws because the Second Amendment is “becoming a suicide pact.” What he didn’t mention was that California has no functioning Second Amendment. It has passed not only every law Senate Democrats are proposing in Washington, but a slew of others. Anti-gun group Giffords gives California an “A” rating, noting that the state has the “strongest gun safety laws in the nation and has been a trailblazer for gun safety reform for the past 30 years.”

California already has “universal” background checks. California has a 10-day waiting period limit for handgun purchases, a microstamping system, a personal safety test, the ability to sue gun manufacturers even if they haven’t broken any law, an age hike on the purchase of certain firearms including rifles from 18 to 21, “red flag” laws that allow police to confiscate guns without genuine due process, a ban on magazines that hold more than 10 rounds (and legislation held up in courts to confiscate those magazines), among many other restrictions. Short of letting cops smash down the doors of gun owners and take their weapons, California has a law for it. And all it’s done is leave people attending dance halls defenseless.

The day of the Monterey Park shooting, President Biden again called on Congress to pass a federal “assault weapons” ban. So-called assault weapons have been banned in California since 1989. Last year, the state passed another bill making them super-duper illegal: SB 1327. From 1989 until today, gun trends in California mirror those of the nation at large. Which is unsurprising. The Assault Weapons Ban of 1994, despite Biden constantly claiming otherwise, did nothing to alter gun violence trends. Homicide rates began to ebb nationally before the ban was instituted. When the ban expired in 2004, and the AR-15 became the most popular rifle in the country, gun violence continued to precipitously fall — by 2014, gun homicides were the same as they were in 1963 — until the appearance of Covid.

Now, America’s gun death rates have reached a 28-year high as of 2021 “after sharp increases in homicides of Black men and suicides among white men, an analysis of federal data showed,” according to The Wall Street Journal. There are likely numerous societal reasons for this change — since about 45 percent of American households had guns 10 years ago and the number is the same today — but Democrats are busy worrying about stopping gun owners from having barrel shrouds.

Not that it matters to Democrats, but the shooter at Monterey Park didn’t use an assault weapon. He used a Cobray M11 9mm semi-automatic gun — “one of the most useless handguns in existence” — which some reporters referred to as an “assault pistol.” It’s a scary looking, if antiquated gun (out of production since 1990) that, in this iteration, fires one cartridge with a single trigger squeeze like almost every other gun owned by civilians — including AR-15s. The gun was already illegal in California. As is carrying any gun into a no-gun zone. As is murder.

After the killers of Monterey Park (72 years old) and Half Moon Bay (67) struck, Biden, naturally, called on Congress to pass legislation to raise the minimum purchase age for “assault weapons” to 21. Many mass shooters are young men, but the average age of mass shooters is 35. The number of ARs used in the commission of murder in the hands of a person under 21 is a fraction of 1 percent. Like all things Democrats are pushing these days, it’s another incremental way of eliminating gun ownership that has only a tenuous connection to the events that supposedly precipitated the action.

All mass shooters obtain guns illegally, or legally before having any criminal record (or because of a mistake by the police, as was the case in Charleston and elsewhere). Most incidents are perpetrated by men who have exhibited serious anti-social behavior. In many, if not most, cases, the shooter is already on the cops’ radar because he has threatened others, as was the case from the Parkland shooter to the Highlands Park shooter to the Half Moon shooter and many, many others. In a study of mass shootings from 2008 to 2017, the Secret Service found that “100 percent of perpetrators showed concerning behaviors, and in 77 percent of shootings, at least one person — most often a peer — knew about their plan.” The best thing we can do is uphold laws that already exist.

None of this is to argue that simply because some people ignore laws, they are unnecessary or useless. It’s to argue that laws which almost exclusively target innocent people from practicing a constitutional right, and do nothing to stop criminals, are unnecessary and useless. The central problem in this debate is that Democrats believe civilian gun ownership itself is a plague on the nation, so it doesn’t really matter to them what gun is being banned or what law is being passed, as long as something is being “done.” Only this past summer, Congress supposedly passed the most vital gun bill in history, yet Democrats are back to acting like nothing has been done. The other side believes that being able to protect themselves, their families, their property, and their community from criminality — and, should it descend into tyranny, the government — is a societal good. They see gun bans as autocratic and unconstitutional, and, also, largely unfeasible. And they’re right.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/23/alec-baldwins-criminal-charges-driven-by-legal-facts-and-his-own-public-arrogance/,2023-01-26
Media Malign Gun Maker For Trying To Teach Kids Safe Shooting,"Democrats and corporate media joined forces this week to malign a gun manufacturer for selling a gun that will help adults teach their kids how to safely handle and shoot a firearm.

There’s nothing inherently illegal about gun manufacturer WEE1 Tactical’s all-black JR-15, a 2.5 lb .22 long rifle designed to function “like a modern sporting rifle.” As a matter of fact, once it hits the market later this year, the JR-15 will be one of the safest introductory firearms for sale.

Yet, seven Democrat senators are renewing their demands that the Federal Trade Commission punish legitimate gun manufacturers like WEE1 for allegedly marketing “assault rifles” and “deadly weapons of war” to young children.

The corporate media, all too happy to advance the anti-gun narrative, amplified the senators’ concerns with inaccurate and disparaging headlines.

“Coming Soon to Stores: The AR-15 for Kids,” one New York Magazine Intellegincer headline blared.

“A child-size rifle with cartoon skulls, inspired by the AR-15, raises concerns,” The Washington Post stated.

“AR-15 rifle for kids marketed weeks after a 6-year-old shot a teacher,” Business Insider fretted.

The attempt to discredit a perfectly legitimate company for manufacturing and marketing a perfectly legal gun is clearly a coordinated political move.

“The Federal Trade Commission is nonpartisan. It’s designed to be nonpartisan. And now you’ve got partisan senator pressure asking them to take a partisan policy position on First Amendment-protected free speech,” Mark Oliva, managing director of public affairs at The National Shooting Sports Foundation, told The Federalist. “Nothing that [WEE1 is] advertising on this is illegal. Nothing of it is criminal. Nothing is factually wrong. They’re going after it because they don’t like it. They’re trying to weaponize the Federal Trade Commission to achieve their policy positions.”

Safety First

Brother-sister duo Eric Schmid and Heidi Schaefer of WEE1 designed the JR-15 to be a smaller, lighter, and safer version of an AR-15 that can be used to teach kids about gun safety.

“Our goal was to build a truly unique shooting platform that a Parent or Coach can safely use to teach a young enthusiast,” a flyer promoting the firearm states.

Schaefer reaffirmed this commitment to The Federalist.

“Eric had this idea to create this firearm as a training platform for safety, education, and tradition. That’s really what we’re all about,” Schaefer said.

Schmid specifically equipped the gun with his patented “tamper resistant safety,” which works like a pill bottle cap to stop a child from shooting the gun without adult supervision and permission.

The weapon shares no parts with ARs and uses .22LR, a recreational round with low recoil and low noise, which fosters safer and more accurate shooting. Instead, Schaefer said it “physically operates similar to the AR-15” so that kids interested in shooting sports can familiarize themselves with the modern sporting rifles and .22 LR caliber that are rapidly growing in popularity.

“If you’re going to introduce the next generation into the shooting sports and hunting sports what is a proper platform to introduce them to? Something that nobody uses anymore or something that is modern and what they will find and use themselves when they grow up?” Schmid said.

The firearm also comes with small, single-round and five-round magazines, something anti-gun groups have lobbied to make universal.

Gun Grabbers Whine

Despite the gun’s above-and-beyond safety measures, gun control groups and Democrats called the JR-15’s first debut at the 2022 Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show in Las Vegas a “grotesque joke,” and “sickening,” and wrongfully smeared one of the safest guns on the market as a “weapon of war.”

The JR-15, like every other gun, was marketed to adults who want to safely share shooting activities with their children, are over the age of 18, and can pass a background check. To this day, WEE1 maintains that the JR-15 is “an adult firearm.”

“It is the adult’s discretion to understand maturity, physically, and emotionally or mentally at what age a child is prepared or youth is prepared for their first firearm experience,” Schaefer told the Federalist.

“Although this gun was made and designed … to help aid in the transfer of our love for shooting sports and hunting to the next generation, it is not made to be sold to children,” Schmid said.

That didn’t stop gun-grabbing groups such as the Brady Campaign from accusing WEE1 of advertising guns to kids for using marketing icons featuring cartoonish, pacifier-sucking skulls and crossbones decked out with mohawks, bows, and eyepatches.

A few months after SHOT Show 2022, 11 Democrat senators wrote their first letter to the FTC demanding an investigation into “the marketing of highly lethal firearms, including assault-style rifles, to impressionable young people.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom also signed legislation that “targets the gun lobby and manufacturers that are preying on our children.”

New Look, Same Safe Gun

Nothing else came of Democrats’ targeted push in 2022, but to avoid distraction from its product and its mission, WEE1 scrapped its old advertising and reintroduced JR-15 at the 2023 SHOT Show with a completely different marketing aesthetic. The baby crossbones with bows and mohawks engraved on the side of the gun was replaced by a sleek black exterior. The booth that once featured bright green and black signs emblazoned with “get ‘em one like yours” was exchanged for bright orange and blue signs and American flags.

The JR-15 was still the same safe gun it had always been. But now it could proceed without any marketing that could detract from the integrity of the product — or so WEE1 thought.

Shortly after the JR-15’s second appearance at SHOT Show, Democrats and corporate media went after WEE1 again for taking a page “straight out of the tobacco companies’ playbook.”

“They’re putting us in the likes of alcohol and tobacco, which children are precluded from enjoying. Shooting sports are not the same. Every single state has a youth hunting program. I’m going to guess that they all have a hunter safety education program to go along with that,” Schmid said.

Despite the renewed backlash from the anti-gun coalition, Schmid and Schaefer have received positive feedback from moms, dads, and their children who have had the chance to try the gun, which is available for sale mid-March, at trial shoots.

“We hope that it, as we roll out, as people get these in their everyday use, that we’ll have a lot of interests and a lot of orders piling up,” Schaefer said. “People can’t wait to get them and use them. We had great responses at range day.”

False Stats Fly As California Democrats Push For Gun Control,"After Friday’s mass public shooting in Israel that left seven people dead, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced: “Firearm licensing will be expedited and expanded in order to enable thousands of additional citizens to carry weapons.”

By contrast, after the three public shootings over the last two weekends in California, the verdict from Democrats is that we need even more gun control laws. President Joe Biden and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., used the attacks to call for a renewed federal assault weapons ban. California’s other Democrat senator, Alex Padilla, called for expanded federal background checks on gun purchases.

California already has the strictest gun control laws in the country, and it has both of those laws and many more. In contrast to Israel and almost all the rest of the United States, concealed handgun permits have been almost impossible to get in the counties where California’s attacks occurred. In Los Angeles County, where two of the attacks occurred, there is only one permit for every 5,660 adults. In San Mateo County, where another attack occurred, there is one permit per every 24,630 adults. By contrast, in the 43 right-to-carry states, there is one permit holder for every nine people.

When Americans are allowed to carry permitted concealed handguns, they stop about half the active shooting attacks in the U.S.

Evaluating the Current Approach

Before doubling down on yet more gun control and making the rest of the country like California, let’s first ask ourselves how the current approach has worked out. Even some Democrats in California are calling for a re-evaluation.

“California has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, but look at what we just had today,” Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna acknowledged after the Monterey Park attack. “I can tell you this — the status quo is not working. We need to re-examine what we are doing, and what may work better.”

However, most other Democrats are unwilling to concede that their laws aren’t working. On Saturday, Biden tweeted the claim he has often made: “In the 10 years that the assault weapons ban was on the books, mass shootings went down.” But there was no drop in the number of attacks using so-called assault weapons during the 1994 to 2004 ban. More importantly, if the ban made a difference, we should see a drop in the percentage of attacks with assault weapons during the federal ban period and then an increase in the post-ban period, but the exact opposite is true. You can’t have the ban reducing the number of attacks without the share of attacks using assault weapons falling.

California’s Laws

In 2021, when federal Judge Roger Benitez struck down California’s “assault weapons” ban, he concluded that the state’s experts, who summarized the existing research, could not provide any evidence that the prohibition reduced any type of violent crime.

Last year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom put out a fact sheet purporting to prove “California’s Gun Safety Policies Save Lives, Provide Model for a Nation Seeking Solutions.”

According to the report: “From 1993 to 2017, California’s firearm mortality rate declined by 55 percent — almost four times the decrease in the rest of the nation. Many of California’s most important firearm laws went into effect in the early 1990s.”

California’s murder rate peaked in 1993 at 13.1 per 100,000 people. That’s up from 10.9 in 1989, the year before the state’s assault weapons ban went into effect.

Why did the murder rate fall by 10 percent in 1994 and not in 1990 and continue falling by 53 percent by 2000? California’s tough three-strikes criminal punishment law went into effect on March 7, 1994.

The Newsom fact sheet also quotes the Public Policy Institute of California: “Compared to citizens of other states, Californians are about 25% less likely to die in mass shootings. Between 2019 and 2021, the state’s annual mass shooting homicide rate of 1.4 per one million people was lower than the national average of 1.9.”

After the California Supreme Court declared the state’s assault weapons ban unconstitutional in 1998, a new version was enacted in 2000. Picking just a few years from 2019 to 2021 to evaluate the law seems arbitrary. Whether one picks the years from 2000 on, 2010 on, or 2020 on, the per capita rate of mass public shootings in California is always greater than the rate for the rest of the country.

The rate has also been consistently lower in Texas, to which gun control groups give an “F” grade for its gun control laws. From 2010 on, California’s per capita rate of mass public shootings was 43 percent higher than the rate in Texas and 29 percent higher than in the rest of the United States. Since 2020, the rate in California was 276 percent higher than in Texas and 100 percent higher than in the rest of the U.S.

Last summer, after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, billboards in Los Angeles and San Francisco tried to warn Californians of the danger of mass public shootings in Texas. The idea was to dissuade people from moving. But if that is what concerns Californians, they would be well advised to leave their own state as soon as possible.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Luna is right that California’s gun control laws aren’t working. The last thing we should do is use California’s set of laws as the model for the rest of the country.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/01/31/media-malign-firearm-manufacturer-for-selling-gun-that-encourages-adults-to-teach-kids-safe-shooting/,2023-02-02
DC's Gun Ban Enabled The Deadly Metro Shooting,"The Metro, which is Washington, D.C.’s subway, is a gun-free zone where even concealed carry permit holders cannot carry their weapons. However, that law did not stop a man with an illegal gun from reportedly shooting three people and killing one older man at a D.C. Metro station during morning rush hour last week. The rampage was only stopped when unarmed citizens tackled him, threw his gun onto the tracks, and restrained him on the platform until police arrived.

Isaiah Trotman, 31, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. He allegedly killed Robert Cunningham, the 64-year-old Metro mechanic who tried to save a woman from being attacked.

Concealed Carry Banned on Metro

The horrific crime spree Wednesday may bring new support for a lawsuit challenging the District for banning carry permit holders from bringing loaded guns on the city’s public transportation.

“It’s about time we realize that law-abiding citizens have a right to defend themselves and should not be defenseless to a lunatic when riding the Metro,” George Lyon, who is the attorney for the four plaintiffs in Angelo v. District of Columbia, told me in an interview.

“I think this shooting illustrated that the Metro can be a dangerous place,” added Lyon, whose firm is Arsenal Attorneys. “There is no method of determining if somebody is there for nefarious purposes and carrying an illegal weapon.”

After the shooting spree ended, Lyon filed an amended complaint in the carry permit lawsuit to “beef up our claim for standing.” D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb has 30 days to respond. Lyon said he may also file again for a new preliminary injunction based on the Second Amendment to allow the lawful carrying on the Metro in light of the horrific crime. Schwalb’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

D.C. law says that Metro stations, trains, and buses are “sensitive places” where lawful people cannot concealed carry. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the multiple shootings on the Metro are caused by guns themselves.

The mayor was asked by a reporter about the rush-hour rampage causing people to not feel “comfortable” riding the Metro.

“We’re focused on how we get guns out of our city,” said Bowser. “Whether it’s the Metro, it’s the street, it’s individual homes — we know that we have guns that are creating tragedies in our city and in our nation.”

Subways as ‘Sensitive Places’

Angelo and the others filed the suit in June 2022 after the Supreme Court’s decision in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen. In that landmark ruling, the court narrowed what can be considered a “sensitive place” where guns are banned, citing only three that have historical context (polling places, legislative buildings, and courts). The ruling, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, warned that while gun control laws can make other places “sensitive,” they cannot expand the category of sensitive places “simply to all places of public congregation that are not isolated from law enforcement.”

In response, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a new law that made public transportation, including the subways, into “sensitive” places where concealed carry is banned. That is being challenged in a federal lawsuit in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. In January, the Supreme Court denied a request to get involved in the case. Justices Thomas and Samuel Alito said the decision was for procedural reasons and not to endorse the merits of the law.

Disarming Law-Abiding Citizens but Not Criminals

The four plaintiffs in the lawsuit — Gregory Angelo, Tyler Yzaguirre, Cameron Erickson, and Robert M. Miller — assert that their Second Amendment rights are being violated every day because they are not allowed to carry loaded guns on the cost-effective Metro. The men all have D.C. concealed carry permits and take the Metro on a regular basis.

Three of them live in D.C. and Miller lives in neighboring Virginia, where the Metro allows for legal gun carrying on its trains, following state law. Carry permit holders on trains from Virginia are supposed to unload their guns and put them in a case when they hit the District stations.

U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss, a Barack Obama appointee, denied the plaintiffs’ motion for injunctive relief in December. Moss ruled that the four men don’t have standing in the case because they can’t prove a “credible threat of prosecution” — meaning none of them have been threatened with arrest. Lyon’s new motion addresses that issue.

Legal carry permit holders are afraid to carry guns on the Metro because it’s against the law. However, that was not a concern for the alleged murderer, Trotman. I asked a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) if Trotman’s gun was registered with the city — that’s the only way it can be legal — but did not get a reply. An MPD spokesman also declined to say if Cunningham was armed or if anyone at the crime scenes had a concealed carry permit, citing the case being under investigation.

Perhaps if a good guy with a gun and a legal carry permit had been at the Potomac Station that morning, he would have been able to stop the assailant before he allegedly murdered the unarmed hero, Mr. Cunningham.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/02/false-statistics-fly-as-california-democrats-push-for-gun-control-laws-that-failed-already/,2023-02-06
Banning My Son From Doodling Guns Won't Stop School Shootings,"The only thing more predictable than boys being fascinated with weapons is them eventually sketching one in class. But that’s not allowed anymore.

What is it that makes a little boy — practically straight out of the womb — take an interest in weapons and emulate gun-toting, swash-buckling heroes? Even doctors aren’t sure. As one pediatrician told me about my then 16-month-old son who turned every stick into a sword, “We don’t know why. They just do it.” If you’ve raised a little boy, you know what I’m talking about. And the only thing more predictable than them being fascinated with weapons is them eventually doodling one in class. An alien with a laser gun. An elf with a sword. Rambo with a machine gun. When they do, they’ll encounter a host of school polices banning images of weapons, ostensibly to prevent school shootings and other violence. Some make exceptions for historical context (such as a Revolutionary War soldier with a bayonet). Others don’t. Who can forget the infamous Pop-Tart gun of 2016? The 7-year-old was suspended. If your child is lucky, he’ll be told to put the drawing away. If he’s unlucky, he’ll be sent to the principal’s office and then to the school counselor, where he may even be given a suicide assessment. No Drawings with Guns Allowed My first encounter with this type of policy was when my youngest boy came home from a Fairfax County, Virginia, elementary school with his shirt inside out. On the front was an image of a Lego Ewok holding — eek! — a tiny axe. I recently encountered this policy again with my 10-year-old son. He had gotten in trouble for drawing a police officer holding a gun. A police officer. Author’s son’s drawing.

In an email, my son’s teacher said she explained to him that drawing weapons in class is not allowed and encouraged him to “stick to dragons and landscapes.”

My heart goes out to my son’s teacher, and to every teacher, who has to worry about one of their students bringing a weapon to class. But I was honest: I have no problem with my son drawing a police officer with a gun, an alien with a gun, or pretty much any other living creature holding a gun. Bugs Bunny once pointed a gun at Nasty Canasta. I’m fine with that, too.

My son’s interest in guns is not a violent one because he’s not a violent boy. He’s a peacemaker — an empathetic child who cares for animals and respects teachers. He’s shot real guns under the supervision of responsible, trained adults. His grandfather was a cop, which is why he sees them as heroes.

But the fact remains: He’s a boy, and boys have been drawing weapons for hundreds of years.

Part of the thinking behind forbidding gun imagery, I gather, is that if a boy takes an interest in guns, he’ll take an interest in bringing a gun to school and killing people with it.

Signs of Mental Illness?

Schools must enforce the thinking of our increasingly leftist-controlled culture, which paints gun usage as only negative. There is no sporting use. No self-defense use. No stopping-the-bad-guys use. Were guns a moral good when they stopped Hitler from marching millions more into the gas chambers? I think so.

Perhaps the thinking behind the “no gun imagery” rule is that fellow students will look at the drawing and fear the child is the next Nikolas Cruz, thus creating an uncomfortable learning environment.

If the child is mentally ill and has the intent to do harm, wouldn’t the drawing provide important and life-saving insight into his mental state? And wouldn’t he draw it anyway, regardless of your policy? Ethan Crumbley, who killed four fellow students at his Michigan high school, wasn’t drawing cops or cowboys. The blood-soaked images he drew were surrounded by clear red flags: “My life is useless.” “Blood everywhere.” “The thoughts won’t stop, help me.”

The second and more likely possibility: The child is not mentally ill and is drawn, in true male fashion, to the gun-toting (or tiny axe-holding) hero archetype. If it scares the teacher and fellow students to see a doodle like this, they are inferring something about the nature of males that is incorrect: that aggression and strength can never be harnessed for good.

A gun is a neutral extension of the person holding it. It can bring peace and restore justice, or it can destroy peace and create injustice. Sometimes it doesn’t even need to be fired. A police officer defending innocents is good. A murderous gunman surrounded by schizophrenic rantings is bad — and deserves the attention of parents and authorities.

No Discretion Allowed

To determine what kind of drawing they’re looking at, teachers could simply use discretion. Yet, unfortunately, discretion is what today’s inflexible school policies — and our increasingly litigious society — prevent. Every incident is treated the same, with no regard for the damage it may do to the child.

What is that damage? When a boy gets punished for drawing a weapon, he is being gaslit and emasculated. He will probably still be interested in guns, only now he’ll feel guilty for it. He’ll see his interest as psychotic. He may even be introduced — by his teachers — to the very adult concept of suicide.

As Michel de Montaigne, the great French Renaissance philosopher who believed in the philosophical, nonviolent education of children observed: “By punishing boys for depravity before they are depraved, you make them so.”

Whether we like it or not, guns and weapons are a masculine interest. And if you suppress healthy masculine interests, you tend to get a rebound effect, and not a good one. The only masculinity that is “toxic” is the kind that erupts when boys have no healthy outlets for these interests. Case in point: America’s schools keep suppressing masculinity and yet we keep getting more of what we don’t want — violence and fury.

The group of boys in Florida who savagely beat a 9-year-old girl on the school bus in an assault straight out of “Lord of the Flies” weren’t allowed to draw guns in school either. But they no doubt never learned what a fair fight is, or (thanks to our society’s obsession with erasing male-female differences) that there is a weaker sex. Did they have nonviolent guidance and love from adults, and a way — other than perhaps violent video games — to diffuse masculine interests?

In my interactions with teachers over this issue, I’ve been told time and again that they agree with me (or at least understand my points) but that “these are simply the times we live in.”

How Can a Child Understand?

This defeatist explanation seems to suit us adults for the moment, but does it make sense to a child? A 10-year-old doesn’t have the knowledge or the maturity to wrap his head around the “epidemic of school and mass shootings.” The rule only makes sense to him if we burden him with a dark, pessimistic view of the world — leading only to more anxiety and more shame.

He doesn’t know why his desire to draw a cowboy or an alien or a cop with a gun is a red flag. He just knows that Doc Holliday looks cool when he twirls his gun in “Tombstone.” He’s drawing the same doodle that a member of the Greatest Generation would have done in school, only he’s getting punished for it.

We should ask ourselves if the remedies that schools are employing to stop school shooters are only making normal little boys feel like psychopaths until they surrender to a softer, weaker, more effeminate version of how God created them. And then as parents who love our little boys, we need to do something about it.

How The Media Successfully Programs Democrats,"A new Axios-Ipsos poll finds that a plurality of Republicans regard fentanyl and opioids as the biggest threat to public health, while Democrats are most likely to say guns. Axios co-founder Jim VandeHei tweeted that it was “wild” that conservatives were under this impression. After some blowback, VandeHei clarified the tweet, and claimed what he meant was that the political divide was “wild.” It is, but not for the reasons he thinks.

According to the CDC, an estimated 106,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2022. And likely around 67 percent of those deaths involved synthetic opioids like fentanyl — which, if I punched in the number correctly, adds up to around 71,000 deaths.

In 2022, around 44,000 Americans died from gun-related deaths. According to the CDC, over half of gun deaths are attributable to suicide, which points to a need for better mental health and community involvement than any useless gun legislation. Around 20,000 people died from guns not used in suicides. This includes hundreds of accidents (which is another reason pollsters like to ask about “gun access”).

So, in other words, around five times as many people have died in drug overdoses in recent years than were killed by gun crime. And even if we counted all 44,000 gun-related deaths as having the same root cause, more than twice as many people died from drug overdoses. It’s wild that so many liberals aren’t aware of this reality.

And the idea that this is a Red State-Blue State perception problem, as the pollster Cliff Young claims, doesn’t really pan out. Yes, the states with the highest per capita drug overdoses include West Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Kentucky, but also New Mexico, Maine, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. New York and Colorado have higher death rates than Texas and Alabama.

It’s also no surprise that the media’s morbid, ideologically motivated hyperfocus on gun crimes; their conflation of suicides, accidents, and criminal homicides; and their politicizing of every shooting have programmed science-loving Democrats to tend to overestimate the dangers of guns. If more voters knew that fentanyl was now more dangerous in the hands of Americans than guns, would our national debate look the same? Who knows.

Partisan media generally sees everything through its own moral and ideological prism, and when the numbers don’t fit they try and bend the narrative to make it work. It’s reminiscent of how the media’s coverage of every natural disaster as a unique occurrence convinces people that the Earth is on its last days, or how the endless hand-wringing over “inequality” creates the impression that America is awash in poverty.

Quick example:

In the same Axios poll story we’re told, “Nearly half of Americans — 47% — say insurers should cover transgender-related medical care. That’s a deeply partisan issue: 77% of Democrats favor it; just 16% of Republicans do.” Why isn’t the takeaway that 52 percent of Americans, notwithstanding the endless efforts to normalize transgenderism, still oppose insurers covering related medical procedures? Of those polled, 33 percent were “strongly” against it — which is considerably higher than the 21 percent that strongly support it. Of course, the question itself is misleading. What would the poll look like if you asked Americans whether the state should “mandate” that insurers pay for drugs and cosmetic surgeries for people with “gender dysphoria,” including children? I imagine, very different.

Anyway, none of this means that the issues of gun violence and overdoses are not important, or that different people don’t face different threats to their health. It’s probably the case, as well, that most people polled are talking about issues they see as preventable. Only 9 percent of Democrats and 17 percent of Republicans in the Axios poll, for instance, say cancer is our greatest health threat to Americans. Meanwhile, cancer claims more than 600,000 American lives every year — or 30 times more than gun homicides. A person is more likely to die from heart disease, respiratory disease, an accident, diabetes, the flu, kidney disease, septicemia, or chronic liver disease, among many other deadly things, than by a gun.

But any way you slice the numbers, it is Republicans who have a better grasp of the “greatest” threat to public health. And it isn’t surprising.",https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/23/banning-my-son-from-doodling-a-gun-is-not-a-solution-to-school-shootings/,2023-02-23
