Welcome to Neoconworld,"Twelve years after the September 11 attacks, threats of American involvement in Syria’s civil war have refocused attention on the region at the heart of our foreign policy: the Greater Middle East. By “Greater Middle East” I mean not only the Arab-Muslim heartland of the Arabian Peninsula, Mesopotamia, and the Levant, but the broader region stretching from Morocco in the west to Pakistan in the east, from Turkey in the north to Yemen in the south (with the exception, of course, of Israel). Many of the countries in the region are not Arab – Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan – but all are predominantly Muslim, and all are infected to one extent or another with the ideology of Islamism, built around the view that Muslims constitute a pan-national political entity and not merely a religious confession.

For the past five years, U.S. foreign policy has been made by senior elected officials and political appointees who, in the words of the Boston Globe, “built careers on [an] anti-war posture.” And yet, our policy in the Greater Middle East remains impervious to new strategic initiatives that seek to fundamentally alter the “neoconservative” course set by the Bush Administration. And while that much-used term is often abused or misunderstood, the policy it describes has taken on a life of its own. It’s still the neocons’ world, and everyone else is living in it. And the jury is still out on how it will end.

But this much is already clear: the old status quo is gone and cannot be reconstructed. The biggest loser in the post-September 11 world has been established order of a region previously dominated by Muslim and Arab strongmen who (while they might be seen as religious zealots by Western standards) sought to ground their rule on secular concepts like nationalism, who ran stable, tightly controlled police states and engaged in traditional power politics, and who successfully projected the internal tensions of their repressed societies outwards. The forces of popular change have come to the region, and for good or ill, they will not be denied. The harder question is what replaces the old order.

Digging To The Roots

Writ small, the September 11 attacks were a conspiracy by Al Qaeda – a terrorist group based in Afghanistan, Germany, and to a lesser extent Egypt and Pakistan, and consisting largely of Saudi Wahabbist Muslim fanatics – to attack civilian targets in the United States. Some observers argued from the beginning that we should focus on the conspirators and their organization, and forego broader ambitions.

The Bush Administration never treated the attacks simply as a criminal conspiracy to be isolated and punished, instead preferring to treat Al Qaeda as a symptom of a wider problem, and to seek out a solution that required digging deeper into the region’s pathologies in the effort to root out the entire problem once and for all. That approach recognized the reality that the organization of jihadist extremist groups was fungible; Al Qaeda was simply one manifestation of a larger movement. Al Qaeda’s own recent behavior illustrates this reality: holding a coordinated conference call with other extremist and terrorist groups that one intelligence professional described as akin to the “Legion of Doom”; current Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri calling publicly for more locally organized terror attacks like the Boston Marathon Bombing; radical imam Anwar al-Awlaki giving Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan the ideological encouragement to conduct a lone jihadist attack on an American military base.

The nearly unanimous decision to go to war in Afghanistan was made without real discussion of what our broader goals were, but the war in Iraq nearly a year and a half later forced the question into the open. Even with the publication of memoirs by most of the major players, we have never really had a full, candid accounting of the grand-strategic thinking of President Bush and his team between September 2001 and March 2003. Bush, in his own memoir, summarized his principles in four points:

First, make no distinction between the terrorists and the nations that harbor them – and hold both to account. Second, take the fight to the enemy overseas before they can attack us here at home again. Third, confront threats before they fully materialize. And fourth, advance liberty and hope as an alternative to the enemy’s ideology of repression and fear.

That fourth point was the source of the high-flying rhetoric about liberty and democracy and its connection to security in his Second Inaugural Address in 2005:

We have seen our vulnerability – and we have seen its deepest source. For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny – prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder – violence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat. There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom. We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world. …So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen…

What was missing from all this was an explanation of how we planned to get to that end – precisely who the enemy was and is, and what our strategic philosophy would be in deciding when to use force, when to declare the mission accomplished, when to coexist with dictators who cooperated against the jihadists, and when to support insurrections that were aligned with them. Both Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld, in their memoirs, stressed the importance of stepping back and doing strategic thinking even in the bustle of war, but despite their respect for Bush, both memoirs have a little edge of regret that more such thinking wasn’t done from the top in a public way that would have given clearer direction to the missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The ultimate historic judgment of the Iraq War must be bound up with the eventual success or failure of the grand strategy it represented.

But just because the strategy wasn’t explicitly stated as such doesn’t mean a course wasn’t set. When the Bush Administration’s actions are considered in light of the thinking of conservative commentators and the justifications offered then and now, it seems clear that the Administration came, rather early, to the conclusion that the problem was the fundamental structure of the Greater Middle East (at a minimum its political structure). Because the solution to such a problem is not merely to launch missiles or drop bombs, but to change the governments of the region – a much more ambitious goal – it inherently required kick-starting the process by choosing a country to make an example. The obvious choice, for a variety of reasons, was Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, with which we already had continuous hostilities dating back a decade; the U.S. Congress had already, in 1998, declared a change in Iraq’s regime to be official U.S. policy. Regardless of the specific arguments made for the invasion of Iraq at the time, the ultimate historic judgment of the Iraq War must be bound up with the eventual success or failure of the grand strategy it represented, just as the ultimate worth of the sacrifices made in Korea and Vietnam are now subsumed in the larger context of the success of the Cold War.

The Nail Beckons The Hammer

President Bush’s “freedom agenda” came to be identified with the neoconservatives, an anti-communist movement dating back to the 1960s, in large part because when the planes hit the towers, the prominent ‘neocon’ thinkers in and out of government were the ones most ready with an off-the-shelf explanation for how you deal with such a problem, and their template resembled what ended up being put in practice in Iraq and Afghanistan. An accurate history of neoconservatism is too broad a subject for this essay, but it was merely one of several strands of thought on the Right that came to similar conclusions about the Cold War by the time of the Reagan era: that the struggle with Soviet Communism was an ideological one, an important component of which was demonstrating to its captive peoples and those on the fence that our system was superior in delivering a good way of life; that they should be encouraged to undermine and ultimately reject their home governments; and that we would not abandon them no matter how long that struggle took. This broad-based view that the Cold War could be won by rooting out the origins of the conflict had won out over the narrower model of containment that focused on dealing with specific provocations as they arose.

The virtue of the neoconservative model was that it had been proven as part of a long-term ideological struggle that succeeded beyond our wildest dreams by the early 1990s; we had won the Cold War without fighting a full-scale war with the Soviets, ushering in a massive global expansion of democracy and trade. Even Putin’s Russia, troublesome as it is, looks more or less like a success story compared to the Brezhnev era – and it looked better in 2002 than it does today. But the parallels were not perfect or entirely encouraging: the Cold War had taken 45 years to win, it had involved a huge, costly military and economic strategy that could not easily be adapted to an adversary that consisted of a loose confederation of non-state-actors and states allied only by convenience, and – perhaps most alarmingly of all – a key ally in the Cold War was the religious faith of Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim subjects oppressed by the atheistic Soviet empire, whereas the battle against Islamism would require convincing millions of Muslims to re-evaluate political doctrines that many of them believed were taught by their faith.

Moreover, the history of the neoconservative model in and before the Cold War offers its own cautions. Ideological competition presupposes populations that have sufficient freedom of action to do something about their governments, or (in the case of Japan between 1850 and 1900) a government that itself sees the benefits of change. Churchill dedicated extensive resources to fomenting rebellion against the Nazis during World War II – he famously directed the Special Operations Executive to “set Europe ablaze” – but the resistance movements in places like Poland and Greece were brutally suppressed; as historian John Keegan concluded from a review of the SOE’s operations, most had little impact on the stability of the Nazi occupation. Only external Allied military force was able to crush Hitler. Only the Union Army, rather than slave rebellions, defeated the Confederacy. The French Revolutionaries were rarely able to subvert their monarchical adversaries and had to meet them on a conventional field of battle. Since the dawn of the West, the history of civilizational clashes is long on the use of military force to defend and expand Western Civilization and short on the peaceable conversion of its enemies. Even in the Cold War, the U.S. was compelled to take to the battlefield to protect the populations of South Korea and South Vietnam from conquest.

The Jacksonian impulse: avoid meddling in the world until provoked, then respond with as much brute force as necessary to convince everyone not to get us that angry again.

The neoconservative approach to post-9/11 strategy was not the only one on offer on the Right. On the one hand was the “realist” approach, redolent of containment, that counseled working with the existing regimes in the region to ally against the non-state-actors and bring the bad-actor states in line. The realist school on the Right, preaching power politics, is in this sense often allied with the school on the Left that preaches the maintenance of order by international institutions (an approach that has regained its footing with the passage of time, but which was plainly inadequate to the task of organizing a response in the aftermath of an event like September 11). On the other was the “Jacksonian” approach. Put bluntly, the Jacksonian impulse is to avoid meddling in the world until provoked, and then respond with as much brute force as necessary to convince everyone, innocent or guilty of the attacks, not to get us that angry again. Jacksonians were thus in favor of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but not in favor of sticking around long-term to clean up the mess.

Bush’s foreign policy team was by no means ideologically monolithic (just as Reagan’s was not); Dick Cheney, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice all hailed more or less from the realpolitik school of thought that prevailed under George H.W. Bush (although many of Cheney’s old aides, back in government, were identified with neoconservatism), and if you ever described Don Rumsfeld as a “neo” anything, you deserve to have your pundit card revoked. But then, in many ways the decision to seek a more structural, long-term solution was as much a product of Bush’s personality and temperament as any ideology. Bush had come into office believing in decisiveness and the use of political capital for large goals and distasteful of half-measures and short-term “kick the can down the road” solutions, and when possible, he naturally gravitated towards bold strokes. Setting the United States the ambitious task of igniting a regional revolution in the Greater Middle East would put all of these impulses into action.

Two Blog Perspectives

To understand the logic of the neoconservative project, it is worth looking back at two essays written at the time from opposite ends of the political spectrum, one on a right-leaning blog, the other for a left-leaning magazine.

Probably the most influential blog essay of the War on Terror was the “Strategic Overview” written in July 2003 by Steven Den Beste. It is interesting and telling, looking back, how much of Den Beste’s analysis and that of others on the Right at the time rested more on Arab culture than Islam, although its logic extends to the wider region. Den Beste’s essential argument was that we were dealing with a body of people that was (1) stuck in a constellation of failed states and a failed culture, (2) deeply ashamed by that fact, and (3) lacking either the will to face that fact or a political outlet in which to do something about it, and therefore were (4) encouraged to vent their rage and frustrations at those outside the Muslim and Arab worlds. Den Beste’s prescription was to break down the political order of the Arab/Muslim world and replace it with something more responsive to popular needs, demands and aspirations. An ambitious project, but one in line with the longstanding conservative view that men can change governments more easily than governments can change men. As Den Beste explained:

The large solution is to reform the Arab/Muslim world. This is the path we have chosen. The true root cause of the war is their failure and their resentment and frustration and shame caused by that failure. They fail because they are crippled by political, cultural and religious chains which their extremists refuse to give up. The real causes of their failure is well described by Ralph Peters. Most of the Arab nations suffer from all seven of his critical handicaps, and the goal of reform is to correct all seven, as far as possible. If their governments can be reformed, and their people freed of the chains which bind them and cripple them, they will begin to achieve, and to become proud of their accomplishments. This will reduce and eventually eliminate their resentment. Their governments would then cease needing scapegoats. Their extremists would no longer have fertile ground for recruitment. This is a huge undertaking; it will require decades because it won’t really be complete until there’s a generational turnover. But ultimately it is the only way to really eliminate the danger to us without using the “foot-and-mouth” solution (which is to say, nuclear genocide). The primary purpose of reform is to liberate individual Arabs. This is a humanist reform, but it isn’t a Christian reform. There will be no attempt to eradicate Islam as a religion. Rather, Islamism as a political movement, and as a body of law, and as a form of government must be eliminated, leaving Islam as a religion largely untouched except to the extent that it will be forced to be tolerant. The conceptual model for this is what we did in Japan after WWII, where only those cultural elements which were dangerous to us were eliminated, leaving behind a nation which was less aggressive, but still Japanese. No attempt was made to make Japan a clone of the US, and no such attempt will be made with the Arabs.

In Den Beste’s view, it was essential that “we had to conquer one of the big antagonistic Arab nations and take control of it” for the following purposes:

To place us in a physical and logistical position to be able to apply substantial pressure on the rest of the major governments of the region. To force them to stop protecting and supporting terrorist groups To force them to begin implementing political and social reforms To convince the governments and other leaders of the region that it was no longer fashionable to blame us for their failure, so that they would stop using us as scapegoats. To make clear to everyone in the world that reform is coming, whether they like it or not, and that the old policy of stability-for-the-sake-of-stability is dead. To make clear to local leaders that they may only choose between reforming voluntarily or having reform forced on them. To make a significant long term change in the psychology of the “Arab Street” To prove to the “Arab Street” that we were willing to fight, and that our reputation for cowardice was undeserved. To prove that we are extraordinarily dangerous when we do fight, and that it is extremely unwise to provoke us. To defeat the spirit of the “Arab Street”. To force them to face their own failure, so that they would become willing to consider the idea that reform could lead them to success. No one can solve a problem until they acknowledge that they have a problem, and until now the “Arab Street” has been hiding from theirs, in part aided by government propaganda eager to blame others elsewhere (especially the Jews). To “nation build”. After making the “Arab Street” truly face its own failure, to show the “Arab Street” a better way by creating a secularized, liberated, cosmopolitan society in a core Arab nation. To create a place where Arabs were free, safe, unafraid, happy and successful. To show that this could be done without dictators or monarchs. (I’ve been referring to this as being the pilot project for “Arab Civilization 2.0”.) …Neither Afghanistan nor Iran would serve the political goals. The conquered nation had to be one generally thought of as being Arab. The human and cultural material we needed for reform did not exist in Afghanistan. The “Arab Street” would not have been impressed by successful reform in Afghanistan or in Persian Iran.

In addition to Iraq’s strategic location and the various casi belli already in existence (also beyond the scope of this essay, but worth revisiting at another time with the distance of a decade), he also noted the important symbolic reasons why Iraq was well-suited to this project:

Saddam had become a hero to the “Arab Street”. He was thought of as a strong Arab leader who was standing up to the West. Though Iraq’s military had been decisively defeated in 1991, Saddam survived politically and this actually enhanced his reputation. He hadn’t won against us, but at least he’d tried, which was better than anyone else seemed to be doing. The “Arab Street” was proud of him for making the attempt. (This involved a lot of revisionism, such as ignoring Saddam’s earlier invasion of Kuwait, or the participation of large Arab military forces in the coalition army which fought against Iraq.) Iraq’s military had the reputation of being the largest, best armed and most dangerous of any in the region. If it could be decisively crushed it would be psychologically devastating. Baghdad historically was one of the great capitals of classic Arab civilization. Having it fall to outsiders would be symbolically important.

I would add that Iraq’s religious and ethnic diversity (the very thing that caused Joe Biden to argue for it being partitioned into three separate states) also presented both a challenge and an opportunity. A challenge, because of the sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shia that would break into something resembling a full-blown civil war in 2006, but also an opportunity, because Iraq could not be unified along monosectarian lines; it needed, and continues to need, some tolerance of pluralism within Islam to function as a single state, some mechanism for enabling tolerance and co-existence.

From the opposite end of the political spectrum, Josh Marshall, writing in April 2003, concluded essentially the same thing about the Bush Administration’s strategy, a strategy he found deeply troubling. He described his nightmare for the aftermath of toppling Saddam:

The United Nations and NATO are in disarray, so America is pretty much on its own. Hemmed in by budget deficits at home and limited financial assistance from allies, the Bush administration is talking again about tapping Iraq’s oil reserves to offset some of the costs of the American presence–talk that is further inflaming the region. Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence has discovered fresh evidence that, prior to the war, Saddam moved quantities of biological and chemical weapons to Syria. When Syria denies having such weapons, the administration starts massing troops on the Syrian border. But as they begin to move, there is an explosion: Hezbollah terrorists from southern Lebanon blow themselves up in a Baghdad restaurant, killing dozens of Western aid workers and journalists. Knowing that Hezbollah has cells in America, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge puts the nation back on Orange Alert. FBI agents start sweeping through mosques, with a new round of arrests of Saudis, Pakistanis, Palestinians, and Yemenis. To most Americans, this would sound like a frightening state of affairs, the kind that would lead them to wonder how and why we had got ourselves into this mess in the first place. But to the Bush administration hawks who are guiding American foreign policy, this isn’t the nightmare scenario. It’s everything going as anticipated.

Marshall concluded that, in the view of hawks within the Administration,

[I]nvasion of Iraq was not merely, or even primarily, about getting rid of Saddam Hussein. Nor was it really about weapons of mass destruction, though their elimination was an important benefit. Rather, the administration sees the invasion as only the first move in a wider effort to reorder the power structure of the entire Middle East…. [T]he administration is trying to roll the table–to use U.S. military force, or the threat of it, to reform or topple virtually every regime in the region, from foes like Syria to friends like Egypt, on the theory that it is the undemocratic nature of these regimes that ultimately breeds terrorism. So events that may seem negative–Hezbollah for the first time targeting American civilians; U.S. soldiers preparing for war with Syria–while unfortunate in themselves, are actually part of the hawks’ broader agenda.

Eight years later, events have long since taken on a life of their own, and while they have followed neither the precise outline of Den Beste’s positive or Marshall’s negative view, the essential trajectory has been the one projected: disruption of the long-ossified status quo and the ushering in of a revolutionary era that has replaced one longstanding tryanny after another with something different and (in the short run) more responsive to popular movements.

Set The Greater Middle East Ablaze

The Bush Administration was fond of touting the milestones of democracy and freedom (the two things are not the same), and in the early years they came in waves. At the same time, the forces of chaos threatened to overwhelm the progress. But as the years have passed, chaos has more often engulfed the enemies of democracy than its friends. Step back and consider the timeline of major events – not every battle or controversy, but the large-scale shifts between democracy, tyranny and extremism:

Along the way, especially in 2011, we’ve seen more modest protests and reforms or crackdowns in places like Morocco, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

Compare all of that to the face of the region in September 2001 – dominated by a few theocratic regimes (Iran and Taliban Afghanistan), a handful of Gulf monarchies, and a long row of strongmen – and you can see how far the project of remaking the face of the region has progressed. By no means is the news all good, but it’s all news compared to the statis that characterized the internal politics of most of the region before 9/11.

The Iraq War dominated U.S. political discussion for the greater part of five and a half years from mid-2002 to late 2007, and Americans have a tendency to focus on how the war affected our politics and foreign opinion of us. But it also gripped the attention of the Greater Middle East, dominating al Jazeera’s regional programming. For would-be democratic reformers, the scenes of voters lining up at the polls and even of squabbling parliamentarians in Iraq and Afghanistan presented an inevitable contrast to their own regimes. And, for that matter, for would-be Islamist revolutionaries, Iraq not only provided a place to prove themselves in battle, but also showed them how to run an insurgency in their own backyards. If U.S. intervention in the region wounded the pride of Arabs and Muslims, it also awakened them to the fact that maybe they could do it themselves – which was the idea of the neocon theory all along, that the process, once started, could develop a momentum of its own without requiring ceaseless American war. We would go to war in Iraq so we wouldn’t have to go to war everywhere else. The Bush Administration’s aggressive pressure also contributed to the dictators’ walkbacks – Qaddafi abandoning his WMD program, Assad leaving Lebanon. Where Saddam had shown a face of defiance, the Arab peoples now saw that even a bloodied, quagmired U.S. could bring the region’s strongmen to heel.

Iraq alone wasn’t the sole cause of the turning; al Jazeera, which had arrived in 1996 and really took off after 9/11, itself had a role in changing the way the region’s people saw their societies. As Rany Jazayerli put it:

Al Jazeera was, from its first day on the air, something the Arab world had never seen before: a television channel in Arabic, available to almost everyone in the Arab world, that provided a frank and reasonably unbiased source of news. It provided the unvarnished truth, and that made it extremely dangerous. If there was corruption going on in Jordan, it was reported. If there was a government crackdown in Egypt, it was reported. If a Saudi dissident living in exile in England had some scandalous information about the Saudi royal family, it was reported. All you need to know about Al Jazeera is that its greatest critics are the Arab governments, who have applied all kinds of pressure on Qatar – where Al Jazeera is based – to tone down the rhetoric… For the last 15 years, then, the Arab world has had the access that was denied them for so long. They’ve seen the truth about how oppressive and hypocritical their own governments are, and they’ve seen the truth about how messy and imperfect and yet ultimately how ennobling and empowering Western democracies are…And having already opened the barn door to letting the masses own satellite dishes, the governments of the region were mostly helpless to do anything about it.

Satellite TV would not be the only technological advance to grease the skids; the internet and social networks like Facebook and Twitter were also altering the playing field. But tools of communications can be a two-way street for propaganda and surveillance, as well; what makes them work is when they have something to talk about.

Flypaper

While the tide of Arab and Muslim revolution was surging in the Greater Middle East, it was waning in the West. Directly provoking the “Arab street” raised concerns about retaliation by the extremists, but the opposite has been true since the region really began boiling in 2005. We’ve seen three really large-scale terror attacks – the kind that require coordination and planning – far from the Greater Middle East since 9/11: the October 2002 Bali bombing, the March 2004 train bombings in Madrid, and the July 2005 bus and train bombings in London. India, still locked in a front-line struggle with Pakistani extremists, has not been so fortunate, being hit by terror attacks in Mumbai in November 2008 (the work of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani Muslim terror group) and again in July 2011. The same is true of Chechen terror attacks in Moscow in 2002 and 2010. (And, of course, Islamists within Europe have been busy with their own forms of homegrown mischief.) The decline in large-scale terror operations is partly due to good fortune, good law enforcement and domestic surveillance; certainly there have been a number of attempted terror attacks against the U.S. that got pretty far, such as the December 2001 “shoe bomber,” the December 2009 “underwear bomber” and a May 2010 truck bomb in Times Square. And smaller independent attacks, some of them with major death tolls, have continued: the July 2002 LAX shooter, the Fall 2002 Beltway snipers, the November 2009 Fort Hood shooter, the April 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing. But any accounting of major terrorist attacks since the invasion of Iraq shows a distinct shift towards attacks within the region itself.

This, too, was – as Marshall acknowledged at the time – an inherent, if usually unstated, assumption of the neocon grand strategy. People who are busy killing each other won’t have time to kill anyone else. A region that is pulling itself apart will not be able to project force outward. A region engaged in a mad scramble for power internally will dedicate its arms, its money and its excitable underemployed young men to winning that struggle rather than staging complex covert operations in another hemisphere.

Sowing dissension among one’s enemies has a long history; perhaps the most successful example was Imperial Germany’s success in taking Russia out of World War I by shipping Lenin into Russia in the spring of 1917. In this case, it’s a logical extension of the “flypaper theory” of the Iraq War. The idea that the region’s Islamic extremists should be enticed into Iraq to fight U.S. troops was sometimes referred to as a “flypaper” strategy – that they’d be drawn in and trapped where we wanted them, and thus that a bloody insurgency was actually good news. Flypaper may sound like a callous attitude towards the safety of American troops, but the thinking is actually the ancient motivation of men at war: confront and kill the enemy on the battlefield so he cannot disturb your homeland. It is perhaps a more cynical approach to the security of the local population – but then, it’s not unreasonable to want the problems of Iraq and other nations in the region to be played out on their soil rather than ours.

That was never the original war plan, of course; the insurgency may not have been adequately planned for by the Bush team, but it did not result from any provocation by the United States – it was wholly the independent decision of those who rejected a democratic political process in which the Iraqi people would be sovereign. Nevertheless, it was implicit in the broader idea of creating a contest for supremacy in the heart of the region.

And in that regard, even though American troops have left Iraq and are nearing their departure from Afghanistan, the flypaper theory writ large is alive and well. Civil war in Syria, Libya and Afghanistan, coup in Egypt, revolution in Tunisia…these are all conflicts that entice the jihadists to test their mettle and influence closer to home rather than travel to the West, and give them enemies other than the U.S., Europe and Israel against whom to vent their frustrations. In that regard, the current landscape may represent the fruits of the neocon project, but it’s also in line with old-fashioned cynical realpolitik (division to my enemies!) as well as embodying the kind of Jacksonian attitude towards one’s enemies that Harry Truman voiced in 1941 when he expressed the view that “If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible, although I don’t want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances.”

All of these attitudes are wholly foreign to President Obama and his national security team, but they have been neither willing nor able to put the genie back in the bottle, as the momentum and internal logic of the whirlwind have swept away one effort after another to re-impose order.

Where We Go From Here

The grand strategy of the neocons has long since passed out of their control, as few still have any influence with the Obama Administration or even in Congress. But the regional revolution they set ablaze is still with us, and they must trust that the path will be clear enough that even those skeptical of the project will make the proper choices. That is a dicey proposition, because few on either side of the political spectrum understand or accept the grand strategic proposition of turning the region’s angst inward to the battle for its own future.

On the Left, there remains no coherent grand strategy or even petit strategy.

On the Left, there remains no coherent grand strategy or even petit strategy. None of what is laid out above should excuse the Obama Administration from the choices it has made, its inability at times to face the new realities of the region for the challenges and opportunities they present, or its general preference (abroad as at home) for negotiating with elites rather than accepting the messy dynamism of popular sovereignty. In 2009, Obama spoke in Mubarak’s Egypt as if the region had been oppressed by President Bush rather than by its tyrants. Since then, as he has grudgingly let go of that illusion, he failed when he had the chance to encourage moderate forces to rebel against the old order in Iran and Syria, was flat-footed in Egypt and constantly behind the curve in Libya. He has seemed, at times, more interested in weapons than people, and completely oblivious to the efforts of Iran and its ally Russia to gain regional hegemony. He has managed neither a strong hand controlling events nor to wash his hands of responsibility for them. He has acted less like the world’s policeman than the world’s meter maid, handing out tickets to scofflaws.

On the Right, Jacksonian critics of the neocon project have tended to focus on Islam as an insoluble obstacle to reforming the region, a critique that I’ve written about before as presenting a collision between two longstanding conservative paradigms: the view of human nature as universal and the view of culture as overriding in its importance. But the facts on the ground have mooted that objection, as nobody has a practical solution if the problem is something inherent in the faith of a billion Muslims; we have no choice but to appeal over the heads of culture to the basic human desire for a better life on this earth. Despairing of a solution is no solution at all.

The way forward must focus on seeking to encourage and influence popular movements to proceed in a democratic, pro-freedom, pro-American direction rather than trying to put the Humpty Dumpty of strongmen – nominally respectful of Westphalian borders and disciplined by international sanctions regimes – back together again. The revolution has come; we should do what we can to see to it that the Islamists are not left alone to ride the wave, as they did in Iran in 1979, Afghanistan in 1996 and Egypt in 2011. And there is a role again for realpolitik as well; we should see the proxy battles between Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey as an opportunity to play balance-of-power politics in the region and prevent one side from gaining the upper hand.

After the fire of September 11, the neocon plan for the Greater Middle East brought not peace, but a sword. America doesn’t need to wield that sword in every conflict – this is a fight that affects us and one we can influence, but in the end it is not our fight to win because it is not our people who must make the final choice. But our ability to affect the course of events begins by recognizing that it’s still the neocons’ world, there is no way out of the fire but forward.

Can We Finally Start Talking About The Global Persecution Of Christians?,"Wealthy Kenyans and Westerners bustled about Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi on Saturday. Families ate lunch in the food court. A radio station targeting Kenyan Asians was hosting a children’s event on the roof of the parking lot.

Around noon, armed gunmen stormed the mall and exploded grenades. Thousands of terrified people dropped to the floor, fled out of exits and hid in stores. The gunmen began lining people up and shooting some of the five dozen people they would slaughter and 240 people, ages 2 to 78, that they would wound.

Al-Shabaab, which is claiming credit for the attack, is reported to have singled out non-Muslims. “A witness to the attacks at Nairobi’s upscale mall says that gunmen told Muslims to stand up and leave and that non-Muslims would be targeted,” according to the Associated Press.

To weed out the infidels, according to news reports, the terrorists asked people for the name of Muhammad’s mother or to recite a verse from the Quran.

And that wasn’t even the worst terrorist attack of the weekend.

The Washington Post reported that one British mother and her young children survived when captors who shot her allowed her to leave on the condition she immediately convert to Islam. The siege of the mall, which included the taking of hostages, lasted four days. Three floors of the mall collapsed and bodies were buried in the rubble.

And that wasn’t even the worst terrorist attack of the weekend.

The next day, two suicide bombs went off as Christians were leaving Sunday services at All Saints Anglican Church in Peshawar, Pakistan.

“There were blasts and there was hell for all of us,” Nazir John, who was at the church with at least 400 other worshipers, told the Associated Press. “When I got my senses back, I found nothing but smoke, dust, blood and screaming people. I saw severed body parts and blood all around.”

Some 85 Christians were slaughtered and 120 injured, the bloodiest attack on Christians in Pakistan in history. The hospital ran out of beds for the injured and there weren’t enough caskets for the dead.

“I found nothing but smoke, dust, blood and screaming people. I saw severed body parts and blood all around.”

The situation for Christians in Egypt has also gone from bad to worse. August saw the worst anti-Christian violence in seven centuries. Sam Tadros, a Coptic Christian and author of Motherland Lost, says that there has been nothing like this year’s Muslim Brotherhood anti-Christian pogrom since 1321, when a similar wave of church burnings and persecution caused the decline of the Christian community in Egypt from nearly half of Egypt’s population to its current ten percent.

The violence of just three days in mid-August was staggering. Thirty-eight churches were destroyed, 23 vandalized; 58 homes were burned and looted and 85 shops, 16 pharmacies and 3 hotels were demolished. It was so bad that the Coptic Pope was in hiding, many Sunday services were canceled, and Christians stayed indoors, fearing for their lives. Six Christians were killed in the violence. Seven were kidnapped.

Maalula, Syria, is an ancient Christian town that has been so sheltered for 2,000 years that it’s one of only three villages where people still speak Aramaic, the language of Jesus. Until September 7, when Islamist rebels attacked as part of the civil war ripping through the country.

An eyewitness to the murder of three Christians in Maalula—Mikhael Taalab, his cousin Antoun Taalab, and his grandson Sarkis el Zakhm—reported that the Islamists warned everyone present to convert to Islam. Sarkis answered clearly, Vatican news agency Fides reported: “I am a Christian and if you want to kill me because I am a Christian, do it.”

Sister Carmel, one of the Christians in Damascus who assist Maalula’s many displaced Christians, told Fides, “What Sarkis did is true martyrdom, a death in odium fidei.”

In recent weeks, we have Muslims killing Christians in Kenya, Egypt, Pakistan and Syria. Again.

It’s time to ask an important question that many of us have successfully avoided for far too long:

Can we finally start talking about the global persecution of Christians and other non-Muslims?

Finally? Please?

A case study in reaction

As Paul Marshall, Lela Gilbert and Nina Shea write in Persecuted: The Global Assault on Christians, “Christians are the single most widely persecuted religious group in the world today. This is confirmed in studies by sources as diverse as the Vatican, Open Doors, the Pew Research Center, Commentary, Newsweek and the Economist. According to one estimate, by the Catholic Bishops’ Conferences of the European Community, 75 percent of acts of religious intolerance are directed against Christians.”

How well does the media tell that story? And how did they cover this weekend’s events? As Anglicans and other Christians worldwide grieved the brutal attack in Pakistan, the media… did not. The worst attack on Pakistani Christians in history didn’t make the front page of the New York Times. The Washington Post buried the story on page A7 of Monday’s paper. On the front page of the BBC web site, a small headline “Pakistan church blast kills dozens” was below stories on Angela Merkel and the Emmys. By the next day, the story was nowhere to be found.

British blogger Archbishop Cranmer noted, “Without media coverage we in the West cannot smell the fear of those Christians who are persecuted by Muslims all over the world.”

“Without media coverage we in the West cannot smell the fear of those Christians who are persecuted by Muslims all over the world.”

Even when the media do cover violence against Christians, the religion angle tends to be buried or given short shrift. Part of this is because politicians, who are the primary sources for many of these news stories, don’t have a strong incentive to confront the reality of Muslim violence against non-Muslims (or, to be honest, many other complicated problems). Imran Khan, whose party leads the government in Peshawar, suggested that the church bombing attack wasn’t about religion but, rather, an effort to scuttle peace talks. He also blamed U.S. drone strikes for provoking militants. That’s all all well and good, but violence against Christians goes back even before 2001, when Predator drones armed with Hellfire missiles began to be used in Pakistan to assassinate terrorist leaders and their companions. By about 1300 years.

The Christian Science Monitor asked the promising question, “Why did militants attack Pakistani Christians?” and discovered that, well, it was really just a case of militants of unspecified religion looking for a “controversial” target and “more spectacular, attention-grabbing attacks.” Why the church? Certainly not because of any particular animosity towards Christians—it was just that the Christians were “vulnerable.”

Trying to explain the attack in Kenya, Think Progress published an interesting piece headlined “What The Deadly Attack On A Kenya Mall Was Really About.” It talks about the weakness of al Shabaab and the terror group’s efforts to provoke conflict in Kenya. The words Muslim and Islam do not appear in the article. Another article is headlined “Five Things The Kenya Mall Attack Tells Us About Global Terrorism.” Spoiler alert: The Kenya mall attack doesn’t tell us anything about religious violence.

And what about Egypt? Well, as the persecution of Christians has heated up, the press tends to portray the violence against Christians as “sectarian skirmishes” or “clashes” between religious groups. This is about as accurate as describing the Armenian genocide as “clashes” between Turks and Armenians.

“Islam is peace.”

Right after the worst terrorist attack on American soil on September 11, 2001, American leaders from George W. Bush on down rushed to portray Islam as peaceful. While it’s simplistic to characterize any religion or other belief system as being strictly about “violence” or “peace,” the Bush Administration had a compelling political interest in marginalizing Islamist terrorists and assuring Muslims throughout the world that American reprisals weren’t going to be indiscriminately applied to all practitioners of the religion.

Sure, the terrorists clearly and explicitly claimed they were fighting for Islam. But if Americans responded in agreement, the duty of Muslims to fight for their religion could have quickly led to a global conflagration.

Politicians claiming Islam is nothing more than a peaceful religion usually aren’t exegetical experts.

On September 17, 2001, President George W. Bush stopped by the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., and said, “The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That’s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don’t represent peace. They represent evil and war.”

Twelve years ago in the heat of the moment, this may have made sense, however ill-advised it is for politicians to be taken seriously as theologians (even those who claim Jesus as their favorite political philosopher). But politicians are still doing it. After two Islamist terrorists beheaded a British soldier in the street in front of an elementary school, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg quoted from the Quran and assured everyone that Islam had been “perverted” by soldier Lee Rigby’s murderers, who claimed they were beheading the soldier in the name of Islam.

“Terrorism has no religion because there is no religious conviction that can justify the kind of arbitrary, savage random violence that we saw on the streets of Woolwich,” said Clegg.

That’s very similar to what Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in his statement this weekend: “The terrorists have no religion and targeting innocent people is against the teachings of Islam and all religions.”

Well it’s all settled then! If we could just somehow convey to the Islamist terrorists that they, in fact, have no relationship whatsoever to Islam, we could all just get back to the business of watching Emmys.

One problem with this approach, and I’m not even talking about the 1300 years of history that speaks to the use of violence in pursuit of the spread of Islam, is that the politicians claiming Islam is nothing more than a peaceful religion usually aren’t exegetical experts.

For example, Clegg cited chapter 5, verse 32 of the Quran as “If anyone kills a human being it shall be as though he killed all mankind whereas if anyone saves a life it shall be as though he saved the whole of mankind.”

This is a favorite verse of politicians. (It’s also been used by Bush’s successor, President Barack Obama.) The only problem with using this verse is that people always fail to quote the entire verse, which in this case changes the meaning a bit. And even worse, the verse is excerpted completely out of context. With the caveat that any time you put 12 Muslims, Mormons or Methodists in a room, you might get 12 different explanations for what a verse means, let’s just say that even a reading of the following verse suggests that we’re not exactly in the peaceful section of the Quran:

Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.

One could understand that some Muslims might interpret this in a manner differently than Deputy Prime Minister Clegg. To constantly harp on the fact that most Muslims are not violent obscures the reality that, well, a good number are.

Is 47 million al Qaeda sympathizers a low number, really?

It’s like those Pew polls that come out every two years showing that most Muslims do not, in fact, support al Qaeda. Last year’s release began:

A year after the death of its leader, al Qaeda is widely unpopular among Muslim publics. A new poll by the Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project, conducted March 19 to April 13, 2012, finds majorities – and mostly large majorities – expressing negative views of the terrorist group in Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Turkey and Lebanon.

The media went along with the press release. The Los Angeles Times headline was “Muslims in Middle East, Asia think poorly of Al Qaeda, poll finds.” U.S. News & World Report went with “After bin Laden’s Death, al Qaeda’s Popularity Wanes.” CNN’s story was “Poll: Many Muslims in Mideast, Pakistan have poor view of al Qaeda,” which included this paragraph:

In Pakistan, where U.S. Navy SEALs killed the al Qaeda leader during a raid on a compound a year ago, 55% of the Muslims surveyed had a negative opinion of the terrorist group, according to the poll. Only 13% had a favorable view.

It’s wonderful and important news that the percentage of Muslims in five countries who don’t like al Qaeda is as low as it is. But I think we forgot to notice that it’s still alarmingly high!

Yes, “only” 21 percent of Egyptian Muslims, 15 percent of Jordanian Muslims, 13 percent of Pakistani Muslims, 6 percent of Turkish Muslims and 2 percent of Lebanese Muslims express favorable views toward one particular terrorist group.

But when you think about how those percentages represent 47,284,049 Muslims in only five of the 50 countries in which a majority of the population is Muslim, it becomes a bit more alarming. The poll doesn’t mention support for al Qaeda-linked terrorists in, for example, Indonesia, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia.

Saturday people, Sunday people

We’re talking about Christian persecution by Muslims because of a particularly macabre issue: Jews have already largely been driven out of many Muslim countries.

Lela Gilbert, a journalist who writes about Jewish and Christian persecution, tells of encountering jihadi graffiti in Jerusalem that read “First comes Saturday, then comes Sunday.” She didn’t get the meaning at first. A friend explained that it referred to Jews worshiping on Saturday and Christians on Sunday and, more subtly, about the order that non-Muslims would be targeted.

Gilbert notes that in 1948 there were about 135,000 Jews in Iraq. Now there are fewer than a dozen. In 2003, Iraq had a fairly strong Christian population. Since 2003, more than half of the 800,000 Christians have fled church bombings, rapes, torture, kidnapping, beheading and house eviction.

Or take Egypt. In 1947 there were about 100,000 Jews there. Today there are less than 50, Gilbert says. And Egypt’s Copts — numbering about 8 million — are experiencing the worst anti-Christian pogrom in 700 years. The 30,000 Jews in 1948 Syria are down to less than a dozen. It’s the Christians’ turn.

Preparation before the conversation

Before we can have an actual conversation about the persecution of Christians and others at the hands of Muslims, we have to lay some groundwork. Here are some quick thoughts for journalists, politicians and the Christian Church.

Journalists: Many journalists act as if they can’t report that acts of violence appear to have some kind of Muslim faith behind them because it might inflame anti-Muslim feelings. This reportorial approach is paired with an odd desire to hype any act of “violence” by Christians. This is why the American media will highlight a tiny Florida church burning some Quran while not mentioning that, say, the entire Kingdom of Saudia Arabia confiscates all Bibles at customs and destroys them.

When and where violence occurs involving Muslims and Christians, as it did in Pakistan, Kenya, Syria and Egypt, it is framed as a political conflict, with no examination of the religious details. Not only is this grievously unfair to the Christians who continue to be slaughtered while the rest of the world is busy watching Dancing With The Stars, it’s also a disservice to Islam, whose followers are not monolithic in their persecution of non-Muslims. Many Muslims themselves are persecuted in the name of Muslim violence. To take the most recent example, at least 96 people in Iraq were killed this past weekend when a string of bombs detonated in short order, targeting Shiite funeral-goers. Muslims who defend Christians are a bold lot. Salman Taseer, the Punjab governor, was a vocal opponent of anti-blasphemy laws that target Christians and other religious minorities. For this, he was assassinated in 2011 by his security guard.

It’s not journalists’ job to protect the public from these facts. And if it were, it would be impossible. While the media may think they’ve done a good job of obscuring part of this reality, most people have figured out that a lot of Muslims do support violence as a part of the way of Islam. And they’ve figured out as well that a lot of Muslims don’t. Both groups can appeal to long traditions within Islam for their defense.

It is the job of journalists to convey information about local and world events in all their complexity and nuance. While most media outlets privilege politics over other cultural factors, journalists really need to be cognizant about how ignorance of the role of religion harms news gathering. They should make sure their sources aren’t just politicians. They should make sure their understanding of religion is respectful of the importance it plays in most people’s lives.

Politicians: Politicians need to stop giving speeches that claim to know the heart of Muslims or the true meaning of Islam. It’s offensive and it’s not helping. And if politicians are going to give scolding speeches about religious beliefs, here’s a thought: Less of condemnation of “those who slander the prophet of Islam” and more condemnation of “those who slaughter Pakistani Christians coming out of worship.” Without even getting into whether there is a foreign policy role to play in the persecution of Christians, the American bully pulpit and diplomacy corps could stand to speak more clearly about religious violence. The current model of apologizing for American freedoms is indefensible.

The Christian Church: Whether journalists stop downplaying the facts of the persecution of Christians, Christians need to stay informed. Even if American politicians respond to Islamist violence by apologizing for the freedom of speech and of religion, the church must remain vigilant. And many are. The media didn’t quite pick up on the significance of the event, but Pope Benedict XVI announced the canonization of the Martyrs of Otranto in the same consistory in which he announced his intention to resign the papacy. In May, Pope Francis canonized the 800 Christians, who were beheaded for their faith after Turkish Muslims invaded their city in 1480. In his words, “They had refused to renounce their faith and died confessing the risen Christ.” Most church bodies have prayer guides to help members pray for the persecuted church. And many religious human rights groups work hard to get word out about persecution worldwide. Christians and others interested in stopping religious persecution should ask media outlets to cover news such as the forced conversions, blasphemy persecutions and bombings of Christians.

However much we may wish Muslim violence against Christians would resolve itself or go away, being in denial serves no purpose. To combat the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, we must first acknowledge its existence. And we need to be clear about exactly who is perpetrating violence against Christians and what is motivating them.

Sole Survivor Of Harrowing Religious Cleansing Operation Has A Message,"Late in the evening of November 28 last year, Habila Adamu was at home with his wife and kids in the Yobe state of Northern Nigeria when visitors stopped by. He opened the door, shocked to find gunmen wearing robes and masks.

They demanded he step outside and they peppered him with questions. What was his name? Habila Adamu. Was he a member of the Nigerian police? No. Was he a soldier? No. Was he a member of the state security service? No. He told them he was a businessman.

“OK, are you a Christian?” they asked.

“I am a Christian,” Habila said.

Initially fearful, Habila came to terms with the realization that it was the day of his death. He began praying for strength, forgiveness and salvation.

The gunmen wanted to know why he was not Muslim and told him they’d spare his life if he renounced his faith. His wife begged him to do what he needed to do to live. But he told them he was ready to die as a Christian. Before he could even get the statement out a second time, they shot him in the face.

Everyone thought he was dead. The gunmen began shouting Allah Akbar. His wife began sobbing. Even Habila was waiting for an angel to come and take him to heaven. Somehow he survived — the sole survivor of a Boko Haram attack on all the Christian men in his village.

Habila shares his story — as he did before a Congressional subcommittee on Tuesday and at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday — so that he can tell people that “To live in this world is to live for Christ, to die is gain.” That and, “Do everything that you can to end this ruthless religious persecution in Northern Nigeria.”

It’s the latter message that political Washington is paying attention to this week.

Washington’s New Posture Toward Boko Haram

Boko Haram is the colloquial name of “The Congregation of the People of Tradition for Proselytism and Jihad.” Boko Haram means something like Western education is sinful. The group seeks to establish a pure Islamic state ruled by sharia and to end Western influences. Launched shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the group has ramped up its terror attacks since 2009. Adherents are known for attacking Christians and their churches as well as government targets.

Habila and various other Nigerians and human rights observers were testifying before Congress as part of a years-long attempt to get Boko Haram designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Rep. Chris Smith, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations, was pushing H.R. 3209, the Boko Haram Terrorist Designation Act of 2013.

On the day of the hearing, the State Department so designated Boko Haram and splinter group Ansaru.

It’s about time. President Obama has called the group “one of the most vicious terrorist organizations in the world.” And The State Department last year ranked it as the 2nd deadliest terrorist group worldwide after the Taliban. As CNN reported:

Afghanistan’s Taliban was by far the deadliest group in 2012, when it launched 525 attacks that killed 1,842 people.



The second deadliest group was Nigeria’s Boko Haram, a jihadist group that orchestrated 364 attacks last year that killed 1,132 people.

As Jacob Zenn of the Jamestown Foundation put it in his congressional testimony this week, “If Boko Haram is not [a foreign terrorist organization], then who is?”

Boko Haram has modeled itself after the Taliban. Two years ago it gave Christians three days to leave Northern Nigeria or be killed. Since then, there’s been a systematic campaign of religious cleansing.

In late September, Boko Haram opened fire on sleeping college students in Nigeria, killing 40 of them. Attacks on schools are so prevalent that Education Testing Services just this week indefinitely suspended both the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) in Nigeria “due to security concerns.”

Last year 47 churches were attacked. This year 53 churches have been attacked and 216 people murdered in them.

“September marked the highest death toll since 2009 with deaths in the region of 500 including a rush-hour ambush in which chainsaws were used to decapitate travelers, a school massacre, a military ambush and scorched earth raids on villages in Gwoza,” said human rights activist Emmanuel Ogebe in his testimony.

That month also saw a massacre of some 152 drivers and passengers who were taken out of their cars and had their identification cards checked before being slaughtered. And just this week 26 people were killed in raids on villages and 40 houses were torched in Boko Haram raids.

On Wednesday, the same day the U.S. designated both groups as terrorist, Boko Haram and Ansaru reportedly worked together to kidnap a French priest in Cameroon.

Downplaying religion

Boko Haram characterizes itself as a religious organization motivated by religious beliefs. Adamu Habila’s testimony of his interaction with Boko Haram shows the importance of religion. So do the bombings, beheadings and shootings of Christians, their churches, and other Nigerians who tolerate them.

But the State Department sees things somewhat differently. The Obama Administration isn’t as interested in looking at the religious motivation of Boko Haram as it is interested in getting Nigeria to think of all the other issues that might play a role in the conflict. Or as the Associated Press put it:

The Obama administration has urged Nigeria to develop a comprehensive approach to address the threat by creating a more professional security force, meeting the economic needs of the people in northern Nigeria, adhering to rule of law and government accountability.

Wednesday’s testimony from Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, barely mentioned religion. That she did at all was considered something of a small victory by interested observers. She said that Boko Haram and Ansaru attack “numerous Christians and an even greater number of Muslims,” though she didn’t indicate where she got her numbers. Then she talked about “regional and socioeconomic disparities,” and unemployment:

Boko Haram’s activities call our attention not just to violence, but also to poverty and inequality in Nigeria…



Good governance, healthy political competition, and equitable economic growth would go a long way to address all of these challenges. The strategy for countering Boko Haram should be, in other words, holistic.

This type of rhetoric is typical of the State Department. The previous Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Johnnie Carson, gave a speech the day after an Easter service bombing of a church in Nigeria that left 39 dead last year. He said:

I want to take this opportunity to stress one key point and that is that religion is not driving extremist violence either in Jos or northern Nigeria.

A U.S. foreign policy that encourages interpretation of religious violence as merely the failure of governments to provide services creates false incentives, said Ann Buwalda, executive director of Jubilee Campaign, which focuses on international religious freedom. If poverty or weak government services is the problem, the solutions tend to involve providing aid to the dangerous parties and areas, a subsidization that can reward and strengthen hostile forces more than combat them.

And oversight is key for managing the disbursement of large sums of cash and resources. For instance, USAID gives millions of dollars to Nigeria to support education:

The programs target public, Qur’anic and Islamiyya schools. Qur’anic schools focus on learning the Qur’an and Islamic values while Islamiyya schools integrate classes to build skills in reading local language and numeracy into the traditional Qur’anic curriculum.

Funding madrasas is a stated priority of U.S. aid, but critics suggest that the federal government has no idea what is being taught in Islamiyya schools. The curriculum subsidized by U.S. tax dollars could very well be funding inculcation of values at odds with U.S. foreign policy goals.

For it’s part, Boko Haram has attempted to reassure the State Department that religion does, in fact, drive its extremist violence. Just last week it released a video taking responsibility for the October 24 attack in the northern city of Damaturu that led to the deaths of 35 people. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau didn’t mention unemployment or poorly administered government services, but he did say:

This is a brief message to the world. We carried out the Damaturu attacks with Allah’s help, with Allah’s might, with Allah’s glory and with victory from Allah, the Creator.

There’s no doubt that the religious cleansing in northern Nigeria is a complex problem requiring a multi-faceted response. The testimonies of Habila and Abubakar Shekau speak clearly to the role religion plays in this conflict. Lest it waste taxpayer dollars or perpetuate the very problem it seeks to solve, U.S. foreign policy should not downplay the role that religion plays in the persecution of Christians and others in Northern Nigeria.

For his part, Adamu says he believed he survived so he could get the message out about what’s happening in Northern Nigeria. He asks that the 900 Christians killed this year alone by Boko Haram will not be forgotten.",https://thefederalist.com/2013/11/16/survivor-religious-cleansing/,2013-11-16
Moving the Goalposts in Yemen,"August 2013: The United States allegedly intercepted a message between the emir of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current head of al-Qaida. Multiple prison breaks occurred throughout the region. To top it off, the Islamic holy month of Ramadan was ending. Officials acted quickly, closing more than 22 embassies worldwide for a period of time. The U.S. Embassy in Sana’a, Yemen, in particular, received focused attention: 12 tanks positioned near the building, surrounding roads completely shut down, checkpoints, and Yemen’s elite security forces deployed to the capital. As usual, Yemen is in the news.

A true discussion of the terrorism situation in Yemen, however, is incomplete without understanding the multiple threats to the interim Hadi regime, and before that, the long-lasting Salih regime. It’s too much to explain in a single paragraph the interplay between the Houthi rebellion in the northern part of the country, the southern secessionist movement, the constant attacks against Yemeni pipelines and security forces in the tribal areas, the myriad power players and handouts due to them, and, now, the constant specter of the previous Salih regime haunting any progress achieved by Yemen’s new leader.

Realizing this, the United States wisely has a two-pronged counterterrorism strategy in Yemen. First are the targeted strikes so widely discussed in the media, but the second prong, as the American Enterprise Institute explains it, is to “facilitate the establishment of a stable government in control of a unitary Yemeni state that is willing and able to combat AQAP.” This is a more complicated affair than it may seem. Yemen’s state is far from unitary, stable, willing, or able to combat the terrorism threat. The U.S. continues in this Sisyphean task, however, because of the urgent importance of neutralizing AQAP’s threat to the homeland.

Not to be undone, however, the administration seeks to confirm its commitment to nation-bolstering, publicizing what is in fact a comprehensive approach to not only Yemen’s security, but also its governance and development. Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the world, suffers chronic unemployment, poverty, infant mortality, and dwindling resources. At a 2012 speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, then-chief counterterrorism advisor John Brennan acknowledged this approach will take “many, many years” — perhaps an understatement.

But is that commitment tied utterly to the terrorism threat in Yemen? Likely.

Three years ago, in 2010, I was briefing a defense official regarding al-Qaida in Yemen when he cut in with a question.

“Why,” he asked, piercing me with a stare, “is Yemen suddenly so dangerous? Where in the last year did this threat come from?”

At the time, the question seemed incomprehensibly shortsighted. I had been focused on the terrorism threat in Yemen since 2004. Certainly, terrorism had been an issue for the country since before the USS Cole attack in 2000 and had never quite stopped. But the policymaker’s question revealed a powerful truth: we pay attention to Yemen only when it is an active theater of jihad.

Dear Yemen, we didn’t care about you before. And when this terrorism thing is over, we won’t care about you again.

When, though, will this ‘terrorism thing’ be over? Likely when 1.) AQAP no longer has transnational aspirations against the West and 2.) Sana’a is safe again for diplomats.

Where did this threat come from?

First, let me attempt to belatedly answer the official’s question.

Yemen became a threat to the United States with al-Qaida’s first known terrorist attack — an explosion in an Aden hotel targeted at US servicemen headed to Somalia. The bomb missed its target and instead killed two Australian tourists.

It was December 1992. Al-Qaida had been established three years before. Men connected to al-Qaida already had begun to plan the 1993 World Trade Center attack. Other associated men had assassinated right wing rabbi Meir Kahane in Manhattan in 1990. Al-Qaida had already taken up arms against US servicemen in Somalia.

But December 1992? That was the first instance of a coordinated terror attack planned and executed by an al-Qaida cell. It was not much of a success. And America didn’t take much notice.

Eight years later, a now well-established al-Qaida in Yemen attacked the USS Cole in Aden Harbor, killing 17 US sailors. Ten months earlier, the cell had attempted an attack on the USS The Sullivans, but failed — a plot only discovered after the USS Cole explosion. The investigation of the attack uncovered the truly transnational nature of al-Qaida, highlighting links to the 1998 East Africa embassy bombings and the Malaysia meeting between future 9/11 hijackers.

Al-Qaida at the time was a hub-and-spoke model. Abu Ali al-Harithi was the head of the Yemen spoke. In October 2002 he successfully orchestrated another maritime attack, this time against the French tanker Limburg. In November 2002 he became a smoking crater, courtesy of a Hellfire missile shot by a Predator drone.

For US policymakers, the al-Qaida threat in Yemen was, for all intents and purposes, dead.

Rising from the Ashes

They weren’t wrong. Cutting off the head of the snake withered the entire al-Qaida in Yemen cell. Al-Qaida did not conduct another major attack against US interests in Yemen until the embassy bombing in September 2008. One year later, the al-Qaida cell in Yemen sent Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to blow up an airliner over Detroit. Thus, the ‘sudden’ Yemeni threat.

What comprised the years between 2002 and 2008, however, was not complete barrenness. Al-Qaida in Iraq leader al-Zarqawi had authorized and endorsed attacks in Yemen in 2004 and 2005. Also, al-Qaida had moved from its hub-and-spoke model to a franchising model. No longer did the central organization pick regional leaders and direct attacks. Over time, a regional group emerged, under the leadership of Nassir al-Wahishi. For simplicity’s sake, some intelligence organizations referred to the group as AQY – al-Qaida in Yemen. However, the group did not get an official nod from al-Qaida until almost two years later.

Despite the lack of an official endorsement, AQY walked and talked like an al-Qaida group. Nassir al-Wahishi, a former secretary for bin Laden in Afghanistan, had escaped from a Political Security Office jail with 23 other people in February 2006. His shura council all had al-Qaida-linked transnational jihadist credentials. And the goal of the group was to overthrow the Yemeni regime. Over the next two years AQY would not only conduct attacks against the Salih regime but also against westerners in Yemen. By 2008 AQY was actively planning and executing attacks against the US embassy and diplomatic personnel in Sanaa.

But regional groups do not attract the attention of US policymakers when their activities are confined to their countries. That, perhaps, is a mistake. Even the September 2008 multiple Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device attack against the US Embassy in Sanaa was not enough for a wholescale shift in US counterterrorism policy in Yemen. The creation of a larger peninsular group — al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), comprised of the old AQY, a former split-off group, and a bunch of fugitive Saudi jihadists — did turn more heads. The US military presence in Yemen began to increase. But the hammer wasn’t lowered just yet.

Then came Anwar al-Awlaki, the dual US-Yemeni imam, a vocal advocate of violent jihad against the West. He had returned to Yemen in 2004 and had a few run-ins with Yemeni authorities and with prison sentences. But by 2009, al-Awlaki had become at the very least a prominent mouthpiece for AQAP. His going into hiding in March 2009 indicated a possibly more sinister connection. By his 2011 death, the United States was publicly referring to him as AQAP’s chief of external operations.

Al-Awlaki’s connection to AQAP began to reveal the group’s transnational aspirations. And that is when the US began to act. Under the Authorization for the use of Military Force (AUMF) against terrorists, the United States began authorizing drone strikes. The first was in December 2009. A week later, on Christmas Day, was the attempted bombing of NWA 253.

We know the rest of the story: the continued AQAP plots against the US, the continued drone strikes, the debate over targeted killings, the accusations that US counterterrorism actions were the very thing driving the al-Qaida threat from Yemen. However, regardless of who started it and who escalated it, one thing is now certain: Yemen is an active theater for jihad, and it is one battlefield in our War against Terror.

So, what’s our endgame?

But what does success in Yemen look like? Certainly, we can not hope to completely dismantle al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. Wahishi learned from al-Harithi’s mistakes. As the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point states:

Al-Wihayshi wanted to avoid this outcome the second time around. He adapted Bin Laden’s blueprint to fit the local context, appointing local amirs in different governorates across the country. Al-Harithi never accomplished that level of organization and delegation. Just like Bin Laden, al-Wihayshi constructed a durable infrastructure that was designed to survive the loss of key leaders.

We cannot hope to have total defeat of al-Qaida the way the Saudis managed to defeat al-Qaida in Saudi Arabia. Yemen, unlike Saudi Arabia, has nowhere near the central government reach nor the intelligence capabilities to disrupt cells over and again until no one is left. The complex structure of tribes, families, political allegiances, blood feuds, reparations, and rebellions in Yemen also mean we certainly can not be sure there will be a time ‘no one is left’. Even without a person’s steadfast adherence to al-Qaida, revenge for a cousin’s killing, for example, can drive activities in support of AQAP.

It may happen that al-Qaida cells will continue to take over southern Yemeni cities. Those cells may continue a pattern of jihad against Yemeni security forces. It may happen that Yemen will completely fail as a state. The question I often received when explaining those possibilities was, “Why do we care?” This was not a question asked dismissively, but rather, an invitation to explain why Yemen’s stability is important to the United States.

Hand-wringing over the radicalization of the Yemeni population, the political balance between the northern Huthi rebellion and the southern secessionists, the loss of potable water, the scourge of khat, the outrage over Yemeni child brides, and the general future fate of Yemen as a state misses the key point: right or wrong, the United States will no longer care when it has determined the threat from Yemen has disappeared. Yemen, the poorest Arab state, has no other strategic value to the US.

That is not to say foreign assistance and diplomatic relations will stop: of course not. But the complex multi-pronged strategy toward Yemen will not last when the United States feels secure regarding the threat emanating from its borders. Without a strident transnational threat, Yemen becomes less Pakistan and more Bangladesh.

What will that look like?

First, al-Qaida will no longer stage large-scale plots against the West out of Yemen. Note, I said “the West” itself not Western interests. We’re talking about Yemen being a safehaven for planning and training for transnational attacks.

It is possible this is already coming to fruition. Certainly, the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki and fellow American Samir Khan did not prevent AQAP’s plan to attack the United States in May 2012. The possible original driving forces of AQAP’s fight against the ‘far enemy’ are dead, but bombmaker Ibrahim al-Asiri is not.

In Yemen, the Obama administration’s focus on targeted killings has gone a long way toward eliminating much of the experienced, transnationally-minded AQAP leadership. The whack-a-mole approach to counterterrorism has its critics, and often rightfully so. Killing an operative will just lead to another operative to take his place. In the Yemeni case, however, those waiting in the wings are likely less inclined to plan large-scale attacks in the West. The death of Ibrahim al-Asiri and those he has trained would also eliminate a knowledge base. Al-Asiri allegedly was a target of an August 2013 strike, and was reportedly wounded.

In a 2011 paper published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, the anonymous author — who continues fieldwork and cultivating contacts in the tribal regions of al-Jawf andMarib — takes a slightly different tack. The deaths of Americans Samir Khan and Anwar al-Awlaki, he argues, will do little to diminish the threat to the homeland, as transnational operations are now part of AQAP’s strategic plan. Instead:

AQAP’s unusually capable strategic decision making reveals that the group’s greatest asset is also its most glaring vulnerability. The most direct way to reduce the group’s viability in Yemen, while simultaneously limiting its capacity to attack the United States at home, lies in removing those Yemeni leaders responsible for the group’s operational coherence: Nasir `Abd al-Kareem `Abdullah al-Wahayshi, Qasim Yahya Mahdi al-Raymi, Muhammad Sa`id Ali Hasan al-’Umda and `Adil bin `Abdullah bin Thabit al-`Abab

Regardless of what exactly constitutes AQAP’s center of gravity in regards to homeland strikes, the same argument applies. Ridding Yemen of AQAP entirely is not the answer; targeting the infrastructure and personalities essential to AQAP’s strategy of transnational attacks is.

The administration’s alleged expansion of its ‘signature strike’ criteria to Yemen fits within this narrative, especially given the more stringent measures applied to such strikes in Yemen as opposed to in Pakistan: clear indication an AQAP senior operative’s presence or infrastructure indicating a terrorist training. If we are concerned about the personalities and infrastructure allowing for the planning and training for transnational attacks, taking out obvious training camps will also help eliminate lower-level individuals who may be poised to conduct such attacks.

AQAP, of course, does not just operate in a vacuum. The influence and direction of Ayman al-Zawahiri heavily impacts AQAP’s strategic direction and plans.

However, al-Zawahiri likely is capitalizing on the basic ingredients for transnational jihad already found within the terrorist group. Yemen’s al-Qaida cohort are the only ones in the past few years attempting and almost succeeding with large-scale attacks in the West. With the opportunity gone, al-Zawahiri will likely instead continue endorsing what al-Qaida’s plots have become: attacks against Western and host nation interests within a country, and small-scale attacks in the West.

The latter types of attacks are of the ‘open source jihad’ variety, a concept advocated by AQAP propagandist Samir Khan. Not planned or directed by al-Qaida, perpetrators of open-source jihad in the West are self-selecting and use al-Qaida merely as inspiration — Nidal Hassan and Fort Hood, for example.

The August 2013 worldwide shuttering of multiple Western embassies, allegedly based on a conversation between al-Zawahiri and Nassir al-Wahishi, underscore the former: attacks within a host country against the West. Targeted killings will likely not lead to the end of this threat, the bread and butter of most regional groups. Purportedly, the August 2013 threat was to foreign oil workers, a common target. Will we be able to make Yemen safe for Westerners? Likely not.

However, the force protection status of Sana’a, Yemen’s capital city, is illustrative of how far south the safety of westerners in Yemen has gone. American diplomats used to be able to live on the economy, shop at the local grocery store, and drive around without having to think of alternating routes for each trip. Then an AQY spinoff began active plans to attack the US Embassy. It almost succeeded in March 2008, with mortars missing their intended target and instead landing in the yard of the next-door girls’ school, killing two and wounding 19. The next month they attacked a fortified western housing compound, home to oil workers and to some embassy employees. In September multiple car bombs exploded at the embassy, killing 13 innocents.

Still, throughout the pattern of authorized departures and force protection restrictions, Sana’a still held a sense of security. Then the targeted attacks began within the capital city began. Four South Korean tourists had been killed at a site outside Sanaa in March 2009. Just three days later, in Sana’a, a suicide bomber targeted a convoy of South Korean investigators and relatives of the victims. In April 2010, British ambassador Tim Torlot survived a suicide bombing aimed at his car. That October, his deputy faced a mortar attack on her vehicle. Two years later, the 20-year security chief for the US Embassy, a Yemeni, was assassinated on his way to work. A year after that, this October 2013, a possible kidnapping plot against the German ambassador led to the death of her bodyguard outside a supermarket in an upscale neighborhood of the city.

It may not seem like a lot, but the attacks reflect the current security situation in the city. The feeling of siege continued with the massive violent protests outside the US embassy in 2012, during which a couple of hundred young men ripped the embassy’s sign from the outer wall, torched tires and a couple of vehicles, burned the American flag and breached the outer gates of the security entrance. A few months later, AQAP announced a $160,000 bounty in gold for the killing of the American ambassador to Yemen and $23,000 for the deaths of American soldiers in Yemen, in order “to encourage and inspire jihad.”

Today, US diplomats live in a sort of modified green zone, no longer residing in large houses in the upscale neighborhood on the other side of the city and instead camping out in buildings next to the embassy. For example, in recent years, only one hotel, the aging Sheraton near the embassy, was approved for visitors. This structure is now under the lease of the State Department.

Until Sanaa stops feeling like a war zone, Yemen’s plight may still hold the US’s attention. Perception is a powerful thing. Only continued coordination with the Hadi government and the full cooperation of the security officers, including the armed cop on the street, can ameliorate the situation. And that, on the end, may be the best argument for a multifaceted strategy toward Yemen.

"Street Gangs, Poverty And The Left","The best way to measure the sincerity of the left’s messianic mission to save the black poor from the damnation of America’s “vicious caste system of racism” is to examine how often they call for “discourse”, attempt to “raise consciousness”, and hold signs to battle the actual causes of poverty.

Considering that the answer is never, such an investigation might better contribute to the cause of tuning out unproductive, irritating voices the way a parent behind the wheel of a car ignores the petulant child in the backseat when he whines, for the fifteenth time in as many minutes, “Are we there yet?”

Whenever a reasonable observer of upward mobility offers measured criticism of the cultural norms within poor groups of people that sabotage opportunities for success, and keep people trapped within the isolation chamber of family breakdown, government dependency, and teen pregnancy, the political, academic, and journalistic left react with the predictable bromides and accusations of bigotry, “privilege”, and hatred for the poor. Congressman Paul Ryan, whose pigmentation is proof of his evil intentions, and Bill Cosby, Michelle Obama, and John McWhorter, whose skin tones…oh, wait nevermind, are not really providing experiential and evidential distinctions between the behavioral patterns most likely to result in poverty and those most likely to create self-reliance, they are “blaming the victims.”

Despite that such sanctimony depends upon sustained ignorance of elementary history, economics, and sociology, the resistance to blaming people one believes are “victims”, even if that belief is misguided and misinformed, is emotionally understandable. But what about blaming the culprits? The criminal offenders who, in a commitment to callousness and cruelty, exploit, rob, rape, and murder the poor, and do everything in their power to keep the streets of their neighborhoods barren, and the families who walk them miserable?

Well, that’s a problem too.

Domestic terrorist units

When it comes to urban planning and neighborhood development, “safety first” is more than a driver’s ed slogan. Without safety, there is no commerce, and without safety, there is no education. Street gangs transform the impoverished inner cities into warzones, and in doing so, not only inflict brutal pain and despair on their neighbors, but undermine any attempt at economic growth and communal uplift.

The appellation “street gang” sounds too innocuous to accurately depict their program of torture and torment. They are domestic terrorist units. They do not hesitate to spray crowded corners with bullets, intimidate witnesses into silence, and rule over their streets with the merciless violence and aggression of any warlord. They ply their trade by exploiting, and thereby expanding, the suffering of drug addicts, and they do not have the minimal level of humanity and decency that prevents most killers and thieves from harming children. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel hired hundreds of “safe passage workers” in 2013 to help the police monitor and supervise children walking to school – most of who were frightened that if their route required them to cross into rival territory, a domestic terrorist would beat, mug, or rape them. Street gang sadists have reduced themselves to systematically terrorizing children. There is no word but “evil” that adequately captures the comprehensive wickedness of the Crips, Bloods, Gangster Disciples, and other professional torturers, posing, with the help of pop culture, as hip rebels.

Modern, American domestic terrorists operate under a shield of protection crafted by the ignorance of the left. The Chicago Police Department estimates that eighty percent of its shootings are gang related. An intellectual mystery equally intractable as any crime scene is why no liberal shouter or politician who harangues everyone within ear shot about “saving just one child” with useless gun control regulations spends any time talking about the overwhelming majority of people who use guns to kill children.

The biggest threat to the black child on the city streets is not a “white Hispanic” weirdo like George Zimmerman, or even a bigot with a badge, but the black street gang member.

The biggest threat to the black child on the streets of Chicago, Los Angeles, Baltimore, or any other American city, is not a “white Hispanic” weirdo like George Zimmerman, or even a bigot with a badge, but the black street gang member. Liberals in the media hammered the public into the ground with daily exhortations for action during the Zimmerman fiasco, but rarely, if ever, mention the murderers who threaten and even assault children, not carrying Skittles, but book bags.

Worse than the liberal refusal to acknowledge the existence of the turf warriors, who viciously enforce color codes and territorial claims, is the implicit approval they give for them when they sentimentalize the issue, break out the world’s smallest violin, and discuss “strain theory” and the street gang as the predictable result of racism and income inequality.

The predator prepared to turn children into orphans and women into widows is simply a misunderstood “victim” of urban decay, unemployment, and unjust educational apartheid. If only the serial killers and crack dealers had decent “jobs training programs”, they would put down their toys, and begin to play nice.

The perpetuation of poverty

Moral relativism, masquerading as cheap sociology, leads to the sloppy and irresponsible conflation of violent offenders with the law abiding, hard working poor. If the gang banger is simply the result of “neoliberal capitalism”, how would the left account for the single mom working two jobs, the young man in high school who studies and applies for college, or anyone who grows up in the ghetto, black and poor, and resists the temptation to kill people?

In a rare moment of bipartisanship, Senators Mark Kirk (R) and Dick Durbin (D) of Illinois met with attorneys from the Department of Justice to request federal funding and personnel assistance in Chicago law enforcement’s struggle against the scourge of street gangs. They advocated a federal level crackdown on gang violence, understanding that the only way to deal with domestic terrorism is to eliminate it. Congressman Bobby Rush bashed the proposal and branded the Senators as “elitist, white boys.” Naturally, he punctuated his stupid and destructive remarks with a perfunctory demand for “jobs and education.”

There is little doubt or debate that the inner cities are in desperate need of better performing, high quality, and functional schools, and that they could use a heavy dosage of the jobs that come with commerce. Pointing out the obvious doesn’t make a race baiting Congressman heroic anymore than it makes a highly paid cable commentator intellectual. It does make the Congressman disingenuous and the cable commentator ignorant when it ignores or includes a defense of the domestic terrorist units dedicated to demolishing any improvement in education or development of business.

What sane entrepreneur would risk robbery, vandalism, or even death to open a store or office in gang territory? What good are excellent schools, staffed with brilliant teachers, if students are afraid to walk to class?

These questions, which exist among many, demonstrate that the street gang is not a product of poverty as much as it is the producer of it. The street gang criminal is not the victim of injustice as much as he is the cause of it. Anyone who refuses to acknowledge that elemental truth of urban America is tacitly endorsing the perpetuation of poverty and the continuation of injustice.

Some Democratic politicians in Chicago not only give implicit approval for the street gang, but benefit from the criminal domination of poor neighborhoods. In December of 2011, Chicago magazine reported on several city alderman, state legislators, and elected judges – all Democrats as the party holds the city’s politics, figuratively, and in this case, literally, at gun point – “routinely seek support from street gangs”, and once they have it, “quietly trade money and favors for mutual gain.”

The report, relying on several community activists, law enforcement agents, and unnamed city officials as sources, describes a “shadowy network of corruption” in which “gangs funnel their largess through opaque businesses, or front companies, and through under-the-table payments,” and also, with typical subtlety and civility, mobilize support for friendly politicians come election time.

The overwhelming majority of poor people in the inner cities – those who the left routinely lumps in with gangsters – would benefit from a more robust economy and more effective school system.

In return, “Some politicians ignore the gangs’ criminal activities. Some go so far as to protect gangs from the police, tipping them off to impending raids or to surveillance activities—in effect, creating safe havens in their political districts. And often they chafe at backing tough measures to stem gang activities, advocating instead for superficial solutions that may garner good press but have little impact.”

Sound familiar?

Although the report does not identify Rush, one cannot help but wonder what truly motivated his indignation when two Senators from his state proposed “tough measures to stem gang activities.”

Speculation aside, it is now easy to conclude that the Democratic Party and the liberal media and academy have forfeited any claim to the moral high ground on the issue of poverty in the inner cities, and as long as they continue to provide intellectual cover for the domestic terrorism that creates it, and in some cases, directly aid and abet its worst culprits, have no right to even enter the moral universe.

The overwhelming majority of poor people in the inner cities – those who the left routinely lumps in with gangsters – would benefit from a more robust economy and more effective school system. The drug dealing, drive by shooting terrorists who target the innocent do not need, or deserve, assistance form the welfare state, opportunities for employment, or pell grants. They deserve to feel the consequences of a State that finds a practical, feasible, and ethical way to exercise the advice of one of America’s greatest authors. Ernest Hemingway writes in his classic book of sports journalism and philosophy on bullfighting, Death In the Afternoon, that good people could cure most of the world’s social ills by grabbing their guns, and having a three day open season on bad people. We need policies which understand the menace gangs truly represent – and we’re not going to get it from policymakers who refuse to acknowledge this truth.

Can Hillary Clinton Recover From Her Support Of The Iraq War?,"With the news that Condoleeza Rice has been hounded from a commencement speaking engagement at Rutgers University by left-wing faculty and student protests on the grounds that Rice “had played ‘a prominent role in the administration’s effort to mislead the American people about the presence of weapons of mass destruction’ in Iraq,” the question that haunted Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign must be asked again: can the Democratic base ever forgive her support for launching that war? The answer, in all likelihood, is that the Democratic Party’s base will forgive and forget – not only out of political expediency and ignorance of history but because, deep in their hearts, they do not really believe their own extreme rhetoric about the Iraq War.

Hawks of a Feather

Unquestionably, if you take the campaign against Rice on its own terms – that “misleading” the nation to war over Saddam’s WMD programs is a war crime or something like it, making one ineligible to be received in polite company – Hillary is similarly guilty. Consider how then-Senator Clinton herself justified that vote:

In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001.



It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.



…In the case of Iraq, recent comments indicate that one or two Security Council members might never approve force against Saddam Hussein until he has actually used chemical, biological, or God forbid, nuclear weapons.



…While the military outcome is not in doubt, should we put troops on the ground, there is still the matter of Saddam Hussein’s biological and chemical weapons. Today he has maximum incentive not to use them or give them away. If he did either, the world would demand his immediate removal. Once the battle is joined, however, with the outcome certain, he will have maximum incentive to use weapons of mass destruction and to give what he can’t use to terrorists who can torment us with them long after he is gone. We cannot be paralyzed by this possibility, but we would be foolish to ignore it. And according to recent reports, the CIA agrees with this analysis.



…perhaps my decision is influenced by my eight years of experience on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue in the White House watching my husband deal with serious challenges to our nation. I want this President, or any future President, to be in the strongest possible position to lead our country in the United Nations or in war…I want to insure that Saddam Hussein makes no mistake about our national unity and for our support for the President’s efforts to wage America’s war against terrorists and weapons of mass destruction.



…Over eleven years have passed since the UN called on Saddam Hussein to rid himself of weapons of mass destruction as a condition of returning to the world community. Time and time again he has frustrated and denied these conditions.

The hairsplitting defense typically offered by those who wish to drive Rice and other senior Bush officials from civilized society while pledging their votes, money and support to make Hillary the next President is that Hillary was just one Senator, following the Bush Administration’s lead. Now, if you regard the Iraq War as a question of ordinary politics and statesmanship, that might be a defense, albeit one that shouldn’t inspire confidence in Hillary’s judgment among diehard critics of the war. But if your actual, serious opinion is that the war is some sort of war crime, “I was only following the leaders” is pretty well-recognized as not being a defense.

And besides that, Hillary was not just any Senator. She had been the First Lady of the recently-departed Administration for eight years, and as her floor speech alluded, she was trading on the credibility that came from her husband dealing with intelligence reports on Saddam’s WMD programs throughout those years. Moreover, the Democrats were leaderless and deeply divided in 2002. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, Senate Majority Whip Harry Reid, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, 2000 Vice Presidential nominee Joe Lieberman and 1988 presidential candidate Joe Biden were supporting the war, but 2000 Presidential nominee Al Gore, House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi, and Senate “liberal lion” Ted Kennedy were opposed. In that setting, the Clintons – the first two-term Democratic president since FDR and his wife – were still de facto the most popular and influential figures in the party. A vigorous statement of opposition to the war by Hillary, bearing at least the implicit imprimatur of her husband (her chief national security adviser at the time), would have carried enormous weight. And with Democratic control of the Senate until the 2002 elections, those votes were critical

Why did she choose, instead, to support and justify a war that Democratic partisans now regard as a war crime, beyond the pale of civilized discourse and disagreement? The New York Times suggested in 2007 that it was her fear of gender politics: “Clinton knew she could never advance her career — or win the presidency, especially — if she didn’t prove that she was tough enough to be commander in chief. Female candidates, it’s presumed, have often suffered as a result of the stereotype that they could never be as strong as men.” That’s a terrible reason to vote to send a nation to war. But as her speech and conduct at the time made clear, there was likely more that went into her thinking than that – thinking not so different, after all, from that of the Bush Administration.

I Read Your Book

In 1998, in the midst of a decade of sanctions on Saddam’s regime, WMD intelligence combined with Saddam’s refusal to cooperate with required weapons inspections had led President Clinton to launch a large-scale air strike against Iraq aimed entirely at suspected WMD sites, as described by President Clinton’s Defense Secretary at the time:

During the course of DESERT FOX, American and British war planes flew more than 650 strike and strike support sorties. Our ships launched more than 325 Tomahawk cruise missiles and U.S. Air Force B-52s launched more than 90 cruise missiles. In all, we attacked almost 100 targets, all related to our overall mission objectives….With respect to the manufacture of chemical and biological agents, as I’ve indicated time and time again, our goal was to diminish his capacity to deliver such chemicals or biological or even nuclear weapons and to strike those facilities we could identify that possibly solely produced them. But we were always conscious of the fact that you could have a facility inside of a hospital or a fertilizer plant, a dual use facility, and we took that into account in seeking to balance the need to reduce his capacity to pose a threat to the region and at the same time, not engaging in the wholesale destruction of the Iraqi people.

The conclusion from that presser? It wasn’t over:

Q: Secretary Cohen, regarding the inspectors, in addition to the UNSCOM inspectors, who call themselves in effect, the IA — International Atomic Energy Agency Inspectors, have also been required to leave Iraq and it’s believed by some they also may not be able to return. And those inspectors were widely considered effective. I mean, is that a price you’re going to have to pay, now having done what you’ve done?

A: Saddam will have to make a determination as to whether or not he’s prepared to fully cooperate with those inspectors as well. To the extent that they remain outside of Iraq, there will be no chance of closing any files in the future. And so, the sanctions, again, will continue to remain in place. So he does not benefit from keeping them out, and he does not benefit from keeping the UNSCOM team out either.

Q: He benefits in terms of an ease[ing] in developing a nuclear program.

A: Well, we are going to continue to watch him very closely. We have — we will make every effort to compensate for the lack of those inspectors. But by the same token, he is going to be precluded from getting relief from the sanctions and that is very important to him. He wanted to get the inspectors out and get relief from the sanctions. He may have gotten the inspectors out at least temporarily. He will not get relief from the sanctions.

Q: Do you think it’s just a matter of time before the United States will have to conduct another such operation against Iraq?

A: Wouldn’t want to speculate on that. We’re prepared to conduct future military operations, but that will depend upon Saddam’s actions.

Of course, those actions had not improved between 1998 and 2002; that’s one reason why even Gore, in a debate with George W. Bush in 2000, had pledged that “I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein.” The intelligence community throughout the United States and around the globe, from one country to the next, agreed in 1998 and still agreed in 2002 that Saddam had non-trivial WMD capabilities and was scheming to obtain more, and scores of leading Democrats believed the same thing. That was the view of the Clinton Administration before Desert Fox, and it continued to be the view of U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies after Desert Fox:

[T]he German Federal Intelligence Service held the bleakest view of all, arguing that Iraq might be able to build a nuclear weapon within three years. Israel, Russia, Britain, China, and even France held positions similar to that of the United States; France’s President Jacques Chirac told Time magazine [in February 2003], “There is a problem—the probable possession of weapons of mass destruction by an uncontrollable country, Iraq. The international community is right … in having decided Iraq should be disarmed.”

Indeed, Saddam’s possession of usable stocks of WMD was believed at the time by senior figures in Iraq’s own military, who were stunned when Saddam disclosed to them in December 2002 that he lacked chemical or biological stockpiles. And from what we learned later on, much of the fault for misunderstanding lay with Saddam himself. He contended, after his capture, that he had deliberately tried to give the appearance of having WMD in order to deter Iran. Ironically, later U.S. analyses found that Saddam’s frantic efforts to scrub former WMD sites in order to give selective access to inspectors had been interpreted as a different kind of cover-up. The very scope of Saddam’s earlier WMD programs made the task of securing all its weapons daunting – a Wikileaks release of previously-secret documents in 2010 illustrated that “for years after [2003], U.S. troops continued to find chemical weapons labs, encounter insurgent specialists in toxins and uncover weapons of mass destruction”:

In August 2004, for instance, American forces surreptitiously purchased what they believed to be containers of liquid sulfur mustard, a toxic “blister agent” used as a chemical weapon since World War I. The troops tested the liquid, and “reported two positive results for blister.” The chemical was then “triple-sealed and transported to a secure site” outside their base.



…Meanwhile, the second battle of Fallujah was raging in Anbar province. In the southeastern corner of the city, American forces came across a “house with a chemical lab … substances found are similar to ones (in lesser quantities located a previous chemical lab.” The following day, there’s a call in another part of the city for explosive experts to dispose of a “chemical cache.”



Nearly three years later, American troops were still finding WMD in the region. An armored Buffalo vehicle unearthed a cache of artillery shells “that was covered by sacks and leaves under an Iraqi Community Watch checkpoint. “The 155mm rounds are filled with an unknown liquid, and several of which are leaking a black tar-like substance.” Initial tests were inconclusive. But later, “the rounds tested positive for mustard.”

And what Saddam was actually doing was hardly harmless. For example, the Congressional testimony of Iraq Study Group head David Kay emphasized some of the threats presented even by a more accurate post-invasion picture of what Saddam had been up to:

Iraq made determined efforts to retain some capabilities for biological warfare. It maintained an undeclared network of laboratories and other facilities within the apparatus of its security services, and as Kay put it, “this clandestine capability was suitable for preserving BW expertise, BW-capable facilities, and continuing R&D—all key elements for maintaining a capability for resuming BW production.” To disguise its biological-warfare programs Baghdad had scientists working on overt projects that were closely related to proscribed activities.



Iraq seemed to have been most aggressive in pursuing proscribed missiles. In Kay’s words, “detainees and cooperative sources indicate that beginning in 2000 Saddam ordered the development of ballistic missiles with ranges of at least [240 miles] and up to [620 miles] and that measures to conceal these projects from [UN inspectors] were initiated in late 2002, ahead of the arrival of inspectors.” The Iraqis were also working on clustering liquid-fueled rocket engines in order to produce a longer-range missile, and were trying to convert certain surface-to-air missiles into surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 150 miles. Most troubling of all, the ISG uncovered evidence that from 1999 to 2002 Iraq had negotiated with North Korea to buy technology for No Dong missiles, which have a range of 800 miles.

Even after his capture, Saddam insisted to his FBI interrogator that he had planned to reconstitute his entire WMD program – chemical, biological, and nuclear. His efforts to corrupt and emasculate the sanctions regime gave him hope – not an irrational hope – that this strategy would prevail.

Subsequent efforts to condemn the truthfulness of the Bush Administration and the Blair and Howard governments in the U.K. and Australia have tended to focus on the existence of disagreements in the intel community over particular pieces of evidence and the timelines that could be drawn from them. And indeed, there were many such dissents at the time, and more than a few items of evidence that look flimsy or worse with hindsight. But the trees should not be mistaken for the forest. The people who thought the intelligence was completely wrong about Saddam’s WMD programs were, for the most part, people who had no clearance to read any of it. Even Barack Obama, who defeated Hillary in 2008 in part by deploying the Iraq vote against her, refused when running for the Senate in 2004 to say he would have voted against the Iraq War if he had had access to classified intelligence at the time, and insisted, as the battle shifted to countering the insurgency, that “There’s not much of a difference between my position on Iraq and George Bush’s position at this stage” – hardly the language of a crime against humanity. Even Obama had to resort to revisionist history on the issue of WMD intelligence; there’s no record of him questioning before the war whether Saddam had WMD. Here’s what State Senator Obama said at the time:

Now let me be clear – I suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal man. A ruthless man. A man who butchers his own people to secure his own power. He has repeatedly defied UN resolutions, thwarted UN inspection teams, developed chemical and biological weapons, and coveted nuclear capacity….Let’s fight to make sure that the UN inspectors can do their work, and that we vigorously enforce a non-proliferation treaty, and that former enemies and current allies like Russia safeguard and ultimately eliminate their stores of nuclear material, and that nations like Pakistan and India never use the terrible weapons already in their possession, and that the arms merchants in our own country stop feeding the countless wars that rage across the globe.

In the end, the argument against American policymakers, in the Bush and Clinton camps alike, is that they committed a war crime by failing to read more closely and skeptically the particulars of specific items of evidence in order to call into question the intra- and inter-governmental consensus. But if that is your thesis, it’s hard to excuse Senator Clinton, who apparently did not even read the 90-page National Intelligence Estimate, according to some reports due to the fact that she only had 10 days in which to read it. Given that the NIE was less than a tenth the length of the Affordable Care Act, one is nostalgic for the days when Senators were asked to do so much less reading – and yet, it was too much for her to digest.

Causes and Reasons

If anything, Senator Clinton’s reliance on the WMD rationale is considerably more culpable, viewed through the lens of “war guilt,” than that of the Bush Administration, because it was much more central to her decision. Liberal ire over WMD intelligence was so acute because Democrats and liberals who did support the war – Hillary among them – did so almost entirely as an exercise in disarmament, consistent with the broader liberal tendency to view both war and crime as a question of weaponry rather than a question of behavior.

By contrast, conservative and Republican supporters of the war inside and outside the Bush Administration always saw the WMD issue as merely one part of a broader set of arguments for war. I’ve previously addressed the grand strategy behind that view, which focused on igniting a disruptive regional revolution that would unsettle the corrupt and oppressive status quo across the Greater Middle East and end the dynamic by which that region’s “secular” and religious leaders alike directed terrorism outwards in order to distract from their stagnant despotisms at home. But there were specific reasons as well, which fall under three general headings:

1. The U.S. and Iraq were still formally at war in 2002. The 1991 Gulf War did not end with a peace treaty; it ended with a cease-fire conditioned on Iraq’s compliance with a number of U.N. resolutions, and Iraq was failing to comply with several of those, including shooting at U.S. airplanes enforcing the no-fly zone, refusing to cooperate with weapons inspections, and funding Palestinian terrorists outside its borders. Every element of the decision to go to war with Iraq in 2002-03 must be evaluated in light of this posture. The issue in 2002 was not whether to pre-emptively invade a nation with which we were at peace, but whether to accept, after a decade of Saddam flouting these terms, that we simply would not enforce them – with all the consequences that entailed for the credibility of future agreements with the U.S.

2. Saddam cheered the 9/11 attacks and openly supported terrorism. The September 11 terrorist attacks were such an unprovoked atrocity that regimes around the world, even those implacably hostile to the United States, rushed to offer their support, their sympathy, or at least their willingness to disassociate themselves from the attacks. Almost alone in the world, though, Iraq’s state-run media openly celebrated the attacks while the wounds were still raw. The Ba’athist regime put up murals cheering the attacks. While even Qaddafi, Arafat and (disingenuously) the Taliban were offering condolonces, Saddam was gloating:

Saddam Hussein’s Iraq said the United States deserved Tuesday’s attacks in New York and Washington as the fruits “of its crimes against humanity.”



Under the headline “America burns,” the official newspaper Al-Iraq said that “what happened in the United States yesterday is a lesson for all tyrants, oppressors and criminals.”



Overnight an official Iraqi statement said: “The American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity.”

For myself, I took rather personally people cheering for attempts at murdering me. President Bush undoubtedly felt the same way, given that Saddam had hired terrorists to blow up George H.W. Bush on a 1993 visit to Kuwait:",https://thefederalist.com/2014/05/19/can-hillary-clinton-recover-from-her-support-of-the-iraq-war/,2014-05-19
Shelby Steele On Race And The Exhilaration And Terror Of Freedom,"One of the most vomitous and hideous regressions of American culture is the eager embrace of victimhood as a means of self-identification from Americans of seemingly all ages and races. Attendance is down at professional baseball games, perhaps because America’s new pastime is the effort to understand yourself as a victim of “income inequality,” “white privilege,” or some other dubious buzzword that substitutes for its more accurate descriptor – self-pity. Academic jargon and liberal sentimentalization provide a cover story for people who find perverse enjoyment in believing and acting as if they are victims. In their drive to illustrate the defeatism of their philosophy, “to be human is to be a victim,” they reject the empowerment accessible through an acknowledgement of their agency, and their ability of overcome adversity to achieve.

Shelby Steele, the great social critic and political commentator, makes the point that the Civil Rights Movement has such resounding beauty and inspirational force because it was entirely self-generated. Its spirit of dignity and integrity lived within an independent body. Martin Luther King, Fred Shuttlesworth, Rosa Parks, and the millions of activists and artists they represented received little governmental assistance. In fact, at most times, they encountered vicious government resistance. The heroes of the Civil Rights era were not people quick to identify as victims, but warriors willing to face down the most cruel and bloodthirsty enemy, and prevail. Steele, an African-American born and raised in Harvey, Illinois, is a veteran of the black freedom struggle, and now continues the work as a fellow at the Hoover Institution.

Comparing the Civil Rights personification of strength with the weakness of trigger warnings, seminars on white privilege, and the whining of occupiers, makes one wonder if a large portion of America has fallen under the spell of some difficult-to-diagnose disorder of the psyche. In such confusing times, it is wise to turn to a man whose brilliance and bravery qualifies him for the task of performing a psychiatric evaluation better than most. Recently, I had the honor and thrill of speaking with Shelby Steele – author of the classics The Content of Our Character, White Guilt, and a forthcoming book on “the polarization of America” – on the phone about race, conservatism, liberalism, President Obama, and the exhilaration and terror of freedom.

Steele quickly undressed the ethos of an unending episode of “America’s Biggest Loser” that seems to define our cultural transformation by going beyond politics, and directing a flashlight directly on the darker corners of human behavior: “One has to go to human nature. There’s a part of human nature when people – particularly young people or minorities – who have very little experience in the mainstream or experience being responsible for their own advancement in the mainstream, are afraid. In other words, they wonder if they won’t be able to make it on their own. When you go through six years of an economic downturn where jobs are scarce, people are insecure. Then, the idea that ‘I’m a victim of someone else’s greed or cruelty or indifference’, is seductive.”

“We say, ‘we’re for individual responsibility.’ Well, guess what? That’s not the most appealing position for a 23 year old straight out of college without a job.”

The seduction leads to a flirtation with self-abdication, and allows for the calming of self-doubt, but it conceives a certain brand of politics and political reform. Steele explains, “Once you say you are a victim, you can then say, ‘I’m going to get things. I’m going to get health care. I’m going to get subsidies here and there. I’m going to get’.” “It’s an incentive system and it’s effective,” Steele said with an anxious laugh, “and it makes me nervous for the conservative side, because we don’t offer those seductive, but empty promises. We say, ‘we’re for individual responsibility.’ Well, guess what? That’s not the most appealing position for a 23 year old straight out of college without a job. He wants to believe that income inequality is driving his reality, and if he believes that, he’s going to want the Democratic machinery to move him forward.”

In my conversation with David Mamet (a friend of Steele’s), the legendary playwright identified one of the tasks of a healthy society as giving young people the opportunity to pass tests, and steadily replace the “fear of matriculation” with the “memory of physical accomplishment.”

The understandable and universal fear of matriculation has morphed into a fear of meritocracy, and an emphasis on victimization, no matter how invented or convoluted, is the result. It provides an alibi for absence, and a trapdoor for escape from any system of responsibility, accountability, or judgment.

“… freedom is the most terrifying thing in the world, because what freedom says is, ‘It’s all on you now.’”

“As a black American, I saw very vividly in the 1960s when we won the Civil Rights legislation and Voting Rights – That constituted a real victory, and it gave us our first experience of freedom,” Steele explained. “We were vastly freer than we ever were before. What everybody at that time missed – I certainly did – is that freedom is the most terrifying thing in the world, because what freedom says is, ‘It’s all on you now.’ Freedom sits there in judgment of you, and makes you feel extremely inadequate if you don’t have the values and skills necessary to thrive in freedom. So, we were right away seduced by the idea that we can be spared the idea of individual responsibility with the Great Society. When we scream that we are victimized all the time, it spares us the terror of freedom.”

I once taught for several years at a predominantly black high school. The experience forced a collision between my ideology and reality, given that I was liberal and suffered from white guilt. Black students – like white students – fail or succeed according to their own merit, skill, and diligence, and the most important factor shaping their capacity for success is their familial upbringing. To continue to believe that black people are noble victims desperately in need of help in perpetuity is to relegate them to roles of infancy, and to transform white liberals, bureaucrats, and politicians into parents. The history of African Americans – from Duke Ellington to Barack Obama – is not only a history of oppression, but a history of accomplishment. Encouraging young black Americans to embrace victimhood and fear freedom is to encourage them to retreat back into the womb, but it is at the heart of the entire liberal program – a program that, in the soft language of pity and charity – calls black people “inferior.”

“… we were lucky enough to come along just before the seductive voice of white guilt started whispering to us that we were victims.”

“It’s worse than oppression was,” Steele said referring to the peddling of victimhood, “I grew up under segregation, and no one saw us as victims. No one cared about us one way or the other, which left us free to pursue our own lives, even if we were so constricted. In the community where I grew up, everybody had a father in the home. Everybody worked. This was a very poor, black neighborhood on the Southside of Chicago. Many of the children I grew up with became doctors and professors. The kid across the alley became the head of the FBI for Western America. One started a supermarket chain in Texas. There are so many enormously successful people, and that’s because we were lucky enough to come along just before the seductive voice of white guilt started whispering to us that we were victims. My parents certainly never gave an inch for that. You got good grades in school and you worked hard. If you weren’t getting good grades, it was on you. This is very simple, but it is very profound.”

The profundity and simplicity of rugged individualism is politically no match, according to Steele, for the “poetic truth” that “drives the left.” “It is a truth”, Steele said, “that bends the truth in order to make a certain point. So, this claim that America is still a structurally and systemically racist society is a poetic truth. There’s very little actual evidence to support that claim, but it is a claim that, given American history, seems plausible on its face. The left, then, wants to embrace that plausibility, wants to build a politics out of it, wants to pursue power out of it, wants to reconstruct society, and social engineer based on a perception of America that is no longer true.”

“The left, then, wants to embrace that plausibility, wants to build a politics out of it, wants to pursue power out of it, wants to reconstruct society, and social engineer based on a perception of America that is no longer true.”

One of the most amusing and infuriating ironies of American culture is that liberal pundits and boring politicians continually call for a “national conversation on race” in the middle of national conversations on race, whether they are provoked by George Zimmerman or Donald Sterling. There is the foul whiff of desperation surrounding the liberal transformation of isolated incidents into an indictment of America as white supremacist, a desperation that Steele submits is the result of the realization that “the left doesn’t have much else.” “Theirs is an ideology devoted to the uplift of the underdog. Well, what if there is no underdog, or if it is insignificant?” Steele asks before quickly answering his own question, “Then they are out of business. They will be unable to make a claim on power. So, as the society improves, ironically the left has to distort more and more to make us look far worse than we are. There has to be victims, because without them the left has to go away.”

Steele believes that the left feels empowered by the shifting demographics of America. “We’re becoming a much more varied, multicultural society. The left sees this as an opportunity to convince these people (immigrants, various ethnic groups) that they are victimized by the ‘one percent’ and ‘white privilege’, and if they can do that they will have political success. They are very imaginative at coming up with ways to consider people victims.”

The academic education of Shelby Steele uniquely qualifies him for scrutinizing and criticizing American culture, and it provides insight into his ability to seamlessly transgress boundaries between social and cultural topics, while it also partially accounts for his engaging essayistic voice, which combines social analysis with memoir style reflection on his own life. Steele earned a Master’s Degree in sociology from Southern Illinois University, and a Ph.D. in literature from the University of Utah. He claims to have taught his favorite book – Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man – dozens of times, and his penchant for picking up on the subtleties for narrative equips him with the intellectual tools necessary for deconstructing America’s complications and contradictions, especially as they pertain to race and politics.

“… what really saddens me is when you have young minorities figuring out new ways to play the victim, and asking for things like reparations.”

His 20/20 cultural vision enables him to sketch out reasons for pessimism and optimism. I asked him if he sees an endpoint to the victimization addiction. Will America eventually turn around and embrace freedom, with all of its rewards and troubles, or will the American people – black and white – continue to demand more subsidies, assistance, and protection? The latest essay from liberal literati god – Ta-Nehisi Coates, who has fashioned a literary personality resembling Jeremiah Wright, just without the sense of humor – called “The Case for Reparations” is already receiving effusive praise, and is perhaps a harbinger of the left’s downward trajectory. “It’s going to be awhile before all of this ends,” Steele explains, “especially when you have people like Coates, who is relatively young, and that’s what really saddens me is when you have young minorities figuring out new ways to play the victim, and asking for things like reparations. What are reparations going to do?” Steele asks with a tone of voice that betrays the absurdity of his rhetorical question, “Give me $25,000, so I can buy a Volkswagen? Reparations are not going to give anyone the skillset to handle freedom.”

In the seminal essay, “Superman Goes to the Supermarket,” Norman Mailer endorses John F. Kennedy for President by explaining how Presidents are as much cultural figures as they are political ones, and that they have as much influence on culture as they do on politics. Liberals of the victimhood disability, of which Mailer and Kennedy were not, are enjoying their moment right now, partially because of President Obama’s influence on American culture. “He’s pumped gas into this idea of victimization, and he’s found new groups to include,” Steele said. The President is an immensely successful man, but he’s “done nothing to get us beyond the trap,” Steele claims, “Because that’s the vote he depends upon.”

As the Obama Presidency awkwardly flutters toward the unforgiving smack of the pavement, liberalism might grow more desperate (arguing for reparations, telling white people to “check their privilege”, putting trigger warnings on Mark Twain books) to advance their narrative, and in doing so, “become more visible for the corruption that it is,” as Steele puts it, “because it is so ineffective.”

“They are cannibalistic,” Steele warns of the left, “They are weakening us.” Shelter is available for liberalism, however, and it is built by the growing absurdity of political correctness – An “application of power,” Steele calls, “naked moral intimidation.”

If political correctness collapses underneath its own oppressive weight, and the exposure Steele describes soon begins, room might open for the advancement of a “black conservative movement” Steele identifies as “growing and beginning to flourish,” despite the predictable stigmatization of “Uncle Tom” labeling and “sell out” branding. “The movement is entirely based on a rejection of victimhood, and an embrace of individual responsibility,” Steele said.

“Well, what Republican is going to say that? I don’t know any, because it takes tremendous courage.”

“Republicans have to stand up to minorities and say, ‘We care about you, and it is precisely because we care about you that we want you to know that you are not victims. There are opportunities for you all over this free society. Are they as lucrative as the ones in the wealthy precincts of society? Probably not, but they are valuable anyway,’ Steele said speaking in the voice he hopes Republicans soon adopt. He continued, his tone becoming more emphatic, “‘Why not organize a parents group and insist that the local school really educate your children with basic skills so that they can become competitive right away? Why not reinforce this at home? Why not do the old fashioned things that actually work instead of waiting around for fancy governmental intervention?’ Well, what Republican is going to say that? I don’t know any, because it takes tremendous courage.”

Among all the speculation over how Republicans can win support among non-white voters, Steele is seemingly alone in advocating for “frank talk” and not the “patronizing flank of victimhood.”

“America should be ashamed of itself over what its done with fifty years of patronization.”

“There’s no way the government is going to come into your house and guarantee that your kids are studying,” Steele said while explaining that his view is merely consistent with the self-reliance and self-sufficiency engendered and embodied by the Civil Rights Movement. “You have to join yourself with an ethic that makes you proud that you are doing that. We have gotten very far from that ethic, and there’s a vast underclass now of millions of lost people, who were never there when I was a kid during segregation. America should be ashamed of itself over what its done with fifty years of patronization.”

The honesty that leads to vulnerability, despite the insecurity that accompanies it, is the only way forward for a real positive message, and a victory for legitimate and promising anti-poverty programs. “People call the Republican party the ‘stupid party.’ Maybe Republicans are stupid, but it is the party that comes closest to articulating and representing the principles I cherish,” Steele said before turning to political strategy, “Start your speech by saying, ‘Half the people here will call me racist, let’s just get that out of the way right now. You need to take control of your own lives and realize that the new Civil Rights movement is not about income equality, but dignity. I’m here because I want to make a better America, and I want you to be an important part of that America.”

“Start your speech by saying, ‘Half the people here will call me racist, let’s just get that out of the way right now.'”

“We say that things are complicated usually when we’re just afraid to do them,” Steele said before concluding, “I think black Americans are definitely ready for the message of individual responsibility.”

To believe and behave otherwise is to act according to the “soft bigotry of low expectations.” Jim Crow stated that black people were inferior to whites, and therefore should be expelled from white society. The modern ideology of victimhood states that blacks are inferior to whites, and therefore need perpetual assistance from white society. Same master, different robe.

As the vision and brilliance of Shelby Steele makes clear, the battle between victimology and responsibility is not so much a clash between political parties, as it is theater in the war between the strength and cowardice both elemental to human nature. The worst part of the embrace and enjoyment of victimhood is that it surrenders all control of life to the people most adept at manipulation through the promise of rescue.

As Ralph Ellison wrote in Shelby Steele’s favorite book, Invisible Man, “Life is to be lived, not controlled.”

Watch What You Say -- The End of Free Speech,"It’s once again time ponder how our careless political rhetoric encourages otherwise reasonable people to snap and go on terror sprees. Sorry, right-wing terror sprees.

Whenever a deranged gunman decides to slaughter innocent people, partisans always seem to unearth a few nuggets of evidence that purportedly ties the irrational murders to some completely innocuous political speech they dislike. So when a disturbed couple ambush two Las Vegas police officers, kill a bystander, and leave behind swastikas (a sure sign of their opposition to higher top marginal tax rates, no?) and a Gadsden flag before committing suicide, we are left with only one question: Why do you do it, Republicans?

Take, for instance, Paul Waldman in the Washington Post online: “How much does right-wing rhetoric contribute to right-wing terrorism?” he asks. Not, “does it” contribute to terrorism, or “is this” even terrorism but “how much”—which means we’ve already answered an important question, doesn’t it? But let’s consider the evidence anyway:

When GOP Senator Ron Johnson says that the Affordable Care Act is “the greatest assault on freedom in our lifetime,” and hopes that the Supreme Court will intervene to preserve our “last shred of freedom,” is it at all surprising that some people might be tempted to take up arms?

Yes, of course it would be surprising. Fortunately, despite the active imagination of pundits, no one has taken up arms to repeal Obamacare—ever.

Now, some of you would-be enablers of terrorism might argue that an individual mandate that allows government to coerce all citizen to purchase a product on the open market is, as far as policy goes, unprecedented. It is then reasonable to believe that the law constitute one of the most serious “assaults” on individual freedom in recent memory. Nothing in that statement, though, intimates that Americans should ambush their local police officers. Nothing in that statement implies that that you “harbor anti-government ideology.” We’re just debating the size of government. Harboring a desire to cut the budget to 2008 levels does not, despite what you may have heard, make you an anarchist.

Are we losing our “last shred of freedom”? That’s certainly a bit hyperbolic. Kind of like accusing your political enemies of “betting against America.” Or incessantly alleging your political opponents are conspiring to keep the poor poor. Or contending that the GOP wants to “deny” sick children health care. Or arguing that Republicans are driven by bigotry, and teeming with misogynists and racists. Or, you know, about another dozen or so rhetorical exaggerations that the Left bludgeons its adversaries with every day. Alas, that’s what happens when everything we do in life has a political component.

White so not terrorism RT @nycsouthpaw Vegas shooters reportedly spread a Gadsden flag over bodies of their victims. http://t.co/zebShd7LcW— Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) June 9, 2014

The use of “terrorism”* in this instance is meant to suggest that there is restive violence rooted in traditionalist constitutional-centric rhetoric. (And isn’t it remarkable how many of same people who claim that 9/11 was merely a criminal act will throw around the word). Which is preposterous. Terrorism is an act of violence intended to generate fear among the populace by deliberately targeting civilians for a religious or ideological goal. The madmen and mentally ill shooters we’ve seen lately—and acts of terrorism have been declining—are neither organized not part of broader ideology that resembles anything in our contemporary political or religious discussion. None. Obviously, Islamic terrorists come in all races and ethnicities; the only thing they all share is an ideological and religious viewpoint. But, then again, why not squeeze every last drop of partisan ammo from a tragedy?

It is also plausible that many on Left believe their own histrionics, not to mention the simplistic caricatures of conservative and libertarians they’ve created. It is conceivable that some leftist pundits make little distinction between white supremacists and Tea Party conservatives. It is likely that those who jumped to the conclusions about Jared Loughner had convinced themselves that half the country is not only populated by unintellectual God-fearing clods but probably plotting the overthrow of the government. You don’t have to go farther than a Paul Krugman column to see how often those who’ve stopped debating can demonize those who challenge their worldview.

Accusing the other party of snatching “freedom,” as Ron Johnson and others have, was a formulation regularly used by the Left regularly during the Bush years. And it has probably been used by every minority party since the Founding. If that level of rhetoric, as Waldman and others claim, can drive people to arms, then so be it. First, because it’s not a lie to say we are losing freedom. Second, because even if the Vegas shooters were reading Milton Friedman and pondering Edmund Burke, it still wouldn’t change the fact that mainstream and nonviolent ideology is appropriated by all species of nuts for all sort of screwy reasons. Should we start blaming environmental terrorism on apocalyptic talk that is regularly used by liberals these days? That game leads to de facto limitations on political speech.

This is all part of a broader movement to transform rhetorical opposition to goals of the progressive agenda—from gay marriage or immigration reform or welfare expansion—into condemnable hate speech. Because we must, as Ari Fleischer told us back when free speech was sacred, watch what we say. When you watch what you say, you can’t say much of anything. Not if you’re a conservative. Which is the point.

*From 2001-2011 by far the most acts of terrorism were perpetrated by environmentalist groups.

Obama’s Wish-Fulfilling Prophecy in Iraq,"Democrats predicted that the war in Iraq was unwinnable, Harry Reid said it was already lost, and Senator Obama declared that President Bush’s “surge” wouldn’t work.

And now here we are in 2014, and by golly it looks as if they were right: Iraq is a total disaster. An al-Qaeda splinter group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, overran Fallujah months ago and just knocked over Mosul and Tikrit, reportedly executing hundreds in the street and sending half a million Iraqis fleeing for their lives. They’re on a path that will take them straight into Baghdad, if there is no one to stop them. And the Iraqi army is in disarray.

So were the Democrats right? Was Iraq a lost cause, inevitably, all along? There’s one big problem with this narrative: Iraq has fallen apart on President Obama’s watch, as a consequence of his own policy of willful neglect.

I would say that this was a self-fulfilling prophecy, but that doesn’t quite seem to cover it. Instead, I would characterize this as a wish-fulfilling prophecy. If Iraq is falling to al-Qaeda, it’s because this administration deliberately chose to throw away the victory handed to them by George W. Bush. The left thought we should have lost the war in Iraq, they wanted us to lose it—and finally they’re getting the outcome they wanted.

To grasp the magnitude of this betrayal, we need to go back to the state of play in Iraq in 2009 and trace the steps forward to understand how we got here.

By 2009, the surge had wiped out al-Qaeda in Iraq, taking advantage of the Islamist fanatics’ brutal tactics to drive a wedge between the terrorists and their local allies. Seizing on this opportunity, the US served as the middleman for a political settlement between the Shiite government and the Sunni tribes in the insurgent heartland, who agreed to oppose the insurgency and back the central government. We then goaded Nouri al-Maliki’s government into clearing out an Iranian-backed, theocratic Shiite militia in Baghdad and in Iraq’s south. So Obama inherited the legacy of a counter-insurgency campaign that had succeeded beyond its advocates’ most ardent hopes. (I know. I was one of the advocates.)

Then, in early 2010, Iraq held an election that produced pretty much the result we had hoped for: a victory for Ayad Allawi’s non-sectarian, anti-Iranian Sunni-Shiite coalition. In effect, this was a ratification of the settlement between the country’s sectarian factions.

But Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who had been a reluctant and unreliable ally, resisted the election result, refused to allow the formation of a new government, and disqualified a batch of Allawi’s candidates after the fact, essentially overturning the election result. And what did we do? We let him. Obama’s State Department signed off on what we can now recognize as their favorite kind of agreement: an off-ramp deal, i.e., a deal designed, not to solve the crisis, but to come up with a face-saving way of absolving us of any responsibility for it. So we brokered a deal where Maliki was supposed to share power with Allawi’s coalition, and Maliki never really bothered to live up to it. Instead, he followed up with a campaign of sectarian persecution and political suppression against the Sunnis.

But what were we going to do about it? President Obama had also failed to negotiate an agreement to keep 10,000 US troops in Iraq. The only message he was sending to Baghdad was that he wanted to wash his hands of Iraq as soon as a possible. So he had no political leverage to use with Maliki.

The results was predictable, and a lot of us predicted it: having broken the political settlement, Maliki alienated the Sunnis, caused them to conclude that they had no stake in the government’s survival, and made them open to the return of the insurgents.

But the key turning point was the rebuilding of al-Qaeda in Syria. When Syrians first rose up against Bashar al-Assad, it was obvious that we couldn’t back the regime, a brutal dictatorship that was closely allied to Iran and had vigorously backed the insurgency in Iraq. But President Obama refused to take any significant action to back the rebellion, which was largely non-sectarian in its early days. This left a power vacuum that would be filled by Sunni Islamists. Yet the administration still kept stringing along the non-Islamist rebels, leaving them some hope that if they opposed al-Qaeda and declared a non-sectarian agenda, we might tip the scales in their favor.

And then came the Putin-brokered deal last summer in which Assad agreed to begin maybe dismantling some of his chemical weapons, in exchange for being accepted as the indispensible man in Damascus. It was another off-ramp deal designed to take the issue off the president’s plate. This betrayal crushed the hopes of the non-Islamist rebels and gave a huge boost in credibility to the Islamists. It helped create a whole new arena for al-Qaeda to reconstitute itself—which naturally crossed over the border. Notice who’s taking over in Iraq: the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

None of this just happened out of the blue in the past few weeks. All of this has happened slowly, agonizingly, over a period of five years. There was plenty of time to notice what was going on—some of us were pointing at the unfolding disaster and jumping up and down and screaming—and to do something about it.

To stop it now would require a giant new military effort, which is vanishingly unlikely to happen unless—until—this disaster comes home to our doorstep in some spectacular way. But to stop it along the way would not have required much, if any, direct military force. It would have meant keeping a few tens of thousand of trainers, advisors, and special forces in Iraq to support the government and back up our influence, plus a whole lot of vigorous diplomacy. But the hallmark of this administration is that they came in talking a lot about how they preferred diplomacy to military action—and then showed virtually no interest in accomplishing anything with diplomacy.

All of this happened while Barack Obama was president—and, I should add, most of it unfolded while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. Yet if anyone in the administration was raising alarms, neither the president nor Madame Secretary deigned to listen.

So if Iraq is collapsing, we have to assume that this is a result the administration was happy to accept, because they never lifted a finger to stop it.

Even now, Nouri al-Maliki is asking us to come in with air strikes, though at this point, he’s really just asking us to intervene on his behalf in a sectarian civil war. That might be the least bad option, but it’s not clear we’ll even do that. So what is Maliki left to do? Turn to Iran for the help we won’t offer.

President Obama is shaping Iraq on the model of his Syria policy: letting it turn into an endless battle between two gangs of theocrats: the Sunni al-Qaeda gang versus the Shiite Iranian gang. That’s his vision of the Middle East: a cauldron of competing Islamist terror gangs.

In purely humanitarian terms, this is a catastrophe. The administration is callously condemning tens of millions of people in the Middle East to poverty, terror, murder, torture, and starvation. And all for what? To flip a big middle finger to George W. Bush?

It’s also a disaster for our interests. In Obama’s Middle East, terror is the coin of the realm, power goes to the most brutal and fanatical, and the whole region becomes one giant live-fire training camp for jihadists from around the globe. I fear we’re going to be paying for this disaster for a long, long time.

Only one thing could be worse. The Middle East could become a cauldron of nuclear-armed Islamist factions. That comes next, when Iran decides to push for a bomb and the Sunni Gulf states decide it’s time to match them. All of this looks like a geopolitical nightmare for us, though it might well achieve another key administration goal: jacking up the price of gasoline to the $8 per gallon that Energy Secretary Steven Chu once named as his target.

Chalk this down to politics, with Obama wanting to focus on domestic issues and avoid any of the entanglements of foreign policy—though he hasn’t been very successful at either of those goals. Chalk it down to crass partisanship, with Democrats giving off the sense that don’t want any American victory if it’s tainted by association with George W. Bush. But I think there’s something deeper at work.

Consider the post-counter-culture left’s attitude toward all our wars, starting with what they did in Vietnam.

By 1973, we had withdrawn ground troops from Vietnam and left a government that could survive, with significant aid and support from the US. So the left systematically cut off all of that aid, inviting North Vietnam to take over. The results were pretty similar to today, with lawless militants imposing a reign of terror and creating vast humanitarian disasters in the places we had abandoned. The left turned an honorable withdrawal into a humiliating defeat, which then emboldened the Soviets to go on a global romp, swallowing more bits of Latin America and grabbing Afghanistan.

Similarly, when things were at their worst during George Bush’s prosecution of the war in Iraq—the “worst,” then, was far better than it is now—Democrats like Joe Biden and Barack Obama didn’t offer their advice on how to rally the war effort and win. Bush had to do that on his own. No, they held a series of votes in Congress trying to guarantee defeat by cutting off funding for the war, just as congressional Democrats had done with Vietnam.

In the left’s view, America is an oppressive and illegitimate society, founded on lies and racism. Until we can be fundamentally transformed, we deserve to lose. And if we don’t lose on our own, they will do what they can to induce that result.

That’s the wish-fulfilling prophecy. We’re losing in Iraq because the people who are now in charge of our policy always said that we would lose, always thought that we should lose, always tried to make us lose, and now they get to make it happen.

This is a generational lesson. If the failed rollout of ObamaCare was a reminder of why we can never let the left have power over the economy, the current disaster in the Middle East is a reminder of why we can never let the left have control over our foreign policy.

We learned all that, once upon a time, back in the 1970s, but the lesson wore off. Let’s learn it for good this time.

The University Of Illinois’ Other On-Staff Terrorist,"URBANA, Illinois—In 2008, the nation learned that the University of Illinois had long had an ex-domestic terrorist on its faculty: Bill Ayers, the co-founder of the Weather Underground, who was teaching at the UI’s Chicago campus, and who happened to be an old colleague of Barack Obama. Controversy flared, but there wasn’t much UI officials could do about it, even if they wanted to. Ayers had tenure. They were stuck with him.

Now, however, it turns out they’ve got another staffer with a background strikingly similar to Ayers—this one without tenure. And whether they keep him around is very much up in the air.

He’s James Kilgore, an instructor at the UI’s main campus in Champaign-Urbana—and a veteran of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), the 1970s revolutionary group best known for kidnapping heiress Patty Hearst, then recruiting or brainwashing her into joining their ranks.

Since 2010, Kilgore has held a variety of positions at the UI, most recently as an instructor and research scholar at the Center for African Studies, teaching about topics like “wealth and poverty in a globalized world.” He’s been active in the “social justice” movement, working to bring ex-fugitive Angela Davis to town last fall and escorting her on her visit.

A Life Of Crime

While Kilgore’s background was known to some UI officials from the start, it wasn’t widely known to the general public until February. That’s when the local newspaper, The News-Gazette, published an in-depth story on the one-time revolutionary who took part in the SLA’s terror campaign, then spent the next 27 years as a fugitive.

It was gripping stuff. Drawing on existing materials, including court documents and Hearst’s statements, The News-Gazette’s Jim Dey (pronounced “dye”) traced Kilgore’s history: armed bank robberies, dozens of bombings, and attempted assassination of police officers—and an effort to bomb a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention.

‘Should a domestic terrorist bent on overthrowing the government by targeting the murder of police and who was involved in a killing be on the public payroll?’

But the worst of the SLA’s crimes came on April 21, 1975. That’s when Kilgore and three comrades, all wearing ski masks, rushed the Crocker National Bank in the Sacramento suburb of Carmichael, ordering customers to get down and clerks to turn over money. One SLA member, Emily Harris, fatally shot Myrna Lee Opsahl, who was depositing funds for her church. (Harris, though claiming in court that it was an accident, had dismissed her victim as “a bourgeois pig,” Hearst said.) Opsahl wasn’t the only fatality that day, Dey noted: “Court documents allege that during the robbery, Kilgore’s girlfriend [Kathy] Soliah, kicked a pregnant, non-resisting clerk in the stomach, causing her to lose her unborn child through a miscarriage.”

Months later, the FBI identified nearly all the SLA principals, including Kilgore, whose fingerprints were found in the bank. Some of them were arrested, but others went underground. Kilgore fled overseas, living in countries from Australia to Zimbabwe to South Africa and pursuing an academic career under the alias of Charles “John” Pape—a name stolen from a dead 10-month-old infant, Charles William Pape, whose birth certificate Kilgore acquired and used to get a passport.

In November 2002, authorities finally tracked him down and arrested him in Cape Town—the last of the SLA members to be caught. Kilgore cut a deal with U.S. prosecutors, who had their work cut out for them after so much time had passed: He’d waive extradition and return to California, pleading guilty to second-degree murder and explosives charges in exchange for a short prison sentence.

By May 2009, Kilgore was out on parole. He headed to the UI, where his wife, Teresa Barnes, taught women’s studies. By January 2010, he was a UI employee.

Stand By Your Man

Since The News-Gazette’s story broke—followed by an outpouring of public outrage—UI’s response has been all over the map. For more than a month, the only official comment was “no comment.” Then UI spokeswoman Robin Kaler gave Kilgore a ringing endorsement. Through it all, the outrage showed no sign of subsiding.

Sometime in mid-April, the university informed Kilgore his contract would not be renewed when it expires August 15. No explanation was given, or (since he was an hourly employee) legally required.

Since The News-Gazette’s story broke—followed by an outpouring of public outrage—the University of Illinois’ response has been all over the map.

Then came the outrage from the other side. A petition signed by 300-plus faculty and staff denounced the move as “a blow to academic freedom and employment equity.” That was a small percentage of UI faculty and staff (2,458 faculty, 3,665 administrative and academic professionals, 4,136 support staff). But it got attention. And, perhaps more importantly, the American Association of University Professors weighed in on Kilgore’s behalf.

Soon, UI flip-flopped again—announcing that the decision wasn’t final and appointing a committee to review the Kilgore decision.

One key person who seems unimpressed by Kilgore’s defense, though, is Christopher Kennedy—chairman of the UI Board of Trustees and son of Robert F. Kennedy.

No Evidence Of Regret

Kennedy said he didn’t regard this as an issue of academic freedom, and also expressed doubt that this was simply a case of an ex-felon who’s paid his debt to society being allowed to live a full life.

“Should a domestic terrorist bent on overthrowing the government by targeting the murder of police and who was involved in a killing be on the public payroll? The answer is no.”

Kennedy also voiced a view seldom heard in academia—that the views of taxpayers should play a major role in the decision.

“We want to be respectful of the fact that we operate on taxpayers’ money and tuition,” Kennedy said. He spoke of how a multicultural society is a fragile system of government whose legitimacy needs to be maintained in the eyes of the public. The university draws about a third of its funding from the state, Kennedy said, “and that’s a big deal.”

While stating that the board wouldn’t prejudge the review process, Kennedy left open the possibility that the trustees might have a say when it’s finished.

It wouldn’t be the first time. When Ayers applied for emeritus status upon retiring in 2010, the trustees overwhelmingly rejected him, with Kennedy noting that Ayers had dedicated a book to Sirhan Sirhan, the man who killed his father—and seemed strikingly unrepentant.

“There can be no place in a democracy to celebrate political assassinations or to honor those who do so,” Kennedy said. “There’s no evidence in any of his interviews or conversations that he regrets any of those actions.”

The American Association of University Professors weighed in on Kilgore’s behalf.

As for Kilgore, is he repentant? His recorded apologies have been prepared, carefully worded statements to bodies that have the power to determine his fate, like the court that sentenced him and the UI trustees themselves. To the latter, after lecturing them on the high social purposes to be served by retaining him, he spent a couple sentences expressing contrition. “As a young man,” he said, “I committed acts of which I stand ashamed,” and which were “utterly destructive” of innocent people and of the campaign for “social justice and peace.”

But on Kilgore’s personal web site, he takes a different tone. In his biography, he says of his crimes only that “he served six and a half years for political offenses committed in the 1970s.”

That phrase—“political offenses”—deserves some attention. It’s not just a vague whitewash, obscuring deeds for which he was convicted and other deeds for which he escaped conviction. It’s a strong implication that Kilgore, far from being a criminal, was a political prisoner.

Certainly that was the intent of the words in their original context: Kilgore cut and pasted them from the blurb for his book, Freedom Never Rests (2012), published in South Africa—where “political offenses” is a phrase associated with the conviction of a national icon, the late Nelson Mandela. Kilgore and his publisher (Jacana Media) weren’t expressing repentance for his past: They were boasting of it, seeking to link him to a movement seen today as a heroic crusade for social justice.

Seeking Sympathetic Ears

There are other reasons to question the nature and extent of Kilgore‘s repentance. He’s declined media interviews from any but the most sympathetic outlets. Yet even the interviews he’s given can raise eyebrows. For example, in a puff piece for Inside Higher Ed, Colleen Flaherty writes:

As for his past, he said, ‘What I say is that I’ve lived a very different life since that time,’ rejecting personally and in his work the politics of small-group violence and ‘trying to effect social change through that process.’

That begs some questions. Kilgore (and presumably not Flaherty) introduced the qualifier “small-group,” which sounds very much like a strategic distinction, not a principled one. What about violence in general? Does Kilgore reject that, or does he merely reject a type of violence that proved ineffective and counterproductive to his revolutionary goals?

Flaherty apparently wasn’t interested in asking such obvious follow-ups. Which may be why Kilgore felt comfortable enough to speak with her, while he steered clear of any journalists who might subject him to actual scrutiny.

When push comes to shove, rhetoric about ‘academic freedom’ and ’employment equity’ nearly always cows administrators into submission.

The University of Illinois, at least, may be employing a bit more scrutiny from now on. Partly in response to the Kilgore controversy, the state legislature may move to ban getting a degree or gaining university employment under false pretenses—like, say, a fake name. (Kilgore’s advanced degrees came under the name of Pape.) And for reasons unrelated to Kilgore, the university has been in the process of requiring criminal background checks on all new hires.

But you can have all the background information you want: You still need to use good judgment in the hiring process. Kennedy clearly doubts that happened in Kilgore’s case, and implies that some school officials slipped him by the trustees. “Whatever notice [about Kilgore] we had years ago, and it was a different board, it was vague in nature and used words that were not offensive,” he said. “The words we use matter a lot.”

If Kennedy’s words are the guiding principles for the final decision, odds are Kilgore’s days at the UI will soon be over. But that would be a reversal of the normal dynamic in academia, where the campus Left is commonly enabled and empowered to do as it will without regard for the taxpayers who pay their salary. When push comes to shove, rhetoric about “academic freedom” and “employment equity” nearly always cows administrators into submission.

Will this time be an exception? We’ll find out this summer.

Enduring Lessons From The Diplomatic Crisis of July 1914,"Saturday marked the 100th anniversary of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo by pro-Serbian terrorists. 30 days later, on July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. The dominoes fell swiftly from there: between August 1 and 4, Germany declared war on Russia and France, and invaded France and then Belgium, the latter invasion bringing Great Britain into what became the First World War. A century later, what can we learn from the month-long diplomatic crisis that led to the Great War?

Europe Gone Mad

The war seems today, and seemed to observers at the time, an eruption of irrationality, if not outright madness. Its cost, even within a few months of its start, was vastly disproportionate to the original provocation, which directly concerned only two of the (ultimately, lesser) combatants. It was fought for no great cause against no great enemy, but among largely similar states for a variety of war aims that were often pretextual and developed after the fact. It broke out in the most prosperous and powerful part of the world that had ever existed, and resulted in a permanent reduction in Europe’s place in the world and image of itself. Virtually all of the combatants (with the arguable exceptions of the U.S. and Japan, both relatively late entrants) ended the war worse off than if it had never been fought. Thus, the war’s reputation as something more like an accident or an outbreak of collective hysteria than a crime.

We tend to think of World War I and World War II as opposite poles in terms of the lessons we draw from their origins. The Second World War is the archetype for the conservative view of how wars can be caused by doing too little to deter aggressors early and stop them from gathering power. The First has long served as the liberal counterpoint, offering a fertile field for a variety of theories about how wars derive from militarism, mutual misunderstandings, colonial rivalries, too much nationalism and too little diplomacy. There is some truth in this, but the facts are not the same as the popular mythology, and the events of July 1914 offer alternative and more practical lessons for modern international relations.

The Falling Dominoes

The basic background and narrative is well-known. Before the July crisis, the rise of Germany and its alliance with Austria-Hungary had created an alliance between Russia and France. Great Britain – alarmed mainly by Germany’s naval armament and designs on colonial expansion – joined that alliance, albeit with characteristic British ambiguity as to its plans and intentions if it came to a fight. Serbia triggered the crisis by its involvement in the assassination, a direct provocation of Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary, its leaders divided and nervous about a wider war, asked for and received a guarantee of support from its ally Germany, and delivered an ultimatum to Serbia. Russia, a promoter of the interests of Slavic peoples like the Serbs against the non-Slavic empires, mobilized its military to a war footing in response – and seeing Russia mobilize encouraged the Serbs to reject parts of the ultimatum, and led the Germans to declare war on both France and Russia and put into action its pre-existing military plan for general war. The French were thus compelled into the war, and when Germany invaded Belgium, the British (as guarantors of Belgian neutrality) dropped all ambiguity about where and when they would help the French, and threw their whole available land force into the war against Germany.

While the system of interlocking alliances is often blamed for the spread of war from a localized crisis, it is (with the notable exception of Russia’s support for Serbia) hard to blame the allies for entering into those alliances, or for honoring them. If the goal of the alliances was to create a perfectly even balance of power that would produce military stalemate, they worked beyond anyone’s wildest imaginings, creating an unwinnable war that was ultimately resolved only when the Americans entered and disrupted the balance of power following the exhaustion of all the other combatants’ manpower. And a nation that refuses to honor its alliances in a crisis will swiftly find itself without allies at the next one.

Some of the other traditional explanations – even those that may have contributed in a more general sense to the conditions in which the crisis erupted – simply do not fit the realities of the run-up to war. The First World War cannot be blamed on cultural misunderstandings. The Serbians and the Austrians, or the French and the Germans, understood each other all too well, and while war may not have been inevitable, conflict was. Their differences involved real collisions of national interest, whether the Franco-German territorial dispute over Alsace-Lorraine or the more existential threat that Serbian nationalism posed to the ethnically diverse Austro-Hungarian Empire, that could not be papered over with happy talk. Nor can the war be blamed on personal misunderstandings. The diplomats of Europe had maintained cordial channels of communication for a century. Even at the level of heads of state, the crowned heads of Europe were literally cousins, and the Kaiser and the Czar continued an affectionate correspondence almost to the moment of the war’s outbreak. There were real breakdowns in diplomacy in July 1914, but they had much more to do with vacationing leaders, untimely vacancies in some key embassies, failure to use modern communications technologies (an issue that would plague the entire conduct of the war on all sides), the absence of an impartial honest broker to keep a dialogue going (the Russians tried to offer multinational mediation at a conference scheduled for the following year, an obviously impractical and self-serving solution), and poor decisions under pressure.

The arms race was also mostly a dog that did not bark in the July crisis. The main arms race – Germany’s effort to gain ground relative to Britain’s dominant naval position – played an important role in setting the stage for the crisis because it was a driving force behind Britain’s decision to ally itself with France and Russia against Germany, but it was at the fore of nobody’s thinking. The broader militarization of Europe before the war was the result, not the cause, of a century of population growth, colonial expansion, and national rivalries. One particular improvement in arms – Germany’s development of artillery powerful enough to break the Belgian forts at Liege and Namur – would end up playing an important role in making the German war plan more practically feasible. But what obsessed the military planners of 1914 was not the balance of high-tech weaponry but that most ancient of considerations, the ability to mobilize and deploy infantry. That started with plans to commandeer the peacetime technology of rail lines, and depended from there on the speed at which men and materials could be moved by the most old-fashioned methods known to war: on foot and by horse. In the end, war became inevitable because of fear of the timetables of feet and hooves rather than any manufactured innovation.

Even the desire of various of the combatants for territorial or colonial gains – Germany’s hunger for a more equal share in overseas colonies, France’s thirst for revenge for 1870 and the reclaiming of Alsace-Lorraine, Russia’s century-long quest to supplant the Ottoman Empire at the gateway from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean – fails to explain the actions of the Serbians, Austrians, Russians, and French, and is inadequate to explain the behavior of the Germans, who were poorly prepared for a showdown with the British Navy and woefully unprepared to defend the overseas possessions they already had. For those explanations, we must consider the combatants in turn.

Experience Is The School of Mankind

Ultimately, if we take the major alliances as a given, it was the choices of four monarchies in Eastern and Central Europe – two on the Entente side (Serbia and Russia) and two Central Powers (Austria-Hungary and Germany) – that escalated the crisis to war. We can learn from their choices today.

Serbia: Terrorist Proxies

But the Serbian government and people learned the painful lesson that states so often learn when they pal around with terrorists: the harder you work to make it look like you wanted deniability, the less you can actually achieve it.

The crisis began with an assassination, carried out (like the 9/11 attacks and other modern terror attacks around the globe) by non-uniformed non-state-actors. The precise relationships between the Serbian government, the assassins, and the Black Hand terrorist group or other affiliated or similar pro-Greater-Serbian terrorist groups remain somewhat murky and disputed even to this day. But then, as now, it did not ultimately matter. Terrorist groups rarely follow a transparent chain of command, and often have indistinct or overlapping membership with groups with similar goals or methods. They also often have multiple and conflicting agendas. Indeed, a major purpose of a states sponsoring terrorists is precisely that they can claim deniability when it becomes difficult after the fact to determine responsibility for an atrocity.

The more indirectly you provoke more conventionally powerful states, the more terrible will be their vengeance. While the immediate consequences of the July crisis would be war in Belgium, France, and Poland, the war would eventually take a harder toll, per capita, on Serbia than any other combatant due to especially heavy civilian casualties. Serbia was overrun by enemy armies, its people driven into the hills, its military situation desperate enough that its 70-year-old king would pick up a rifle and head for the front, and eventually its population would be decimated by a typhus pandemic.

Did Serbia achieve its war aims? In a sense, yes: the multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian empire was driven to collapse, and a Serbian-dominated greater Slavic state (“Yugoslavia”) was formed in the wake of the war. But even that victory would prove a poisoned chalice, as Yugoslavia would suffer the agonies of invasion and ethnic partisan warfare on an even worse scale in the 1940s and would unravel in vicious bloodletting in the 1990s. Even the winnings of terrorism are rarely to be collected at peaceful leisure.

Austria-Hungary: Indecision

The next move fell to Austria, which responded by issuing an ultimatum to Serbia on July 23, nearly four weeks after the assassination.

Histories of the crisis of July 1914 generally look at Austria as on the horns of a dilemma. On the one hand, a powerful nation simply cannot take sitting down the assassination of its head of state (or in this case, a man who would have been its head of state within two years) by terrorists armed by a hostile neighbor. On the other hand, the empire’s delicate balance was unsuited to the test of a major war; events would prove this soon enough (the Austrians faced manpower exhaustion earlier in the war than any of the other major combatants), and the reasons why were well known to Austrian policymakers in July. Austria chose its national honor and ended up losing its nation.

Militarily, Austria’s dilemma was that its pre-war dispositions, worked out in coordination with the German general staff, called for placing more than half of its army, and three quarters of its initially deployed forces, on the northern frontier with Russian-controlled Poland rather than the southern frontier with Serbia. An offensive against Serbia alone would mean deviating from the plan for general war to the prejudice of Germany, and potentially risking leaving its own flanks open to Russia.

But the great unanswered question is what would have happened had Austria moved swiftly and decisively to retaliate against Serbia – without waiting for German assurances, without giving Russia time to mobilize, without throwing the capitals of all Europe into war fever. Paradoxically, had Austria chosen a limited war against Serbia and presented the Russians with a fait accompli, its decisiveness (like that of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine today) might have convinced Serbia’s potential protectors that the assassination had been justly punished. The desire to avoid the implications of the crisis only widened them.

Russia: Unpreparedness and Unreliable Allies

The central military fact that drove all the war plans of 1914 was that it would take Russia far longer to mobilize – both its initial military strength and its full military capacity – than the other European powers. From Day One, Russia would be weak and vulnerable compared to its potential, and this weakness would prove provocative. From Germany’s perspective, the fact that Russia would move more slowly than France meant an opportunity to take France out first and defeat Russia in detail. From Russia’s perspective, this meant that the Russians would need to find the earliest possible opportunity to mobilize (as they did), knowing that word of mobilization would be hard to conceal and would likely trigger the Germans to flip the switch from mobilization to combat (as it did). Indeed, it was word of Russian partial mobilization reaching Belgrade at the hour of crisis that led the Serbs to reject critical portions of the Austrian ultimatum – even though the Czar was still balking at a full mobilization order as late as July 29. Russian weakness led to fear, fear led to partial mobilization, mobilization led to war.

From Day One, Russia would be weak and vulnerable compared to its potential, and this weakness would prove provocative.

It is easy in hindsight to criticize the Imperial Russia of 1914 for its lack of military preparedness, which was the result of geography, relative poverty (compared its neighbors), the weakness of the Czarist system and specifically the lack of a rail network in Poland that was partly a matter of policy choice. But Russia found itself in crisis in the first place because it had chosen to ally itself with an aggressive and unpredictable government, hardened by recent war, that had no qualms about arming radicals whose subsequent behavior could not be predicted. Bismarck is said to have remarked, years before, that general war would come to Europe as a result of “some damn foolish thing in the Balkans” – less a prophecy than a shrewd assessment of where the real threats to stability lay. Had Russian policymakers adequately considered their military posture and the nature of their Serbian ally, they should have either exerted more influence in advance to let the Serbians know that they could not count on full Russian support if they behaved irresponsibly.

Germany: Technocracy and Preemption

If it was Serbia that chose local crisis, Austria that chose to widen the crisis, and Russia that chose to arm for general war, it was Germany, in the end, that preferred to fight and fight now, rather than run the risk of attempting a more modest resolution It was Germany that immediately invaded two countries – France and Belgium – that had done nothing to provoke it. Why?

The answer, of course, is that Germany’s military experts had developed one – and really only one – military plan for a general European crisis, the famous Schlieffen Plan. The Schlieffen Plan was brilliant and incredibly detailed, full of careful consideration of the balance of forces and the available opportunities for Germany pushing through Belgium and overwhelming France before Russia could get its act together. And it almost worked. The intricacy and audacity of the Schlieffen Plan seduced the military planners of Germany then, and has seduced military analysts of the war ever since with the elusive question of whether this or that change in the disposition of forces or the battlefield decisions of von Kluck and other commanders could have made it work and forced France to sue for peace as swiftly in the fall of 1914 as it did in the spring of 1871 and the summer of 1940.

But while the Schlieffen Plan was brilliant, it was also fundamentally flawed in ways that should have precluded it from gaining a dominant role in the nation’s war planning, and would have precluded it in a nation with better civilian control of the military. Even tactically, Schlieffen had no more plan than the Underpants Gnomes for how the German army was actually supposed to roll up Paris once it arrived, and took inadequate consideration of the potential of British intervention on the line of march through Belgium. He also left East Prussia dangerously exposed, and only good fortune, good generalship and poor Russian communications prevented an epic military disaster for Germany on the Eastern Front and instead inflicted one on the faster-mobilized-than-expected Russians at Tannenberg.

On a broader strategic level, the Schlieffen Plan committed Germany to a swift preemptive war without a plan for how to conduct a long-term war if the initial move failed – a failure similar to that of Imperial Japan in attacking the United States a quarter century later. The subject of preemptive wars has a long and controversial history, full of successes and failures, that has tended in recent years to be overshadowed by the American experience in Iraq. For these purposes, the important point is that preemptive war is a hazardous undertaking, and doubly so when its premise is that the balance between a roughly militarily evenly matched set of combatants can be overwhelmed by rapid action. A war launched on such a premise, without a fallback plan for prolonged combat, is the height of irresponsible statesmanship. In fact, the German military’s view of pre-emption was driven largely by the accelerating industrialization of Russia, which left German war planners in fear that the careful balance of the Schlieffen Plan would be upset if Russia had a few more years to build up its industrial capacity. The planners built into their plans a war that would need to be fought before the plans were overtaken by events.

And so, when push came to shove, it was the war plans that dictated the war, and even the Kaiser (who like many of his ministers was of two minds about war) lacked the gravitas to overrule the military technocrats who had planned this series of tripwires. All the way to July 30, two days after Austria’s declaration of war, the Kaiser, the British Foreign Minister and the French were all pushing for Austria to “Stop in Belgrade” so as to avoid widening the war beyond Austria and Serbia. But at the same time von Moltke, the head of the German General Staff, had already demanded that Belgium allow free passage of the German army through its territory and was now telling Austria to mobilize for war against Russia. The Austrian emperor signed a general mobilization order on July 31, and the Russian generals, by now in a panic over being caught unawares, talked the Czar into the same thing. The Kaiser’s remaining reluctance melted away, Germany demanded that Russia demobilize or face war, and both Germany and France mobilized shortly thereafter. War could be stopped only if the various powers, now mobilized to a war footing, could be persuaded to talk it out. But von Moltke, having talked the Austrians into mobilizing, impressed on the Kaiser the impossibility of calling off the Schlieffen Plan. The Kaiser told him to call it off anyway – but then did nothing to back down from the series of ultimatums that had been premised upon it, and let von Moltke put the plan into action when none of the others blinked. The urgent inflexibility of the Schlieffen Plan had robbed Germany of any other option.

The lesson is one that should never be lost on policymakers, military or otherwise: technocratic experts not only aren’t always right, they can be affirmatively dangerous without adequate civilian supervision because of their tendency towards tunnel vision that excludes the larger considerations of state policy that range outside their expertise. In fact, the fewer probing questions an expert is apt to get from civilians, the more likely the expert is to make mistakes even within his own area, like failing to account for the British or not having a plan to reduce the Belgian forts (Schlieffen completed his plan before the German heavy guns had been manufactured). The German government of 1914 was often portrayed by the Western democracies as some sort of absolute despotism, but the Kaiser’s fatal flaw (common enough to hereditary monarchs) was instead too much trust in his subordinates, trust that a confident elected leadership would not have accepted blindly.

Conclusion

Europe blundered into the First World War, but it did so due to a series of clearly identifiable mistakes that should not be repeated. Its leaders failed when they took steps that stripped them of options, whether by trusting in irresponsible terrorists and terror-sponsoring states, by dithering instead of taking prompt action while they had the freedom of initiative, or by tying themselves into inflexible technocratic long-range plans. Today’s policymakers should not repeat those errors, but to avoid them they must understand why they went wrong in the past.

What to Do About Syria and Iraq,"A rigorously non-interventionist foreign policy poses a basic paradox. The worse the rest of the world looks, the more the anti-interventionists can say there are no good options to choose from, and we should just stay home and keep out of trouble. But the worse the world looks, the more intervention is actually necessary to improve the state of the world, give us better options to choose from, and keep all of that trouble from coming back home.

In short, intervention looks less appealing precisely to the extent that it becomes more necessary.

Today, as the consequences of the Obama Doctrine sink in, the world is looking worse than it has in a good long while, so the anti-interventionists are taking full advantage of the first half of the paradox. Particularly in the Syria-Iraq theater—it has become essentially one war—everything is so bad that it looks like there are no good options, and it’s easy to throw up our hands, write off the rest of the world, and do nothing.

But when we do nothing, our options tend to get a whole lot worse, fast. That’s how we got where we are right now, by refusing to choose among the not-so-bad options we had a few years ago and instead just letting things drift while a cross-border jihadist group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, gained strength. Will another year or two of letting ISIS and Iran have a romp through the Middle East give us better options?

But that raises the big question: if we need to intervene in Syria and Iraq, what can we do?

Let’s define specifically the dilemma we face. The conflict in Iraq and Syria is turning into a battle between two evil forces, in which neither side is friendly to our interests. If we intervene to fight ISIS, we’re supporting the Iranians’ proxies in Iraq. But if we refuse to fight ISIS, we let them take over and establish their terrorist “caliphate.” Either way, it seems, we lose.

But when we state this dilemma, we can recognize that we’ve faced it before on a much bigger scale. In World War II, we aligned ourselves with the Soviets to defeat the Nazis, only to have Stalin swallow half of Europe, so that we had to spend the next four decades fighting the Russians and their proxies all over the world. I think it made sense to fight the Nazis first because it allowed us to secure free societies among our natural allies in Western Europe, particularly Britain, and because it was coherent with our fight against the Japanese regime that actually attacked us in 1941 and started the war. Certainly, we had no direct casus belli for taking on the Soviets first.

This strategy also made sense within a larger framework. If we hadn’t intervened, Europe would have been divided between Fascists and Communists, leaving no room for peaceful, free societies. It would have given us only a choice of enemies and left us threatened by both sides.

We now face the same prospect in the Middle East: a region divided between a Shiite theocratic terrorist regime, Iran, and a Sunni theocratic terrorist regime, ISIS (or merely the Islamic State as they now style themselves). These two enemies will happily carve up the Middle East between them—there is some evidence that Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad deliberately fostered the rise of ISIS—and they will wage sectarian warfare indefinitely along the fault lines between them, so long as they rule unchallenged within their own heartlands.

I don’t see any way in which this is good for us. ISIS is a terrorist organization on the model of al-Qaeda that openly seeks to launch attacks on the US. Iran is one of the world’s biggest state sponsors of terrorism—you might recall that Iran’s Quds Force was implicated in a plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the US by blowing up a restaurant in Washington, DC. Iran also seeks to dominate the Persian Gulf, giving it power over the flow of energy to the West, and its quest for an atomic bomb threatens to set off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, which is the last thing we need.

When faced with two evil alternatives, there’s some appeal to just letting them fight it out, and certainly that was a component of our strategy in World War II; most of the fighting and dying happened on the Eastern Front. Then again, this is what we’ve already tried, by default, in Syria. Despite making noises over the years about supporting the non-jihadist rebel factions in Syria, the Obama administration never actually did so, at least not enough to make any kind of difference. Last year, President Obama removed the United States as a factor in Syria when he agreed to a Vladimir Putin-brokered deal with the Assad regime (an idea that proved every bit as bad as it sounds). The result has been to empower the jihadists in Syria while reducing the incentive for other rebel factions to oppose the jihadists. The result? The expansion of the Syrian jihadists into Iraq.

I don’t think we’ve realized yet what a disaster we allowed by letting jihadists take the lead in Syria. We gave them a genuinely sympathetic cause to fight for: overthrowing a brutal dictator. This has made it easier for them to raise money from Sunnis in the Gulf States who want to oppose Iranian influence, and it has made it easier for them to recruit jihadists from across Europe, giving them a pool of trained and indoctrinated fighters who hold Western passports. Which puts them in a much better position to organize terrorist attacks against us.

Syria was a great example of the “no good options” dilemma, and it demonstrated that often the worst option is to do nothing. Early on, I favored immediate support for the original, non-sectarian rebellion, on the grounds that the longer the fighting went on, the more it would play into the hands of the jihadists. Later on, I favored backing the overthrow of the regime, then turning our efforts to the fight against ISIS and other Syrian jihadists. But I concluded that, given the president’s reluctance to act, we would have to revisit the issue “once we see what things look like after another year or three of minimal, ineffective American involvement.” It has been about a year since I wrote that, and now we can see what things look like.

The hell of this is that we’ve faced exactly this same dilemma before, in 2006, when Iraq was being torn apart by sectarian fighting between al-Qaeda in the Sunni west of Iraq and the Iranian-backed Mahdi Army in Baghdad and the south. So what did we do? We attacked the al-Qaeda threat first, flipped the Sunni tribes to our side and brokering a political accommodation with the central government, and then turned our efforts to fighting Iranian influence by suppressing the Mahdi Army.

That’s what you do when you’re faced with a choice between two hostile forces. Yes, in some cases, it can make sense to let them fight each other for a while. But in the end, you have to decide to take down one side first, then turn around and take the other side down later.

So the question in Iraq and Syria is not which of the combatants we should oppose, but which we should oppose first.

What makes this question legitimately difficult is that the answer may be different on either side of the Iraq-Syria border.

In Syria, we still have an interest in toppling the Assad regime first, if only to get it out of the way. Right now, it makes sense for the Gulf States to send support to Syrian jihadists as a way of backing their fellow Sunnis against an Iranian satellite regime. But once Assad is toppled, Syria’s jihadists—particularly ISIS, with its absurdly ambitious plans to establish a vast caliphate that would rule over the rest of the Arabian peninsula—will become a clear threat to the Gulf States, who will suddenly discover a very intense interest in supporting a more moderate regime. As for whether we could find local proxies against ISIS in a post-Assad Syria, see the success of other Syrian rebel groups in driving ISIS out of the key city of Aleppo.

In Iraq, we have an interest in backing the central government against ISIS—but we also need to reform the central government. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s sectarian administration wrecked the political accommodation with Iraq’s Sunnis, and it can’t be restored while he is still in office, so he needs to be pushed out—a move that would probably be quite popular with a variety of Iraqi factions. But no political solution in Baghdad will work unless ISIS is also being defeated in the field. More broadly, the only reason anyone in Baghdad is going to pay attention to the US is if we demonstrate that we’re committed to sticking around and ensuring an outcome that fits with our interests. If we can’t show that, then all of the factions will make other arrangements with allies whose interests are contrary to our own. Which is exactly what got us to this point.

After ISIS is defeated in Iraq, then we can turn back to our previous indirect, Cold War-style strategy for undermining the Iranian regime and containing its influence.

I should point out that these solutions do not require sending 150,000 troops back into Iraq for a new “surge.” The threat from ISIS is serious enough to warrant direct American military action, and as in Libya, an air war against the Assad regime may be necessary to tip the balance to the rebels. But most of what I am proposing can be accomplished less directly, by providing our chosen allies and proxies with money, supplies, weapons, training, intelligence, and diplomatic support. One of the signatures of the Obama administration is that they talked down the importance of military action and talked up the power of diplomacy—then proved particularly disengaged and inept in their use of diplomacy.

Might someone have better ideas for how to deal with Syria and Iraq? Possibly. The main issue is that we have to stop just standing on the sidelines gawking and hoping that everything turns out all right. We need to pick a strategy, pick sides, and do something, because we’ve been doing nothing for long enough to realize that this conflict isn’t going to turn out fine if we leave it on its own.

Unfortunately, this discussion may be moot, because there is little point in offering advice to this ideologically blinkered administration. They have made some noises about doing a few of the things I recommend—arming non-jihadist rebels in Syria, providing military support to fight ISIS in Iraq, pushing Maliki out of power. But President Obama has done it in the same lackadaisical, half-hearted way he does everything in foreign policy. For a crisis fueled specifically by a vacuum of American credibility, this is not likely to be enough.

So why discuss it now? To defuse the paradox of the non-interventionists by answering the fatalistic notion that we have no viable options in the Middle East. Yes, we do—we’re just not choosing to act on any of them. Remember that when our options get even worse.

5 More Typos We Found In Major Pieces Of Legislation,"Much has been said, most all of it idiotic, about how a typo/drafting error was responsible for the recent federal court decision that forbids Obamacare subsidies from being used to offset the cost of federal health exchange plans. Seriously. A lot of people who are not particularly bright have actually claimed the whole brouhaha is due to a silly little typo.

HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA ""My subsequent statement was just a speak-o—you know, like a typo."" http://t.co/A2YQ0xummq

Gruber 2012: States without exchange don't get subsidies http://t.co/6060bjYxSZ Gruber 2 days ago: This is a typo http://t.co/dhk4fCR1jZ



AG (@AG_Conservative) July 25, 2014

A major federal appeals court, however, did not just gut Obamacare because of a “drafting error.” But in keeping with the spirit of the always accurate and super intellectual argumentation we’ve come to expect from the Left, we here at The Federalist have identified a number of other huge drafting errors in major legislation.

Without further ado, here are 5 massive drafting errors in landmark legislation that had been completely missed until now:

1) The Bush tax cuts didn’t actually sunset after 10 years. They were permanent.

When the Bush tax cuts were initially passed in 2001 and expanded in 2003, they technically included a 10-year sunset in order to comply with budget reconciliation rules. But most of the people who voted for it and wrote it didn’t want a sunset. They wanted the tax cuts to be permanent. The point of the law was to increase economic growth. Why on earth would lawmakers not want to increase economic growth forever? We’re supposed to believe they only wanted more jobs and higher growth for ten years? That’s absurd.

Sure, the law technically states that the new tax rates and brackets were to expire after ten years, but we really do need to look beyond the plain meaning and focus on the real intent of and context surrounding the law.

Plus, I heard someone somewhere say they actually meant to make it sunset after 100 years, not 10. The point is: let’s not let this silly drafting error get in the way of increased economic growth. Unless you hate people having jobs and making money.

2) The Iraq war authorization actually allows the U.S. to invade Canada.

In 2002, Congress passed and the president signed a law giving the president the authority to use military force against Iraq. And everywhere else. A few caveats: yes, the law itself is entitled “Authorization For Use Of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution Of 2002,” so a pedestrian analyst might look at it and assume it’s only related to Iraq. And yes, the law technically only allowed the president to use force against Iraq and not other countries:

AUTHORIZATION.—The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to—

(1) defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and

(2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.

But c’mon. The resolution was written by Republicans and supported by Bush, and they’re all dirty war mongers who love killing people, so it’s absurd to assume they’d only constrain their insatiable blood lust to a single Middle Eastern country. Ergo, watch out Canada. You might be next.

3) The PATRIOT Act allowed waterboarding of anti-war opponents.

Think about it. Terrorists attacked us, and we were unprepared. The PATRIOT Act was intended to give law enforcement the ability to find and stop terrorists before they could strike us again. Terrorists opposed the war against terrorism. And anti-war activists opposed the war, so they’re kind of just like terrorists.

Anyhow, the point is that waterboarding dissenters would have made crushing dissent a lot easier, which would’ve made war a lot easier, which would’ve made protecting America easier, which was the whole point of the PATRIOT Act.

Sure, they didn’t technically write that authorization into the law, but there’s really no other way to interpret their intent. And if you disagree, it’s probably because you’re a terrorist.

4) About that whole Second Amendment thing…

Finally we get to the real fruits of the Left’s labor of interpretation legislative intent. Yes, the Second Amendment mentions guns. Yes, it mentions the right to own and bear them. Yes, it says that right shall not be infringed. Yes, America was freed from oppressive British rule thanks to the ability of common individuals to fight back using their own weapons.

But c’mon: a right for people to own guns? That’s just absurd.

5) About that whole First Amendment thing…

Remember that time the Founders fought a war to ensure our right to freely express our religious beliefs? Well, you remembered wrong. It turns out they were only cool with speech approved by 21st century liberal politicians. I mean, the right to own a gun to protect yourself is one thing. But the right to say your thoughts out loud? Talk about absurd:

[I]n the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Democrats held a hearing on Tom Udall’s proposal to gut the First Amendment by allowing Congress to prohibit or restrict participation in political campaigns. The Democrats like to say that the amendment would reverse the effect of the Citizens United and McCutcheon cases, but in fact it goes much farther than that. The amendment, which is favored by Harry Reid and most Senate Democrats, would give Congress unprecedented power to limit debate on public issues in the context of elections. You really have to read the proposed amendment to understand how radical it is.

Thankfully, the constitutional geniuses who run the U.S. Senate have finally found a way to correct the first-ever American legal typo: just repeal the First Amendment in its entirety. With that out of the way, they won’t ever have to worry every again about people going to court to affirm the notion that words mean things.

At long last, America’s never-ending, speech-laden, typo-fueled nightmare might finally be over.",https://thefederalist.com/2014/07/25/5-more-typos-we-found-in-major-pieces-of-legislation/,2014-07-25
"Big Government Is The Borg, And Resistance Isn’t Futile","Checks and balances are definitely not President Obama’s style. So we shouldn’t be surprised when he pulls another executive order out of his well-stocked hip pocket any time Congress or the Supreme Court doesn’t do what he wants. Some recent developments have proved especially insufferable for him, what with Congress refusing to rubber stamp his immigration plans and the Supreme Court declining to do same for his abortifacient mandate. It seems Obama believes that neither Congress nor the Supreme Court count as branches of the government when they don’t follow suit.

This is simply the nature of what we so euphemistically call “big government.” It’s difficult to come up with a more specific term to describe the current phenomenon, especially since so many Americans seem to be on board with Obama’s style. Big government beckons with promises of a more humane future, total equality, a utopian sentimentality-without-faith. But, to borrow the words of Flannery O’Connor—echoed by Walker Percy—such tenderness “leads to the gas chamber.”

One way to get this message across is to explain that really gigantic government is personified in the Borg of “Star Trek” lore. The Borg is a formidable collection of species that function as drones ruled by a collectivist hive mind. It fuels itself by devouring everyone in its path.

Resistance Is Futile

The Borg’s stated goal is to “achieve perfection.” What’s not to like there? And doesn’t it stand to reason that everyone must be sucked into its vacuum? A Borg’s got to do what a Borg’s got to do. So, if you’re in its path, it first greets you by stating: “Resistance is futile.” It then absorbs you and erases your identity. And thus it propels and gorges itself throughout the universe.

Those most attracted to power tend to be control freaks rather than the live-and-let-live types.

The irony, in this era of bloating government, is that the Borg is still considered a villain in popular culture. Why? The Borg acts just like any blob bureaucracy: it comes, it sees, it conquers. And more young people—especially those inclined to follow in the footsteps of the Obama 2012 campaign’s Julia infographic—seem tempted with the idea of womb-to-tomb care by a Borg-like State. The dirty little secret, which they may or may not see, is that being a wholly owned creature of the state means ultimately becoming a tool of the state, which must “help” more individuals, who become tools, etc. Resistance is futile.

The Borg’s goal of perfection is a classic utopian lure: attaining an almost mechanical precision in society in which all beings operate in symphony, kind of like ant colonies. Unfortunately, its methods to achieve utopia are coercive. But this is logical, Captain. The journey of utopian dreams is always—and, as history proves, always has been—paved with brute force.

That’s because, in the words of University of Hawaii political science professor R. J. Rummel, “Power Kills.” No matter what the stated motive is—peace, love, hope, or change. No matter whether the motive is sincere or, more likely, a fake front to accumulate power.

When power is never limited or checked or balanced, it can’t get enough of itself. When it reaches a tipping point at which a power-mongering clique or dictator can further the goal of more power accumulation (in the name of whatever), it will destroy anything that gets in the way. And it will rationalize any use of force in the name of a better tomorrow. That’s the just nature of the beast.

The End Thereof Is Death

All human beings are flawed. All leaders are human beings. All leaders are flawed. So, it’s worth paying some attention to what some leaders do with power when they get too much. In the worst-case scenarios, we all know that some people actually kill to maintain power. Not only that, but they have a tendency to feel justified in doing so, especially after they get more power.

We need to get beyond, ‘This could lead to a European-style socialist system.’

The reality is that those most attracted to power tend to be control freaks rather than the live-and-let-live types. So in a system devoid of checks and balances you’re more likely to end up with a Joseph Stalin as leader than with, say, Saint Francis of Assisi. And once little dictators have the reins of government power, there’s no way they’ll let go.

It’s time to stop dancing around the issue and to stop talking so antiseptically and academically about limiting government in order to “increase fiscal responsibility” or “reduce the debt.” It’s time to stop merely arguing against executive orders because they “just aren’t the way we do things in a Republic.” We need to get beyond “This could lead to a European-style socialist system.”

The primary reason to fight against big government is that its final destination is Death. As in murder. At some point, someone’s got to say it. So there, I said it. (#bansorry)

The late professor Rummel delivered some hard facts during his career compiling statistics on deaths from various forms of institutionalized murder. In his book “Death by Government” (1994,) Rummel’s first lines read:

Power kills; absolute Power kills absolutely. This new Power Principle is the message emerging from my previous work on the causes of war and from this book on genocide and government mass murder—what I call democide—in [the 20th] century. The more power a government has, the more it can act arbitrarily according to the whims and desires of the elite, and the more it will make war on others and murder its foreign and domestic subjects. The more constrained the power of governments, the more power is diffused, checked and balanced, the less it will aggress on others and commit democide. At the extremes of Power, totalitarian communist governments slaughter their people by the tens of millions; in contrast, many democracies can barely bring themselves to execute even serial murderers.



These assertions are extreme and categorical, but so is the evidence . . .

Indeed, the evidence is astonishing. Death by government in the 20th century cost 169 million lives. That’s at least four times more people killed by their own governments than by war. In the 20th century 38 million lives—both military and civilian—were lost in all conflicts combined.

The Link Between Utopia and Terror

First, please note, I’m not saying the administration’s penchant for government by executive fiat, utopian rhetoric, and radical social policy put us on the brink of democide. All I’m trying to say is that those who remain ignorant of history are ill equipped to pass judgment on the wisdom of certain policies and political approaches. Anyone who takes a sober look back at the last century’s big governments would be very motivated to limit government, not grow it.

Every thinking person would do well to listen to the audio course Utopia and Terror in the 20th Century. It was produced in 2003, and the lectures by University of Tennessee professor Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius are an absolute tour de force that will help you connect the dots and understand patterns in the history of 20th-century human violence. Liulevicius describes the general scope of his course:

A bitter contradiction is revealed between the age’s promises of progress and its bloody record. The twin concepts of utopia and terror are defined and their linkage is examined: The aim of achieving a perfect society was supposed to justify violent means. Utopia refers to the perennial human impulse to imagine a flawless society, free of contradictions and conflicts. Terror designates the deliberate and systematic use of fear and violence to achieve political ends. The 20th century saw the rise of dynamic and brutal ideological regimes that promised total solutions.



Then he asks a chilling question about the past century’s terrors: What if these things are not throwbacks, but signs of things to come?

Naturally, we’d all prefer to see these things as throwbacks. If you live a carefree life in America, you’re possibly offended by this as beyond the pale, tinfoil hat stuff. Nevertheless, insisting on a comfortable aversion to that question does make you susceptible to manipulation by such forces. However, if you have an inkling of history, then you might wonder about the possibilities of some bad history repeating itself. You might even see some troublesome patterns of too much power in the hands of too few people. Your awareness that power kills would make you a more effective resister.

Utopia’s Cruel Response to Resistance

Utopianism is perennial bait tyrants pitch to the masses. It tends to suck us in because humans want to overcome everything bad everywhere. It’s our deep-seated urge to visualize across-the-board solutions for what ails us socially. But once we’re sold on the pitch, we’re sunk. That’s because elites always use fear to get and keep raw power. In the words of Liulevicius, “Terror seeks to instill fear and panic, aiming at forcing transformation.” He notes that terror and utopia are strongly linked in the 20th century, “because plans for perfection encountered either passive or active resistance. If individuals and society would not willingly submit to being radically remade, compulsion would be used to enforce the planned perfection.”

If you have an inkling of history, then you might wonder about the possibilities of some bad history repeating itself.

This last point is key. Every dictator, from Lenin to Stalin to Mao to Castro to Pol Pot and so on, imposed their visions of a greater tomorrow. This tomorrow could only come for them once the problematic people—the resistors, the “undesirables,” the counter-revolutionaries—were eliminated. Liulevicius speaks of the rise of “political religions”—ideologies that promise “ultimate meaning and a perfect future”—that provide supporters both the confidence and justification to suppress dissent.

In fact, political religion does seem uncomfortably real today, and its practitioners have a knack for using fear of persecution and force to try to shut up dissenters. Think global warming, gay marriage, and the transgender push to redefine all of humanity by claiming sex is merely “assigned” to us at birth.

The list goes on, but suffice it to say that expressing opposition to any tenet of this political religion is considered an act of heresy in the public square today. The media, Hollywood, academia, and sundry politicians serve as defenders of the faith. Resisting can get you burned at the stake, socially and professionally speaking.

Four Key Elements of the Utopia-Terror Dynamic

How can so few end up imposing their iron-fisted rule over so many? Liulevicius identifies four key elements in the road from utopian vision to dystopian reality in the 20th century: Masses, Machines, Mobsters, and Master Plans. The masses and machines provide the means. The mobsters and the master plans provide the motives.

1.) Masses. In order to consolidate support, 20th-century regimes had to mobilize masses of people. They “exploited societies in turmoil, full of uprooted and atomized individuals.” (Does this sound a bit like our borders right now?) “Humans caught up in ideological movements were often uprooted, members of ‘lonely crowds’ seeking escape in promises of belonging, anonymity, and equality.” (The constant media harping on “inequality” certainly foments this sense today, as do speech codes. Other slogans such as “spread the wealth” and the Occupy movement’s “We are the 99 percent” call for mass mobilization.)

Every dictator, from Lenin to Stalin to Mao to Castro to Pol Pot and so on, imposed their visions of a greater tomorrow.

2.) Machines. This would include not only newly devised instruments of war, but also modern technologies and media for propaganda use, to manufacture public opinion “approval,” to bloat bureaucracies and to use police and data collection to gain compliance. A system of surveillance by neighbors was, and still is, standard practice in totalitarian societies. In the 21st century we see the explosion of social media as a means of driving public opinion to grow support for utopian agendas. The invasion of privacy by Big Data looms ever larger.

3.) Mobsters. These would be the elites who drove the 20th century’s mass movements for transformation: “They gathered into organized conspiracies to achieve political power and often using criminal methods, inspired by gangster bosses.” They act as though above the law. One can see this in unsavory alliances between government and big business, abuse of executive orders, codes of silence that include cover-ups for wrongdoing among the elites, but also the silencing of dissenters through threats and fear. Joy Pullmann recently illustrated how an era of “mafia government” is being played out today.

4.) Master Plans. These are “ideologies championed by mass movements, total blueprints based on ideas, promising utopia as an outcome, with comprehensive visions of a future society. They could be adapted to changing conditions, while still claiming to be infallible.” It’s not much of a stretch to see Obamacare and Common Core as examples of “master plans.” They are enormous in scope, taking over both the medical and educational sectors of society. There is also a push for the philosophy of communitarianism, which is basically a softer term for communism: both prescribe a relationship of community to individuals that trumps family and any other autonomous relationship.

Liulevicius identifies four key elements in the road from utopian vision to dystopian reality in the 20th century: Masses, Machines, Mobsters, and Master Plans.

The main purpose of mass movements is to create an aura of dynamism that creates an illusion of a juggernaut that helps push the elite’s agenda forward. Utopian visions, whether left or right politically, are all similar in their actions and their structures. They require centralized power to force a vision of transformation on the whole society. A common theme that runs through these movements is that a “vanguard,” or power clique, is necessary to protect the masses.

But in order to effectively prop up government, or get out of the government’s way, the masses must be made up of isolated individuals, atomized and unable to have independent relationships with one another. This requires sowing a culture of distrust. Dictators, and even utopian democrats, are really good at this. As more and more people fear social punishment for speaking their minds, people become more isolated. The bonds of personal relationships weaken. People are divided as never before. This state of affairs always serves mobsters very well.

Is Resistance Futile?

When the Borg begins to suck in a victim, it warns: “Resistance is futile.” As powerful as the Borg is, why would it do that? Two reasons, I think. First, it needs to heighten the sense of inevitability for the victim. Second, it needs to heighten the sense of inevitability for itself.

Resistance is still a nagging challenge for the Borg, even though it prevails. That’s because resistance forces the Borg to see its behavior and existence rejected. And that doesn’t compute. So I wonder: Is the Borg also really using the meme to convince itself, to reinforce its own sense of mission? All autocrats expend vast amounts of resources and energy fighting even the tiniest bits of resistance. And they always expect resistance.

People are divided as never before. This state of affairs always serves mobsters very well.

For example, there is an interesting YouTube interview on this tendency, from an infiltrator of the terrorist organization Weather Underground. Larry Grathwohl is the author of “Bringing Down America,” and was an FBI informant who joined the Weather Underground during the 1960’s. Bill Ayers, the group’s leader, today is a strong supporter of Barack Obama. Although Ayers always likes to claim there is distance between him and Obama, their ideologies are very much in sync, and he is known to have groomed Obama for office.

During a meeting in 1969, Grathwohl asked Weather Underground leaders about the aftermath of taking over the government: What would they do with Americans who resisted the revolution? Grathwohl says they told him such Americans would go into re-education camps in the Southwest. Any who couldn’t be re-educated in the new way of thinking would need to be eliminated (as in killed). When asked for an estimate of how many might need to be killed, Grathwohl reports Ayers and company told him: “about 25 million people.”

Fascinating, Captain.

Do you recall Rummel’s “extreme and categorical evidence?” That evidence is impressively depressing. The 169 million government-sponsored murders in the 20th century indicate unchecked domestic government is lethal. Perhaps resistance is not futile. Perhaps submission is far more futile and far more deadly.

Atomized Versus Healthy Individuals

Whatever you think of Grathwohl’s account of Ayers (which of course Ayers denies,) it’s interesting that Ayers has spent decades as an academic in Chicago, an education reformer dedicated to bringing his radical “social justice” ideas to public education. For at least the past 40 years, he has advocated for politically correct policies and school curricula that essentially cultivate ignorance and stunted thinking. By replacing the study of history—whether Western Civilization or any real survey course—with a disparate package of “relevant” ethnic/gender identity studies, we’ve made it harder for students to develop the ability to think coherently about the past and about patterns of human behavior.

In addition, speech codes and political correctness cause people to fear speaking out. (“Question authority!” used to be a rallying cry of Ayers’ radical Left. We don’t hear that so much when they’re in charge, do we?) This causes a spiral of silence that leads to social isolation. People become distrustful and less able to share their innermost beliefs with others. In short, relationships become weakened throughout society. People become atomized, or disconnected. They become the perfect drones for strongmen.

Submission is futile. Resistance is the only hope, the only way out.

The net effect is a vacuum of knowledge and amnesia of history. That basically removes much of the will to resist whatever transformation might be pushed. People become more at sea mentally, and so more inclined to latch onto big government as though it’s an anchor.

But there are signs of hope. As Liulevicius notes, there is enormous power in human individuality. This individuality, he says, is “embedded in true, everyday human community, rather than given over to loneliness in crowds. . . Genuine individuals resist the ‘marching impulse’ of organized crowds.”

When people hold on to their individuality and resist absorption into group think, they have so much to offer in relationships with those who might feel more isolated. They can reach out with kindness and understanding. They can build trust as they share their knowledge of the wider world. This creates an irresistible ripple effect that injects strength into the bonds of those relationships, which are the building blocks of real community. True individuals offer the polar opposite of the type of “community” now advocated by communitarians who aim to stamp out individuality once they’ve trumped it.

Whenever power seekers talk about “community,” they generally mean masses of atomized individuals whose first loyalty must be to the fount of power, generally the State. It’s not a real community because it doesn’t allow for personal relationships that cannot be controlled by the State. It’s a Borg community, a “hive mind” without distinct individuals. In the end, these systems are really fragile house of cards when exposed to resistance by true individuals. Why else would political correctness be so tirelessly applied to punish dissenters?

The big little secret—and the great truth it represents—is that resistance is not futile. Submission is futile. Resistance is the only hope, the only way out. The Borg knows this very well. So do the likes of Bill Ayers, Incorporated.

Obama’s Callous Humanitarianism,"One of the consequences of Barack Obama’s presidency will be to discredit the foreign policy of the “humanitarians.” It won’t be because people think it’s bad to feel compassion for the suffering of others. It will be because the loudly declared compassion of the humanitarians is revealed, in practice, as ineffectual posturing adopted as a substitute for actual strategy.

The latest occasion for this is the president’s announcement that he has authorized American air strikes to stop the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria from expanding to swallow up Iraqi Kurdistan. What triggered this announcement? ISIS had begun to overrun Kurdish border positions and threatened to wipe out about 40,000 Christians and Yezidis (leftover Zoroastrians) who have long enjoyed a safe haven thanks to Kurdish broadmindedness on the subject of religion.

(By the way, ISIS is now calling itself just the “Islamic State” and demanding the loyalty of the entire Muslim world, but I’ll continue adding the “Iraq and Syria” part because those are the only places they can actually assert any authority. Plus, it makes for a better acronym.)

President Obama declared here that the US “cannot turn a blind eye” to the “genocide” of the Yezidis. Yes, this is from the same man who turned a blind eye while hundreds of thousands of people have been brutally wiped out, tortured, and starved in Syria. But 40,000 face a similar threat in another spot, so he lets loose a few American bombs. That’s what impresses me most about this: the capriciousness of Obama’s humanitarianism, and also its episodic nature, as if it is all driven by a response to temporary political forces and the desire to avoid bad press coverage for a few news cycles, with no bigger, long-range thought behind it.

It reminds me of Obama’s approach to the war in Libya. When Gaddafi’s thugs were driving east toward Benghazi and vowing to kill everyone there, finally Obama authorized American action—but once the conflict was over and Gaddafi was overthrown, he dropped the issue. He took no interest in Libya, made no plan for how to help stabilize the country, and devoted no resources to the issue. As a result, he ended up losing an ambassador and three other American in Benghazi, and now our entire diplomatic mission has bugged out as the country dissolves in a new civil war.

President Obama’s State Department has become notorious for its “hashtag diplomacy,” using Twitter messages to impress upon everyone how much the administration cares about a particular issue—#UnitedForUkraine or #BringBackOurGirls—as cover for the fact that we’re not really doing anything about it.

Back in Iraq, Jacob Siegel succinctly describes how this current disaster was a result of the failure of President Obama’s previous approach to Iraq: “What had been the US policy—to rely on local forces to contain ISIS while waiting for a new Iraqi government to reach a political solution—is finished.” He goes on to warn that a few airstrikes are not likely to accomplish anything, either. No kidding.

This fits the Obama pattern, in every overseas conflict, of doing just the bare minimum necessary to be able to talk himself into the hope that it will all work itself out somehow, that somebody else will step up and America doesn’t have to take a stand. American disengagement from the world is his goal, the only consistent theme of his administration. These fits of humanitarian intervention are just temporary punctuation within an overall strategy of withdrawal.

Remember the old expression that if you fail to plan, you plan to fail? The reverse is also true: if you plan to fail, you fail to plan. If your goal is American irrelevance, then you won’t make any plans for how the US can successfully shape events to serve our interests. So we don’t see much evidence of a long-term plan here. Obama announced his new war in Iraq by promising that “I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq.” This war-that-is-not-a-war approach indicates the absence of any strategy in Iraq.

To establish a strategy in Iraq is to establish a long-term end result that America wants to achieve, to pick sides in the current fight, and to commit to doing whatever is necessary to achieve the desired result. In this case, America cannot tolerate the existence of a brutal terrorist state like ISIS, given that this is precisely the kind of organization that mounted the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Even if we act now, I believe it is only a matter of time before ISIS-backed terrorists, probably US or European citizens who were recruited for the jihad, attempt a significant terrorist attack on the United States. They will no doubt cite the current air strikes as provocation, so we might as well get something substantial out of them. Rather than a few airstrikes to protect one small enclave, we need an effort which includes continued airstrikes coordinated by hundreds of American special forces embedded with Kurdish troops at the front—coupled with some serious ultimatums to the central government in Baghdad to get rid of its incompetent, sectarian, Iranian-backed leadership and to reincorporate the Sunni tribes alienated by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.

But this requires a president willing to set the strategic objective of defeating ISIS, as opposed to just containing its spread and alleviating the latest humanitarian crisis caused by its brutal rule.

That’s the underlying problem with “humanitarian” foreign policy. We cannot react to every humanitarian crisis in the world, and most of the time, such a crisis is merely a symptom of a much bigger problem. But “humanitarians” react to these symptoms ad hoc and emotionally, with no consistency and no follow-up. Often, as in the case of Iraq, this seems to be intended as guilty compensation for the strategic indifference that allowed the country to descend into bloody chaos in the first place.

What would a strategic humanitarianism entail? It would involve a long-term campaign to eliminate the kind of terrorist groups and dictatorial regimes that commit acts of mass slaughter and to replace them with governments that represent their people and have some respect for their rights. Such an approach is generally know by the label “neoconservatism.”

What would be better would be the big-picture approach of the neoconservatives—one that addresses the underlying causes of global threats rather than just the symptoms—combined with a focus on regimes and terrorist groups who pose the greatest threat to the United States. Which would be, more or less, the foreign policy of George W. Bush—who actually did achieve, for a while, a period of peace and stability in Iraq that was consistent with American interests.

But we couldn’t have that now, could we? Better to throw around a few “humanitarian” bombs to make ourselves feel better for a while.

"Niebuhr, Iraq, And Moral Clarity","The argument so far: Michael Boyle argued that calling ISIS “evil” is strategically self-defeating. Paul D. Miller argued that moral clarity is vital in wartime. Boyle responded by highlighting some of the potential dangers of moral clarity.

Michael Boyle has advanced two claims about the dangers of moral clarity: 1) it can blind us to the nuances of a situation, and 2) it can generate an aggressive overconfidence and self-righteousness. The first concern is overblown, maybe even exactly wrong: the obvious evil of a group like ISIS can concentrate minds to focus on how best to dismember it. In any case, the United States is bad at implementing just about every foreign policy, not just the one involving combat against evil groups, so we can hardly blame our failures on the use of moral language.

The second concern is widely popular and, theologically speaking, entirely sound. However, it is also widely misunderstood and misused, not for prudent self-examination, but for moral paralysis. Boyle’s concern here stems from a particular reading of the twentieth century theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. Niebuhr rightly argued that the United States should be cautious about its own power; that it should examine its motives carefully. Niebuhr based his critique on a Christian understanding of human nature: because we are fallen and sinful, we are often blind to how our own selfishness warps our conception of morality. The problem with Niebuhr is that he talks out of both sides of his mouth and people only hear the side they like to hear.

Think, then Act

Boyle argues we should be skeptical about always assuming the moral righteousness of our cause. He is, of course, right. We shouldn’t assume: we should think carefully about it. But when we conclude that we are on the right side, we should hold that belief firmly, and act on it. Too often when critics invoke Niebuhrian caution, they are not cautioning us to be careful about too blithely assuming we’re right. Rather, they actually mean that it is impossible to ever be “right” on anything; any claims to “rightness” are dangerous fundamentalist zeal bound to lead us to fanaticism and violence. In counseling self-doubt, they are not suggesting a healthy debate and scrutiny of one’s motives and beliefs before acting; they mean we should park permanently in a position of self-doubt because all action is suspect.

That is, of course, not what Niebuhr said—and I assume not what Boyle would say either. Niebuhr was quite clear about our need to confront evil in the world, to take sides, and to take action. He was even pretty clear about the goodness of democracy. But I fear that the practical effect of Boyle’s and other critics’ arguments would engender moral paralysis and inaction because of their intense skepticism of American motives. They cite a few aberrations, like Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, and extrapolate a trend. But in the stretch of history those examples are the outliers, not the norm.

Jihadists Aren’t Wildly Different

Boyle and I also disagree profoundly on the nature of the war against jihadists. David Kilcullen rightly formulated the problem as a “global Islamist insurgency,” understanding the menagerie of jihadist terrorist groups and insurgencies around the world to be broadly similar in motivation and ideology while distinct in their short-term goals and tactics. While their ideology is hostile to the United States, the United States certainly cannot and should not try to combat every one of those groups on its own because very few of them can do us any significant harm. Our strategy has rightly been to disaggregate them by breaking the transnational links that empower groups to go beyond their national borders. Disrupting terrorist financing networks is probably the most effective thing we can do against most of these groups. We only need get directly involved to combat the groups that threaten to overwhelm whatever local government they oppose—which, right now, includes the Islamic State (ISIS), the Taliban, possibly al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and few others.

Disrupting terrorist financing networks is probably the most effective thing we can do against most of these groups.

Boyle underappreciates the ideological challenge jihadists pose. He brings out the old trope about how jihadism is a perversion of Islam and most Muslims don’t buy into it. True: but so what? The hostile and aggressive ideology of jihadism—no matter its relation to Islam—is thriving, alive, and well-established in many corners of the globe. Because of its implacable hostility to the United States, we should understand that the triumph of jihadism anywhere in the world would be a threat to U.S. national security—but especially in strategically valuable places like Saudi Arabia or Iraq (because of their oil), Pakistan (nukes), or Afghanistan (opium, caves, history, and dense network of jihadists across the region). That means any and all of these jihadist groups is part of “the enemy,” albeit not one we necessarily must be in direct combat with.

That is why I think Boyle’s recommendation that “we should stay focused on our enemy (al Qaeda), try to avoid making new ones by lumping other groups in with al Qaeda and now ISIS” is radically wrong and unrealistic. Al Qaeda (AQ) was never anything but the most theatrical, successful, and prominent of these groups. He is worried about us lumping them together—but he seems unaware that they lump themselves together, not as a merged organization or a monolithic institutional entity, but as an ideological movement, as variations on a theme, different manifestations of the same phenomenon. The fact that AQ “expelled” ISIS is immaterial. Jihadist groups will always squabble amongst themselves, but they are of a common ilk.

Different Strokes for Different Folks

Again, that does not mean the United States need to use the same tactics to combat all these groups. In most cases we simply invest in the law enforcement, border control, and counterterrorism capabilities of partner nations (like the Philippines). Sometimes we can effectively ignore them (like Boko Haram in Nigeria). Other times we do need to be involved in airstrikes (Pakistan and Iraq) or even ground combat (Afghanistan). One of the weaknesses of Cold War policy was underappreciating the difference amongst communist states; President Nixon’s insight was to understand the cleavages between China and the USSR and exploit them. Similarly, we can and should take a different policy towards different groups as conditions require (although the Nixon analogy breaks down because I don’t envision us making peace with AQ to fight ISIS, for example).

Finally, it seems that Boyle actually does agree with the need to combat jihadists ideologically, even if he won’t admit it. He concluded that one way of undermining AQ and ISIS is that “we will also have to send a message to the thousands of other prospective terrorist groups that there is a better, more efficient way to make political demands.” That sounds an awful lot like combating them with superior ideas. I daresay he is even suggesting that enabling people to express grievances freely and demand accountable governance is part of how we should combat terrorist threats. I wholeheartedly agree. In fact, someone else argued earlier in the war, “If the peoples in that region are permitted to chose their own destiny and advance by their own energy and by their participation as free men and women, then the extremists will be marginalized and the flow of violent radicalism to the rest of the world will slow and eventually end.” I’m glad Boyle agrees.

The Ferguson-9/11 Nexus,"As the riots and unrest in Ferguson recede, the Obama administration has embarked on a new adventure in Iraq, this time against the Islamic State (ISIS), hitting the terrorist enclave in Iraq with a handful of airstrikes in recent weeks. Although President Obama admitted “we don’t have a strategy yet” for confronting ISIS, the United States nevertheless has begun recruiting a broader coalition of allies to carry out attacks against the group in Syria and widen operations against it in Iraq.

Meanwhile, many Americans have come away from the riots in Ferguson, Missouri deeply disturbed by the militarization of local police departments, not just in that town but nationwide. Images of cops in armored vehicles training military-grade rifles on unarmed protestors and firing tear gas into crowds struck many as repugnant and alarming—scenes better suited to mass protests in Egypt, Ukraine, or Turkey.

So what does our response to ISIS have to do with the police response to Ferguson? Last week, Peter Suderman of Reason argued the militarized police response in Ferguson directly results from America’s response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. The federal programs that supplied the armored vehicles, body armor, tear gas, rubber bullets, and other military gear in Ferguson were meant to help cops fight terror at the local level.

It’s a bit much to say, as Suderman does, that far from fighting terror, the police in Ferguson “have helped create it,” but it’s certainly true that over the past decade local police departments nationwide have been outfitted with an unprecedented array of military gear and training. Never before have so many cops had so much military hardware as they do now, most of it supplied by the federal government.

The American Street War

Arming cops with heavier firepower began decades ago with the War on Drugs, but Suderman rightly notes that the attacks of 9/11, the War on Terror, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq accelerated the trend by many orders of magnitude:

A federal program began transferring large military grade equipment from the Pentagon to local law enforcement—giving away almost $450 million worth of equipment originally intended for conducting war last year alone. Since 2002, a separate program run by the Department of Homeland Security has provided $35 billion in grants to law enforcement around the country, funding the purchase of tactical gear, storm-trooper-style armor, and mine-resistant vehicles.

Radley Balko has had some fun chronicling the distribution of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected armored personnel vehicles, or MRAPs, to small towns like Dundee, Mich., population 3,600. But it’s not just small towns. Last year, Ohio State University acquired its very own a 19-ton MRAP. It was just one of more than 100 colleges whose campus police are getting military-grade hardware from the Department of Defense.

It became clear that giving military gear to cops just meant more local police departments would form SWAT teams.

The idea is that local cops must be prepared to disrupt terrorist plots and therefore should be trained and equipped accordingly. In the wake of 9/11, when Americans were in shock and afraid there might be more attacks on the way, this reasoning kind of made sense. But as the years wore on, it became clear that giving military gear to cops just meant more local police departments would form SWAT teams—it’s estimated that 80 percent of towns with 25,000 to 50,000 residents now have SWAT teams, up from just 26 percent in 1984—and that they would be more likely to call in the local SWAT team to, say, serve an arrest warrant (never mind that SWAT teams were originally conceived as a special response unit to hostage or active shooter scenarios). The pretense that any of this has anything to do with actual law enforcement has all but disappeared: the federal program doling out the military equipment doesn’t seem to distinguish between areas with high crime rates and those that are relatively safe.

Terrorism Versus Crime

It’s hard to understand this kind of nonchalant police militarization unless you consider that it springs from a specific approach to terrorism and domestic security developed after 9/11 and employed by the last two administrations. Put simply, this approach treats terrorists as criminals and acts of terror as crimes. Law enforcement, not warfare, has become the framework for America’s response to terrorism at home and abroad. Hence, the National Security Agency’s (NSA’s) domestic spying program, the security theater of the Transportation Security Administration, the militarization of local police, and so on.

Fighting terrorism then becomes a matter of law enforcement for the host country but remains, as it should, a matter of diplomacy and warfare for the United States.

It wasn’t always this way. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, our leaders did not contemplate their response as an exercise in law enforcement, or that terrorism was merely a criminal-justice issue. President George W. Bush vowed the United States would “make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.” Accordingly, the United States delivered an ultimatum to the Taliban: hand over Osama bin Laden or face immediate attack. The Bush administration also gave an ultimatum to Pakistan, which had a long history of accommodating the Taliban. Two days after the attacks, Richard Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, handed Pakistan’s intelligence chief a list of seven demands, which included breaking ties with the Taliban, stopping al-Qaeda operations on the Pakistani border, and granting American forces access to Pakistani bases and airspace. According to former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, the demands came with a promise that if his country did not comply, the United States would “bomb it back to the Stone Age.”

Here was an entirely different response to terrorism that placed the responsibility for dealing with terrorists on the terror groups’ host regimes: if you do not take care of this problem, we will make war—not only on the terrorists, but also on you, Musharraf, or you, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and topple your regime. According this approach, any leader wishing to preserve his regime is co-opted to fight terrorist groups operating inside his country and dismantle any terrorist networks—even ones the regime itself may have helped establish. Fighting terrorism then becomes a matter of law enforcement for the host country but remains, as it should, a matter of diplomacy and warfare for the United States.

Angelo Codevilla has written at length about this approach to fighting terrorism as the only way to end America’s “permanent war footing” and “restore the respect and geopolitical balance on which peace depends.”

Ending ‘permanent war footing,’ ever so essential for any nation’s sustainability, requires being honest about who threatens us, and putting them out of action while not bothering others. The Bush and Obama Administrations, each for its own reasons, preferred to pretend that our problem consisted of bands of rogues extraneous to any authorities. Both Administrations tried and failed to identify and police such rogues in alien lands while so wrapping America in ‘security measures’ as to make it almost unrecognizable. That way lies permanent war with foreigners and strife amongst ourselves.

Police Abroad, Military At Home

Unfortunately, the Bush administration never really followed through on its promise to hold regimes accountable, or else. Instead, it gradually adopted a law-enforcement strategy for containing al-Qaeda abroad while militarizing law enforcement at home—an approach the Obama administration has maintained.

Holding regimes accountable for terrorism is an infinitely better policy than attempting to police terrorists ourselves because it doesn’t require the creation of a massive security and domestic surveillance apparatus.

But for a democracy, holding regimes accountable for terrorism is an infinitely better policy than attempting to police terrorists ourselves because it doesn’t require the creation of a massive security and domestic surveillance apparatus. The problem with the creation of such an apparatus, designed to disrupt terror plots beforehand and ferret out potential terrorists among us, is that sooner or later it will be turned on the very civilian population it was meant to protect. Between the domestic spying programs of the NSA and the militarization of police departments nationwide, we are now witnessing this process begin to play out here in the United States

If we choose to fight terrorists at home and try to police them abroad, instead of bringing the fight to them and holding their host regimes accountable, we should expect more of the kind of domestic militarization we’ve lately seen in Ferguson. And if the Obama administration’s failure to devise a strategic response to ISIS continues to manifest itself in equivocal and intermittent airstrikes that stop short of destroying the fledgling terrorist state, then we should not be surprised to see boots on the ground—not in Syria or Iraq, but here at home.

Obama’s ISIS Plan: Strategy or Fantasy?,"President Obama has finally come up with a strategy against the self-styled “Islamic State” in Iraq and Syria.

Better late than never—and there is much in this strategy that is correct, if the administration is actually willing to face up to the reality of what its strategy will require. Which we have very good reason to doubt.

Here’s what’s good about the strategy.

First, after a good deal of previous wavering and stumbling on this point, President Obama finally recognized that the Islamic State is a powerful terrorist group that must be destroyed, rather than just managed or contained. On the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks—an unlucky number, as it turns out—it is impossible to avoid the parallels between ISIS now and al-Qaeda then. The only real difference is that ISIS is arguably stronger than al-Qaeda ever was. So allowing it to remain in existence is not an option.

Second, the president acknowledged that we cannot fight the Islamic State on one side of the Syrian border while leaving it untouched on the other side. More important, he rejected the idea that in fighting ISIS in Syria, we should ally ourselves with the Assad regime.

Across the border, in Syria, we have ramped up our military assistance to the Syrian opposition. Tonight, I again call on Congress to give us additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters. In the fight against ISIL, we cannot rely on an Assad regime that terrorizes its people; a regime that will never regain the legitimacy it has lost. Instead, we must strengthen the opposition as the best counterweight to extremists like ISIL, while pursuing the political solution necessary to solve Syria’s crisis once and for all.

The decision to support the Syrian opposition as a counterweight to jihadists—and the question of whether such a non-jihadist opposition even exists—will be the most controversial part of this strategy. But the logic behind it is inexorable.

To those who object that we can’t support the Syrian opposition because we might be throwing our weight behind Islamists, the same objection holds with even greater force when it comes to the Assad regime. Bashar al-Assad can only be considered “secular” if you ignore that his main geopolitical sponsor is the radical Shiite theocracy in Iran, or that he relies on the jihadist terror army of Hezbollah for his shock troops. These are our strategic enemies in the region, and an alliance with them would be self-defeating.

As Sherlock Holmes said, when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Doing nothing about ISIS is impossible, and so is volunteering to serve as an air force for Iran and Hezbollah. What remains, then, is to support a non-jihadist opposition that will fight against the Islamic State without propping up the Assad regime.

But we have to recognize how improbable this is, or rather, how difficult it will be to pull it off, and we have to consider all of the concrete steps that will be required.

Unfortunately, this is an administration that tends to prefer self-congratulatory fantasy to reality.

You can see that in Obama’s speech, which is self-congratulatory in a petty, peevish way. So he declares: “Over the last several years, we have consistently taken the fight to terrorists who threaten our country.” Over the last several years—as if no one was doing anything before he came into office? Or: “This is a core principle of my presidency: if you threaten America, you will find no safe haven.” A core principle of his presidency—as if he invented the idea of fighting terrorism? President Obama could have said that America has taken the fight to terrorists over the past 13 years, or that offering no safe haven to terrorists is a core principle of American foreign policy. But he cannot bring himself to share any credit for anything, and particularly any credit, even implicitly, with George W. Bush.

This preening, neurotic need for self-congratulation leads Obama to present a ridiculous fantasy assessment of the runaway success of his own foreign policy.

Abroad, American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world. It is America that has the capacity and the will to mobilize the world against terrorists. It is America that has rallied the world against Russian aggression, and in support of the Ukrainian peoples’ right to determine their own destiny. It is America—our scientists, our doctors, our know-how—that can help contain and cure the outbreak of Ebola. It is America that helped remove and destroy Syria’s declared chemical weapons so they cannot pose a threat to the Syrian people—or the world—again. And it is America that is helping Muslim communities around the world not just in the fight against terrorism, but in the fight for opportunity, tolerance, and a more hopeful future.

Does he really think that Putin isn’t winning in Ukraine? Did he really just promise to cure Ebola? Does he actually think Assad isn’t using chemical weapons any more? Is he really going to boast about bringing “opportunity, tolerance, and a more hopeful future” to Muslim communities as Libya collapses into civil war?

Maybe he really believes these things—and that’s the problem. Here’s how Tim Arango, Baghdad bureau chief for the New York Times—the New York Times, mind you—recently described the administration’s approach.

It’s not my job to rate the Obama administration’s actions in Iraq. But I will tell you that after 2011, the administration basically ignored the country. And when officials spoke about what was happening there they were often ignorant of the reality. They did not want to see what was really happening because it conflicted with their narrative that they left Iraq in reasonably good shape. In 2012, as violence was escalating, I wrote a story, citing UN statistics, that showed how civilian deaths from attacks were rising. Tony Blinken, who was then Biden’s national security guy and a top Iraq official, pushed back, even wrote a letter to the editor, saying that violence was near historic lows. That was not true. Even after Fallujah fell to ISIS at the end of last year, the administration would push back on stories about Maliki’s sectarian tendencies, saying they didn’t see it that way. So there was a concerted effort by the administration to not acknowledge the obvious until it became so apparent—with the fall of Mosul—that Iraq was collapsing.

So the risk of a strategy that uses air power only and relies on local forces to do the fighting on the ground, which is what Obama is proposing, is that he will stick to that strategy—in order to prove that he’s not George W. Bush—even if there is abundant evidence that it is failing. Similarly, the risk of a strategy that revolves around supporting a moderate Syrian opposition is that the administration will simply deem that whatever opposition groups it finds are “moderate,” whether they really are or not.

I have advocated supporting non-Islamist rebels in Syria since the beginning of the uprising. And it was a great idea—three years ago, when the rebellion was largely peaceful, liberal, and non-sectarian. But as many of us warned, the longer the conflict dragged on, the more it became a magnet for foreign jihadists. It was utterly predictable, and widely predicted, that if the US did not strongly support a non-Islamist opposition, then others in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, would send money and weapons to the jihadists, making them the best equipped, best organized factions in the opposition.

Almost exactly a year ago, President Obama himself guaranteed that outcome. Organizations like the Free Syrian Army had made a point of trying to remain moderate and even fought against jihadist rivals in the hope that if they did so, the Obama administration would eventually come to their rescue. We didn’t (despite repeatedly making noises about arming the rebels), and instead Obama cut a deal with the Assad regime, delivering a crushing blow to the very “moderates” Obama now says he’s going to support.

My point is not that the administration’s new strategy is inherently impossible or that we shouldn’t try it. We have to avoid the trap (or pose) of being so hawkish that you become a dove. There is a temptation to say: “I’d really like to fight this enemy, so long as we do it in the perfect, totally decisive way I imagine—but if not, then we’re better off staying home.” In this approach, if there is no unequivocally moderate Syrian opposition already in existence, ready, waiting, and militarily strong, then we should do nothing. But this was basically the Obama administration’s policy from the beginning of the Syrian revolt, and look where it has gotten us.

My point is that we have to recognize how difficult this strategy is. A moderate opposition to Assad cannot be assumed to exist ready-made, pure, and effective. If it does not exist, it will be necessary for us to create it. But this requires a degree of concrete involvement—and an honesty about confronting past errors and measuring our ongoing success—that I don’t think we can expect from this president or this administration.

Since the alternatives are worse, we have to support this effort and hope that rough experience and undeniable failure will eventually move the administration to adopt a more realistic strategy. Which, come to think of it, is how we got this new strategy in the first place.

Love In The Time Of Terrorism,"Even with “Jihadi John” unmasked, there would still be plenty more where he came from. His anonymity has actually revealed three basics we shouldn’t forget: 1) He is male; 2) He has a penchant for violence and a fetish for publicly beheading people; and 3) He does not project an individual personality as much as he does the persona of a terrorist. The last point is key: finding a role that seems to earn other men’s awe is what aimless and aggressive young men often do.

It’s also a good guess that Jihadi John and his terrorist ilk live in a feral mindset. The idea of living a normal domesticated life—that is, working an honest job, and having primary loyalty to a home with loving wife and kids—seems not to be uppermost in JJ’s bloodthirsty mind. What are the chances such thoughts could be buried deep within a terrorist? Is it possible such a terrorist can be tamed? Let’s take this a step farther and dare to ask: What if these most violent men could actually learn to love home and hearth and desire never to stray again? I think it worth engaging in this thought experiment. The implications for understanding human motives, relationships, and behavior are vast.

And guess what? According to a 2001 essay by terrorism expert Bruce Hoffman, such a taming actually happened to members of the terrorist group Black September, a group that suddenly subsided from the public eye in the 1970s almost as quickly as it appeared.

So how on earth could this have happened? Perhaps first we should ask: Why would this have happened?

Do You Remember Black September?

Black September was the scourge of Munich during the 1972 Olympics. Even if you weren’t around then, you’ve probably seen the iconic photograph of the hooded terrorist on that Munich balcony. The group kidnapped and then killed 11 Israeli athletes and a German policeman. The world held its breath as the intense standoff and a botched rescue attempt were televised.

Thirteen years ago, Hoffman’s intriguing article for the Atlantic Monthly was entitled “All You Need Is Love.” In it, Hoffman described his conversation with a general in one of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s intelligence services. The general explained how the PLO deliberately dismantled Black September, the most dreaded terrorist organization in the world at the time.

Deliberately dismantled it? Well, yes. Black September was becoming more of a liability than an asset to the PLO during the 1970’s. Yasser Arafat, then chairman of the PLO and head of its al-Fatah faction, formed Black September as a covert—and therefore deniable—special PLO operation. The initial purpose of Black September was to exact revenge on Jordan for expelling Palestinians in September 1970, and to get headline coverage while doing so. Hoffman explained:

Black September’s first operation was the assassination, in November of 1971, of Jordan’s Prime Minister Wasfi al-Tal, who was gunned down as he entered the lobby of the Sheraton Hotel in Cairo. While Tal lay dying, one of the assassins knelt and lapped with his tongue the blood flowing across the marble floor. That grisly scene, reported in The Times of London and other major newspapers, created an image of uncompromising violence and determination that was exactly what Arafat both wanted and needed.

The Munich Massacre of the Israeli athletes followed. And with it, the Palestinian cause rocketed high onto the world agenda. Black September continued with hijackings and bombings, but by fall 1974 Arafat was invited to address the United Nations General Assembly and the PLO had gained observer status there. So Black September had served its purpose and was seen as more of a liabililty than an asset. Arafat then ordered his chief of intelligence, Salah Khalaf, to “turn off” Black September.

‘A Reason to Live Rather than To Die’

Hoffman’s host had mulled over the options with Khalaf, whom he served as a deputy. How do you simply “turn off” a group of hardened terrorists (without killing them all)? Hoffman explained: “Finally they hit upon an idea. Why not simply marry them off? In other words, why not find a way to give these men—the most dedicated, competent, and implacable fighters in the entire PLO—a reason to live rather than to die?”

‘There, in a sort of PLO version of a college mixer, boy met girl, boy fell in love with girl, boy would, it was hoped, marry girl.’

They put a plan in motion, which began by scouring large Palestinian communities for the most attractive young Palestinian women they could find. They asked the women if they would come to Beirut “for a reason to be disclosed upon your arrival, but one decreed by no higher authority than Chairman Arafat himself.” About a hundred of these stunning young women were brought to Beiruit and, according to Hoffman: “There, in a sort of PLO version of a college mixer, boy met girl, boy fell in love with girl, boy would, it was hoped, marry girl.”

But wait! There’s more: “The hundred or so Black Septembrists were told that if they married these women, they would be paid $3,000; given an apartment in Beirut with a gas stove, a refrigerator, and a television; and employed by the PLO in some nonviolent capacity. Any of these couples that had a baby within a year would be rewarded with an additional $5,000.”

Did it work?

…as the general recounted, without exception the Black Septembrists fell in love, got married, settled down, and in most cases started a family.

But would they later be tempted to stray back to their terrorist ways? The PLO intelligence operatives factored in that possibility. They tested the men by periodically giving them passports to go to Western Europe on legitimate non-violent PLO business. And: “the general explained, not one of them would agree to travel abroad, for fear of being arrested and losing all that they had—that is, being deprived of their wives and children. ‘And so,’ my host told me, ‘that is how we shut down Black September.”

If you’re interested, you can read the article “The Deradicalization of Terrorists” in Salus Journal (2013) for an overview of recent studies on that topic. But I would guess Black September is likely the most successful and effective case because the terrorists had the blessing of superiors who worked in concert to change their environment and then offer them all they needed to live an alternative life that promised love, family, home, stability, and prosperity.

What Might This Tell Us about Men and Society?

This story tells us a lot about hierarchies, the power of personal relationships, human motives, and our utter need for a reason to live rather than a reason to die. In fact, this story actually smashes the feminist stereotype of “patriarchy.” Deprivation of sexual outlet, family, and work spells disaster for single men, and not because he lives in a particular type of culture or society, but because he is human, and because he is male. When the stability of close familial relationships and a sense of purpose are withheld from a man, he does not socialize well or at all. He tends to resort to a male herd, which too often means finding his place in a hierarchy. He also finds in this an outlet for his aggression, which is generated by aimlessness and pent-up frustration. It’s a violent brew, east or west. I dare say, we’ve seen some of such unrest recently in both the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and in Ferguson, Missouri, USA.

When the stability of close familial relationships and a sense of purpose are withheld from a man, he does not socialize well or at all.

The factors that went into changing the outlook of Black September members were both simple and complex. Simple because, at root, contentment comes from the sense of stability and belonging one gets from happy familial relationships. And simple also because a single man deprived of remunerative labor and a sexual outlet is more prone to violence than a married man with a home, wife, children, and stable work. The complexities in such situations have to do with how invested the man was with the violent gang or terrorist group he is a part of—the depth of his bonds and connections with the group, his devotion to the ideology if there is one, his lack of alternatives, the stability of the environment should he leave, and whether there are outside influences that can wean him away.

Clearly, if you are a young, single man who is part of a violent cult and all of a sudden the leaders of your cult “de-programs” you and offers you a life that promises love, family, and good employment, chances are you would grab the opportunity, especially as you sense all of your brethren doing the same. It seems a no-brainer.

Gender Theory and ‘Jihadi John’

This story flies in the face of the gender theory that’s been peddled for the past couple of generations and now is everywhere in our schools, colleges, the media, and Hollywood. According to its advocates, human beings play “gender roles” that are entirely a construct of society, and have nothing to do with nature. Gender theorists are hellbent on abolishing the natural family. They claim marriage promotes the gender roles that encourage “patriarchy”—or a male superiority complex—which they insist undermines women’s equality. I would expect them to look at the story of Black September and completely miss the point, instead complaining that the women were “rounded up” perhaps like “chattel to be married off.”

The feminist agenda, by tearing down the natural family, has spawned the violent behavior of guys like Jihadi John.

But I suggest we all take a good look at the masked “Jihadi John” for a real glimpse of what modern feminism and gender theory have to offer us at the end of the road. The feminist agenda, by tearing down the natural family, has spawned rather than spurned the violent behavior of guys like Jihadi John. Unfortunately, such feminists of today don’t take a long view. They seem nearsightedly focused on cases of domestic violence in the West. This not only gives them an unhealthy preoccupation with what goes on in other people’s bedrooms, but also blinds them to finding real solutions to the entire problem of male violence.

Of course one would have to try to understand men—rather than simply revile them—to accomplish that. Most interesting is how modern feminists are loath to express much outrage for the imposition of Sharia law in the West. How frequently do we hear the politically correct voices of “women’s equality” speak out against honor killings or genital mutilations of young girls, even when they take place within Western borders? Not much. They seem to have fallen in line—as we can see in the case of Rotherham—with British officials and media who turned a blind eye over the past 15 years to the brutal trafficking of about 1,400 girls.

Instead, our western feminists are preoccupied with dismantling the male-female bond, the father-child bond, and the mother-child bond. So their big target is marriage and families with biological connections. The goal is to get the state to serve as surrogate parents to us all. We can see this in a recent article by feminists who argue basically that workingclass single mothers shouldn’t even consider marriage which I discussed here. We can see it in the push for same-sex marriage, which in the end is little more than a bait-and-switch strategy to abolish family autonomy along with state-recognized marriage. We can also see this in the promotion of abortion that is no longer “rare” by severing the mother-child bond that women supposedly should feel good about.

The mascot of our bureaucratic feminists turns out to be “Julia,” their cardboard-cutout Stepford wife to the state as someone for us all to emulate. If we keep traveling this road—of policies that separate men from women and all of us from one another—where might we end up?

Why, at Jihadi John’s doorstep, of course. Where else?

Men and Marriage

We’d do well to reflect on the story of the tamed Black September terrorists when we consider the chaos of crime and violence around us. It applies to all situations in which men feel marginalized, humiliated, neglected, discarded, directionless, and misunderstood. Indeed, it seems men need women to love more than women appear to need men.

‘The denial of male nature in modern life warps and perverts the natural play of male aggression, leading to violence and pornography, to fear and exploitation of women.’

When this need is not met, they tend not to express frustration in words, but in destructive action. It might begin with gross inaction, but at a certain point the behavior in young, detached men can devolve into riots, looting, pillaging, killing, gangs, drug cartels, and the like. Leftists and feminists who are hellbent on abolishing the traditional family are of course loath to attribute such behaviors to fatherlessness and broken homes. They prefer to use the catch-all term “poverty,” and to deny there is a male nature or even a human nature.

Economist George Gilder delved into this irony in his fascinating book, “Men and Marriage” (1986): “the denial of male nature in modern life warps and perverts the natural play of male aggression, leading to violence and pornography, to fear and exploitation of women. . . The result is a society that at once denies the existence of natural male aggressiveness and is utterly preoccupied with it.”

Gilder examined a deep truth about men, something those PLO officials recognized when they went about “turning off” the savagery of the ruthless Black September terrorists: Without a sense of connection with family, young men are restless and prone to violence. But with it, they can feel settled. They can then channel their ambitions to constructive ends. Men and boys, particularly, need some kind of civilizing force that allows them to build rather than to destroy. That force is a relationship, especially one of love that truly integrates them into the human family. It’s a force that invites them to build a nest that nurtures the next generation, which they can see—for real—in the faces of their own children.

Gilder, in “Men and Marriage,” also noted: “Biology, anthropology, and history all tell the same essential story. Every society, each generation, faces an invasion by barbarians. They storm into the streets and schools, businesses and households of the land, and unless they are brought to heel, they rape and pillage, debauch and despoil the settlements of society. . . . Every society must figure out ways to bring them into the disciplines and duties of citizenship.”

when a man is given the opportunity for an intimate relationship that creates companionship and the promise of his own children, something astonishing can happen to him.

One of Gilder’s points most worth pondering in the West is this: “The only undeniable winners in the sexual revolution are powerful men.” A society that rejects traditional marriages and families cultivates the ground for destructive patterns of male hierarchies. These detached alpha males—enabled today by feminist women—don’t simply lord themselves over women but they especially lord themselves over other men. As dominated men’s frustrations grow, so does the threat of violence. In the West, women who play along with the sexual revolution, pretend to be oh-so-content with the hook-up culture while accommodating aimless male patterns of behavior, which approach their apex in cultures that promote polygamy and women-as-chattel. So we come full circle.

The men who run ISIS seem to practice a particularly harsh form of hierarchical dominance towards other men, as is the case in most intensely tribal cultures. With Sharia law there is an obvious attempt by the powerful men to lord over other men. We can see how the elites among them prevent and control access to relationships with women. We ought to ask: Whose purpose does veiling women really serve? Answer: Powerful men exerting their dominance over less powerful men, that’s who. And as if the veiling of women is not enough, ISIS has also made sure that in cattle markets the hindquarters of sheep and goats are covered up so men will not be able to view the animals’ genitalia and be reminded of things sexual. No doubt, those coverings—and the degrading message it presumes on sidelined single men—can only accentuate their frustrations.

The unvarnished truth is that when a man is given a purpose, and given the opportunity for an intimate relationship that creates companionship and the promise of his own children, something astonishing can happen to him. Suddenly the garbage of empty violence doesn’t smell so good to him anymore. When he has a sense of order and meaningful work to go along with a family, he has a place in the world and everything clicks—for everyone.

The Forever-War President: Obama’s ‘Transformational’ War Powers Legacy,"In May 2013, some 11 years into the War on Terror, President Obama took a break from reviewing target sets and kill lists to deliver a much-anticipated “drone speech” at the National Defense University in Washington DC. “We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us,” Obama admonished; “we have to be mindful of James Madison’s warning that ‘No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.’”

It was a disorienting performance: at times, Obama seemed to be speaking not as the president, but as his own loyal opposition—a thoughtful critic who might conduct himself differently if installed as head of Dronefleet Command. “Unless we discipline our thinking, our definitions, our actions,” Obama intoned, “we may be drawn into more wars we don’t need to fight, or continue to grant presidents unbound powers.” He welcomed this debate… with himself.

With Tomahawks raining down on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border, it would be nice to have Congress debate the president’s newly declared war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), but it doesn’t look like that will happen anytime soon.

Still, it’s not too early to take stock of the Obama legacy on constitutional war powers. He’ll go down in history as a “transformational” president, having completed America’s transformation into a country where “continual warfare” is the post-constitutional norm.

War: The New Normal

Obama’s hardly the first president to wage war without congressional authorization. Although the Constitution invests Congress alone “with the power of changing our condition from peace to war,” every post-World War II president has found some excuse for striking out on his own. Many of these engagements were of the “frolic and detour” variety: rescue missions,retaliatory fly-bys against rogue regimes, short incursions to depose a dictator or reverse a coup. Longer commitments—like the peacekeeping deployments to Lebanon and Somalia, Bill Clinton’s 78-day air war in Yugoslavia, even the decade-plus of no-fly-zone enforcement in Iraq following the Gulf War—were nonetheless territorially confined.

Presidential wars are no longer limited departures from the peacetime norm.

In the twenty-first century, however, we’ve gone permanently “kinetic.” Presidential wars are no longer limited departures from the peacetime norm. As a “war president,” Barack Obama has institutionalized—and accelerated—a trend that began in the Bush administration: war without temporal or spatial boundaries. The “operational tempo” can range from steady to frantic, but the beat goes on, unceasingly. Indeed, as the Wall Street Journal reports, we’rerunning out of cool names for the operations we launch. The bombing’s gotten ahead of the branding: for the time being, President Obama’s latest simply goes by “Operations in Iraq and Syria.”

In his six years, Obama has bombed more countries than George W. Bush managed in eight, Politifact recently affirmed—although they had some trouble settling on a precise number. They credited “44” with repeated strikes on Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Libya, and Syria, and noted that, while “we could not confirm the authenticity of these reports,” Obama “may have bombed the Philippines” in 2012.

The War on Terror has become increasingly unmoored from its original legal basis: the Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution, or AUMF, that Congress passed three days after September 11, 2011. The AUMF authorized the president to use “all necessary and appropriate force” against the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks and those who “aided” or “harbored” them. Thirteen years on, the administration continues to rely on an expansive interpretation of that language to target so-called “associated forces” of Al Qaeda—including groups that didn’t exist on 9/11 and whose connections with “core” Al Qaeda are ever more tenuous.

“A declaration of armed conflict against a long and/or open-ended list of emerging terrorist groups undermines the important distinction between war and peace,” law professors Jennifer Daskal and Stephen Vladeck warned in the Harvard National Security Journal earlier this year: “such an approach would change the default from peace to war.” At this point, it seems appropriate to drop the conditional—we’re already there.

Old Declarations of War Never Die

Since early August, the president has launched more than 200 airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq; two weeks ago, he began hurling Tomahawk missiles into Syria, some of them aimed at the heretofore unknown “Khorasan Group,” which, we’re told, threatens to bring down U.S. passenger planes by setting off “explosive clothes.”

Who needs John Yoo when you can get what you want by torturing decade-old authorizations for wars past?

After a few false starts, the administration seems to have settled on the 2001 AUMF as its main source of legal cover for the war against ISIS. One problem with that rationale is that “core” Al Qaeda has publicly denounced—and excommunicated—ISIS. A recent statement from an unidentified “senior administration official” offers the administration’s legal workaround. Because of the group’s “longstanding relationship” with Al Qaeda, and its “position – supported by some individual members and factions of AQ-aligned groups – that it is the true inheritor of Usama bin Laden’s legacy,” ISIS fits within the AUMF, despite the “public split between AQ’s senior leadership and [ISIS].” That is, some time ago, they used to be friends, and many in the jihadi “community” think ISIS is hot stuff.

Does that make ISIS an “associated force” of a group that refuses to associate with them? Or is the administration’s legal theory that the torch has been passed to a new generation, and ISIS is “the proper successor to al-Qaeda” under the AUMF? Either way—as far as the administration sees it—they’re covered. A neat trick, that. Who needs John Yoo when you can get what you want by torturing decade-old authorizations for wars past? In the Obama theory of constitutional war powers, Congress gets a vote, but it’s one Congress, one vote, one time.

Well, maybe two times. The same “senior administration official” also insists that the “Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002” still has enough life left in it for another war in Iraq, if not strictly “against” it. “Even so,” he writes, “our position on the 2002 A.U.M.F. hasn’t changed and we’d like to see it repealed.” Got all that straight?

War on a Need to Know Basis

The administration has relied on the 2001 AUMF to justify an archipelago of secret drone bases in the Middle East and Africa, and a war that will continue “at least 10 to 20 years” more. The way the Obama team interprets that resolution may help explain why Politifact was unable to determine whether Obama or his predecessor had bombed the Philippines. In the administration’s view, information on where and with whom we’re at war can properly be withheld from the American people.

If publicly identifying an ‘associated force’ invests it with jihadi ‘street cred,’ then bombing the group must really boost its claim to be Al Qaeda’s heir apparent.

In a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing one year after the president’s drone speech, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) led the Pentagon’s general counsel, Stephen Preston, through a list of jihadist groups, asking him which ones the administration believed it had the power “to go after under the 9/11 AUMF.” Al Nusra? AQIM? ISIS?

Each time, Preston refused to answer: “Sir, again, the groups that we’ve not identified as groups we are currently operating against, the intelligence and applications of the standards under the AUMF is not something that we are prepared to discuss in an open session.” Letting Americans know who we’re at war with could cause “serious damage to national security,” you see. That’s what a Pentagon spokesman told a ProPublica reporter: “Because elements that might be considered ‘associated forces’ can build credibility by being listed as such by the United States, we have classified the list.”

It’s grimly amusing to puzzle out how this “building credibility” theory might intersect with the administration’s argument that being viewed as “the true inheritor” of the bin Laden’s legacy puts a group on the AUMF hit list. If publicly identifying an “associated force” invests it with jihadi “street cred,” then bombing the group must really boost its claim to be AQ’s heir apparent. If any particular clique’s not quite there yet, perhaps Team Obama can summon legal authority into existence through the very act of hurling Hellfire missiles at them.

Target, Rinse, Repeat

At the very least, an open-ended war on emerging jihadist groups may conjure up its own political justification. “Collateral damage” from American ordinance can build their credibility and swell their ranks. And targeting groups that haven’t yet targeted the U.S. home front surely raises the risk that they’ll return the favor.

Targeting groups that haven’t yet targeted the U.S. home front surely raises the risk that they’ll return the favor.

There’s been no sign of “active plotting against the homeland,” from ISIS, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said in August; “no credible information that [ISIS] is planning to attack the United States,” the director of the National Counterterrorism Center affirmed last month. A few hundred U.S. airstrikes later, it could be that their incentive structure has changed.

If “blowback” from our ever-expanding War on Terror takes the form of domestic terror attacks, that in itself will be taken as proof of the need for a more aggressive response abroad and new restrictions on liberties at home. “The global war on terror has acquired a life of its own,” says intelligence analyst Patrick Lang: “It’s a self-licking ice cream cone.”

“We cannot use force everywhere that a radical ideology takes root,” Obama said in his National Defense University speech, because “a perpetual war—through drones or Special Forces or troop deployments—will prove self-defeating, and alter our country in troubling ways.”

It might, at that. Still, we fight on. The droning will continue until morale improves.

20 Ways Media Completely Misread Congress’ Weak-Sauce Benghazi Report,"On September 11, 2012, Islamist militants attacked U.S. complexes in Benghazi, Libya. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed, the first U.S. Ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979. Three other men were killed and 10 were injured.

The media immediately turned it into a political story, focusing more anger on Mitt Romney’s comments about the administration’s blaming of a YouTube video critical of Islam than determining the facts of the attack itself. Many in the media thought it fine that President Obama jetted off to a high-dollar fundraiser before the bodies cooled. When various high-level government officials blamed either a YouTube video critical of Islam — or our laws protecting free speech, it didn’t generate much controversy among big media.

The media tended to parrot White House talking points about the attack even years later. So even though everyone with knowledge of the scene in Benghazi knew otherwise, the New York Times was claiming until Friday — just this past Friday — that al Qaeda had nothing to do with the attack on Benghazi.

Really. Less than one year ago, the New York Times ran one of its massive “projects” — Pulitzer Prize attempts, basically — around the following claim:

Months of investigation by The New York Times, centered on extensive interviews with Libyans in Benghazi who had direct knowledge of the attack there and its context, turned up no evidence that Al Qaeda or other international terrorist groups had any role in the assault. The attack was led, instead, by fighters who had benefited directly from NATO’s extensive air power and logistics support during the uprising against Colonel Qaddafi. And contrary to claims by some members of Congress, it was fueled in large part by anger at an American-made video denigrating Islam.

If there’s something true in that pile of horse manure, you’ll have to point it out. Within days this was thoroughly debunked by those in the know (albeit highlighted by media outlets such as CNN). But just this past Friday afternoon, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released “the definitive House statement on the Intelligence Community’s activities before, during and after the tragic events that caused the deaths of four brave Americans” in Benghazi. We’ll look through all the flaws with this report (.pdf) here soon, but first we need to talk about the media reaction to same.

How Fox News Dismissed Today’s Benghazi Report in Less Than 30 Seconds (VIDEO) http://t.co/Hh4z5BVXry (By @themattwilstein)



Mediaite (@Mediaite) November 22, 2014

We’re going on six years of many major media outlets completely failing to inform their viewers and readers about numerous Obama administration scandals, but this is what the “media reporters” choose to focus on? Really? In just this past week alone, for instance, we had updates to the IRS scandal relating to targeting of conservative groups (some 30,000 irretrievably lost emails were found), updates to the many scandals surrounding Obamacare’s drafting (note which outlets are carrying substantive updates about Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber) and implementation (thank God for Peter Suderman or we might not have learned about the latest Obamacare surprise coming out in the latest Friday night document dump), news a huge Obama bundler and major gay rights activist being arrested for child rape, reports of emails revealing Department of Justice attempts to silence one of the rare tenacious reporters covering the administration, a teensie weensie little Constitutional problemo about President Obama usurping the legislative process, signing a secret order to extend the war in Afghanistan, and probably a half dozen other things I’m missing.

If there’s a story about media downplaying Obama administration scandal news, and boy is there, this Fox News not giving enough coverage to a weak-sauce Benghazi report sure as hell ain’t it. Let’s look at what else the media missed.

1. Many journalists obviously didn’t read the report.

Much less read it critically.

One might assume this both because of the speed with which they joined the groupthink and their complete and uncritical acceptance of what they heard the report said. I grant that they may have read the 2-page executive summary.

2. They forgot the well-known problems with Congressional oversight

The relationship between intelligence agencies and the members of Congress who are supposed to oversee them could not be more damaged. I’m not even talking about stuff like how the CIA admitted to spying on members of the Senate committee that is supposed to oversee the agency.

It’s actually the good relationships that are even worse. (And I’m not even talking about how sometimes members are married to people who work in the private sector on related topics.) One of the most common criticisms levied against the intelligence oversight committees is that they’re far too approving and accepting of what the intelligence community wants. I’ve covered the federal government for more than 10 years, so I’m familiar with bureaucratic jargon. Still, I was stunned by the level of obfuscating jargon I found in the report, and what a reasonable person might assume that meant:

@MZHemingway the idea that a Republican investigation into darkest CIA ops would yield shining, shocking truths is…implausible



JAMES ❄ POULOS (@jamespoulos) November 22, 2014

Exactly. This is, like, reporting 101. How did so many big-shot reporters miss just that initial skepticism we should all share when reporting on — especially — politicians?

3. “Mistakes were made.”

On May 1, 1973, Nixon’s Press Secretary Ron Ziegler famously said, “I would apologize to the Post, and I would apologize to Mr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein… We would all have to say that mistakes were made in terms of comments.” Ziegler wasn’t the first to use the line “mistakes were made” but he made it so famous that it was included in obituaries when he died. The phrase is a cliched way to avoid responsibility for wrong-doing and to try to diminish the seriousness of allegations.

Guess what page “mistakes were made” appears in the explosive Benghazi report that supposedly exonerates everybody in the intelligence community that was within 3,000 miles of the deadly attack? Did you guess page one of the executive summary? Congratulations. You win.

4. Actual vs. caricatured complaints about Obama’s handling of Benghazi

Now, if you were to ask people who aren’t reflexively defensive of President Obama (as the media tend to be) what their main concerns with Benghazi were two years ago, they’d probably say something along the lines of:

That we allowed an ambassador to be assassinated by Islamist militants in Libya.

That we didn’t quite seem as concerned as we should have been, as evidenced by our commander-in-chief heading off to a Vegas fundraiser hours after it happened and a general patience about seeking justice.

That we claimed that an attack on September 11 probably actually had something to do with a silly video and nothing to do with Al Qaeda.

probably actually had something to do with a silly video and nothing to do with Al Qaeda. The we officially told the world that “since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others,” as President Obama said.

That our Secretary of State said of a video made by an American that “We absolutely reject its content and message.”



That these statements were dangerously untrue. In America, you’re actually totally allowed to disparage any religion you want. (I myself have fun targeting Methodists.) (Sidenote, check out how our Secretary of State gave a rhetorical beatdown to the Nazis when they complained about a mock trial of Hitler held in Madison Square Gardens in 1934.)

That our media seemed more obsessed with covering for Obama than investigating what the heck happened that night.

Now, the report whitewashes, excuses or glosses over almost all of this and fails completely to get at any of the deeper and troubling questions about what’s wrong with our intel community. It only “debunks” claims if you think that bureaucratic ass-covering and rather strained justifications of what I would hope all Americans would agree was a clear intelligence failure count as “debunking.”

5. Let’s talk about the Feb. 17th Brigade

Here’s a case in point.

The report says that at “appropriately” (I assume they meant “approximately”) 9:40 PM, dozens of militants approached the compound and that “as the men approached, three Libyan security officers in a car outside the [Temporary Mission Facility] drove away without warning U.S. personnel.” Further:

“The State Department had contracted with the February 17th Brigade and the Blue Mountain Group to provide local security for the TMF facility. All available information indicates that the February 17th Brigade guards were inside the walls of the compound and did not detect or report information about the attackers before the attackers breached the gate.”

Now, the report doesn’t mention the Feb. 17th Brigade too much again (we hear the telling — for what it suggests isn’t mentioned — reference to some “helpful” members of the group a few pages later). And maybe it’s telling because the Feb. 17th Brigade — our security contractors — are now allied with Ansar al Sharia — the perpetrators of the attack — and the two groups have taken over large parts of Benghazi. Now, I know that you have to contract with bad guys when you’re doing shady but important work. But don’t you think that maybe a definitive report about how absolutely nothing went wrong in Benghazi that could have been prevented should include that we contracted out our compound security to al Qaeda affiliates there? I mean, maybe the group used to be totes awesome and only went bad after we left. Or, given how things went down, maybe they totally sold us out. But to not even discuss this issue strikes me as odd in the extreme.

Or what about this guy:

Wissam Bin Hamid’s name has surfaced time and again in the investigation into the Benghazi attack. He admittedly met with American officials in Benghazi just days before the assault to discuss security, and he reportedly refused to provide assistance once the attack was underway. The post-revolution Libyan government also worked with Bin Hamid and his Libya Shield militia, which was supposedly one of the strongest “security” forces inside Benghazi.

You will never ever ever guess where this guy is now. OK, if you guessed that a few weeks ago Ansar al Sharia released a 42-minute video featuring him, you win. However, you won’t find any mention of him in this report.

Another weird paragraph says that a Tripoli security team arranged with someone for some particular equipment to be there when they landed in Benghazi. But when they got there, the equipment was nowhere to be found and their interlocutor’s cell phone was turned off. Interesting.

Should these angles have been discussed in the “definitive” report on how everything is awesome? I kind of think so, don’t you?

6. Remember that New York Times report that was only updated on Friday?

I just want to point out that the first line of the report that supposedly makes Republicans look bad places blame for the attack on “armed militias with ties to terrorist organizations, including al-Qa’ida.” And while, yes, the Times did finally get around to updating their report to note that these militias have ties to al Qa’ida, they hedged as much as you could imagine and buried it on page 8. Why are we making fun of FOX, again?

7. Our response was slow.

Now, you can read the report as a big intel agency CYA or you can read it as just a really charitable defense of the decision making that night. But no matter how you read it, it’s striking how slow we were in responding to this crisis.

You know that line about how when seconds count, the police are minutes away? Well, here we had a situation where seconds counted but the nearest security team was 42 minutes away, because of various delays. And the Tripoli team didn’t even start for the air field in Tripoli until after that. And both cited traffic concerns.

Once the Tripoli team finally got to Benghazi, the equipment they arranged for wasn’t there and the group supposed to take them to the hospital (where they believed the ambassador to be) decided they didn’t want to go. The explosive report simply says, “it was not clear why those individuals did not want to travel to the hospital.”

Oh, and the “confusion at the airport lasted for about three and a half hours.” Oh. OK. And then the reason why they were able to leave was because the Libyan Shield brought vehicles to them. But the committee “uncovered no evidence” that the militia tipped off the attackers to the Tripoli Team’s presence. The attack of lethal and deadly accurate mortar fire just happened to take place 11 minutes after they finally arrived at their destination. After some difficulties, they were able to convince Libyan Shield drivers to help them evacuate.

8. Intelligence failures explained away.

A good example of how the report treads softly happens in Section 2, where we’re told that while intelligence agencies knew the threats in Libya were rising, they didn’t have any knowledge of a specific attack.

“There is no evidence of an intelligence failure,” the report says. But by that it simply means that nobody had given the CIA blueprints for an attack. I mean, we do know that Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri “had called for Americans to be targeted in Libya the day before the diplomatic mission was attacked, leading to speculation that al Qaeda’s leadership in Pakistan had some sort of role or influence in the attack.” This would seem to indicate that maybe our confidence al Qaeda had nothing to do with the attack was as misguided as our belief that there was no intel failure in predicting an attack on Americans there.

“One of the first questions [the committee] pursued is whether the U.S. government had or should have had intelligence that could have prevented or disrupted the attacks, and thus whether there was an intelligence failure.” This is idiotic. I mean, you might explain why we had an intel failure but there’s no question that we failed. By definition we failed. We have a dead ambassador, three other dead Americans and 10 severely wounded. All because of a surprise attack we were unprepared for. That’s a failure of the intelligence community.

But instead the report says the Committee “found no evidence of an intelligence failure, and an internal CIA analytic review provided to the Committee on January 4, 2013, corroborates the Committee’s findings.”

Wait, the CIA said the CIA didn’t fail? That’s not surprising at all. I mean, this may be what passes for intelligence committee oversight, but I think most Americans want to know why we weren’t more on top of the Al Qaeda leader’s warning or why we didn’t connect that to one of Al Qaeda’s favorite targets (diplomatic compounds) or why we forgot the significance of September 11. Or just why we weren’t better informed of who was friend and who was foe, who was working with whom and why and what we could do to prevent more dead Americans.

Examples of intel failures are brushed away as uncorroborated. To wit, the CIA apparently reported that “a former Transitional National Council security official in Benghazi said he received, very shortly before the attack, information of a possible imminent attack against the TMF and tried to notify the Libyan Intelligence Service the day of the attacks. However he was unable to make contact and relay the information.” Sounds like a failure. But the committee says it wasn’t corroborated by anyone. OK?

9. Try cutting through the jargon here.

Finding #2 says that the “CIA provided sufficient security personnel, resources, and equipment to defend against the known terrorist threat and to enable CIA operations in Benghazi. There is no evidence that the CIA turned down requests for additional security resources at the Annex.”

Well, we’ve already excused failures by saying that the CIA couldn’t have known of the threat. So the first line that they had appropriate resources for “known” threats is basically meaningless. And we already knew two years ago that Ambassador Stevens requested a beefing up of security.

Now, let’s say the request was never officially turned down but just never fulfilled, which is, in fact, extremely plausible. The end result is a lack of requested security but you could report that “There is no evidence that the CIA turned down requests for additional security.” See how bureaucratic jargon works? It’s like magic. (And if you’re immediately wondering how that first line about “known threats” doesn’t work in conjunction with the knowledge that Stevens requested more security, you are smarter than a typical reporter.)

Does a finding like that really “debunk” the supposed conspiracy theory that there wasn’t enough security? I don’t see how it does. Further, Finding #2 is something of a slap in the face of Ambassador Stevens’ memos to his superiors. These aren’t mentioned in the section.

Should I mention that this section about how everything was hunky dory mentions that “perhaps all of the [Diplomatic Security] agents were unarmed and one of them was not wearing shoes”? Or should I instead Groupthink my way into poking fun at conservatives and telling them to be ashamed?

10. Scathing indictment of how little our Feds understand about al Qaeda

As recently as Friday, the State Department was being mocked for its refusal to acknowledge that Ansar al Sharia is tied to Al Qaeda.

Finding #5 is fairly explicit about how a ragtag group of Al Qaeda affiliates launched the attack.

What’s going on with the State Department’s downplaying of Al Qaeda links? Well, I think it has a lot to do with Obama campaign pledges regarding Al Qaeda. You’d have to be a Major League Gruber to claim that the global Islamist militant movement is waning. But President Obama did make a lot of claims about Al Qaeda being “on its heels” or “on the run” or “decimated” and so on. To wit:

“Now, four years ago, I made a few commitments to you. I told you I’d end the war in Iraq, and I did. I said I’d end the war in Afghanistan, and we are,” said Obama. “I said we’d refocus on the people who actually attacked us on 9/11 — and today, al Qaeda is on its heels and Osama bin Laden is no more.”

To make this campaign rhetoric stick, our executive branch has claimed that it meant “core” al Qaeda as opposed to all the groups al Qaeda oversees and works with. Because if we know anything about al Qaeda it’s not that it’s a powerful decentralized operation with a global network. Oh wait, that’s precisely what we do know.

So Finding #5 says “A mixed group, including members of al-Qa’ida in the lands of the Islamic Meghreb (AQIM), al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), the Muhammad Jamal Network (MJN), Ansar al-Sharia (AAS), and Abu Abaydah Ibn Jarah Battalion (UJB) participated in the attacks, along with Qadafi loyalists.

Of course it was a mixed group such as this! It was the White House that consistently downplayed al Qaeda’s involvement for so long. It’s not entirely clear why this finding is such a debunking of what people other than the New York Times have been saying.

11. The involvement of prisoners released from Gitmo

So that New York Times report I keep going back to includes a portion that says this:

The C.I.A. kept its closest watch on people who had known ties to terrorist networks abroad, especially those connected to Al Qaeda. Intelligence briefings for diplomats often mentioned Sufian bin Qumu, a former driver for a company run by Bin Laden. Mr. Qumu had been apprehended in Pakistan in 2001 and detained for six years at Guantánamo Bay before returning home to Derna, a coastal city near Benghazi that was known for a high concentration of Islamist extremists. But neither Mr. Qumu nor anyone else in Derna appears to have played a significant role in the attack on the American Mission, officials briefed on the investigation and the intelligence said.

Again, if you were reading conservative sites, you already knew that this wasn’t true.

But the report says he was almost certainly involved and that he was trained by al Qaeda. And that others who were involved were part of al Qaeda.

12. “They told us to wait.” “Yeah, We told them to wait.”

Remember a few months ago when FOX News had a special documentary “13 Hours at Benghazi”? This was an explosive documentary hosted by Bret Baier that featured three American security forces who were in Benghazi saying they disagreed with how long they were told to wait before trying to rescue folks at TMF.

You can watch the relevant portion here but I’ll just note that these men are speaking on the record about their experience:



Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com

If you’d rather read the relevant portion, here’s a transcript. The guys said they were ready to go within five minutes but they were held back by a top CIA officer named “Bob.”

“It had probably been 15 minutes I think, and … I just said, ‘Hey, you know, we gotta– we need to get over there, we’re losing the initiative,’” said Tiegen. “And Bob just looks straight at me and said, ‘Stand down, you need to wait.’” “We’re starting to get calls from the State Department guys saying, ‘Hey, we’re taking fire, we need you guys here, we need help,’” said Paronto. After a delay of nearly 30 minutes, the security team headed to the besieged consulate without orders. They asked their CIA superiors to call for armed air support, which never came. Now, looking back, the security team said they believed that if they had not been delayed for nearly half an hour, or if the air support had come, things might have turned out differently. “Ambassador Stevens and Sean [Smith], yeah, they would still be alive, my gut is yes,” Paronto said. Tiegen concurred. “I strongly believe if we’d left immediately, they’d still be alive today,” he added… In a statement to Fox News, a senior intelligence official did allow that the security team was delayed from responding while the CIA’s top officer in Benghazi tried to rally local support.

Here’s how this is “debunked” according to the report:

Finding #7: Prior to the CIA security team departing for the TMF, the Annex leadership deliberated thoughtfully, reasonable, and quickly about whether further security could be provided to the team. Although some security officers voiced a greater urgency to depart for the TMF, no officer was ever told to stand down.

Oh where to begin? Now, what the report does is explain the delay, not deny it. It characterizes the delay as thoughtful and reasonable. The guys who went on the record thought it overdone, but that’s a natural disagreement.

But note that while the guys said they were told to “stand down” by a top CIA officer, the “debunkers” say that no CIA officer was told to stand down. Later they say that no “stand down” order was given from CIA HQ or from the Tripoli Team.

Of course, these security guys never said that. They said they were told to stand down by an officer right there who looked them in the eye and was named Bob. Further, it’s rather obvious from the actual interview that their big point of dispute is that they were told to wait. The report confirms that is exactly what happened.

13. Explanations aren’t eviscerations

Similarly, Finding #9 explains “The Tripoli Team’s decision not to move to the hospital to retrieve Ambassador Stevens was based on the best intelligence at the time.”

And yes, this report says, that intelligence turned out to be completely inaccurate. (But remember, there were no intelligence failures, just inaccurate or insufficient intelligence that turned out to be disastrous.) But if the claim is that nobody moved to the hospital to help Stevens, explaining why no one moved isn’t the same thing as “debunking” the claim.

14.No focus on State Department or Defense Department

This isn’t a big thing but it’s worth noting that this review was of intelligence agencies. Therefore, it lacks a substantive discussion of State Department and Defense Department performance. Not that I’d expect any biting oversight of those departments, either, but since those departments also played (or didn’t play, as the case may be) roles in what happened, the lack of focus is just something to consider when declaring, as one media outlet did, the release date of this report the date when Benghazi was no longer up for discussion.

15. Did we mention that there was nothing good about the talking points?

Yeah, so, late in the report we learn that “the Administration’s initial public narrative on the causes and motivations for the attacks were not fully accurate.” You don’t say! Also that “The process and edits made to these talking points was flawed.”

And for this, the GOP should be ashamed? Really? It’s almost like a less obsequious press might think something else might be amiss.

Much of the report wishy-washily explains that there is a fog in intel gathering that makes things difficult to assess and that this kind of sort of excuses all the horse manure that was shoveled by the administration during the campaign-season terrorist attack.

Now, earlier in the report we’re told that “[Ansar al Sharia] posted a video on YouTube on September 12, 2012, claiming participation in the attacks” and we know that the head of al Qaeda called for attacks on the U.S. in Libya the day before the attack. We know that the attack took place on September 11, what even the most casual observer might note is a significant date. We’re told that the Defense Intelligence Agency said the attacks were pre-planned on September 12.

But you see, man, like a few weeks later the CIA totally thought it just happened to fall on September 11.

Let me be clear, as President Obama might say, if you’re a reporter reading this and think this sounds even remotely plausible and you think that this section is anything other than a great explanation of how idiotic the CIA can be, you are an idiot.

Everything about this section is groan-inducing. Such as that when a cable came from Tripoli to the CIA on September 14 that was the “first indication that there may not have been a protest,” according to deputy director Mike Morell, he wasn’t sure if he’d read it. Nevermind that we later learn that folks in Libya had within hours assessed that there was a lack of protests that day. I just have a hard time believing that the deputy director wouldn’t care if a Tripoli intelligence cable came around. Either way, by September 15, he’d gotten an email specifically saying there’d been no protest.

And when did Susan Rice go on television blaming a YouTube video for sparking a protest that somehow magically transformed into this super-effective double-location onslaught that took four American lives including an American Ambassador’s? That would be September 16.

That was when she said the actions in Benghazi were a “direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated.”

This report that supposedly makes Republicans look bad notes that Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes wrote on September 14 that “one of the goals of Administration public statements should be ‘To underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.'”

Exactly the opposite, Ben.

Anyway, this report then claims, more or less completely implausibly, that Rice couldn’t have really known until afterwards that her assessments were incorrect. Um, OK. But maybe when you’re, I don’t know, trying to “underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy” because you’re focusing on campaigning more than truth-telling, you end up underscoring something that isn’t true. I don’t care if we have some difficult-to-swallow bureaucratic BS explanation that avoids tough questions and instead pats Susan Rice on the head as if she couldn’t be expected to do better. Or, rather, I don’t see why we let certain administrations get away with this type of explanatory defense while nailing other people to the wall for the smallest slight.

16. Wait, what’s this about Mike Morell again?

So the same Morell who accidentally didn’t read a memo related to a horrific terror attack and forgot to tell anyone about the cables from Tripoli also was this guy:

“Finding 12: Deputy CIA Director Michael Morell made significant changes to the talking points”

Wait, what? Are you kidding me?

But, the report says, it’s OK because, um, well, you see, he didn’t know Susan Rice or anyone else in the Administration would use talking points he made. And then the report says something about excellent beachfront property for sale cheap. No, actually it says he “made a large number of edits after a September 15 White House Deputies Committee meeting.” Oh dear.

Earlier drafts of the talking points mentioned al Qaeda but by the time Morell was done with them, he didn’t even include “Islamist” in them. Because our CIA is full of people who do not commit intelligence failures but can’t figure out that an al Qaeda attack on September 11 might be related to Islamism.

By the way, the CIA’s office of public affairs also stripped language about attacks and changed it to “demonstrations” and I am sure that had nothing whatsoever to do with it being an election year or their bosses allowing a major attack on the anniversary of September 11.

17. CIA could have done things better? You don’t say.

Finding #14 says “the CIA could have placed more weight on eyewitness sources on the ground and should have challenged its initial assessments about the existence of a protest earlier.” Of course, its initial assessment was right on. Within hours, the CIA noted that the attack was premeditated and there was no protest. It was politics that changed that rather obvious conclusion. And as noted above, the guys in Tripoli specifically told the agency that they had no evidence of a protest before Susan Rice received talking points making contrary claims.

Looking through all of this talking-point changing and reversal of initial assessments, and White House efforts to make sure everyone believed it was a protest, this whole “what difference does it make?” episode from Hillary Clinton sure doesn’t look any better (though I’m sure the media will continue to give her one of their trademarked passes).

18. Wrongly forced to sign NDAs?

Another finding is that no one was improperly forced to sign non-disclosure agreements. This is in response to the claims made by some that they were encouraged to sign multiple non-disclosure agreements.

The report in fact acknowledges that some of those who were told to sign secondary NDAs felt uncomfortable about it. It says “three of the six contractors who signed new NDAs testified that they believed CIA’s request for the new NDAs appeared odd.” But the committee feels strongly that everything was cool about it.

But how does this debunk reporting that contractors were asked to sign further NDAs or that the request felt it odd? The report confirms it. And it seems sensible that some might find it odd. Reporters shouldn’t delight in CIA explanations for why it was totally no big deal over other claims at odds with CIA talking points.

The report goes into twists and turns to explain that these secondary NDAs weren’t really tied to Benghazi, they just super seem like it. And further the report says that Director Brennan was “factually accurate” when he denied it had anything to do with Benghazi but then suggests he didn’t handle it well. What a mess.

19. If you can’t trust the CIA completely, who can you trust?

Finding #16 is “There is no evidence that the CIA conducted any unusual polygraph exams related to Benghazi.”

You’ll note a few things. Namely the word “unusual” and the phrase “related to Benghazi.” CNN reported that some people who had been in Benghazi were being polygraphed once a month. They also reported that was an unusual rate.

Does the CIA justify its claim by saying once a month is a totally usual rate? That the polygraphs were done at an unusual rate but weren’t actually related to Benghazi but, instead, something else agency related? Is the distinction related to the difference between the journalistic claim regarding “CIA operative” and the CIA claim that “no officer” was polygraphed? We don’t know. There is no substantiating evidence that would make someone believe the CIA over Jake Tapper on this one. Should journalists jump up and down and make partisan clowns out of themselves before asking these questions?

20. What a waste of two years.

The conclusion to the report claims “This report is the result of nearly two years of intensive investigation.” I’d like to see how they define intensive.

Because if you spend two years to come up with a report that one of our worst failures was not preventable and you don’t even explore, say, whether we were sold out by supposed friends who turn out to be al Qaeda affiliated, what are you doing with your time?

If I wanted to read a bunch of unconvincing explanations for bad behavior, I’d talk to a group of poorly disciplined children. We should expect a bit more from an oversight committee.

And as for the clown show of our reporter class who spent the last couple of years making B-E-N-G-H-A-Z-I acrostics? Joking about dead ambassadors and lacking curiosity are not as good looking as you think.

One Man’s Torturer Is Another Man’s Freedom Fighter,"Like the death penalty and foreign policy and mostly unlike abortion, regulatory rollback, entitlement reform or any number of other conservatarian litmus tests, those on the Right in our political and cultural spectrum disagree on the morality and effectiveness of utilizing enhanced interrogation techniques on captured terrorists.

Is treating a human inhumanely worth the potential life-saving and national defense-bolstering information that might not otherwise be made available? Is the fact that the actions of this human—a terrorist, and therefore almost assuredly a mass murderer or attempted mass murderer—are deplorable alter the moral implications of treating him harshly, both physically and emotionally?

These questions should concern anyone who cares about the ethical actions of our government, not to mention our moral standing in a comparatively immoral—or perhaps amoral—world. If our government’s actions reflect our society’s mores (as we have certainly projected them to be), then what does the use of EIT say about our culture and value system?

Pushing People Around Is Not Torture

To properly analyze the recently stoked but cyclically reoccurring chattering class kerfuffle over the U.S. government treating terrorists a bit…unpleasantly, one must understand an important distinction: not all EITs are created equally. This is a critical point, because it is too easy to lump all forms of interrogation into a vat called “torture” if they go beyond offering the accused a cup of coffee and asking a few questions. That answer is too easy, and not accurate from a practical or ethical standpoint.

If Denzel can do it for a movie, our government should be able do it to captured terrorists who hold information we need to save innocent peoples’ lives.

I will not split the definitional hairs of “torture,” as some have, to exclude waterboarding or prolonged periods of solitary confinement, cold temperatures, or loud noises. While those methods don’t exactly equate with lashes from a whip, or breaking fingers with a hammer, or any number of other physical torments, they can correctly be considered torturous while hardly stretching the spirit of the word.

But a reasonable line can be drawn, at least on the front end of the “means and ends” debate, between pouring water over a terrorist’s face and branding his neck with a hot iron.

I have been surprised to witness the backlash from most of the liberal media community, as well as many conservatives and libertarians, to waterboarding in particular. In the 2012 film “Safe House¸” Denzel Washington’s character, international criminal Tobin Frost, is subjected to waterboarding by Central Intelligence Agency agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). The catch is that Washington wasn’t acting during this scene. He wanted an authentic portrayal of the experience, and thus actually had Reynolds hold a towel over his face and dump water on him, creating the sensation of drowning. This is otherwise known as waterboarding.

Regardless of where one lands on other manners of torture, if Denzel can do it for a movie, our government should be able do it to captured terrorists who hold information we need to save innocent peoples’ lives.

Ends Can Justify Means

But beyond the settlement of the definitional debate lies the greater question with which we’re faced: Does torturing a terrorist represent a moral compromise we shouldn’t be willing to make?

The effectiveness of EIT is material to its morality in the same way the morality of war depends on the cause over which it’s being fought.

Doing evil can never be justified, even to bad people, so goes the argument. But I’d like to suggest that when the ends are justified—indeed, even imperative—then the actions to achieve those ends may no be longer evil on their face. As with most of the great questions in life: it depends.

Consider the effort to end slavery in the United States—not a difficult example to conjure when one considers the cruelty the Islamic State, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist organizations inflict upon their victims. Certainly killing another person is grotesque and undesirable, even extremely so. But ending slavery was deemed worth a civil war, both at the time by Northern Republicans and in every historical remembering since.

The ends justified the means, objectionable they may appear to be. Does the same logic apply to EIT, or is the question of stopping terrorist groups and of treating one roughly once captured two separate moral issues? In other words, is torture’s effectiveness immaterial to its morality?

The effectiveness of EIT is material to its morality in the same way the morality of war depends on the cause over which it’s being fought. Certainly, killing another human can be a great evil, but doing so with the legal backing of an organized government in a strategic manner toward the goal of eliminating a specific terrorist threat in the grander scheme of eliminating all terrorist threats creates a proper justification for such killing.

No one argues that it would have been morally preferable to not shoot Osama bin Laden. Given this, surely information-gathering that would prevent the slaughter of hundreds or thousands of innocents creates a proper justification for EIT.

The Morality of a Thing Can Depend on Its Goal

It is not enough to say, from the safety of a keyboard or cable news soapbox, that “torture is wrong,” and leave it at that, although many intelligent commenters have arrived at that conclusion (including some whom I respect and who contribute to this site), any more than it is acceptable to say that “killing is wrong,” while ignoring all context.

EITs should be used reluctantly, sparingly, and only when a terrorist prisoner withholds specific information. But they should be used.

Killing is wrong when it’s not justified. Killing is not wrong when it is done to end slavery, to stop Adolph Hitler, or to defeat radical Islamist terrorists hell-bent on killing anyone who isn’t. Neither is torture wrong to prevent those same radical Islamist terrorists from their continued tyranny.

To contend otherwise, one must accept that foregoing EIT could mean not obtaining information that could prevent an attack. In short, refusing to touch a captured terrorist in Guantanamo could, say, mean the death of children attending school in Nishapur. In other words, one cannot separate the reason for using EIT methods from whether they are immoral or not. EITs should be used reluctantly, sparingly, and only when a terrorist prisoner withholds specific information. But they should be used.

Innocent People Shouldn’t Have to Die, No Matter the Year

New York Times conservative columnist Ross Douthat—whom I hold in high regard and with whom I rarely disagree—wrote recently in an article titled “Why We Tortured, Why We Shouldn’t” that:

The threat to the United States was real, but it was not the kind of threat it seemed in October 2001, or in 2002 and 2003 for that matter. We face a foe that wishes us harm, that has killed and will kill large numbers of people in many places around the world — but that has been unable carry out a single major terror attack on U.S. soil across thirteen years of trying. Forget a nuke a year or a 9/11 a year: Al Qaeda has not even managed a car bombing a year since its great success in 2001, and the domestic terrorism its ideology has inspired (Fort Hood, the Boston Marathon) has mostly been as random as school or movie theater shootings, posing no existential or strategic threat.

Douthat’s argument is reasoned and thoughtful, as always, but I believe he misses the greater gravity of the matter. His point would be acceptable as an argument to discontinue the use of EIT today, tomorrow, and perhaps the next day (if one accepts the presupposition that our moral duty is only to protect our own soil and people, but that is an argument for another time). It is fairly easy to acknowledge, even for the staunchest of pro-EIT hardliners, that if there is no threat, we shouldn’t treat our prisoners of war inhumanely.

But that’s not what this debate is about. We’re talking about using severe methods to garner specific information from captured terrorists that would help actively prevent the death of innocent people. That argument of moral examination knows no timeline. It was directly applicable in 2003, and if it isn’t in 2014, it will be again in ’15, or ’16, or whenever the next great terrorist or foreign enemy threat emerges.

I will concede that the current terrorist threat may loom smaller on the American horizon than in 2001 or even in the panicked aftermath, if Douthat will concede that our principles are hardly kept intact by treating a handful of imprisoned terrorists with kind hospitality while their friends target innocent men, women, and children.

Americans and the World Depend on Our Strength

In his column this week, Charles Krauthammer defended the use of waterboarding under President George W. Bush’s post-9/11 tenure: “A nation attacked is not a laboratory for exquisite moral experiments. It’s a trust to be protected, by whatever means meet and fit the threat.” This is especially true when that nation is ours. Many other nations depend on the militaristic and economic strength of the United States, and some would even struggle to exist (Israel comes to mind) if our enemies had their way with our armed forces and our republic. The threat of terrorism is still strong—here at home but elevated more highly abroad—and perhaps even more pressing than it was six years ago.

On this important moral matter, the people have it right.

We complain about perpetual war, and there is validity to the notion that the United States would be better served by being more selective in its foreign military forays. But as long as there are terrorists, there lies in us—the world’s mightiest force for good—a moral obligation to help stop them.

In general, the American public have no qualms with harsh treatment for captured terrorists in the name of the greater good, as a consistent string of polls and surveys show a majority support EIT when there is the potential to gain critical information. Moral efficacy is, thank goodness, not determined by public opinion polls or majority-think. But on this important moral matter, the people have it right.

Sometimes you have to wage war to stop bad men. Sometimes you have to pour water on their face.

Sydney Siege: Coming Soon to a Starbucks Near You,"After hours of speculation overnight about whether the gunman holding hostages at a downtown cafe in Sydney, Australia, might be an Islamic terrorist—despite his pretty clear gesture of forcing his captives to block the cafe’s windows with the traditional black flag of the jihadists—the gunman has issued demands that include, you guess it, being provided with an official Islamic State flag.

Thanks for clearing that up.

There are a couple of other things this jihadist SOB has helpfully cleared up for us.

First, there is the question of whether terrorist attacks are “blowback” for American military operations overseas. Well, does anyone really think that the top priority of the jihadists is to strike a blow against evil Australian imperialism? To be sure, Australia has been a reliable ally that has contributed troops and support for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But they’re not such a dominant force as to be a headline target for jihadists, and to my knowledge they haven’t been involved in recent airstrikes against the Islamic State.

No, the Sydney attack probably has more to do with Australia’s significant population of Muslim immigrants, some of whom are unassimilated and disaffected. The latest report is that the hostage taker has been identified as Man Haron Monis, “a 49-year-old self-styled ‘Muslim cleric and peace activist'” who fled Iran five years ago. I’m not saying that Australia shouldn’t take in immigrants from the Middle East, particularly since many recent Iranian immigrants were themselves fleeing an Islamist regime. But this does indicate that terrorism is less a reaction to Western military intervention than it is about the dangerous influence of jihadism within the “religion of peace.” It’s not about us, it’s about them. This is about the radical Islamists’ yearning to strike out against anyone who is not a Muslim.

Second, this incident gives the lie to the idea that the civil war in Syria is none of our business. Three years of dithering and refusing to take sides and treating Syria as if it really were none of our business made room for the rise of the Islamic State—and the success of the Islamic State is now rallying radical Islamists worldwide. There will be some discussion about whether this attack was planned as part of a wider conspiracy or whether it was a “lone wolf” attack, but that’s not a very comforting distinction, is it?

Islamic terrorism thrives on examples of success. The Muslim god is a god of war, and his prophet was a victorious conqueror. The example of a strident and victorious Islamist movement that carries all before it is a palpable incitement to other aspiring jihadists, whether they are directly linked to the Islamic State, or whether they’re just fanboys.

There might even be some wisdom to that old notion about fighting them over there so we won’t have to fight them over here.

That leads us to the final thing that is clarified by the Sydney attack. This is the next wave of terrorism.

Any time a show is this successful, they make a sequel. Terrorism is all about theater, about making a big splash and going down in a blaze of glory on behalf of the Muslim faith. That photo of terrified hostages holding the black flag of jihad up against the windows of an upscale cafe will be electrifying to other angry and disaffected Islamists. Anyone who cannot make it to Syria to join the jihad there—or, just as likely, someone who has already been there and come back—will see this as a new, highly effective way to bring terror to our streets.

This has been the trend for a while: many small lone wolf attacks in place of one big organized attack. The Fort Hood shooter, the would-be Times Square bomber, the machete attack on Lee Rigby, and so on. So it’s a minor miracle that what is happening in Sydney hasn’t already happened in Manhattan. We should assume that it is only a matter of time.

That’s the grimmest message from this story. You may not be interested in the War on Terrorism, but it is interested in you. Jihadism is back, and it may be coming soon to a Starbucks near you.

Torture Is Unacceptable; But What Is Torture?,"Are there things that one human being should not, under any circumstances, do to another? Is it ever appropriate to disregard a person’s humanity entirely, in the interests of attaining some highly desirable goal? These, I believe, are among the difficult questions that confront us when we consider the morality of Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (EIT).

Enhanced interrogation can mean a number of different things, not all of which (in my view) are categorically wrong. It should go without saying that intelligence agencies can at times have very compelling reasons to want information from uncooperative detainees. Sadly, a substantial portion of the population seems not to take this seriously. It’s genuinely troubling to see the naïvete with which some people dismiss enhanced interrogation, asserting blithely that it can never work, or simply failing to appreciate the seriousness of the obligations that we lay on intelligence agencies in demanding that they protect us from covert threats. Uncovering terrorist attacks before they happen is no simple matter, and as a rule, bad people aren’t willing to tell us about the heinous massacres they’ve been plotting just because we ask politely. There is no reason to take seriously those maddeningly unreflective people who presume that niceness must always be the best policy.

Equally irksome are those who dismiss all efforts to define torture as Jesuitical exercises in self-justification. They are not, or at least not necessarily. When it comes to interrogation, delving into the details is not merely permissible, it is necessary. Careful moral analysis is needed if we are to responsibly preserve the integrity of our nation, without obliterating any meaningful moral distinction between ourselves and our enemies.

Drawing Distinctions Between Interrogation and Torture

Being interrogated by American intelligence need not be a pleasant experience for enemy combatants. They are not honored guests. If interrogators have reason to believe that a suspect has critical information, it seems reasonable to allow them to intimidate or manipulate him in various ways. Averting terrorist attacks is important enough to justify certain breaches of decorum.

Human beings need not always be nice to one another, but we should always maintain a basic respect for the bodily and psychological integrity of other human beings.

At the same time, we should never allow ourselves to forget that enemy combatants are still human beings. Most of them probably aren’t very good human beings, and undoubtedly some are moral monsters. They are not citizens of our nation, nor are they prisoners of war in the proper sense. Still, they are human. This means that they possess that intrinsic dignity and worth that is proper to all human life. Seeing the moral significance of that basic reality is perhaps the most important line that divides a humane and rational society from a terrorist organization or a brutal dictatorship.

Human beings need not always be nice to one another, but we should always maintain a basic respect for the bodily and psychological integrity of other human beings. Sometimes it is necessary to cause pain, discomfort, or inconvenience to others by way of pursuing important ends. However, I cannot respect a person’s humanity while deliberately maiming him, or acting in such a way as to leave him psychologically broken. Such actions assault a person’s humanity on such a fundamental level that it would be ridiculous to claim they are compatible with a real respect for that person’s life.

I take this to be the basic line between aggressive interrogation and torture. Legitimate interrogation may be unpleasant, but it endeavors to leave the interrogated person physically and psychologically intact, in such a way that his long-term welfare is not seriously threatened. Torture recognizes no such imperative. It consents to treat the interrogated person purely as a means to a further end, with no regard for that person’s own well-being.

Once We Treat People Like Objects, We’re Acting Like Terrorists

Among the truly depraved (despots, for example) torture is sometimes used as a means of quashing political dissent, or even as a form of entertainment. Presumably (hopefully!) Americans would all agree that this is morally monstrous. But even when torture is employed as a means to extracting information that might save innocent lives, a line has still been crossed.

Enhanced interrogation inevitably happens under a veil of secrecy, and that being the case, there isn’t a good way of ensuring that torture is reserved for the heinously guilty.

We should not allow ourselves to take too much comfort in the assurance that the tortured are bad people. Most of them probably are, and some undoubtedly “deserve what they have coming.” Nevertheless, two considerations should give us pause. The first is that enhanced interrogation inevitably happens under a veil of secrecy, and that being the case, there isn’t a good way of ensuring that torture is reserved for the heinously guilty. Very bad people aren’t the only ones who can have valuable information. Are we simply to take the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA’s) word for it that they’ll take extreme care to spare the innocent (or the not-very-guilty)? That seems quite naïve. When did conservatives become so trusting of governmental organizations?

On a deeper level, though, the guilt or innocence of the tortured is quite literally beside the point. For the interrogator, the moral state of the prisoner is irrelevant. The welfare of the prisoner is irrelevant. The humanity of the prisoner is irrelevant. The tortured person, as such, disappears from the equation. He is regarded purely as a source of information, no less dispensable than a computer or a reference book.

Whether or not his actions are heinous enough to merit such treatment is unimportant, because his torturers are not in the business of administering justice. They have simply chosen to disregard the prisoner’s humanity for the sake of pursuing other ends. If we believe we are at liberty to do that, is there any moral precept that we won’t break, given sufficient motivation? What do we have left that separates us from the terrorist or the despot, apart from a more-comfortable situation that generally enables our ordinary citizens the luxury of more squeamish sensibilities?

How Far Is Too Far?

Philosophically, the distinction between aggressive interrogation and torture is critical. Aggressive interrogation is at times a regrettable necessity, but the apologist for torture simply jettisons any plausible claim to respect human life as such.

At the extremes, sleep deprivation can cause long-term psychological damage or perhaps even death.

In application, the line between these is anything but bright. Of course, some interrogation tactics do seem pretty obviously to fall to one side or the other of the “torture” line. So, for example, we shouldn’t call it “torture” when intelligence operatives are loud, rude, or verbally aggressive during an interrogation. It’s not torture to make prisoners sit in hard chairs, or to turn the thermostat to uncomfortable levels for limited periods of time. It’s not torture if we keep questioning suspects awake well past their bedtimes, in hopes that the exhaustion will make them careless. On the flip side, it definitely is torture once we start severing limbs or brain lobes, crushing hands or knee caps, or flogging people.

In between these relatively-clear extremes, there is a large realm of gray. People vary quite a lot, both physically and psychologically, in terms of what stresses they can endure. If an interrogator’s intention is to frazzle, confuse, or even terrify a suspect without causing permanent harm, he will need to exercise significant prudence. The prisoner’s fortitude and vulnerabilities must both be carefully weighed. Sometimes an interrogator might miscalculate in ways that are minimally culpable, or not culpable at all. After all, people occasionally misjudge their own strength in ways that lead to permanent harm. It’s too much to ask that intelligence agencies preserve dangerous prisoners from even the smallest possibility of risk.

Waterboarding and sleep deprivation are two examples of interrogation techniques that (in my view) may or may not qualify as torture, depending on a variety of factors. Waterboarding is an intensely unpleasant experience, which nevertheless can be done in such a way as to avoid permanent harm. We have used it on our own operatives as part of their counter-interrogation training. (By contrast, we do not maim or disfigure our own operatives for that purpose.) It can plausibly be argued that waterboarding does not always and necessarily constitute torture. At the same time, waterboarding certainly can cause permanent harm if it used too frequently or without sufficient caution. It doesn’t clearly and unambiguously qualify as torture, but it isn’t something to take lightly.

Sleep deprivation is an interesting example, because in mild forms it’s a commonplace experience. If sleep deprivation qualifies as torture, then babies the world over are torturing their parents every day. Even in milder forms it can sometimes be a useful interrogation tactic, because exhaustion confuses people and leaves them more susceptible to suggestion. At the extremes, however, sleep deprivation can cause long-term psychological damage or perhaps even death. Josef Stalin took many prisoners to those extremes in the Gulag.

Now, to Combine Realism and Morality

Dissatisfying as it may seem, it really isn’t possible to create hard-and-fast rules for every sort of enhanced interrogation. Physicians, psychologists, and moral philosophers have spent long hours debating these points, which is mostly a good thing. We should be pleased that our Justice Department gives such careful attention to these issues, because it generally shows that efforts are being made to avoid torture.

There is no fail-proof way to enable interrogators to do their jobs without opening the door to harrowing mistakes.

We also need to recognize that in many cases, a rule book is no substitute for a prudent and humane interrogator, who has an individualized sense of a particular prisoner’s moral and psychological state. This is frightening because, realistically, intelligence operatives aren’t perfect. Sometimes they make bad prudential decisions. Sometimes they make bad moral decisions. There is no fail-proof way to enable them to do their jobs without opening the door to harrowing mistakes.

As members of the general public, we must endeavor to find a balance between being critical (because torture is a deeply serious matter) and being understanding (because we should appreciate the difficulty and importance of the work that these agencies do). It isn’t fair to demand that the CIA protect us from desperate criminals, and then to boil over with indignation whenever political tricks force us to confront the (obvious!) fact that catching terrorists is an unsavory business. Since September 11, our nation has been mostly free of serious terrorist attacks, and we should all be profoundly grateful for that.

At the same time, we should never go so far as to condone torture. Yes, it happens. It will continue to happen, like other unfortunate things in this world. But torture is never right or just. It is an assault on humanity itself, and on the fundamental goods of life and dignity, which we as a society normally claim to value. A nation that openly condones torture is in grave danger of losing its own soul. We should make it clear to our political leaders (and the people they appoint) that We The People find torture morally unacceptable.

"Yes, Christians Can Support Torture","In a recent post cited by Patheos, nondenominational pastor Brian Zahnd brashly proclaims “You Cannot Be Christian and Support Torture.”

There is no possibility of compromise. The support of torture is off the table for a Christian. I suppose you can be some version of a ‘patriot’ and support the use of torture, but you cannot be any version of Christian and support torture. So choose one: A torture-endorsing patriot or a Jesus-following Christian. But don’t lie to yourself that you can be both. You cannot.



…Any thoughtful person, no matter their religion or non-religion, knows that you cannot support torturing people and still claim to be a follower of the one who commanded his disciples to love their enemies. The only way around this is to invent a false Jesus who supports the use of torture. (The Biblical term for this invented false Jesus is “antichrist.”)



Those who argue for the use of torture do so because they are convinced it is pragmatic for national security. But Christians are not called to be pragmatists or even safe. Christians are called by Jesus to imitate a God who is kind and merciful to the wicked.

Zahnd edited this piece. He states in a “PS” that he originally wrote, “You cannot be a Christian and support torture.” He took out “a” probably because he received a lot of backlash, and rightly so. So he qualified it: “You cannot be Christian and support torture. . . . Can you support torture and go to heaven? Maybe. Can you support torture and be Christlike? No.”

Zahnd can try to disingenuously snake his way out of his own wording, but it’s obvious he’s calling people’s Christianity into question, and that’s what he meant when he initially wrote the post. But even with the qualifier, he is judging 79 percent of evangelicals in America and 78 percent of Catholics (along with 68 percent of all Americans, according to a recent poll)—who say torture can be justified. Yes, not only white evangelicals say torture is justified. White Catholics do, too—a fact overlooked in many articles written about the 2009 Pew survey.

So, can torture ever be morally justified? Or are Christians who support torture simply sellouts to security, as Zahnd says, and possibly doomed to hell?

I think Zahnd and others who make similar judgments are wrong. Torture in some forms and in some circumstances—conducted by the police and military officials—can be morally justified because (1) torture is not necessarily morally worse than killing (i.e., the death penalty); (2) the terrorist has forfeited his right to life and his dignity by his own evil actions; and (3) the innocent lives that can be saved are of higher value than any moral claims by the terrorist who has committed atrocities.

Is Torture Worse Than Death?

Torture is the infliction of severe pain on a defenseless person for the purpose of breaking his or her will. Authoritarian regimes want to break people’s wills to gain or maintain power. Their motives are not to gain important information to save lives, and the torture they conduct is typically prolonged, lasting days, weeks, and even years. This is a maximalist kind of torture imposed on soldiers and even innocent citizens who should not be subjected to such treatment, and it has no place in civilized societies. This is the kind of torture that can be worse than death. It is so devastating, so damaging to both the body and the psyche that the person being tortured loses his self-identity and ability to function as a healthy and completely autonomous human being even after he has been released.

However you classify them, the purpose of harsh interrogation techniques is to gain information to save lives, not to exercise power over the powerless.

Prolonged torture designed to crush the spirit of an individual is different from interrogation techniques, even ones that inflict pain. Whether these are classified as torture has been hotly debated since the Central Intelligence Agency report on enhanced interrogation techniques was released. However you classify them, the purpose of the techniques is to gain information to save lives, not to exercise power over the powerless.

Interrogative torture is minimal, acute, and designed to gain necessary information to protect society. Some might not feel comfortable using the term torture, but for the sake of this post, I will. It is sometimes morally justified to use pain to break a terrorist’s will in order to save lives. Interrogative torture is not prolonged, maximal, pleasurable, vengeful, or punitive, and it does not have long-term debilitating consequences that completely disrupt a person’s ability to function normally.

This kind of torture is a “lesser evil” than death. While torture does involve the exercise of control over another human being for a time, it does not end their autonomy as death does. When someone is dead, they have no autonomy, no hope of life, and no dignity. They’re dead. However, when a person is tortured in a minimal way, they have not completely lost all autonomy—even in the moment of intense pain. They can still give up information and end the interrogation, or they can remain silent and suffer. There will come a time when the pain will end, when they will regain their autonomy, and they will continue their lives. There is no such hope for a dead person.

The harm that results from interrogative torture is clearly a lesser moral evil than the harm that comes from killing someone.

It simply does not follow that torturing someone is morally worse than killing them—not in all circumstances. The harm that results from interrogative torture is clearly a lesser moral evil than the harm that comes from killing someone. While a torture victim is physically powerless, they still maintain enough mental faculties to give information and to stop the interrogation. Again, the person who is dead has no such ability. Killing someone takes away his life and autonomy, but torture—while it takes away a person’s autonomy for time—does not take away a life.

Torture Violates Human Dignity?

A primary argument against torture is the same that is leveled against the death penalty—that it violates a terrorist’s human dignity. Some would argue that execution does not violate human dignity, but it would be difficult to argue that capital punishment in the Bible took human dignity into consideration. In the Old Testament, God commanded that people be killed by stoning for various crimes. These included breaking the Sabbath, homosexuality, adultery, and children rebelling against their parents.

If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, ‘Let us go and worship other gods’ (gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known, gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other), do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people. Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. (Deuteronomy 13:6-10)

Stoning was not an immediate death. While sometimes it happened quickly, oftentimes its object would suffer terrible pain, humiliation, and anguish as he bled to death on the street with rocks raining down. The criminal’s dignity was irrelevant. It was irrelevant because he—in the eyes of the law and God—had lost his own sense of dignity. And stoning wasn’t the only method used. The Talmud describes pouring molten lead down the throat of the condemned, beheading, and strangulations—all for crimes such as practicing magic, worshipping idols, or eating something unclean. Throughout Christian history, cruel and unusual punishment as we would define it has been exercised without a thought to the guilty person’s “dignity.”

Yet this is an objection many Christians make in opposing torture. Federalist contributor Rachel Lu makes this point when she says that no matter what a person has done, he maintains his dignity, and other people have no right to violate it.

We should never allow ourselves to forget that enemy combatants are still human beings. Most of them probably aren’t very good human beings, and undoubtedly some are moral monsters. They are not citizens of our nation, nor are they prisoners of war in the proper sense. Still, they are human. This means that they possess that intrinsic dignity and worth that is proper to all human life. Seeing the moral significance of that basic reality is perhaps the most important line that divides a humane and rational society from a terrorist organization or a brutal dictatorship.

The assumption here is that human dignity can never be lost or forfeited. It is part of who we are, and no one has the right to take it away from us. We have the right to life, to our dignity, to our autonomy. In other words, our dignity is absolute in an ontological sense.

While Lu is correct that no human being has the right to take our dignity from us, our dignity is not absolute—it is conditional to our being because we are moral creatures. Unlike our finitude, which is absolute, as well as our physical mortality, our dignity depends on our moral character, our values, our choices, our actions. It exists in relation to God’s law and his righteousness.

Criminals Forfeit Their Dignity

When we make evil choices—especially in the context of murdering people—we forfeit our dignity and autonomy. Our own choices have diminished our dignity, and it cannot be called up to save us from receiving the punishment we deserve—or the consequences that come with our own actions. This is why it is just to take away a criminal’s freedom when he commits a heinous crime. Criminals have forfeited their right to be free, and they have abandoned their own sense of worth and value by taking another’s life. They have made that choice. They have done that to themselves.

Thomas Aquinas makes this point quite clearly in his defense of killing criminals:

By sinning man departs from the order of reason, and consequently falls away from the dignity of his manhood, in so far as he is naturally free, and exists for himself, and he falls into the slavish state of the beasts, by being disposed of according as he is useful to others. This is expressed in Ps. 48:21: ‘Man, when he was in honor, did not understand; he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them,’ and Prov. 11:29: ‘The fool shall serve the wise.’ Hence, although it be evil in itself to kill a man so long as he preserve his dignity, yet it may be good to kill a man who has sinned, even as it is to kill a beast. For a bad man is worse than a beast, and is more harmful, as the Philosopher states (Polit. i, 1 and Ethic. vii, 6).

“A bad man is worse than a beast, and is more harmful.” Aquinas’ words are definitely in line with how God treats criminals in Scripture. Human dignity is not seen as an absolute, but as conditional. This makes it morally justifiable to kill people who have violated the law—man’s law and God’s law. Since interrogative torture is not worse than killing, and killing is morally justified because human dignity has already been lost, interrogative torture is morally justifiable.

If we choose not to torture someone so we can save a life, then we are placing the dignity of the criminal over the life and dignity of the innocent person who is about to die.

If killing were not morally justifiable on the basis of human dignity, God would be a monster. But he isn’t. Why? Because of human guilt. Even though the Bible says, “Thou Shalt Not Kill,” God orders Joshua to “go in and clean house, and don’t leave anything breathing! Don’t leave a donkey, child, woman, old man or old woman breathing. Wipe out Jericho!” He can order this because those people had violated God’s law and in so doing had forfeited their rights and lost all sense of dignity. Even as we struggle with the fairness of this from our limited human perspective, the fact that this occurs in Scripture cannot be denied. The justification for it lies in the guilt of the people being punished. If killing were not morally justifiable—and if human dignity were intrinsic to our being no matter what we do—then hell itself would be a profound injustice because people would be tortured for eternity with their dignity intact. How can this be reconciled with the absolutist view of human dignity?

If it is morally justifiable to stone a criminal to death, which is punitive (or even kill someone out of self-defense or to save a life that is threatened), would it not follow that it would be morally justified to torture a criminal to get information out of him in order to save a life? If we choose not to torture someone so we can save a life, then we are placing the dignity of the criminal over the life and dignity of the innocent person who is about to die—something the Bible doesn’t do. The Bible does not recognize the autonomy and dignity of the evildoer. God didn’t, for the foreign nations who were not covered by his covenant. The theocracy of Israel didn’t, which is why people were stoned to death for adultery and other crimes. And it is why, now in the new dispensation, the government (though not the church) is to wield the sword and “violate” the autonomy of the guilty, and we’re to recognize the state’s authority when it does:

Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience. (Romans 13, emphasis added)

Government Rightly Uses Force to Protect Society

While the new dispensation fulfills the old in the Church, it does not make these old laws invalid. In Matthew 5:18, Jesus says: “For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.” Christians are no longer under the Mosaic Law, but this does not mean there are no longer temporal punishments delivered by the government—a government that God means will use force to protect society, not to be a charitable institution. The Bible makes it clear that those who live by the sword will die by the sword. If you kill, you forfeit your right to life. You have become, as Aquinas said, worse than a beast.

If you kill, you forfeit your right to life. You have become, as Aquinas said, worse than a beast.

This doesn’t mean the government can do anything it likes to criminals just because they’re guilty. It is not our right to exercise power for the sake of power. If we are forced to use interrogative torture, we do it to save lives, not to abuse the criminal for the sake of empowerment or even punishment. And this action is to be done, not by individuals, but by the government, which has been given the authority of the sword by God himself.

People like Zahnd who speak of God’s forgiveness and mercy and the many commandments in Scripture for God’s people to turn the other cheek and love their enemies make the mistake of applying these commandments meant for individuals also to the government. While it is a Christian’s duty to love and forgive, it is the state’s duty to punish criminals—even to put them to death.

The good news is that there is hope even for the evildoer. If there is repentance, there is forgiveness, there is restoration of dignity. This is the hope of the Gospel and the promise of Christ who died for our sins. If you put your faith in him, he is faithful and just to forgive and cleanse you of all unrighteounsess. But for those who commit evil, who live by the sword, they will surely die by it. And those who refuse to show mercy will suffer at the master’s hand: As Jesus said of the unmerciful servant in Matthew 18, “In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed. ‘This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.’”

Guilt and Innocence Matter

While forgiveness and mercy are a matter for individuals, it is the role of the government to protect and punish. When it comes to protection, innocent lives that can be saved are of higher value than any moral claims by the terrorist who has and will commit atrocities. Guilt and innocence matters. If government officials have a known terrorist in custody, and it is certain that he has information needed to save lives, it is morally justified for them to use interrogative torture to get the information necessary to protect innocent life.

When the good are ‘protected and saved by the slaying of the wicked, then the latter may be lawfully put to death.’

Once again, I turn to Aquinas. In defense of the death penalty, he wrote that the reason it is necessary to kill a criminal is not simply to punish him, but to protect society “to safeguard the common good.” When the good are “protected and saved by the slaying of the wicked, then the latter may be lawfully put to death.”

If, according to Aquinas, the good can be saved through killing the wicked, then it would seem to follow that the good can be saved through interrogative torture, which is a lesser evil than killing. If we’re willing to kill in war to protect our homeland, why are we not willing to inflict temporary pain on a terrorist to save lives? The people who are killed on the battlefield will never walk again, they will never feel the sun on their faces, or eat a hot meal, or touch another human being. The terrorist who has been tortured will—and those he has threatened will, too.

The Catechism of the Council of Trent expounds on this theme when it says that lawful slaying to “protect the innocent” is just use of civil power. “The just use of this power, far from involving the crime of murder, is an act of paramount obedience to this Commandment which prohibits murder [Thou shalt not kill]. The end of the Commandment is the preservation and security of human life. Now the punishments inflicted by the civil authority, which is the legitimate avenger of crime, naturally tend to this end, since they give security to life by repressing outrage and violence. Hence these words of David: In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land, that I might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord.”

John Yoo, who was instrumental in setting up the Guantanamo Bay detention center, said in an interview in 2007 that there are situations when torture is justified:

Death is worse than torture, but everyone except pacifists thinks there are circumstances in which war is justified. War means killing people. If we are entitled to kill people, we must be entitled to injure them. I don’t see how it can be reasonable to have an absolute prohibition on torture when you don’t have an absolute prohibition on killing. Reasonable people will disagree about when torture is justified. But that, in some circumstances, it is justified seems to me to be just moral common sense. How could it be better that 10,000 or 50,000 or a million people die than that one person be injured?

Peter Levine, a professor at Tufts University, says that Yoo asks a serious question, and while he tries to respond it, he’s not satisfied with any of his answers.

We have a good reason to safeguard the rights of captives: our own government can take us prisoner. If we lose habeas corpus for suspected terrorists, we can lose it for ourselves. That is certainly a concern, but it doesn’t excuse acts of war on foreign lands that may cause individuals to suffer worse than they would under torture. A pacifist replies: War is never acceptable. But what about in 1940? Or 1861? Or 1776? If war is ever justified, then we will sometimes kill people. And if killing is worse than torturing, why should we ban the latter–especially if it proves an efficient means of preventing casualties?

Levine, like most of us, doesn’t feel comfortable with torture, but the argument that it can be effective in saving lives is compelling. Some call this pure utilitarianism, but if you can kill to protect society, and some forms of torture are not as bad as killing, then does it not follow that it is morally justified to use torture to save lives?

One of the problems we have in this debate is the tendency to make no distinction between the guilty and the innocent. Someone says he would never advocate torture to save the innocent. But is that realistic or even honest? What if a bomb is about to go off in your child’s school? The authorities have captured a terrorist who has information on where the bomb is. They know he has this information, and they’re running out of time. Would you allow your child to die in order to save the dignity of a terrorist? Some say they would, but is the value of a criminal’s dignity—dignity he doesn’t value himself as he’s abandoned it—more valuable than your child’s life?

Will the Torturer Lose His Soul?

The issue here is not over using power for power’s sake, which is often the case with torture. It is acting for a higher moral purpose. Dietrich Bonhoeffer certainly understood this dilemma when he participated in a plot to assassinate Hitler. You can read the heaviness of his choices in the following passage:

We have been silent witnesses of evil deeds. We have become cunning and learned the arts of obfuscation and equivocal speech. Experience has rendered us suspicious of human beings, and often we have failed to speak to them a true and open word. Unbearable conflicts have worn us down or even made us cynical. Are we still of any use? We will not need geniuses, cynics, people who have contempt for others, or cunning tacticians, but simple, uncomplicated, and honest human beings. Will our inner strength to resist what has been forced on us have remained strong enough, and our honesty with ourselves blunt enough, to find our way back to simplicity and honesty?

Choosing between two evils is never easy, but it is a situation created, not by those trying to find resolution, but by the criminal who has chosen evil over good. Some argue that torture necessarily dehumanizes the one carrying it out. This is an interesting admission, especially when these same people say that a criminal doesn’t dehumanize himself by his own evil deeds—that he doesn’t forfeit his dignity. How can a torturer dehumanize himself by inflicting pain if a murderer doesn’t dehumanize himself by killing others? It seems that our immoral actions do affect us, do diminish us, do reduce us, as Aquinas said, to a level lower than beasts—both for the torturer and the murderer.

There would be grief and pain, but there would be a measure of calm and acceptance that what had to be done was done to save a life.

Leaders in law enforcement have been known to say that they would never want someone on their force who can carry out torture and not be affected by it—precisely because it does have a dehumanizing effect. These concerns are valid. Indeed, if someone were to torture and not be affected by it, he would be a sociopath and dangerous in society. No one is saying employing torture techniques will leave a person unaffected. Bonheoffer was certainly affected by his role in the conspiracy to kill Hitler, but does this mean he was necessarily dehumanized? Not when the motive and the purpose is a higher good—to defend the defenseless, to save lives.

Most everyone would say that if they randomly killed someone, they would be psychologically and spiritually harmed. But if they killed someone who was trying to rape or kill their daughter, they would find peace with it because they will have known it was necessary to protect the one they loved. Context and motive make all the difference. They would be affected, of course. There would be no delight, no pride, no joy. There would be grief and pain, but there would be a measure of calm and acceptance that what had to be done was done to save a life—to defend the defenseless and protect the good. This is why it is important that when we consider these kinds of measures—measures that have been forced upon us as we live in a barbaric world where the wicked terrorize the innocent—that we remain true to our purpose and only resort to these extremes when there is no other choice.

What About Due Process?

How do we work through these difficult issues legally? Do we want our government to have the power to interrogate people it considers guilty without accountability and due process? First of all, a terrorist is not an American citizen and does not have the rights of due process given to American citizens (or they shouldn’t). The Geneva Convention says prisoners of war are “Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfill the following conditions: (a) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; (b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance; (c) that of carrying arms openly; (d) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.”

Terrorists don’t meet b, c, and d. They do not wear uniforms. They hide among civilians and innocents. Their arms are usually concealed. They don’t conform to the laws and customs of war but target innocent people.

Second, it would be unwise to have torture legalized and institutionalized because such license would be dangerous left unchecked in the hands of the powerful state. Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard University law professor, offers a reasonable solution.

I think every president would at least consider the option of torture if confronted with an actual ticking bomb. President Clinton said he would consider torture and President George W. Bush actually authorized the use of waterboarding, even in non-ticking bomb situations. Bush denied that waterboarding and other forms of extreme interrogation measures he approved were torture, but they would seem to fit any reasonable definition of that term.



If I’m right, and if every president would, in fact, consider opting for the torture of one terrorist rather than permitting thousands of innocent Americans to be blown up, then the following question must be asked: Would it be better or worse for a law to be passed requiring the president to secure a warrant before (or, in a real emergency, during or right after) he could employ this drastic measure? Such a law would implicitly legitimate torture in extreme situations, and that’s a bad thing, but it would also create visibility and accountability, which is a good thing.

A danger of torture warrants is that there would be no check on how often they are given, and the result would be that torture would become more normal. That’s certainly a risk. The only other option is to keep all forms of torture and enhanced interrogation illegal and let those who find themselves faced with the ticking time bomb scenario or something similar fall on the mercy of society and the courts. If this is, indeed, the only solution, I hope the courts and the public will show leniency, since torture is morally justified in extreme circumstances and those men and women who are caught between two evils but who humbly act according to conscience—even when it is contrary to the law—will be shown the respect and gratitude they deserve.

Swiftly Executing Terrorists Is More Humane than Torture,"In the wake of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on the Central Intelligence Agency’s detention and interrogation program—the so-called “torture report”—many have argued that what we did to captured terrorists after 9/11 was justified because it helped disrupt future terror plots and led to the assassination of Osama bin Laden. Waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and other “enhanced interrogation tactics” saved American lives, we’re told, so it was all worth it—even if we had to bend the law, even if it was inhumane.

But there is a more humane and morally justifiable way we could’ve dealt with terrorists after 9/11. We could have executed them.

We have a precedent for such a response to terrorism. Execution is exactly what we did during World War II. On June 12, 1942, four German saboteurs landed on Long Island, New York, after a voyage across the Atlantic on a German submarine. Four days later, another four-man team landed on a beach south of Jacksonville, Florida. Their mission, codenamed Operation Pastorius, was to blow up hydroelectric works at Niagara Falls, industrial plants in several states, locks on the Ohio River, railroad passes in Pennsylvania, Hell Gate Bridge in New York, and Penn Station in Newark. They planned to bomb mundane civilian targets like railroad stations and public squares. They planned to bomb Jewish-owned businesses.

It was essentially a Nazi terrorist plot. Albert Speer, Hitler’s architect, noted in his diary that Hitler was obsessed with “the downfall of New York in towers of flames.” Even before the war, Hitler had been intrigued by plans for the Messerschmitt Me 264, the “Amerika Bomber,” a long-range aircraft designed to hit American cities on the east coast. After Germany declared war on the United States, Hitler initiated Pastorius.

German Operatives Received a Military Trial and Swift Execution

The operation did not go well. Soon after making landfall on Long Island and changing into civilian clothes, the Germans were spotted and confronted by a Coast Guard patrolman. The group’s leader, George Dasch, attempted to bribe the patrolman, who promptly returned to his station and reported the incident, launching a massive FBI manhunt. Believing the mission to be compromised, Dasch and another agent, Ernst Burger, conspired to betray their comrades and abort the operation. Dasch turned himself in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on June 15, and within weeks American authorities had apprehended the others. President Roosevelt immediately issued an executive order creating a military tribunal to try the saboteurs, a decision confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.

President Roosevelt immediately issued an executive order creating a military tribunal to try the saboteurs, a decision confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The trial lasted less than three weeks and ended on August 1. The Germans were found guilty and sentenced to death. Because Dasch and Burger had turned themselves in and provided information, Roosevelt commuted their sentences to prison terms. The six remaining saboteurs were executed by electric chair on August 8, less than two months after landing in the United States. Their remains were buried in a potter’s field outside Washington DC.

Here was a case of enemy combatants hiding among the civilian population with the objective of carrying out terrorist attacks and industrial sabotage. When we caught them, we didn’t detain them in a special prison, we didn’t waterboard them or force them into coffin-sized boxes for days on end to get them to divulge all they knew. We simply tried and executed them—swiftly.

The Comparison to WWII Is Fair

Of course, some will object that comparing WWII to our interminable post-9/11 “war on terror” is not entirely analogous. In 1942, we were at war with Germany, a nation-state with a government and a military in control of a defined territory. Today, we are at war with an amorphous network of terrorist organization operating all over the world. Yet the Dasch case is similar to the immediate aftermath of 9/11 in a few important respects. In both cases, America had recently suffered an unprecedented surprise attack that claimed thousands of lives; U.S. military intelligence and domestic law enforcement agencies were on high alert for further possible (and possibly imminent) attacks; and we had scarce intelligence about the enemy’s capabilities and plans.

The notion that we would treat prisoners, even spies and saboteurs, in anything close to the way the Japanese treated their prisoners was repugnant to Americans.

Yet the idea of holding enemy saboteurs indefinitely or subjecting them to anything like waterboarding didn’t even occur to U.S. leaders during WWII. Americans were outraged at Japan’s widespread use of torture to gather military intelligence from prisoners of war, and we prosecuted thousands of Japanese personnel after the war for these crimes. The notion that we would treat prisoners, even spies and saboteurs, in anything close to the way the Japanese treated their prisoners was repugnant to Americans.

In the end, though, it doesn’t matter how precisely analogous comparisons are between WWII and the war on terror, because torturing prisoners shouldn’t be subject to some kind of body count arithmetic about how many lives might have been saved if we did this or that. Torture is either morally justifiable or it isn’t, and the circumstances and arguments for or against its effectiveness are ancillary. Khalid Sheik Mohammad, the mastermind of 9/11, either has basic human rights or he doesn’t. If he does, we shouldn’t torture him or even treat him inhumanely.

Torture Can Never Be a Just Punishment

Herein lies an important distinction: a man may, owing to the severity of his crimes, lose his right to live; he should never lose his right to be treated humanely, to die with a measure of dignity. His punishment is that he lose his life—not his humanity. This holds even for the wicked, who have not themselves been humane to their victims.

A man may, owing to the severity of his crimes, lose his right to live; he should never lose his right to be treated humanely, to die with a measure of dignity.

An extension—and arguably a perversion—of this principle may well account for the sharp rise in drone strikes against terrorist targets under President Obama, more than six times as many as his predecessor. In light of the barbarity that a place like Guantanamo requires, so the thinking goes, perhaps it is better if we do not apprehend these men in the first place. In a recent column, Victor Davis Hanson asked whether the next Senate Intelligence Committee will “charge that in the topsy-turvy morality of the Obama presidency, his administration preferred to bypass Guantanamo by choosing to kill suspected terrorists rather than capture them?” Maybe that’s precisely what the president was thinking—rid himself, and us, of the greater evil in favor of a lesser one.

Christopher Hitchens once told an audience of liberal college students that Guantanamo was an outrage. Asked what should be done with the detainees, he replied—to the students’ horror—that if it were up to him he’d have the terrorists lined up and executed by firing squad. That shouldn’t be so difficult to understand. In the wake of the Taliban’s slaughter last Tuesday of 145 people at a Pakistani school, most of them children, one mourner at a recent vigil for the victims in Lahore held up a placard that declared: “Terrorists should be publicly executed.”

Perhaps they should. They should certainly not be tortured.

Dear Rand Paul; Tell Dad to Shut Up,"If Rand Paul wants to have any chance of running for the Republican nomination for president in 2016, not to mention the presidency itself, there is one thing he needs to do immediately.

Tell Dad to shut up.

In response to the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, Ron Paul took a break from his usual blame-America-first rhetoric to blame France first. On an internet television show, Paul the Elder declared, “France has been a target for many, many years, because they’ve been involved in foreign affairs in Libya, and they really prodded us along in—recently in Libya, but they’ve been involved in Algeria, so they’ve had attacks like this, you know, not infrequently.” He continued:

I put blame on bad policy that we don’t fully understand, and we don’t understand what they’re doing because the people who are objecting to the foreign policy that we pursue, they do it from a different perspective. They see us as attacking them, and killing innocent people, so yes, they, they have—this doesn’t justify, so don’t put those words in my mouth—it doesn’t justify, but it explains it…. It’s that overall policy which invites retaliation.

This is absurd on a number of levels. First, many of the Western interventions that Paul cites were efforts to attack and destroy Islamic terrorist groups. It now appears, for example, that the leader of the Paris attack was previously jailed for recruiting French Muslims to fight for al-Qaeda in Iraq. So when we attack Islamic terrorist networks, Islamic terrorists become angry with us. Thanks for that nugget of wisdom, but it doesn’t make the destruction of terrorist networks any less desirable. (As for the Paris attacker’s claim that he supported al-Qaeda because he was angry about US abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, this requires that you forget the giant, systematic war crimes perpetrated by jihadists wherever they try to seize power, as the Islamic State has recently reminded us in Syria.)

More important, there is no reason to believe that Charlie Hebdo was attacked as a protest against French foreign policy. If you take the attackers’ own reported claims at face value, they were attacking to “avenge the prophet” against insults from the tabloid’s cartoonists. And if you still don’t believe that this is the motive, British radical Anjem Choudary has taken to the pages of USA Today and helpfully explained to us that Islamists such as himself “do not believe in the concept of freedom of expression” and regard blasphemy as a capital offense. You don’t say.

But Ron Paul wants to overrule the Islamists’ own statement of their motives. I call this Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy: taking someone else’s terrorist attack, fantasizing what you think his motives ought to be according to your world view, and then using the attack to try to get everyone to climb onto your own ideological hobby horse.

It goes without saying that there isn’t much of a market for that outlook, particularly among the Republican base. It smacks too much of appeasement. There might be some good reasons to alter our foreign policy, but avoiding the anger of our sworn enemies is not one of those reasons.

So if Rand Paul wants a chance in 2016, he has to convince his father to zip it.

Then again, Paul the Elder’s views don’t come out of nowhere. They come from the same old-style libertarian base that Paul the Younger is no doubt counting on to jump-start his campaign.

The old libertarians are not just advocates of small government or limited government. They regard government as such as the enemy. Even those who are not openly declared anarchists—and there were plenty of those—are hard-pressed to admit find any branch of government they would support, and that hatred and suspicion of government extends to the police and the military. As a result, the libertarians have generally borrowed the foreign policy of the far left, in which American “imperialism” and the “military-industrial complex” are always the real enemy. When you spend your time nursing an unwarranted hostility toward your own country, you tend to end up indulging an unwarranted sympathy toward its sworn enemies.

So maybe Ron Paul should keep on talking. If he isn’t doing his son any favors, he might do us some favors by reminding us where Rand Paul came from and leading us to ask some hard questions about how far the apple has fallen from the tree.

How France Grew Its Own Terrorists,"In the wake of the massacre of 17 people in Paris last week, some have questioned the role that immigration played in bringing radical Islam to France. Some are even calling for a moratorium on immigration to France from Muslim countries to avoid further terrorist attacks. Although it’s necessary to look to the history of immigration in France to understand how this happened, it’s wrong to think that changes to immigration policy now will make a difference. The damage has already been done.

The truth is, the men who launched these attacks in the name of Islam were French citizens. They were born and educated in France. They didn’t recently immigrate, and they didn’t import terrorism from a foreign land where they were raised. They were radicalized at home, in France. This is why cutting off immigration from North Africa, where most of France’s Muslim population comes from, or other Muslim countries, will not change the strained state of affairs in France among its citizens, or insulate them from further terrorist attacks.

The Kouachi brothers and their accomplice were motivated by religion, as are Islamic terrorists around the world. However, the context in which homegrown western terrorism occurs is important to understand so we can learn from these mistakes. In the case of France, the French Muslim men who join radical Islamist movements often do so in the context of growing up in a country that has never wanted them and whose strong adherence to the principles of Universalism has excluded them from mainstream society.

Fifty Years of Terrible Foreign and Domestic Policy

The divisive atmosphere in France between the Muslim and non-Muslim populations has been the work of over 50 years of catastrophic foreign and domestic policy toward France’s former colonies in North Africa. The colonies’ struggles for independence and the ensuing waves of immigration to France set the stage for a disaffected Muslim diaspora that feels at home neither in France nor in the Maghreb.

The divisive atmosphere in France between the Muslim and non-Muslim populations has been the work of over 50 years of catastrophic foreign and domestic policy toward France’s former colonies in North Africa.

French colonial rule in North Africa was always treated as a “civilizing mission” to help the natives. In reality, it minimized the Arab and Berber populations, relegated their languages to secondary and tertiary status, and brought French wealth and secular society to North Africa as a “civilized” alternative to the established Muslim way of life. The battles for independence in the 1950s and ’60s were bloody, brutal, and full of deceit by both France and the emerging North African governments. Algeria was by far the worst and most volatile of these battles, with a high body count and terrible reports of systematic torture on both sides.

More than half a century later, the memories of these events still echo in the French collective mind, although France’s mainstream culture tries to ignore it. In 2012, on the fiftieth anniversary of Algerian independence, there was little reporting on the events that led to an independent Algeria. One radio station applauded itself for reporting on it at all, although their coverage was paltry. Bringing up the war can be hazardous. Friends of mine have been warned in France to be careful talking about Algeria because the French will not take kindly to it; they would rather pretend it simply didn’t happen.

Economic Importation and Segregation in France

The children of North African immigrants are also aware—and wary of—of this history. While teaching in Montpellier in 2012, I brought up the Algerian war to my college students as a loose parallel to the United States’ involvement in the Vietnam War and the controversy it caused at home. Some of my students from Algerian and Moroccan families exchanged shocked looks. They couldn’t believe that a professor was taking the Algerian war seriously and bringing it up in a university setting. It was startling for my students to hear it compared to the Vietnam War. I had done something perhaps none of them had witnessed before: I questioned the infallibility of France’s colonial presence in the Maghreb.

By pretending that all its citizens are exactly the same, France ignores the differences that do exist and require attention.

The decades after independence brought several waves of emigration from the Maghreb to France. Workers came to reinvigorate the labor force that had been depleted in World War II. In the 1960s and ’70s, immigrants lived in shantytowns on the outskirts of major cities. Later, low-income housing was constructed after more families arrived and the immigrant population swelled. Tenements were built far outside downtown areas and always at the end of public transportation lines. These “suburbs,” the banlieues, are much more like our inner cities in the United States. Unemployment is high, the standard of living is low, and police checks are frequent. Immigrants are geographically separated from mainstream France—out of sight, out of mind.

The North African immigrant community also experiences a sort of metaphorical segregation. Since the French Revolution, France’s society and political structure has been based on the principles of Universalism, wherein all citizens are considered the same before the state. While this may sound sensible, it means the French government can’t acknowledge any differences between citizens. For example, it has refused to the sign the E.U.’s Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Their reason for doing so is that it would require acknowledging that France has minority ethnic groups, which would violate the tenets of Universalism. By pretending that all its citizens are exactly the same, France ignores the differences that do exist and require attention. In doing so, they have created a much greater divide than there otherwise would have been.

Equality before the state requires individuals to approach the government as secular citizens, including when in government buildings and schools. This is what sparked the Muslim headscarf controversies in France that culminated in banning headscarves in schools. Whereas in America we have laws that protect the freedom of individuals to express their religious beliefs, in France laws protect people’s right not to have to see others express their religion in public. Religion, according to the state, belongs firmly in the private sphere. This is yet another way in which France isolates its massive Muslim population, whose families come from countries where Islam, far from being a private matter, is the state religion.

Although minorities should not be singled out by the state, neither should they be ignored. Refusing to acknowledge that they exist leads to alienation and the creation of parallel communities—just as Britain’s staunch multiculturalism has done. Last year it was revealed that British social workers in Rotherham had been ignoring a problem of chronic gang rapes perpetrated by Pakistani Muslim men against more than 1,400 young girls. The social workers said they failed to report the crimes out of fear of being accused of racism. While Britain refuses to require any sort of assimilation into British society, France tries to whitewash its citizens to make them blend together, requiring absolute assimilation. Both systems produce a similar result: disaffection and isolation from the mainstream culture.

The Middle Ground Between Forcing and Ignoring Assimilation

America should take note of this dilemma when it comes to immigration, assimilation, and the Muslim community in the United States. We must find a middle ground between the extreme multiculturalism of Britain, where the state allows parallel Sharia courts to mete out justice according to Islamic law, and French Universalism, which forbids even asking questions about religion, ethnicity, and race in its official census.

Because radical Islam considers itself at war with the West, it appeals to young people who want to reject the Western culture and society they feel has rejected them.

For the most part, America has struck a healthy balance. We require some level of assimilation but also insist on the separation of church and state while allowing individual differences and protecting religious liberties. However, we should be on alert, because this balance can easily slide.

France has made a series of dangerous mistakes that immigration reform can’t fix. They have alienated a community of Muslims five million strong, and the youths in this community are doubling down on their Muslim identity. Because radical Islam considers itself at war with the West, it appeals to young people who want to reject the Western culture and society they feel has rejected them. So they turn to a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, often finding their inspiration in prisons, where Arab youths are frequently radicalized. As the French prime minister to the U.S. said in an interview this week, this gives them a raison d’être.

Turning toward religion as a salve to social injustice is not a given. In the 1980s, second-generation North Africans tried to blend in with mainstream French culture. They wanted to get into clubs, to drink, and to dance. They just wanted to be “French.” Today, things are different. There has been a revitalization of religion in the banlieues, in part because of the prominence of Islam in the public eye since September 11. Muslim youth in France are practicing religion more devoutly and more openly than their parents’ generation. It is a sort of provocation, a statement of rejecting French—that is, western—culture and society.

France is an example of what happens when you think you can just build tenement housing on the outskirts of the city and throw away the key.

Islamic terrorism is a worldwide phenomenon and occurs regardless of the marginal status of its practitioners. However, France is uniquely positioned to have problems with homegrown terrorism because of an unwillingness to engage its Muslim population or even to attempt to integrate them partially. It is difficult to assimilate people whose existence you refuse to acknowledge.

What’s done is done in France and it may be too late to repair it. But it’s not too late for the rest of us to learn from these mistakes. France is an example of what happens when you ignore a problem, when you think you can just build tenement housing on the outskirts of the city and throw away the key. This breeds contempt, radicalization, and, among a growing number of French Muslims, loyalty to something greater than the state.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/01/16/how-france-grew-its-own-terrorists/,2015-01-16
"Before CAIR Lectures Republicans, It Should Stop Supporting Terrorists","The Council on American-Islamic Relations, which recently tweeted that “American Sniper” Chris Kyle was a “hate-filled killer” and that those who think he’s a hero are “simplistic patriots,” has issued an open letter to 2016 Republican presidential candidates on tolerance and “how to avoid past mistakes other Republican candidates have made when making remarks about and engaging with the American Muslim community.”

The letter says the 2012 Republican presidential primaries were marked by “Islamophobic” statements from nearly all the candidates.

Promoting Islamophobia and false anti-Muslim conspiracies to prove conservative bona fides and attract support from the GOP base in a presidential bid is a failing strategy.



Making anti-Muslim remarks will not get a campaign the ‘good’ attention it needs to make a run for president. Such remarks do not go unnoticed by watchdogs and turn away independent or undecided voters.

CAIR advises Republican candidates to invest their resources “in courting Muslim voters as they do other minority communities. The American Muslim community is well positioned to impact election results in key swing states such as Ohio, Virginia and Florida.”

It is well-known that the majority of the American Muslim vote went to President George W. Bush in the close 2000 election. However, by the 2012 general election, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney only received a single digit percentage of the Muslim vote. This significant drop in Muslim support for the Republican Party can be attributed to unwillingness from Republican candidates to engage with Muslim communities, increased adoption of Islamophobic rhetoric and support for discriminatory legislation that targets foreign law, a dog whistle to the conservative base for ‘sharia law.’

The letter accuses Republicans of being “overwhelmingly responsible” for “pushing anti-Islam prejudice during past elections” and that Republican gains in the Muslim community are only possible if “sincere effort is made.” CAIR advises Republicans not to give “a platform to Islamophobia” and to hold “accountable those candidates that do use their campaigns to foster anti-Muslim sentiment.”

CAIR Isn’t Exactly Trustworthy

When it comes to giving advice about “Islamophobia,” CAIR is the last organization Republicans—or anyone, for that matter—should listen to. That’s because CAIR has been listed as a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has categorized any organization critical of Islamism and Islamist extremism as either outright promoting hatred of Muslims or supporting anti-Islam themes, and has been active in shutting down free speech in the name of Islamophobia.

Last year, the United Arab Emirates listed CAIR as one of 83 proscribed terrorist organizations.

Last year, the UAE’s ministerial cabinet listed CAIR as one of 83 proscribed terrorist organizations. This was unexpected because CAIR and the UAE have had cooperative ties, with the UAE praising CAIR for its work and CAIR raising funds for the UAE. Additionally, the UAE has been known to promote Islamism, so it would seem odd for the UAE to label CAIR, which supports the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, a terrorist organization.

The categorization, however, makes sense when you consider that the Islamist movement is fractured. As Daniel Pipes of the Middle East Forum writes at National Review, “Sunnis fight Shiites; advocates of violence struggle against those working within the system; modernizers do battle against those trying to return to the seventh century; and monarchists confront republicans.”

Even though the Persian Gulf monarchies have worked with the Muslim Brotherhood before, they now see it as a threat, Pipes says. “The Saudi, Emirati, Kuwaiti, and Bharaini rulers now view politicians like Mohamed Morsi of Egypt as their enemies, as they do Hamas and its progeny—including CAIR.”

The real question, though, is whether CAIR should be listed as a terrorist organization. Pipes makes the case that it should. It doesn’t set off bombs, he says, but CAIR does incite and fund terrorism.

Five Reasons CAIR Deserves a Terrorist Designation

Pipes lists five points to prove that CAIR deserves to be on the UAE terror list:

(1) CAIR apologizes for terrorist groups. Even though CAIR has spoken out against the violent acts of Hamas and Hezbollah, it has not denounced the groups themselves as terrorist organizations.

CAIR is connected to Hamas, which the United States has designated as a terrorist organization.

(2) CAIR is connected to Hamas, which the United States has designated as a terrorist organization. “In 1994, CAIR head Nihad Awad publicly declared his support for Hamas; the Holy Land Foundation (HLF), a Hamas front group, contributed $5,000 to CAIR; in turn, CAIR exploited the 9/11 attacks to raise money for HLF; and, this past August, demonstrators at a CAIR-sponsored rally in Florida proclaimed ‘We are Hamas!’”

(3) CAIR settled a lawsuit that accused it of being a terrorist-supporting front organization. “CAIR initiated a libel lawsuit in 2004 over five statements by a group called Anti-CAIR. But two years later, CAIR settled the suit with prejudice (meaning that it cannot be reopened), implicitly acknowledging the accuracy of Anti-CAIR’s assertions,” which included that CAIR is partially funded by terrorists, terrorist-supporting individuals, groups, and countries; it has proven links to and was founded by Islamic terrorists; and it “actively supports terrorists and terrorist supporting groups and nations.”

(4) Within CAIR’s organization are individuals who are accused of terrorism. “At least seven board members or staff at CAIR have been arrested, denied entry to the U.S., or were indicted on or pled guilty to (or were convicted of) terrorist charges.”

(5) CAIR has been named by federal prosecutors “as ‘unindicted co-conspirators and/or joint venturers’ in a criminal conspiracy to support Hamas financially. In 2008, the FBI ended contacts with CAIR because of concern about its continuing terrorist ties.”

So a Terrorist Front Group Wants to Shut Down Critics

While CAIR has shown support for terrorist organizations even while speaking out against violence, it has spent much of its money and energy going after so-called Islamic hate groups and individuals in the United States. In its recent report, “Legislating Fear: Islamophobia and Its Impact in the United States,” CAIR outlines its vision for America and the groups it sees standing in the way of that vision.

CAIR says the ‘Tea Party defeat’ in recent elections is cause for optimism that Islamophobia is on the decline.

Its goal is to establish an environment in America in which “being Muslim carries a positive connotation and Islam has an equal place among many faiths in America’s pluralistic society.” Indicators of achieving that vision include Islam having 75 percent or higher favorability rating among the general public, a person’s Muslim faith being considered an asset in private employment and public service, politicians welcoming and seeking public support from Americans of the Islamic faith, and anyone associated with “anti-Muslim movements or rhetoric” being determined unfit to seek the privilege of public service.

CAIR divides organizations and individuals who are standing in the way of those goals into two groups. The “Inner Core” comprises organizations or individuals “whose primary purpose is to promote prejudice against or hatred of Islam and Muslims and whose work regularly demonstrates Islamophobic themes.” The “Outer Core” groups are those who might not appear to be promoting prejudice against or hatred of Islam and Muslims, but their work “regularly demonstrates or supports Islamophobic themes.”

Thirty-seven groups make up the Inner Core, including ACT! for America, American Freedom Law Center, David Horowitz Freedom Center, Florida Family Association, Jihad Watch, Middle East Forum, and Tennessee Freedom Coalition.

Thirty-two groups make up the Outer Core, including American Center for Law and Justice, American Family Association, Christian Broadcasting Network, Eagle Forum, Fox News, Liberty Counsel, Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, National Review, The Mark Levin Show, The Rush Limbaugh Show, The Savage Nation, Washington Times, and Worldnet Daily.

While the Tea Party is not on this list of Islamophobes, CAIR implicates Tea Parties in its report by saying the “Tea Party defeat” in recent elections is cause for optimism that Islamophobia is on the decline.

Notice Whom CAIR Hates and Loves

The report also praises some for pushing back against these “Islamophobes.” On CAIR’s “praise list” is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for speaking out following “Islamophobic criticism of his nomination of Sohail Mohammed as a New Jersey Superior Court judge.” At that time, Christie said, “This Sharia law business is just crap. It’s just crazy, and I’m tired of dealing with the crazies.”

The report quotes Rolling Stone, which reported that Fox News Channel President Roger Ailes might have a ‘personal “paranoia” in regards to Muslims.’

Also on CAIR’s praise list is Political Research Associates, Washington Monthly, Wired, CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360°,” and National Public Radio, as well as People for the American Way, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the Center for American Progress. All of these groups are lauded for promoting pluralism and pushing back against “Islamophobes” such as former Rep. Allen West and Herman Cain, both of whom the report accuses as inciting Islamophobia because of statements critical of Islam. West, in particular, is considered suspect by CAIR because he works with Inner Core group ACT! and has praised its leader as “incredible.”

The CAIR report finds Fox News particularly troubling, citing the Public Religion Research Institute, which made the following points about the network:

“There is a strong correlation between trusting Fox News and negative views of Islam and Muslims. This pattern is evident even among conservative political and religious groups.”

“Among all Republicans, nearly two-thirds (63 percent) say that Islam is at odds with American values. Among Republicans who most trust Fox News, more than 7-in-10 (72 percent) believe that Islam is at odds with American values.”

“Among Republicans who most trust other news sources, less than half (49 percent) say Islam is at odds with American values, making their attitudes roughly similar to the general population.”

“A similar effect can be seen in beliefs about American Muslims and the establishment of Shari’a law. Nearly 6-in-10 (58 percent) Republicans who most trust Fox News believe that American Muslims are trying to establish Shari’a law in the U.S. Again, the attitudes of Republicans who most trust other news sources look similar to the general population (33 percent and 30 percent respectively).”

The report quotes Rolling Stone, which reported that Fox News Channel President Roger Ailes might have a “personal ‘paranoia’ in regards to Muslims.”

Terrorist Supporters Shout Down Free Speech

Along with publishing these kinds of warnings about Islamophobia both in Inner and Outer Core groups, CAIR is active in shutting down the speech of anyone it has labeled anti-Muslim. CAIR was recently successful in getting a Federal Bureau of Investigation representative to withdraw from speaking at a Texas event called “Domestic Jihad & Isis,” hosted by St. Mary’s University’s Center for Terrorism Law in San Antonio, that was initially sponsored by ACT! for America. After CAIR’s protest, the event dropped ACT! as a sponsor and one of its speakers, John Guandolo, whom CAIR said was an “anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist.”

CAIR is active in shutting down the speech of anyone it has labeled anti-Muslim.

When Fox News terrorism expert Steven Emerson apologized for falsely claiming that a city in the United Kingdom is “totally Muslim, where non-Muslims just simply don’t go in,” CAIR called on FOX News to get rid of him.

“Fox News’ continued use of Islamophobes, such Steven Emerson and many others like him, only serves to harm the network’s reputation and to promote hostility toward Islam and ordinary American Muslims,” said CAIR Department to Monitor and Combat Islamophobia Director Corey Saylor.

CAIR has called on Oklahoma Sen. Kyle Loveless to drop a bill that states school districts will incur “no liability as a result of providing an elective course in the objective study of religion or the Bible.”

“The district and others across Oklahoma have shown interest in having such a class, as an elective, and I am just wanting to keep them from feeling threatened of lawsuit or from not offering a class such as this,” Loveless said in an email to The Huffington Post. CAIR opposes the bill, saying it is unconstitutional and a “dangerous encroachment into the separation of church and state.”

Dear CAIR: Criticizing Sharia Law and Islamism Isn’t Hate Speech

In 2013, CAIR sought to stop Brigitte Gabriel of ACT! for America from speaking at an high school in Minnesota. “As Little Falls High School would not, and should not allow a racist or an anti-Semitic speaker to use its facilities, we ask that school and district officials apply the same standard to an anti-Muslim speaker,” said CAIR-MN Executive Director Lori Saroya. “By allowing the school to host this event, the perception is that the school is endorsing hate speech and anti-Muslim views. This perception could have a negative impact on the learning environment for Muslim students.”

‘Almost all of [CAIR’s]members are theocratic Muslims who reject secularism and want to establish Islamic states.’

If there could be an “Undesirable No. 1” in CAIR’s anti-Islamophobic campaign, it would be Gabriel (with Pipes a close second). She is the founder of ACT! and one of the leading terrorism experts in the world. When asked by FrontPage Mag in 2010 why CAIR has continued its relentless attacks against her, Gabriel said the organization has taken statements she has made out of context to “create a distorted caricature” of what she believes and how she defines “the threat of radical Islam.”

Considering the list of suspects in its Inner and Outer Core, the creation of a distorted caricature seems to extend to others beyond Gabriel. Most of these groups and individuals oppose “radical Islam” and are critical of Sharia law and Islamism (not Islam). Kamal Nawash, head of Free Muslims Against Terrorism, has said that CAIR condemns terrorism on the surface, but it endorses an ideology that fosters extremism, adding that “almost all of their members are theocratic Muslims who reject secularism and want to establish Islamic states.”

As Republican candidates gear up for the GOP primary and then the general election, caricatures by CAIR are the last thing they need to consider. Instead of folding under the pressure of political correctness, GOP candidates need to make a stand along with moderate Muslims who reject Islamism in all its forms. If CAIR wants to call that Islamophobic, so be it.

"There’s Nothing ‘Random’ About Islamic Terrorism, Mr. President","During his sycophantic conversation with President Barack Obama, Vox’s Matthew Yglesias poses a “question” that I imagine reflects the opinion of many on the Left these days: “Do you think the media sometimes overstates the level of alarm people should have about terrorism and this kind of chaos, as opposed to a longer-term problem of climate change and epidemic disease?”

Obama:

Look, the point is this: my first job is to protect the American people. It is entirely legitimate for the American people to be deeply concerned when you’ve got a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris.

The president, in his own peripatetic way, ends up concurring with Yglesias’ appraisal of the world. Terrorism, the violent arm of a religious movement that threatens innocent lives and liberal ideals on every continent and people of every faith (including other Muslims), is entirely overblown when compared to a slight variation in the climate or some highly debatable assumptions about the future of human progress.

And, as you all know, there is a dearth of chilling stories about climate change in the media.

At least Obama was kind enough to acknowledge that Americans had some reason to be concerned about “a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks.” As it turns out, these random people who got themselves shot in a “deli” in Paris happen to have been Jewish. The random people getting themselves shot at a satirical newspaper happened to have mocked Mohammad. And those 10 random people who were murdered and had their churches burned down by mobs in Niger last week, well they happened to be Christian folks.

It’s likely that all these victims would – with astonishing precision – be able to pinpoint both the religious affiliation and rationale of those responsible for their deaths. President Obama refuses to do the same. For the president, acknowledging who the victims of Islamic terrorism are means acknowledging the motives that drive it. Recognizing what drives a terrorist undermines the progressive theory that says this movement is merely a byproduct of shiftlessness, criminality and poverty rather than a movement driven by faith and political goals.

Gone are the days when were allowed to make (appropriate) distinctions between peaceful and radical Islam. Now we’re supposed to accept that these string of events are executed by aimless zealots, detached from any tradition or faith. Random. We are supposed to believe that this problem can be dealt with, as the president notes, in “the same way a big city mayor’s got to cut the crime rate down if he wants that city to thrive.”

Dealing with political Islam is just like getting rid of graffiti and waiting for gentrification. You know, if only Saudi Arabia had a few extra bucks laying around, we’d rid the world of all of these delinquents.

For Jews, there is another reality that wishful thinking can’t change. According to Pew, there is rampant anti-Semitism in the Islamic world. Not only among radical factions, but everywhere. In moderate Jordan, 97 percent of the folks unfavorable view of Jews (not Zionists, Jews). The ADL found that 74 percent of the folks surveyed in the Middle East and North Africa had anti-Semitic attitudes. The number was 24 percent in Western Europe and 34 percent in Eastern Europe. Not all of this aversion to Jews is equality vitriolic or dangerous, of course. But it is undeniable that in Europe there is increasing violence, and much of it comes from Muslims.

All of which makes Obama’s politically correct construing of events even more disturbing.

Put it this way: the president is more inclined to call out Christian crimes against the Rhineland Jews of 1096 than Islamic crimes against Jews today. He’d rather dissemble for the sake of political correctness, using heavy-handed historical comparisons that aren’t only irrelevant to contemporary discussions about religious violence, but a stretch even if we discussed them in the context of history.

It should go without saying that Americans deserve a more accurate conversation about the threats they face. Maintaining precision of language throughout a long interview is probably tough. So I imagine Obama’s liberal use of “folks” wasn’t meant in a dismiss way. I don’t believe he has a problem with Jews – though, as Jonathan Tobin puts it, he sure has a blind spot. And his contention that terrorism isn’t tied to any specific religion comports well with things he’s said before. There was little chance the president would say the words “Islamic terrorists” – actually, “Islam” doesn’t make an appearance at all– to strip the conversation of a reality. But there was nothing “random” or senseless about these events. The message was sent. It’s why French soldiers have to stand outside synagogues and satirical newspapers today.

It’s also why, incidentally, a random bunch of folks with a nuclear weapon might make the Jews even more nervous.

"Chris Kyle, ‘Savages,’ And Moral Language In A Terrorist Age","America finds itself squared with an enemy in ISIS that utilizes tactics one can only call evil and nightmarish. It crucifies, beheads, and burns its enemies alive. The recent video of a Jordanian pilot writhing in flames, for example, has sparked moral outrage, and rightfully so.

It’s in this context that the “American Sniper” film has proven one of the most culturally explosive films in years. In particular, we’ve heard much discussion of Chris Kyle’s use of the word “savages” to describe the terrorists he fought overseas—and which he would certainly call ISIS, or the Islamic State, if he hadn’t tragically been killed. Kyle has been routinely criticized for drawing a sharp line between good and evil.

Kyle wrote the following of the terrorists he opposed in his autobiography (also entitled “American Sniper”):

Savage, despicable evil. That’s what we were fighting in Iraq. That’s why a lot of people, myself included, called the enemy ‘savages.’ There really was no other way to describe what we encountered there (4).

Of his kill count, Kyle wrote this:

The number is not important to me. I only wish I had killed more. Not for bragging rights, but because I believe the world is a better place without savages out there taking American lives. Everyone I shot in Iraq was trying to harm Americans or Iraqis loyal to the new government (4).

These comments—and others—have drawn a great deal of attention since the film debuted in December 2014. The most serious critique regarding these passages is that Kyle has dehumanized his enemy and, in doing so, has justified even harsher retaliation at the hands of American military forces. This is a substantial charge that we believe demands a better answer than it has received. Our response is threefold.

Chris Kyle Did Not Demonize Anyone

He called evil what it was. Like virtually all American combatants in Iraq, Kyle saw the opposing side commit evil acts, over and over again. He watched a mother put her child in mortal jeopardy by pulling a grenade pin. He saw the enemy use children for shields. Those he fought frequently took drugs to ramp themselves up for combat, and they were driven not by a sense of virtue, but “blood lust,” as Kyle noted.

At one point, Kyle and his unit found the following scene:

In this one house, we heard faint moans as we went down into the basement. There were two men hanging from chains on the wall. One was dead; the other barely there. Both had been severely tortured with electric shock and God knows what else. They were both Iraqi, apparently mentally retarded—the insurgents had wanted to make sure they wouldn’t talk to us, but decided to have a little fun with them first (163-64).

The grisly scene, captured briefly in the cinematic form of “American Sniper,” was beyond words:

The second man died while our corpsman worked on him. There was a black banner on the floor, the kind the fanatics liked to show on their videos when beheading Westerners. There were amputated limbs, and more blood than you can imagine. It was a nasty-smelling place (164).

This is evil in its purest form. It is what Kyle and his fellow Americans were in Iraq to fight. Kyle did not sacrifice his time and energy to stereotype people (even as he has been stereotyped). He traveled far from the comfort and pleasure of home to oppose wickedness and protect the innocent.

Chris Kyle saw evil. He saw savagery. He named it, and for that he is a pariah to the American Left.

Kyle’s Remarks Referred to Behavior, Not Ontology

Kyle said some strong things, to be sure. He notes throughout his autobiography that he struggled with hating the enemy. This is a common experience for soldiers of all sides, and we can be honest about it. It is far from ideal, but this is part of the effect of the fog of war, of trying to kill someone whose goal is to kill you.

A preening minority has focused a great deal of attention on the just exploits of a conscionable soldier and correspondingly little attention on the terrorists who made his sniping necessary.

Kyle was a tough customer. He used rough language and sometimes shot off his mouth. But he wasn’t calling innocent people savages. He also wasn’t speaking to the inherent worth of those he fought. He was referring to insurgents and terrorists who had freely chosen to target civilians and destroy the moral and sociopolitical order of Iraq. They tortured disabled people. They blew up children. They created anarchy and chaos in order to stop the many civic-minded Iraqis who wanted to build a stable society.

The pushback against Kyle is both ironic and instructive. It is ironic because a preening minority has focused a great deal of attention on the just exploits of a conscionable soldier and correspondingly little attention on the terrorists who made his sniping necessary. It is instructive because the West has largely lost any sense of martial virtue. Now, we are taught, war is wrong, and anyone who partakes of it is equally implicated. There is no honor in war. So say those who depend upon soldiers to be able to advocate their opinions (precious few of whom have gone without Wi-Fi for a day in their lives, let alone faced an actual terrorist).

This is nonsense of rare vintage. Despite what one cloying, under-performing “war” movie after another has alleged (“In the Valley of Elah” and “Grace Is Gone” are just two of a closet-full of titles currently swimming in mothballs), good and evil are real forces in the world. It is right to oppose evil. The Nazis embraced savagery, and killed innocents. They became savages in their behavior. So do terrorists of the modern era. They more than merit the title of “savage.”

To call evil “savagery” is not to justify harsher, capricious treatment in return. Our position requires consistency and fair application. Were U.S. soldiers to ever act in similar barbarism, they, too, would be acting savagely. America has rules of engagement, a well-defined system of accountability, and it subjects offenders to trials in courts of law. This is moral realism in practice. Borders do not determine good and evil. American militancy is not barbarism, and our martial code both deplores it and guards against it.

Terrorists of the modern era more than merit the title of ‘savage.’

Our argument suggests that as humans deploy or embrace attitudes and actions that are intrinsically evil, they become further enslaved to sub-human irrationalities. This adopted madness mars the image of God we all naturally bear by a willful descent into irrational evil. Despite what some voices within the Christian tradition have alleged, this descent reveals that language invoking “savagery” is not wrong. Labeling an enemy a “savage” by virtue of their brutal, cruel tactics does not deny their ontology as image bearers of God. It does describe vicious, primitive, and barbaric acts as a descent into animalistic rage.It is not our use of such language that dehumanizes terrorist combatants. They willingly choose to become dehumanized by failing to resist either internal or external pressures to cooperate with evil. We are thankful that many understand this devolution. For example, a Princeton scholar and a diverse constituency recently released a petition that called the actions of ISIS “unconscionable acts of barbarism” and called for U.S. intervention.

Christian Theology Gives a Vocabulary of Rebuke

Christians have always been able to call evil by its first name, because Jesus Christ did the very same. Consider the following passage from the Bible: “But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, ‘You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance’ (Matthew 3:7-8 ESV).”

Kyle stands shoulder-to-shoulder with many figures in the Christian tradition who have indicted the evil of the human heart.

Jesus also called his opponents by this term in Matthew 3:7 and 23:33. His apostles did not hold back, either. Peter called false teachers “irrational animals” and “accursed children” (2 Peter 2:12, 14). Paul thundered to the Galatian church, “I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!” (Galatians 5:12) These biblical figures made such strong pronouncements because they knew that wicked people existed. They recognized the church would lose its way if these false teachers were not opposed and the gospel of grace clarified. The stakes were too high for politesse.

What does all this have to do with Chris Kyle? He was not Jesus by a long shot. He, like every one of us, was imperfect. But he stands shoulder-to-shoulder with many figures in the Christian tradition who have indicted the evil of the human heart. We think of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who famously said, “The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?”

Solzhenitsyn’s witness won’t allow us to perform the amoral sleight-of-hand perfected by our sitting president, in which we condemn atrocities but fail to use the “e” word (“evil,” for the presidentially influenced). Good and evil exists within each of us. Without divine assistance and the cultivation of moral virtue, the descent into brutality and evil exhibited by a foreign enemy could easily sweep over each of us.

Chris Kyle Deserves Honor for His Moral Heroism

We find ourselves in a weakened age. Much of manhood has been carved out. Little of it is left. Part of what our culture has lost as a result is the moral discourse associated with virtue, and traditionally with manly virtue. We are not allowed to use black-and-white moral terms today.

The loss of our moral language leaves us a nation without a soul.

At best, we feel endless pressure to nuance and qualify and back-track. At worst, we offer vacuous moralisms about the messiness of war meant to indict each side’s guilt. We are losing our ability to make moral judgments, because moral judgments can only be expressed with cold, hard, right-and-wrong words.

The loss of our moral language leaves us a nation without a soul. Occasionally, however, a courageous person shouts so loud that he or she cannot immediately be silenced. The moral certitude of this voice is so strong, so unusual, that for a glorious moment, the censors of society are struck dumb. For a time, before he was cruelly cut down, Kyle filled this role, in his rough-and-tumble way. He did the unthinkable: he used language that was irrevocably moral.

That, alongside his courage and proficiency in battle, renders him something more than an American sniper. It renders him an American hero.

Using Doublespeak To Describe Islamist Terrorism Blinds Us To Reality,"After the Charlie Hebdo massacres in France last month, we were again reminded of the timidity of our public leaders in their refusal to look the roots of Islamist terrorism in the face. After initial condemnations of those murderous acts, public figures and the media frantically began a campaign of insisting that there was no connection between the murders and any branch of Islam, extreme or otherwise. Just recently, Obama claimed ignorance as to what ideology was responsible for the immolation of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh at the hands of this Islamic State (ISIS). One of the ways in which this stubborn denial of reality is expressing itself is linguistically.

The Obama administration has made it clear that it will not use the term “Islamic terrorism,” or the more widely accepted “Islamist terrorism,” which acknowledges that terrorism done in the name of Islam belongs to only one of many branches of the religion. Rather than using either of these phrases, they are opting for “violent extremism.” This was demonstrated in Josh Earnest’s announcement after the Charlie Hebdo killings that the administration would convene a “Summit on Countering Violent Extremism” this February. A descriptive term, Islamist terrorism, is being replaced with a less-specific substitute. But what does using euphemisms actually do to how we view the topic at hand?

Use Bland Words to Discuss Touchy Ideas

When a subject is deemed too sensitive or has the potential of being offensive to politicians, news organizations or academics will blame the word or phrase used to describe said touchy topic. Rather than engage the issue straight on, they pretend that the real culprit is the use of “nasty” language. If only people would stop using derogatory words, the negative feelings behind them will fade. So they come up with a new word. This is a form of linguistic prescriptivism that the politically correct try to micromanage. Rather than prescribing “proper” grammar, they tell us what are “appropriate” ways of discussing certain ideas.

Rather than engage the issue straight on, they pretend the real culprit is the use of ‘nasty’ language.

In the case of “Islamist terrorism,” the phrase has not taken on the same offensive connotation as words like “retarded,” which was once used to describe someone with mental disabilities. This phrase is instead being banned because of what it uncomfortably implies about the world. Obama is concerned that saying “Islamist terrorism” will reinforce negative stereotypes about the Muslim faith that some hold. He fears that acknowledging any link between Islam and terrorism will lead people to permanently fuse the two, and furthermore will violate the laws of multiculturalism. Despite his concerns, it is not a term that is currently being used to offend. It is being used to describe.

There is no doubt that words can become loaded with strong negative connotations. Words that describe a race or ethnicity can quickly become offensive, and therefore people seek another option. But forcing people to use a substitute for words that do not yet carry such connotations only changes how they view things to a certain extent, and it ultimately depends on how they viewed it in the first place.

The Effects of Codifying Speech Crimes

The target population for word substitutions is presumably those who are using said word derogatorily. However, given the fairly arbitrary nature of words (man’s best friend is “dog” in English and “chien” in French), changing the label will most likely not affect the opinions of people who already have concerns about the relationship between Islam and the slew of attacks and bombings happening around the world. “Violent extremism” will just come to be understood as code for “Islamist terrorism.” It will do little to affect how this part of society views the matter.

By refusing to utter the word ‘Islamist,’ people can make-believe about the world.

On the other hand, insisting on changing something’s name is not without effect. The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis claims that the language we use, while not dictating our thoughts, does influence them. This hypothesis has taken a lot heat for being linguistically discriminatory. Nevertheless, it is often used to defend the need for politically correct speech, based on the idea that if we change the words we use we will also change the way we view the topic. This practice of language censorship can be seen on campuses across the country. However, another outcome of this tactic is that rather than changing the way we see things for the better, linguistic prescriptivism may blind us to reality.

It can lull those who wish to be in denial about violence in the name of Islam into a false sense of security about the reality they have constructed around themselves. This is a reality wherein there is no more violence done today in the name of Islam than any other religion—and, more to the point, that these terrorists are not motivated by religion but by a vague thing called “extremism.” Using the term “violent extremism” in lieu of “Islamic terrorism” crucially fails to acknowledge that in order to be an “extremist” you must be extreme about something. You can’t be an extremist about nothing.

By refusing to utter the word “Islamist,” people can make-believe about the world. The more they exclude “Islamism” or “Islamist terrorism” from their lexicon, the less credence they will give to the possibility that groups like ISIS are in fact motivated by religion. The very serious danger in this is that without naming violence done in the name Islam for what it is, it will be extremely difficult to make any headway in combating these groups, or their recruitment tactics.

The Language Change Deliberately Creates Confusion

In one sense words are unimportant in that whether we say “desk,” “bureau,” or “مكتب” we are all referring to the piece of furniture at which we do our work. However, when it comes to more sober issues that have to do with worldview, philosophy, or religion the issue becomes more complicated. Words, and more importantly, naming, do matter. All languages change and morph over time due to differences in regional and class usage, and to contact with other languages. But this is a different kind of language change. This is about trying to mask or alter reality by changing the language we use to describe it. It is intentional obfuscation.

This is about trying to mask or alter reality by changing the language we use to describe it. It is intentional obfuscation.

Writers like Michael McGough sympathize with the Obama administration’s verbal substitution, saying that it is done in an effort to avoid people unfairly equating Islam with violence. He argues, “That the president is being diplomatic doesn’t mean he’s in denial.” McGough further claims that the Right is “obsessed” with this issue and cites as evidence the loud complaining after the administration labeled the Fort Hood shootings “workplace violence” instead of an act of Islamist terrorism.

First, it is not at all clear that Obama is in anything but denial about the dangers of radical Islam and the seriousness of the combination of extremism with religion. Second, McGough’s dismissal of the issue by condemning it as just another conservative obsession is alarming. He thinks the mislabeling of the Fort Hood shooting is utterly unimportant, belying that he doesn’t understand the importance of words. Denying that Major Hassan murdered his coworkers as an act of jihad makes it impossible to come to terms with the sources, realities, and repercussions of the problem.

The Obama administration wants to protect the American people from forming their own opinions on Islam, or factions of Islam, based on the facts of the world around them. However, acknowledging that Islamist terrorism is a real threat and danger, and has something to do with one interpretation of Islam, is not Islamophobic. Nor does it condone true Islamaphobia.

The Obama administration wants to protect the American people from forming their own opinions on Islam, or factions of Islam, based on the facts of the world around them.

Once the slippery slope of euphemism begins it is hard to stop. Soon even the phrase “violent extremism” will become unacceptable and offensive. I can imagine a (very) near future where media outlets, which already tacitly defend the use of violence by groups like Hamas as necessitated by Israeli “occupation,” will find the phrase “violent extremism” offensive. They will claim that the violence is in no way an extreme reaction to a dire situation. It is, rather, a rational move for self-preservation and the fight for justice. They will self-righteously suggest using terms like “violent justice” or “violence for peace” or some other nightmarish Orwellian neologism.

The administration is not wrong to point out that violent extremism takes many forms and that Islamism is not our only concern. However, it is disingenuous, especially in the weeks after the attacks in Paris and amidst the horrific violence of ISIS, to pretend that the world is equally assailed by extremists of all shapes and sizes. This linguistic sidestepping is an effort to bend reality that on the one hand cannot mask what is really happening, and on the other risks lulling people into a false sense of security regarding the real dangers that we face today.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/02/17/using-doublespeak-to-describe-islamist-terrorism-blinds-us-to-reality/,2015-02-17
Is Islam A Terrorist Religion?,"In a widely-circulated article for The Atlantic, Graeme Wood reported on “our ignorance of the Islamic State” and judged “We have misunderstood the nature of” the group, in part because of “a well-intentioned but dishonest campaign to deny the Islamic State’s medieval religious nature.” Graeme then breathlessly revealed, “The reality is that the Islamic State is Islamic. Very Islamic.” That the group made and actually believed religious claims was, apparently, astonishing.

The same week as the Atlantic story went viral, coincidentally, the Obama administration held a summit at the White House on “violent extremism,” at which all discussion of “Islam” was studiously avoided. The administration’s fundamentalist insistence on political correctness has become a self-parodying punchline.

In truth, the Islamic State’s (ISIS’s) religious nature is banal because it is so obviously true. The Islamic State is difficult to comprehend only for secularists who believe religion is an aberration in the modern world. It isn’t: they are. Ignoring the religious nature of jihadists is the simple arrogance of those who dismiss as “false consciousness” the sincere devotion of the faithful. I read Graeme’s piece and felt like Captain Renault being shocked—shocked!—to find gambling going on in Rick’s Cafe. You’re only shocked if you’ve been deluding yourself for a decade.

But the religious nature of the Islamic State—and of jihadist terrorism generally—feeds into some disturbing chatter I’ve heard among conservative friends and colleagues. People rarely say it publicly, but in private conversations and emails among friends, I’ve heard more mutterings about the problems with “Islam,” about how the Islamic State proves Islam is not a “religion of peace.” I heard someone wonder when we were going to recognize the threat from “them” and start tracking Muslims in America to protect ourselves from their plots.

We are right to dismiss the White House’s pablum as vacuous nonsense. But rejecting one idea does not mean we have to affirm its opposite. It is false that jihadism has nothing to do with Islam; but that does not mean that Islam is nothing but jihadism. The tiresome, politically-correct cliche about the vast majority of Muslims not being terrorists….is true.

I. The Islamic State Is Definitely Muslim

Yes, the Islamic State is “Islamic.” Jihadists use Islamic rhetoric, symbols, and concepts in the construction of their ideology. They endlessly debate fine intricacies of Islamic theology. They direct their arguments at Muslim audiences and seek new recruits from among Muslims. They invoke the Koran, quote the hadiths of Muhammad, and find bases for their beliefs in the jurisprudence of Islamic law. They claim to be Muslims—indeed, the only true Muslims—and they explicitly claim that their religion motivates, inspires, and even commands them to commit their horrific acts of violence. They believe that Islam has a great deal to do with their behavior. Some scholars have argued that the clash between rival interpretations of Islam should be seen as a civil war within the Islamic world—jihadists, Islamists, traditionalists, and reformers all attempting to pull Islam in different directions—in which case jihadism most certainly has a strong, complicated, and important relationship to Islam and its future.

Social scientists who dismiss the religious claims of jihadists, treating religion as epiphenomenal to some other ‘real’ cause, betray a materialist, secularist bias and do not help us understand our enemy.

Scholars and policymakers evade these awkward facts by arguing that jihadists’ religious claims are either false or irrelevant. The first evasion is irrelevant; the second is false. The falsity of jihadist theology has absolutely no bearing its existence as a hostile religious ideology fervently believed in by thousands of well-armed people who wish to harm the United States. Its theological status does not change the threat it poses, nor, necessarily, its ability to find more recruits from within the Islamic world.

And jihadist religious claims are certainly relevant. Success in war depends on knowing your enemy. Social scientists who dismiss the religious claims of jihadists, treating religion as epiphenomenal to some other “real” cause, betray a materialist, secularist bias and do not help us understand our enemy. The secularist view—that jihadism is the product of frustrated rational actors lashing out at their disempowerment in corrupt, poor, repressive societies left behind by globalizing modernity—is true but incomplete, the shallow understanding of secular modernity unable to come to grips with the enduring power of religious identities.

Religion powerfully intermixes with politics in all societies in the world, including the United States—whether it is the religion of Christianity or the religion of Enlightenment secularism. That Islam has become entwined with the politics of countries in which it predominates is unsurprising, and, naturally, has given rise to attempts to construct a coherent political ideology along Islamic lines—what is broadly called “Islamism.” Islamism is the transmutation of Islam into a political ideology. Much as the American founders claimed that civic republicanism was a natural consequence of Protestantism, similarly many Muslims are grappling with the question of what politics flows most naturally from their faith.

Islamism is not necessarily violent nor, always, opposed to majoritarian rule, representative institutions, or elections.

As such, Islamism is not necessarily violent nor, always, opposed to majoritarian rule, representative institutions, or elections. Tunisia’s Enhadda Party is probably the best example of a peaceful Islamist movement that briefly held power after the Arab Spring, and which peacefully conceded defeat in elections in October 2014. Turkey’s Justice and Development Party is a slighter version of a peaceful Islamic movement, although its commitment to political liberalism has been cast in doubt the longer it has held power. Egypt was briefly ruled by the Muslim Brotherhood before the 2013 military coup. Islamist governments are illiberal—but not necessarily violent or threats to U.S. national security.

Jihadism is a variant of Islamism. It is the effort to impose Islamist goals—however defined—by force. Jihadists have found or invented theological justifications to attack their enemies, mostly fellow Muslims, for their impiety or disloyalty to the jihadist cause, leading to the rise of jihadist terrorist and insurgent groups and, occasionally, jihadist governments (including the Taliban and the Iranian regime) and quasi-governmental entities (like the Islamic State and some organizations within Pakistan and Saudi Arabia). Jihadist movements are quite obviously threats to the national security of states they seek to overthrow, many of whom are U.S. allies; they are also threats to their neighbors because of the expansionist drive inherent in jihadist ideology. Jihadist ideology ultimately seeks the dominance of its brand of Islam over the world.

II. Nearly All Muslims Aren’t Jihadists

Religion matters and ideas have consequences. But if we stopped there, we might be tempted to start fearing our Muslim neighbors as a fifth column just waiting to strike when the moment is right. Here is where we need to take counsel from the other side of the debate.

Assume ten million active jihadists worldwide, a wild exaggeration of their true numbers. That is 0.63 percent of all Muslims worldwide.

There are 1.6 billion professing Muslims in the world. If we count up every member of every jihadist group in the world, including al-Qaida, the Islamic State, the Taliban, Boko Haram, al-Shabab, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, Hamas, Hezbollah, Lashkar-i Taiba, and scores of other groups you’ve never heard of, how many would there be? Let’s assume that we could count one million active jihadists in the world, almost certainly an exaggeration of their true numbers.

That would account for 0.06 percent of all Muslims worldwide.

Assume ten million active jihadists worldwide, a wild exaggeration of their true numbers. That is 0.63 percent of all Muslims worldwide.

Assume that there are one hundred million Muslims worldwide who would count themselves as believers, supporters, fellow-travelers, fundraisers, or sympathizers with jihadism, people who would actively give their time, money, and effort to supporting active jihadists. That still leaves 94 percent of the world’s Muslims who neither participate in nor even sympathize with terrorism.

According to a 2013 poll by the Pew Research Center, “Muslims around the world strongly reject violence in the name of Islam,” including overwhelming majorities that reject suicide-bombing, a good proxy measure for support for terrorism. By any reasonable measure, Muslims are not terrorists.

The percentage of Muslims who are terrorists is barely higher than the percentage of Quakers who are terrorists.

Let’s say you went shopping in a very large mall in a cosmopolitan city filled with people from all over. You wanted to know if it was safe. If I told you that 99.5 percent of all shoppers in the mall had no criminal record whatsoever, you should, rationally speaking, feel safe. If, instead, you looked at the mall and declared it to be full of criminals, you would be wrong.

I loathe political correctness for its arrogance, illiberality, and intellectual oppression. So when I say that Muslims are not terrorists, I say that simply on the numbers, as a quantifiable fact. The percentage of Muslims who are terrorists (let’s say it is 0.5 percent) is barely higher than the percentage of Quakers who are terrorists (which I assume is zero).

III. Islam Is a Living Religion

But, comes the rejoinder, Islamic theology is different than Quaker theology. Specific passages in the Koran, hadiths attributed to Muhammad, and much of early Islamic history support the idea that Islam is inherently violent, intolerant, hostile, expansionist, and aggressive. If 99.5 percent of Muslims in the world are not terrorists, that’s because they’re bad Muslims. In this view, the Islamic State is the true embodiment of what Islam actually is, and what all Muslims might become if they woke up to the true calling of their faith.

I’m not an expert in Islamic theology and neither are you, so it is pointless and presumptuous for either of us to get into a debate about what is and isn’t true Islamic theology.

There are a number of problems with this argument, the first of which is that this is exactly the claim the terrorists are making, and I’d hate to play into their propaganda.

Second, I’m not an expert in Islamic theology and neither are you, so it is pointless and presumptuous for either of us to get into a debate about what is and isn’t true Islamic theology. For us to sit here and try to judge which interpretation of Islam, the violent or nonviolent, is truer to the founding words of Islam, strikes me as futile and irrelevant. I doubt we have the ability to make accurate judgments about the supposed essence of Islam. You should immediately disbelieve any “expert” out there who quotes one or two Koranic verses and uses them to make sweeping claims about all Islam. Anyone who does the same with the Bible is rightly dismissed as a crank.

Third, and most importantly, this view commits an error of ontology: it assumes that there is single, objective thing called “Islam” defined exclusively by its theology, and that we can make distinctions between what is true Islam and some things are false Islam based on parsing ancient texts.

The meaning of Islamic theology and Koranic passages change across time and culture as it is interpreted and lived by different people in different times and places.

There is no single thing called “Islam” captured once and for all time in the Koran. “Islam” is a lived religion as much as it is a body of theology; it is a pattern of behavior embodied by 1.6 billion Muslims as much a propositional doctrines expounded by its theologians. The meaning of Islamic theology and Koranic passages change across time and culture as it is interpreted and lived by different people in different times and places. How those 1.6 billion Muslims live should be key to our interpretation of those doctrines and ancient texts.

In other words, there are many versions of Islam. For practical purposes, I simply observe the numbers: in almost every case, the way Muslims have lived “Islam” does not involve terrorism.

IV. But Islam Has Many Other Problems

But my appeal to the “lived religion” of most Muslims invites a final critique of Islam. If we are looking at the broad pattern of behavior of Muslim societies, they may not have a strong tendency to inspire terrorism, but there seems to be a broad pattern of tyranny, oppression, misogyny, poverty, illiteracy, lack of religious freedom, and more. Jihadist violence is, in this view, only the most dramatic and violent manifestation of a deeper pathology. (Not all Muslims are terrorists, but these days an alarmingly high percentage of all terrorists are professing Muslims). The United Nations Arab Human Development Reports have more than adequately documented with high standards of rigor and scholarly objectivity something that we all sense: humanity does not seem to flourish in the heartland of Islam.

Just war is not an excuse for bloodlust. It is, in fact, supposed to be an expression of love.

To the extent that this is true, there may indeed be a problem with “Islam” in all its varieties. Some problems, like the lack of women’s rights and religious freedom, seem to be straightforward implications of widely-accepted, mainstream Islamic theology that privileges male Muslims. Multiculturalists have yet to own up to their hypocrisy when they champion women’s rights and cultural pluralism: most cultures in the world accord women far less respect than ours.

But other problems, like poor governance, corruption, and poverty, are not so obviously a function of Islamic theology. This is where we might start looking for an interdisciplinary explanation for this broad phenomenon, one that integrates both theological study with anthropology and history and political science. There is so much variance across the Islamic world that we should look at the different cultures, histories, politics, and geographies of the Islamic world to begin to explain things. That would be a better response than the Obama administration’s epic ostrich-head-in-the-sand performance, and better than its opposite.

Jihadist violence is a threat to U.S. national security, and we should use all instruments of national power to prevent any jihadist group—including the Taliban, about whom most Americans have conveniently forgotten—from seizing power anywhere. In the film “Fury,” one character tells another that killing Nazis is a “righteous act.” In every just war, such is the case.

But just war is not an excuse for bloodlust. It is, in fact, supposed to be an expression of love. Most of the other problems in Islamic societies are not national security threats. We can, if we wish, safely ignore them. If we choose to pay attention, their plight does not call for our fear or hatred so much as our pity, and our charity.

The Left’s Ugly Israel Freakout,"After years of ginned-up conflict, Barack Obama has finally found a pretext to change the contours of the United States-Israel alliance. Israel’s policies might not be changing, but the administration will “reevaluate” the relationship, anyway.

POLITICO reports that Obama may, among other things, stop shielding Israel from international pressure at the United Nations. So Americans can look forward to joining Sudan or Yemen—feel free to pick any autocratic dump, really—in condemning Jews for living in their historic homeland and relying on democratic institutions rather than a consensus at the United Nation to decide their fate.

So our morally chaotic foreign policy is coming to a predictable climax. At least on this issue. Obama, with no more elections to run, will now use these threats to pressure Israel into compliance on an Iran deal that looks more dangerous every day. That’s not surprising. What is, though, is how self-proclaimed Zionists have co-opted some of the most absurd justifications for throwing Israel to the wolves.

These rationalizations come in familiar flavors. There’s the tough-love crowd. The notion here is that Democrats are the ones who truly have Israel’s “long-term” interests at heart. And because of a deep and abiding love for the Jewish State, Democrats are obliged to support policies that will set Israel straight. Without the stern guidance of lefty columnists, how can we expect one of the most technologically advanced market economies in the world to remain a vibrant democracy?

Others argue, and have been arguing for a long time, that the United States has a moral responsibility to distance itself from Israel right now, because the two nations no longer share ideals about freedom and liberalism.

Support Terror, Criticize Democracy

And if by “nation” they mean “this White House,” it’s probably true. Here’s a refresher on the administration’s moral calculus these days:

Out: Standing by the only democratic Middle East ally.

In: Entering into deals with theocratic terror-sponsoring regimes that will destabilize the entire region, without the consent of the American people.

In: Entering into deals with theocratic terror-sponsoring regimes that will destabilize the entire region, without the consent of the American people.

Sure, Iran’s top ally may be dropping chlorine gas on civilians, but the real problem in the Middle East is the Israel electorate. “The Price Israel Must Pay: We no longer have a Netanyahu problem. We have an Israel problem”—not a Hamas problem, or Fatah problem, not a random-criminals-shooting-folks-in-markets problem, or a lack-of-a-civil-society-in-the-Middle-East problem, but an Israel problem—writes William Saltean over at Slate. If you turn on Obama—which is the only real “problem” here—there is always a steep price.

It is true, for many Democrats this is about Israel, not any one politician. But the irrational hatred of Benjamin Netanyahu sure does propel things. Take this piece that strings together an array of Obama-era mythologies about Israel by Jonathan Chait:

Netanyahu is expected to walk back his denunciation of the two-state solution, which he made in unequivocal terms. Here Netanyahu is reprising tactics employed for years by Yasser Arafat, who would issue maximal demands in Arabic and follow them with conciliatory remarks to the foreign press. Netanyahu may be best understood as Israel’s Arafat — a master of nationalist politics, yet also disastrously lacking any strategic vision, and able to survive only at the deep and possibly fatal cost to his own people’s long-term aspirations.

The above paragraph begins with an half-truth, transitions to a baseless claim, and then ends with preposterous comparison. Netanyahu’s statement about the Palestinian state came with a clear stipulation: there can be no two-state solution today because conditions in Palestinian society—a society rife with radicalism, bigotry, and corruption—will almost surely produce another radical Islamic state next door. This is an uncomfortable reality, but it is a reality for any prime minister.

Of course, the Arafat analogy is particularly pernicious, not only because it is untrue, but because it compares an elected prime minister of Israel, a man who represents a government that is formed with consent of the people (including many Arabs), with an autocrat and founding father of modern-day terrorism who, on many occasions, killed or targeted Americans. A person who believes this is a clever point of comparison might best be understood as a person who’s lost his sense of moral perspective about the situation.

The argument these American journalists are making is that Obama has a better grasp of the long-term needs of a Jewish homeland than the people who live there.

But even if we take Chait’s comparison in the narrowest possible terms, it still doesn’t work. Arafat was offered a deal to create a Palestinian state. Arab intermediaries and the American delegation begged him to accept this offer because they knew there would likely never be one as conciliatory. But he refused. Netanyahu has never been offered any conceivable path towards a peace deal. Nor has he made any “maximal demands” in Hebrew that he hasn’t offered in English. Israel has an open and vigorous press, in both languages.

Obama Knows Best (?)

There is no arguing that Israel’s best future would feature a stable Palestinian state next door. But Gaza is already a semiautonomous mini-terror state that has no bearing on Israel’s democracy—other than perhaps insuring Likud victories with every missile barrage. Neither will the West Bank. Yet one of the most widely used fearmongery arguments we’ve heard lately is that Israel’s democratic makeup is bound to crumble if it doesn’t give the new PLO its own state before Obama’s term is up.

Time’s Joe Klein tells us: “When I was a little boy, my grandmother would sing me to sleep with the Israeli national anthem. It still brings tears to my eyes.” (When he was a little boy Arabs in Israel didn’t even have the right to vote.) Today, though, he writes deeply silly columns that blame Netanyahu for introducing bigotry into Middle Eastern politics. Bibi had the temerity to mention that Arab voters were being bussed to polls, another statement that happened to be true—he’s sort of like the mass murder who first dehumanizes his enemies.

Klein also says, that the “alternative to a two-state solution is a one-state solution.” And here’s Tom Friedman in the New York Times writing the same thing:

Having won the Israeli elections — in part by declaring that he will never permit a two state-solution between Israelis and Palestinians — it means Netanyahu will be the father of the one-state solution. And the one-state solution means that Israel will become, in time, either a non-Jewish democracy or Jewish non-democracy.

The idea that Israel is on the road to demographic collapse if it doesn’t make a deal right now is not substantiated with data. For decades Israelis have been hearing how they will be outnumbered as the Jewish democracy collapses. Numbers tells a different story. Last year, you might remember Secretary of State John Kerry also pulled the “apartheid” card. As others have pointed out before, Israel’s population stands at around 8 million people, with 6 million Jews, and nearly 400,000 non-Jews related to Jewish immigrants. There are around 1.7 million Israeli Arabs, which includes Christians and Druze. Israeli Arabs are not an existential threat to Israel.

Gaza is already a semiautonomous mini-terror state that has no bearing on Israel’s democracy—other than perhaps insuring Likud victories with every missile barrage.

You know what is? A bunch of apocalyptic mullahs with access to nuclear weapons. This reality, however, doesn’t seem to draw as much concern from columnists who tear up at sound of Hatikva.

In essence, the argument these American journalists are making is that Obama has a better grasp of the long-term needs of a Jewish homeland than the people who live there. Netanyahu survives only on the fatal cost to his own people’s long-term aspirations, but Obama, whose history is littered with anti-Israel activists, he’s got Israel back.

These pundits also seem to confuse Zionism with their own quixotic progressive idealism. It’s the kind of faux-Zionism that you’ve heard from Peter Beinart or J-Street—a progressive outfit with no popular support from the Jewish community but important enough for the White House to entertain—or Hamas-defending types at the Foundation for Middle East Peace, and so on. Zionism is a national movement to return the Jewish people to their historic homeland in Israel. Its most pressing moral obligation, like any other state’s, is to defend its own security and people, not to create more volatile neighbors or to help cement Barack Obama’s legacy.

Hamas Can Promote Genocide But Don’t Quote Them,"In 2012, Hamas aired a music video with the message, “Killing Jews is worship that draws us close to Allah.”

Now that message will appear on the sides of buses, and New York politicians like Mayor Bill de Blasio are outraged… …at Pamela Geller. Geller’s organization, American Freedom Defense Initiative, paid for the ads, and they highlight the hateful ideologies of various Islamic extremist elements. The ad featuring Hamas was rejected by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, but AFDI sued and had their free speech rights upheld in court.

U.S. District Judge John Koeltl ruled, “[T]here is no evidence that seeing one of these advertisements on the back of a bus would be sufficient to trigger a violent reaction. Therefore, these ads—offensive as they may be—are still entitled to First Amendment protection.”

The Hamas viewpoint depicted is indeed offensive. The quote about “Killing Jews” runs alongside an image of a Hamas fighter and the tagline “That’s His Jihad. What’s Yours?” parodying a Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) ad campaign.

Attack the Messenger, Ignore the Message

But the response of many liberals and local Democrats seems to suggest they are more offended by the ads than by Hamas. The ads have “no place in New York City,” Mayor de Blasio said. CAIR responded on its Facebook page: “These ads can achieve nothing but sow the seeds of hatred.” What can spread more hate than Hamas’ calls for genocide?

What can spread more hate than Hamas’ calls for genocide?

Even some left-wing Jewish outlets attacked AFDI. The magazine Tikkun said these ads legitimize terrorism. “By displaying these ads AFDI has, once again, provided a legitimate excuse for terrorist organizations to practice their heinous acts which do not even come close to religious ideology,” Lubna Qureshi wrote, in an article that preemptively tries to justify terrorism.

Terrorist groups often cite all kinds of any farcical, dishonest excuses for terrorism. Some even cited an obscure YouTube video created by a private citizen as justification for attacking Benghazi. None of that justifies terrorism. To do so would be to blame the victim. Yet Qureshi didn’t just call the ad an “excuse,” she called it a “legitimate” one. To deny that Islamic terrorism is a problem while raising the possibility of a terrorist attack is on its face a self-defeating argument. In fact, the attack on the Muhammad cartoon event Geller organized in Garland, Texas, on May 3 only highlights the problem. Whatever one thinks of Geller, he ought to defend her right to express herself without being killed.

Criticizing Hamas Isn’t Criticizing Islam

Some people oppose these ads because they are “anti-Islam.” “When did those noble concepts of ‘liberty,’ ‘free speech,’ ‘freedom of conscience’ and ‘individual rights’ come to mean fighting for the ignoble right to say vile things about Muslims?” Abby Zimet wrote at Common Dreams.

Zimet says the ad says ‘vile things about Muslims.’ In fact, the ad only says something about Hamas.

Surely most Muslims do not support Hamas’ terrorism, but Zimet says the ad says “vile things about Muslims.” In fact, the ad only says something about Hamas. The ad in question quotes Hamas calling for the death of Jews and attributes it to “Hamas MTV.” Specifically, the line is taken from a sign in the background of a music video that ran on Hamas’ propaganda channel Al-Aqsa TV in 2012. The video shows a militant with a gun singing about “killing occupiers.”

There’s a treasure trove of anti-Semitic propaganda on the Al-Aqsa channel. That’s the channel that famously played a jihadist version of Mickey Mouse inciting children to “martyrdom.” After Jihadist Mickey Mouse was “martyred,” on the show, by Israeli intelligence agents, he was replaced by a bee, who died of disease, who was then replaced by Assud, a bloodthirsty rabbit, who said, “I, Assud, will get rid of the Jews, Allah willing, and I will eat them up, Allah willing, right?”

Another one of Al-Aqsa’s music videos featured a four-year-old girl pledging to “follow mommy in her steps” after depicting her mother’s own suicide bombing. The director of Al-Aqsa TV and leader of the Hamas Public Affairs Department Fathi Hamad once gave a speech encouraging the murder of Palestinians used as human shields:

For the Palestinian people, death has become an industry, at which women excel, and so do all the people living on this land. The elderly excel at this, and so do the mujahideen and the children. This is why they have formed human shields of the women, the children, the elderly, and the mujahideen, in order to challenge the Zionist bombing machine. It is as if they were saying to the Zionist enemy: ‘We desire death like you desire life.’

Supporters of Palestinian rights should be just as outraged by what Hamas is doing to the very people it claims to govern.

Islamic Extremism Isn’t Just Hamas

Hamas is the organization of government in one of the Palestinian territories, which is campaigning for statehood, so it is noteworthy what they say. The world should be informed on its ideology, including its genocidal charter, before making policy on Israeli-Palestine matters.

Many of the people on the ads are not fringe figures but important leaders.

But Hamas isn’t the only Islamic extremist entity gracing the AFDI ads. Other ads quote Turkish Prime Minister Tayypi Erdogan, Egyptian Islamic theologian Yusuf al-Qaradawi, and terrorists Osama bin Laden and Faisal Shazad. Granted, AFDI was probably going too far by using those terrorists, and anyone who disagrees with bin Laden’s violent interpretations of Islam can criticize him without criticizing Islam.

Many of the people on the ads, however, are not fringe figures but rather important leaders. Erdogan is the first elected prime minister of Turkey, a country with a population of 76.5 million people, which is in the process of consideration for European Union membership. Erdogan’s tenure has been noted for his crackdown on protesters and his attempts to move what was a relatively secular country closer to theocracy.

Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the scholar al-Qaradawi are both quoted as making anti-gay comments. Al-Qaradawi might not be a well-known figure, but he is the chairman of the International Union of Muslim Scholars and an advisor to the Muslim Brotherhood, which recently held power in Egypt and is fighting for power elsewhere. He has a show on Al Jazeera and has published over 100 books.

These ads are frankly spreading awareness of hate. If you are worried about ethnic hate, religious hate, violence, and religious fanaticism, those people depicted on the ads are who should be condemned.

De Blasio says the ads “serve only to divide and stigmatize.” If they stigmatize the bigots they display, then good, but New Yorkers and Americans should be united in disagreement with Hamas and the others.

Anyone who practices a moderate, non-violent form of Islam by definition doesn’t believe in the extremist view, yet the extremist view of Islam is a major problem in countries around the world today. Rather than attacking the messenger, let us criticize the extremists.

Let’s Call Islamic Terrorists What They Call Themselves,"For more than three decades, they have sought out and killed Americans. In 1983, in one of the first major anti-American attacks, they bombed the Marine barracks in Beirut, killing 241 American servicemen. In 1992, they used bombs to kill two people in Aden, Yemen, in hopes of killing American troops that might be passing through. In February 1993, they used a truck-based explosive to try and topple the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan. They failed, but their attack killed six New Yorkers and injured a thousand others.

What would you call the perpetrators of such acts—militants? Would you copy President Obama and call them violent extremists or simply terrorists? What is missing in such formulations? Even as he identified al-Qaeda as a threat to America, Obama refused to describe the enemy as it describes itself: “Islamic.”

Islamic Terrorists Have a Religious Goal

Emboldened by their success in Beirut and their almost-success in New York City in 1993, terrorists used bombs in 1995 to kill five U.S. servicemen in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The following year, al-Qadea struck again at American troops in Saudi Arabia in the Khobar Tower bombings, killing 19 Americans and wounding 372.

Why did the terrorists persist in their plots to kill Americans? What was it about America that so enraged them? In February 1998, Osama Bin Laden provided an answer when he declared a “fatwa” (a religious decree) declaring war against America in the name of the World Islamic Front, calling for the killing of civilians as well as soldiers:

The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies — civilians and military — is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country [emphasis added] in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque [Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim.

By their own words, Bin Laden and his fellow travelers declared themselves to be not just terrorists but Islamist terrorists with a religious goal—to re-establish true Islamic society in the Middle East by removing any “stain” of American influence by force. Bin Laden believed the whole world was meant to accept his universal message.

While the majority of Muslims prefer peaceful, non-violent, socio-political approaches that lead in time to a peaceful transition to Islamic society, a minority, led by revolutionary groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, favor a jihad or holy war dependent upon violence and military action. This brand of Salafist Islam does not distinguish between combatants and civilians as the West does but sees the West as an imperialist enemy with America as its leader.

It is self-evident that the terrorists who have sought to kill us all these years are Islamist. Al-Qaeda and ISIS terrorists consider themselves to be holy warriors who believe in a specific ideology (Islamist extremism) that is tied to a specific religion: Islam.

From Al-Qaeda to ISIS

Following Bin Laden’s fatwa, the killing continued. In January 2000, al-Qaeda attacked the USS Cole in the port of Aden, killing 17 and injuring 39 Americans. In the world today, Bin Laden said, “the worst terrorists are the Americans,” and he predicted “a black future for America.” We did not understand how black they would try to make it.

While President Obama acknowledged that the fight against al-Qaeda was not over, neither he nor any other Western leader foresaw the change that Islamist terrorism would undergo.

On the morning of September 11, 2001, two hijacked passenger jets smashed into New York City’s World Trade Center, destroying the two towers and killing 2,753 people. A third hijacked jet slammed into the side of the Pentagon in Washington DC, killing 184 civilians and military personnel. A fourth plane, whose target was probably the U.S. Capitol, was diverted by courageous passengers and crashed in the Pennsylvania countryside, killing 33 passengers, seven crew, and four hijackers.

In response, President George W. Bush approved and later President Barack Obama supported a global manhunt for Bin Laden, which ended on May 1, 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, with his death in a raid by American Navy SEALs. Commented President Obama: “For over two decades, bin Laden has been al-Qaeda’s leader and symbol, and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies. The death of Bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation’s effort to defeat al-Qaeda.”

While President Obama acknowledged that the fight against al-Qaeda was not over, neither he nor any other Western leader foresaw the change that Islamist terrorism would undergo.

As the central branch of al-Qaeda withered under American assault, a regional affiliate, known as al-Qaeda in Iraq or AQI, grew and spread. In 2013, this group rebranded itself as ISIS, or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. ISIS’s mission was to do more than harass American troops with improvised explosive devices or commit acts of terror. Rather, it aspired to territorial government and expansion across the Muslim world in the name of Sunni Islam. ISIS has proclaimed itself to be a re-establishment of the caliphate, or transnational Islamist state that ruled the Middle East and much of Europe a thousand years ago.

Beheadings and Massacres: Yes, They’re Serious

It shocked the world by beheading on camera James Foley, a freelance reporter with the GlobalPost; former Army Ranger Peter Kassig; and freelance journalist Steven Sotloff. In addition, ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller, an American volunteer worker in Syria, was accidentally killed by a coalition airstrike.

Islamist terrorism will only be defeated when we see it is as far more than mindless violence and ‘extremism.’

While the West condemned the callousness of the beheadings, ISIS’s reach grew. “We announce our allegiance to the Caliph…and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity,” announced Abubakar Shekau, leader of Boko Haram, a Nigerian terrorist group dedicated to the goals of an Islamist society that ISIS represents.

Boko Haram is merciless. In the past year, it has killed more than 10,000 people. This includes a brutal massacre of some 2,000 women, children, and elderly in the town of Baga, Nigeria. Nor is its reach limited to Nigeria. Boko Haram continues to spread havoc across parts of Niger, Cameroon, and Chad. Its declared allegiance to ISIS further demonstrates the accelerating appeal of Islamist terrorism not just in the Middle East and in Africa but around the world.

In Islamist terrorism, the United States and the West face a foe of the same ideological mold as the Soviet Union. Both communism and Islamist terrorism are threats grounded in principles deeper than geo-political or social considerations. In the 14 years since 9/11 there have been 65 separate Islamist terrorist plots or attacks on U.S. soil. Thanks to the diligence of American intelligence and security operations, few of these plots have come to fruition. However, Islamist terrorism will only be defeated when we see it is as far more than mindless violence and “extremism.”

President Obama recognizes that Islamist terrorism is a problem, sort of. Last September he declared that America would use a broad coalition to ultimately “degrade” and “destroy” ISIS. Destroy? Yes. Degrade? No. ISIS is a terrorist group, not a street gang.

President Obama’s preferred use of the euphemistic “violent extremism” to describe our enemies is problematic. The President’s desire not to offend Muslims who are not engaged in terrorism may win some points in the Muslim world but it will weaken efforts to build a broad coalition against ISIS. Furthermore, it will confuse the American public. Without clarity in language there can be no clarity in strategy.

Don’t Impose Western Values on Islamic Terrorists

Obama’s socio-economic analysis of 9/11, at the time of the tragedy, reveals an inability to see clearly on a matter of national security:

The essence of this tragedy, it seems to me, derives from a fundamental absence of empathy on the part of the attackers…. It may find expression in a particular brand of violence, and may be channeled by particular demagogues or fanatics. Most often, though, it grows out of a climate of poverty and ignorance, helplessness and despair.

But the root of the 9/11 terror attacks was not a “lack of empathy” or “poverty and ignorance.” It was an ideology of religious terrorism that Bin Laden willingly embraced. His beliefs flowed from forces more potent than the superficial categories Obama suggested. Islamist terrorism is grounded in a rigid theocratic-political view of the world. As Walter Lohman, director of Heritage’s Asian Study Center has put it, “the threat cannot be honestly separated from its religious context…. Calling the threat ‘Islamist’ allows us to distinguish friend from foe.”

There is no need for America to declare its own “fatwa” against all Muslims. Rather, we must recognize that ISIS and Al-Qaeda represent a clear and present transnational danger that calls for precise definition and decisive action. We must be willing to understand our enemy as he is, not as we might wish him to be.

Presidential Candidates Should Support The Iraq Invasion,"In saying “if I knew then what I know now, I would not have authorized the invasion of Iraq,” presidential candidates are taking for granted that the Middle East would have been better off had America not led a coalition to overthrow Saddam Hussein in 2003.

That assumption is groundless. In fact, Bush’s decision to go to war seems more prescient to me today than it did the day I enlisted in January 2003. If I had known then what I know now, I still would have enlisted. I would be making that decision as a lower-enlisted soldier, knowing I would not have the power to change any of the ill-considered policies that were enacted subsequent to the decision to invade.

To my mind, this decision should be a lot easier for someone going back in time to be the president. After all, they would find themselves in a position to avoid most of the mistakes that caused the trouble. The question, Would you have invaded Iraq knowing what you know now? should not be confused with the question, Would you have conducted the war in the exact same manner?

No one disputes that costly mistakes were made, especially in the early years. I would hope a commander in chief who traveled back to 2003 would avoid mistakes such as prolonging the transfer of sovereignty, disbanding the Iraqi army, failing to maintain adequate security after the regime fell, tolerating Iran’s explosively formed projectile networks, and allowing inadequately trained soldiers and contractors to run a major detention facility. But I do not see how the leader of the free world, knowing what we know now, could rationalize leaving Saddam’s regime in place.

Saddam Hussein Was Not Just Another Evil Dictator

Difficult as the Iraq War was, deposing Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly an important strategic accomplishment for the United States. Many people are too young to recall, or have forgotten, or perhaps no longer care, what kind of human being Hussein was, or what kind of regime he led. As a result, too many analyses of the Iraq War include the unserious premise: Saddam was a bad guy, but...

The objection that America cannot go around toppling every unsavory dictator is unconvincing, as it assumes Saddam was ordinary.

There is no “but.” Saddam was not the run-of-the-mill problem that many pundits today seem to think he was. He was one of history’s most brutal tyrants and he was a serious threat to international stability. So the objection that America cannot go around toppling every unsavory dictator is unconvincing, as it assumes Saddam was ordinary.

It would be unfortunate if one of the lessons people took away from the war was that America, and the world, would have been better off if we had left Hussein’s Baathist regime in place. Saddam was quite literally intolerable. His regime needed to go. That point should be clearer today than it was 12 years ago. Why clearer today than in 2003? ISIS should help clarify.

ISIS Are the Remnants of Saddam’s Regime

A while back, President Obama took criticism for making a flippant remark about ISIS. He called them a jayvee team. Soon after, ISIS took over large swathes of Iraq and Syria and began killing lots of people in very graphic and public ways. Polling numbers very quickly showed a large majority of Americans would support military action to destroy ISIS. Obama, it was thought, had badly underestimated this group.

This cadre of back-benching Baathists is now driving the military maneuvering of ISIS.

He had. But he was also correct. ISIS is a jayvee team. They are not the al-Qaeda jayvee, as President Obama was implying. Rather, they are the vehicle of the remnants of Saddam Hussein’s old Baath Party. The top Baath Party leaders have all been killed, and the party’s elite units have been decimated, but some regime loyalists survived—a jayvee team of sorts—and this cadre of back-benching Baathists is now driving the military maneuvering of ISIS.

Writing for the Washington Post, Liz Sly reports: “Even with the influx of thousands of foreign fighters, almost all of the leaders of the Islamic State are former Iraqi officers, including the members of its shadowy military and security committees, and the majority of its emirs and princes, according to Iraqis, Syrians and analysts who study the group.” ISIS’s use of terror to control the population is a strategy it learned from the Baathists, not from al Qaeda.

In effect, the Baath Party became a terror organization the day Saddam seized power. There is video documentation of the precise moment, if you have doubts. In the video you see Saddam has called the Central Committee into session. Then he has a surprise guest address them. While Saddam coolly puffs on his cigar, that guest “confesses” his role in a coup plot, then slowly reads off a list of co-conspirators. One by one each of the accused is escorted from his seat.

What we do not see in the video is the execution of each of these men. That is the key part. The people who have not been called—Saddam makes them pull the trigger. To ensure loyalty, the Baathists demanded party members make themselves complicit. That is how a terrorist state is maintained.

Ruling Iraq with Terror

Until we liberated Iraq, the Baathists continued to rule by intimidation and fear. They videotaped their torturing of opposition figures and disseminated the tapes to terrorize others. The only difference between the Baathists and ISIS is that ISIS has iPhones to record their atrocities.

The only difference between the Baathists and ISIS is that ISIS has iPhones to record their atrocities.

Within Saddam’s terror state, the majority Shia saw their religion coopted by the Baath Party. The Kurds and Shia were brutally repressed, and sometimes gassed with deadly chemical weapons. Millions of Iraqis were forcibly relocated to better enable Saddam to control the country. The marshes in the south were drained to destroy the ecosystem and force the Marsh Arabs to move. While the Baathists prevented Sunni extremist organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood or al Qaeda from taking root inside Iraq, they supported such groups abroad to make trouble for their neighbors.

Saddam also commanded the world’s fourth-largest army, which he was not reluctant to use. He started a war with Iran that claimed at least half a million lives. He started another war with Kuwait that claimed about 100,000 lives. In putting down the uprising that followed that conflict, the Baathists killed another 300,000.

Aggression Against the United States

Mismanagement of the state and abuse of the Oil for Food program led to hundreds of thousands more deaths. The Baathists represented a standing threat to nearly half of the planet’s oil reserves. Allan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, advised after the war that removing Hussein was “essential” for securing the world’s oil supply, and maintaining global economic stability.

Saddam ordered the assassination of a U.S. president, and Saddam’s air-defense units were firing on U.S. Airmen almost daily as they patrolled no-fly zones.

Some people are uncomfortable talking about oil in the context of war, but a major disruption to the oil supply could cause extreme economic hardship and a significant reduction in energy availability, and it would be the world’s poor and weak who would suffer the most. To address this threat, the United States needed to maintain a sizable military footprint in the Middle East. In fact, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia was one of al Qaeda’s reasons for conducting the 9/11 attacks.

The United States was not exempt from Saddam’s aggression. Saddam ordered the assassination of a U.S. president, and Saddam’s air-defense units were firing on U.S. Airmen almost daily as they patrolled no-fly zones that covered 40 percent of Iraqi airspace.

Today’s problems always seem to us to be worse than yesterday’s. Perhaps this is because they are the ones we have to deal with, or maybe it is because they appear to us more vivid than the black-and-white images of the past. Overcoming this bias and evaluating the current situation objectively is often a challenge. Countless commentators and politicians insist that no sane person would advocate toppling Saddam if they knew it would lead to the rise of ISIS. This perspective seems skewed. It overinflates the present threat posed by ISIS and underestimates the threat posed by Saddam when we invaded.

Saddam Hussein Was Worse than ISIS

Thus, we encounter the oddity that in March 2015 more than 60 percent of Americans polled thought ISIS was threatening enough to warrant a response from the U.S. military, while at the same time only a very small fraction of Americans seem to believe we were right the first time to use military force to defeat the Baathists. ISIS is nowhere near the threat to America or the Middle East that Hussein’s regime was. So I do not see how so many Americans can support military action against ISIS but still think we were wrong to have invaded Iraq in 2003.

There was no question in anybody’s mind by the late 1990s that a stable Middle East was simply impossible so long as Hussein remained in power.

There was no question in anybody’s mind by the late 1990s that a stable Middle East was simply impossible so long as Hussein remained in power. In 1998, it became U.S. policy to replace Saddam’s regime with a democracy. Unfortunately, President Clinton did not have a workable strategy to achieve this objective. The U.S.-Iraq relationship devolved into predictable pattern of Saddam pushing the envelope, followed by a pinprick bombing.

Saddam was firmly in control of the dynamic. Sanctions had failed. The Baathists were manipulating the Oil for Food program that had been put in place to prevent a humanitarian disaster. America was taking the blame for the Iraqis’ suffering. In an infamous interview on “60 Minutes,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright accepted the premise that half a million children had died as a result of the sanctions, and she claimed it was worth it. In reality, the death toll was not nearly so high, and Albright most likely did not genuinely feel such a humanitarian disaster would have been acceptable. But the point remained the same: America’s failed Iraq policy was causing grief for the Iraqi people while doing nothing to influence Saddam’s behavior.

After 9/11 it should have been immediately clear that kicking the can down the road with Hussein was no longer an acceptable strategy. The war on terrorism could not be fought effectively so long as the Middle East was being destabilized by Saddam. The Bush administration wisely determined Saddam had to go, and military force was needed to make that happen. As I recall, no viable solutions other than invasion were being proposed at the time.

Hindsight Is Not 20/20

Many people today assume that doing nothing at all would have been a better option. In fact, a disturbing number of foreign-policy experts now contend that Hussein was some sort of necessary evil. They imagine he was balancing Iran and suppressing all the Islamic extremists. So while they may have wished he’d have been a little nicer, they feel we were still pretty lucky to have had him around. Aside from being a depressingly cynical approach to foreign policy, this view is demonstrably inaccurate.

No sane assessment of Hussein’s 24-year official reign could conclude that he was in any imaginable way a stabilizing force in the region.

If Saddam was the cork bottling up all the chaos that later came rushing out, he was certainly a very leaky cork. Did Saddam “balance” Iran during the ’80s, or did he start a war that claimed more than half a million lives? When the Iraqi Kurds were fighting a civil war in the mid-’90s, were the Baathists offering their regional balancing services, or were they fueling the bloodshed? When Iran’s Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, was blowing up embassies, hijacking planes, and killing U.S. servicemen, where were the Baathists and why weren’t they holding these Shia radicals in check?

Hussein was not a U.S. ally and he did nothing at all to shape the region in our favor. Nor could any sane assessment of his 24-year official reign conclude that he was in any imaginable way a stabilizing force in the region. Yet, the popular view today is that if President Bush had only left him alone, two of the Middle East’s biggest problems—Iran and Islamic extremism—would be solved.

Sen. Marco Rubio is correct when he says the world is better off for the United States’ removing Hussein from power. This should not be controversial. Given everything we know about the Baathist regime, we have every reason to believe the past 12 years would have been significantly worse with Saddam still in control of Iraq.

The Arab Spring almost certainly would have been a blood bath; there would be no promising seed of democracy growing in Tunisia, or potential reformer in Egypt; we would not be talking about a potential Kurdish state, but more likely of a Kurdish genocide; Iran would not even be pretending to negotiate an end to its nuclear program, but would be arming to the teeth to “balance” Saddam; Qaddafi would not have relinquished his weapons of mass destruction program, and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb likely would be in possession of them today; terrorists with international reach would likely be benefitting from Saddam’s support; at the very least American counter-terror forces would find the Middle East a much more challenging environment to conduct their work. And without question Iraq would be in a far worse state than it is today.

Over-reluctance by America to use military force will not make the world a better and more peaceful place. There are real dangers in the world that will not go away except by force, and the greatest dangers require a great force, which only the United States possesses.

"For Bastille Day, The French Storm Freedom","As the French celebrate their national holiday, le quatorze juillet, they may want to consider whether France is living up to its national motto—“Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité.”

Known in English-speaking countries as Bastille Day, the fourteenth of July celebrates the historic storming of the Bastille prison—the first defiant blow of the Revolution against French absolutism. Yet, today, the French are turning their back on that legacy of liberty and embracing the sort of authoritarian control they once abominated. The recent UberPOP riots outside Paris and the government’s response to the anti-Uber violence expose the tight reins of special interests that direct the French state and the readiness of French politicians to subordinate France’s revolutionary ideals to the transient popular will.

Rioting Against…Car Sharing

On Thursday, June 25, almost 3,000 French taxi drivers, coordinated by the FNDT and UNT national taxi unions, turned their cars into instruments of protest, effectively stopping transportation by private car services in and out of Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports and around the country.

As tires burned, taxi drivers stopped suspected UberPOP drivers, overturned cars, and held drivers—and their passengers—hostage on the road. In Strasbourg, at least two Uber drivers received summonses to remote locations, where taxi drivers ambushed and assaulted them and vandalized their cars.

Singer and actress Courtney Love, traveling to Paris, live-tweeted, “they’ve ambushed our car and are holding our driver hostage. They’re beating the cars with metal bats. this is France?? I’m safer in Baghdad.”

The official French response only fed the Uber pyre. French President Francois Hollande condemned the violence but insisted that the demonstrations were completely “understand[able].” Both Hollande and Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve called for an end to UberPOP’s “illegal” activities in France.

Using Government to Undercut the Competition

Hollande and Cazeneuve can accuse UberPOP of operating illegally thanks to a law passed in October of last year. “La loi Thévenoud” made it illegal to run an operation facilitating for-profit exchanges between non-professional drivers and passengers. Violations of the law could incur a €300,000 fine ($321,889) and two years of jail time. The legislation specifically targeted UberPOP, which operates in France like Lyft in the United States, by connecting non-professional drivers with paying passengers.

French taxi drivers benefit from a highly regulated system that exists to close out competition.

Notably, the law also outlawed the feature that gives Uber, and other app-based car services, a distinct advantage over traditional taxis—the geolocalization map that allows Uber users to identify the closest Uber and that estimates arrival time before the user even chooses to reserve a car. According to Le Monde, the French legislature included this provision to “conserve the cruising monopoly” of traditional taxis. The legislature also sought to regulate Uber’s prices, counteracting Uber’s “economic terrorism.”

Like taxi drivers in New York, San Francisco, and other U.S. cities, French taxi drivers benefit from a highly regulated system that exists to close out competition. Yet, while this system protects taxis from new entrants, it was unable—as in the United States—to prevent Uber’s innovative, price-efficient model from bulldozing a new way into the car service industry.

No wonder French taxi drivers, who suffer under burdensome licensure requirements that can cost as much as $270,000 in Paris, are desperate to kill Uber. Even French VTC drivers—professional, non-taxi drivers—must participate in a three-month training, which, according to Uber France General Director Thibaud Simphal, can cost as much as €6,000, an unaffordable sum for most prospective Uber drivers.

The French legislature may write the law to benefit the inflexible, unprogressive taxi establishment, but the French courts appear less willing to apply the law unequally. Two Parisian courts in December, 2014 and February of this year declined to ban UberPOP, allowing Uber to continue building UberPOP’s 400,000-strong user-base. In May, the Constitutional Council upheld the Thévenoud law’s geolocalization provision, but put off the question of UberPOP’s legitimacy to September, leaving the car service in an apparent legal grey zone.

Innovation Is Economic Terrorism

Until the smell of burning tires wafted toward Paris. Although taxi strikers’ signs with “Death to Uber” and “Uber go home” appeared directed at Uber and its drivers, French politicians heard the message loud and clear: The “uberization of the world” and the “economic terrorism” that accompanies it must stop—at all costs.

The uuberization of the world’ and the ‘economic terrorism’ that accompanies it must stop—at all costs.

After meeting with taxi unions the day of the riots, Cazeneuve elected to champion illiberal minority rule, inequality based on special privilege, and the exclusive brotherhood of the cartel—while claiming to oppose the “law of the jungle.” He promised that UberPOP vehicles would be “systematically seized” and the service “would be closed.” So much for the court’s opinion. Clearly, the more than 100,000 Uber fans who took to Twitter and Facebook to protest the protest, even promoting a “strike” against taxis, saw that the minister was letting special interests dictate the law. Adieu, liberty, equality, fraternity. Au revoir, democracy.

The French government’s unequal, illiberal application of the law degenerated further four days later. Investigators indicted Thibaud Simphal, and Uber’s general director for Western Europe, Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, for deceptive commercial practices, complicity in illegal taxi operations, and illegal treatment of personal data. While the two directors were held overnight and face trial in late September, those who assaulted the liberty of Uber drivers and their passengers escaped punishment. Although 70 vehicles were damaged in the protests, only 10 rioters were arrested nationwide.

Cazeneuve and company’s response to the riots conveys a ringing warning. France will not defend the American model of destructive innovation and the customer’s freedom to choose when they conflict with entrenched interests—even if preserving those groups’ privileges menaces the interests and safety of French citizens without an influential brotherhood at their back.

Uber understands—now. Friday, July 3, Uber suspended UberPOP “primarily to assure the safety of Uber drivers.” As Uber executives Simphal and Gore-Coty watch the triumphant Bastille Day fireworks, no doubt they will paraphrase Courtney Love’s tweet: “This is France?? I’m safer in (Communist) China,” where by the way, Uber faces a competitor with 80 percent market share in the private-car sector, Didi Kuaidi.

Didi plans to fight off Uber not with bats and a government gun, but with happy passengers and fertile investment dollars—millions and billions of them. Now, that’s a liberal response worthy of French imitation.

The Total Failure Of Gun Control Captured In One Photo,"If you want to know why gun control doesn’t work, you only need to look at one photo to see why.

The picture below, taken after the terrorist attack on a military career center in Chattanooga, captures the complete failure of the logic underlying demands for greater gun control in the U.S.:

“Federal Installation,” the top of the sign reads in black letters atop a yellow background. “Firearms Are Prohibited In This Facility.” The bullets that shattered the glass in more than a dozen places around the gun-free zone sign did not heed its commands.

In addition to ignoring the sign designating the area as a gun-free zone, the terrorist shooter also appears to have illegally obtained his firearms:

BREAKING: FBI: Man who attacked military sites in Tennessee purchased some of his guns illegally.



The Associated Press (@AP) July 17, 2015

In other words, the gun control regime not only failed to prevent the terrorist from obtaining his firearms, it also failed to prevent him from possessing them in a gun-free zone. The gun ban did, however, dissuade law-abiding Marines from carrying firearms that they could’ve used to protect themselves.

As David Harsanyi noted, gun control and gun-free zones don’t hamper violent madmen. Instead, they only encourage them. Gun-free zones are the softest of soft targets, and there’s nothing more a violent terrorist desires more than the ability to inflict the greatest amount of harm with the least amount of resistance:

Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez is suspected of murdering four unarmed Marines in Chattanooga and wounding others. As I write this, we still don’t know how Abdulazeez obtained his gun or what his motivations were—though, we can take an educated guess on the latter. What we do know is that Abdulazeez shot his victims in a “gun-free zone,” which is a useful illustration of the absurdity of gun-control laws: we constrain conscientious Americans but offer free rein to killers. In this case, even our best trained warriors were helpless.

The gun-free zone sign didn’t prevent the shooter from firing a gun at completely innocent individuals within the zone. It did, however, prevent them from defending themselves. The key to stopping gun violence isn’t gun control, because this episode (along with many others) proves that gun control just doesn’t work.

Arming Soldiers After Chattanooga Would Let The Terrorists Win,"Of the five soldiers murdered in the Tennessee Terror Attack, four were Marines, and as that branch’s doctrine declares, every one was “a rifleman.” Many demand to know why these members of the armed forces went unarmed. Each could answer with his Oath of Enlistment.

While in uniform, those soldiers at that civilian recruiting office went unarmed because they swore, “to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America.” To do otherwise would erode a safeguard as old as our republican government, transforming civilian offices into zones of military occupation. In short, if we arm soldiers off base, the terrorists win.

End Gun-Free Zones. Restore the 2nd Amendment. But Don’t Introduce Armed Soldiers into Society

Since the Chattanooga shooting, many have called for an end to military gun-free zones. Politicians, presidential candidates, and members of the media question why a government that trains men and women to use deadly force abraod denies them the same tools to defend themselves at home. Already six different state governors have authorized their National Guardsmen to lock and load.

They call gun-free zones a ridiculous policy and they’re absolutely right. Recruiters should have the ability to conceal carry. Military police should pack heat. But uniformed American soldiers on American soil should never openly show force.

More Cincinnatus than Sulla, our soldiers liberate and defend while their opponents enslave and conquer.

Today we forget that freedom is the exception rather than the rule of world history. Our Founders did not make this mistake. As that bleak politico who penned Federalist No. 8 observes, “to be more safe,” a people “runs the risk of being less free.” If the government exists to defend the rights of the individual as the Founders believed, soldiers must never eclipse civil society.

To their credit, our military has always embodied this ethos. They move only when the Commander-in-Chief—an elected civilian—gives the word. More Cincinnatus than Sulla, our soldiers liberate and defend while their opponents enslave and conquer. This republican character of their esprit de corps stems directly from a desire to preserve democratic freedom. Instead of pushing these troops across an American Rubicon, we should let them continue doing their duty.

Terrorists Win When We Overreach

Of course our soldiers will never march on state capitols, and neither will jihadists. Instead, like the extinct anarchists of 19th century Europe, today’s terrorists rely exclusively on “the propaganda of the deed.”

By definition, rogue extremists cannot galvanize the economic, political, and military might necessary to win a war in any conventional sense. There’s little threat that Boko Haram, ISIS, or Hezbollah could bombard Fort McHenry and burn our Capitol. Instead, terrorists attempt to exert political will by terrorizing.

Terrorists can’t conquer modern nation-states. Instead, they seek capitulation of Western national consciousness.

Jihadists like Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez don’t blow themselves to bits to win strategic victories. They do it to win moral ones. They don’t measure success in miles conquered. They measure it in minds changed. They do not seek control of a nation-state. They seek capitulation of national consciousness.

For the jihadist, victory comes not by marching down Pennsylvania Avenue and hoisting their flag above the White House. Rather, it occurs when out of fear, we disgrace our own banner by tearing down principle. It comes when we overreach.

Learn From History. Don’t Repeat It

In the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, good leaders made bad policy. Supposedly critical in the moment, many provisions of the legislation enacted shortly after the attacks have been shown both ineffective and dangerous. Therefore, to rob Abdulazeez of a victory, we must remain calm.

Instead of converting recruiting stations across the country into little Alamos, lawmakers should simply empower individual citizens in uniform by reversing the Federal policy that makes them soft targets. Citizen soldiers already have all the tools necessary to defend themselves. Washington should let them by abolishing gun-free zones.

Soldiers ought to have the freedom to exercise their Second Amendment rights like any other citizen—either by storing a handgun in a glove box or carrying it concealed on their person. Armed Military Police should defend those who dedicate themselves to our defense. All provisions to keep these men and women safe must be considered—that is, everything except an open show of force at home.

Balance Liberty and Security.

Arming uniformed soldiers in a civilian setting blurs the separation of martial and civil authority. It perpetuates the fear that feeds the terrorist’s strategy. And it has no place in a free society. The best counter-terrorism policy will keep American soldiers safe while preserving the principles they seek to defend.

Honor the oath of the Chattanooga five who died for our freedom. Preserve the Constitutional separation of martial and civil power. To do otherwise, to surrender by taking the first steps to transform society into a security state, would hand the terrorist a victory.

Charlie Hebdo Teaches Us Terrorism Does Work,"In a resounding victory for the enemies of free speech, Charlie Hebdo will no longer print images of the prophet Muhammad. The satirical French magazine, whose Paris office was attacked by Islamic terrorists in January, killing twelve, recently told a German magazine that it had “done its job.”

“We have drawn Muhammad to defend the principle that one can draw whatever they want,” said editor Laurent Sourisseau, who survived the January 7 massacre by playing dead after taking a bullet to the shoulder. “It is a bit strange, though: we are expected to exercise a freedom of expression that no one dares to.”

Criticize Charlie Hebdo, Sure, But Not Islamists

Indeed, Charlie Hebdo was one of the few publications anywhere that would print images of Muhammad. The venerable New York Times would not even reprint the Charlie Hebdo cartoons that prompted the attack, citing some pabulum about offending its Muslim readers (its Catholic readers, on the other hand, recently got to see an image of a portrait of Pope Benedict XVI made out of condoms in the pages of the paper).

For its trouble, Charlie Hedbo was condemned by certain craven elements on the Left, like the dozens of writers, including Joyce Carol Oates and Junot Díaz, who protested PEN America when it chose to honor Charlie Hebdo with its annual Freedom of Expression Courage Award. Garry Trudeau, creator of the Doonesbury cartoon, went so far as to denounce Charlie Hebdo for “hate speech” and for “punching downward, by attacking a powerless, disenfranchised minority with crude, vulgar drawings.”

Setting aside Trudeau’s condescension that the world’s 1.57 billion Muslims are all some amorphous, powerless minority, and his conceit that a tiny satirical magazine in France could ever “punch down” at the second-largest religious group in the world: the magazine did no such thing.

Rather, Charlie Hebdo’s purpose in lampooning Muhammad was to mock Islamic extremists, whose violent interpretation of their religion is responsible for oppression throughout the Muslim world—especially the oppression of those who are actually powerless and disenfranchised: women, gays, and anyone who opposes their local Islamic extremists.

Who Will Now Champion Free Speech?

That’s why Charlie Hebdo was so essential: it was one of the few publications willing to offend everyone, regardless of religion or creed, even under threat of violence. We shouldn’t blame the magazine for saying it’s had enough, just as we shouldn’t blame individual cartoonists or writers for having had enough. Back in April, Charlie Hebdo cartoonists Luz, who drew the magazine’s cover picture after the massacre featuring Mohammad holding a sign saying “Je Suis Charlie” under the words “All is forgiven,” said he would no longer draw Muhammad. “It no longer interests me,” he said.

Charlie Hebdo was one of the few publications willing to offend everyone, regardless of religion or creed, even under threat of violence.

That’s fair. They have suffered enough. A dozen of their best gave their last full measure of devotion to the principle of free speech. Let them rest. However, that means the rest of us need to step up.

In May, a group in Texas did just that, hosting a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest that was the target of a failed attack by two gunmen acting in the name of the Islamic State (both were killed). The event, organized by the American Freedom Defense Initiative, was staged in honor of Charlie Hebdo. Jean-Baptiste Thoret, the magazine’s film critic who accepted the PEN award, said it was “nonsense” to compare the group to Charlie Hebdo. But, he added: “Maybe there is just one thing in common: You can’t mess with Texas, you can’t mess with Charlie Hebdo.”

If We Cower, Terrorism Wins

Alas, you can. “The terrorists did not win,” Luz said back in April. “They will have won if the whole of France continues to be scared.” At the time, he was accusing the far-right National Front of trying to stir up fear and outrage in the wake of the attacks, but his question takes on a new urgency in light of the magazine’s decision not to publish any more cartoons of Muhammad. Have the terrorists won? To paraphrase Luz, they will have won if the whole of France continues to be scared of criticizing Islam and publishing images of Muhammad. For now, it seem this is indeed the case.

Terrorists will have won if the whole of France continues to be scared of criticizing Islam.

In the wake of the January massacre, Parisians took to the streets with signs proclaiming, “Je Suis Charlie” (I am Charlie)—a show of solidarity that prompted similar expressions across the globe. So much for all that. The magazine’s decision, while understandable, is nevertheless a vindication of the Heckler’s Veto—or in this case the Terrorist’s Veto, which has silenced the one publication in all of Europe that was willing to defy Islamic extremists for the sake of free speech.

It seems clear, now, that France’s slogan after the massacre should have been “J’étais Charlie”—I was Charlie. But no more. Charlie is dead, and “J’étais Charlie” has become the epitaph of Europe. And if America’s progressive elites at places like The New York Times and in the upper echelons of the literary world have their way, it will eventually be our epitaph, too.

How GOP Debaters Should Handle Obama’s Iran Agreement,"The seventeen GOP presidential candidates must talk definitively about Iran in tonight’s debates. That’s because the 60-day window is ticking for Congress on “the deal” (a cynical term used even by President Obama—no one says “agreement”). It’s not enough for Donald Trump to say, properly, that he would have increased sanctions and intensified pressure, and that he would never have gone to the table unless Iran showed good faith by releasing the four captive Americans. Or that he would have negotiated from strength and not kept extending deadlines and caved; that he would have walked away from the Persian bazaar.

Let everyone know tonight that this administration discouraged and prevented Israel from a military attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities when such an attack was more feasible. A delusional Barack Obama believes his outreach to Iran is somehow comparable to Richard Nixon’s rapprochement. Obama was a community organizer with no legislative accomplishments in Illinois or the U.S. Senate who reads a teleprompter and plays beginners checkers. Nixon was a naval officer, congressman, senator, vice president, and international statesman who played multi-dimensional chess. Obama’s ego makes him so arrogantly intent on his dubious legacy that he would, in effect, compromise the national security of this nation.

Trump and the other presidential contenders must clearly explain tonight why this agreement is contrary to American interests: how it will embolden Iran, increase its influence, reward and fund more terrorism, threaten our moderate Arab allies, trigger a destabilizing conventional and nuclear regional arms race, spur nuclear proliferation (a traditional liberal obsession) beyond the Mideast, incite a Hezbollah rocket war against Israel, end any chance of Israeli-Palestinian peace or a two-state solution (a liberal panacea), and assure a nuclear weapons capability for Iran that would endanger Europe and, in time, the United States.

Remind everyone that Obama said this deal must be limited to nuclear capability; instead, Kerry allowed new conventional capabilities immediately for Iran and, down the line, intercontinental missiles that could target the United States. And Obama says the burden of proof is on opponents of the deal? The alternative is back to the negotiating table with the strongest sanctions we can have, and, if necessary and allied with other Arab nations: pursuing disruptions, cyber warfare, and targeted assassinations and military strikes to keep delaying fulfillment of Iran’s nuclear option.

Obama Is No Reagan or JFK

But first the presidential candidates, hopefully on the same page, must correct the record, and President Obama has just given them a new opening.

A nuclear-armed Iran could be as dangerous a threat to the United States as the Soviet Union.

In his speech yesterday at American University, where President John F. Kennedy spoke more than a half century ago about war and peace, President Obama presumptuously invoked memories of JFK and Ronald Reagan. Let me paraphrase the late distinguished U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a great national-security Democrat (who probably would have opposed this deal), as I say this to President Obama: In 1960, I was a 13-year-old boy volunteering in JFK’s presidential campaign, and you’re no John Kennedy. And a few years later, I first met Reagan, and you’re no Reagan.

As my colleague Bruce Weinrod, a foreign-policy expert who served as the Pentagon’s point man for NATO, has written, a nuclear-armed Iran could be as dangerous a threat to the United States as the Soviet Union, and the agreement’s verification provisions, hardly comparable with Reagan’s negotiated verification provisions, are flawed.

Unlike Obama with Iran, Reagan refused to negotiate with the Soviets until they changed their hostile objectives. Obama relaxed pressure on Iran. Reagan increased pressure on the Soviet Union. Despite his public posture, Obama privately took the military option off the table; Reagan launched the Strategic Defense Initiative to convince the Soviets to negotiate. Obama sought “to weaken, delay or block enhanced sanctions” on Iran; Reagan sought to disrupt the Soviet economy. Obama made “pre-emptive concessions”; Reagan held firm and walked away from the negotiating table at Reykjavik.

President Obama cited President Kennedy’s 1963 test-ban treaty and President Ronald Reagan’s 1987 nuclear forces reduction agreement. In his speech, Obama also said Iranian “hardliners chanting ‘Death to America’ …are making common cause with the Republican Caucus.” Incredibly, he equates reasoned opponents of his deal exercising their constitutional prerogative with Islamist terrorists who would kill us. Obama did not mention that even Democrats in Congress who support the deal are unenthused (“it’s the best we can do”), and some congressional Democrats, despite his threats, already have declared opposition.

In contrast to Obama’s ugliness, presidents Kennedy and Reagan, recognizing bipartisan foreign policy, sought the U.S. Senate’s advice and consent.

In contrast to Obama’s ugliness, presidents Kennedy and Reagan, recognizing bipartisan foreign policy, sought the U.S. Senate’s advice and consent (80 to 19, and 93 to 5, respectively) on their treaties. I worked in the Senate when it ratified President Nixon’s ABM treaty (88 to 2). In 1979, Jimmy Carter sought Senate approval for his arms limitation agreement with the Soviets, then withdrew it after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan.

But even Carter, unlike the non-collaborative Obama, was not go-it-alone. Obama says the Iran deal is “consequential,” yet views it only as an executive agreement and announces he yet will defy congressional disapproval. His Secretary of State John Kerry extended negotiations so many times he became subject to the Stockholm Syndrome: Kerry just said congressional rejection would be the “ultimate screwing…of the Ayatollah.” The administration doesn’t mind screwing Israel and our Arab allies, or going first to the United Nations—an end-run around not just Republicans, but Congress.

Obama Must Be Smoking an Iranian Hookah

Obama, in his continued isolate-Israel mode, said in his speech that except for Israel, other nations publicly support the deal. Do these benevolent countries favor the United States or Iran, or just their own interest? And what about the Arab nations that privately oppose the deal? Consider that in, all these years that Israel has had a nuclear weapons capability, Arab countries were unworried. Ever wonder why the region is apoplectic about Iran?

If under heavy sanctions Iran kept spending on terrorism, why—with no sanctions—would it stop now?

Powerful multinational business interests and perhaps billionaire plutocrats would profit from this deal to end sanctions. Perhaps Bernie Sanders should inquire. Instead, Obama in yesterday’s speech raised the specter of “tens of millions of dollars” in (dual-loyalty Jews?) lobbying against the deal. I keep mentioning this speech because his remarks are calculated, not impromptu. As Jennifer Rubin noted in the Washington Post, Kerry has previously warned of Israeli manipulation of Congress, and that Israel (and American Jews?) would be blamed for congressional rejection of Obama’s deal. This divisive rhetoric has consequence: every African-American member of Congress boycotted the prescient speech of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Obama’s historical revisionism on Iran and this “deal” is remarkable. He said sanctions contracted Iran’s economy by 20 percent to bring them to the table, and wants to end them to help Iran with “56 billion dollars of its own money” for “funding pensions and salaries for infrastructure.” If under heavy sanctions Iran kept spending on terrorism, why—with no sanctions—would it stop now? He also conveniently does not say Congress forced him to go along with stronger sanctions. His administration claims multi-nation sanctions are no longer sustainable (if so, thanks to his lack of leadership); he also asserts that U.S. unilateral sanctions would be inadequate, yet he repeats the myth of “snap back” unilateral sanctions “if Iran violates the agreement.”

Later in the speech, he says unilateral sanctions won’t work because we would offend “countries like China…major purchasers of our debt.” Obama, like Kerry, argues Iran’s case, e.g., that we are negotiating not with the thugs who run the government, but with the “the Iranian people” who would not “agree to a total surrender of their sovereignty.” Yet Obama then falsely says “inspectors will be allowed daily access to Iran’s key nuclear sites…on 24 hours notice…even if Iran objects.” This is the stuff of “Saturday Night Live.”

The Iran Agreement Neuters U.S. Options

In claiming an “enforceable…permanent prohibition on… Iran weapons-related research,” Obama contradicts Kerry. Obama even says, “If 15 or 20 years from now, Iran tries to build a bomb, the U.S. will detect it” and we can respond “under international law…[with]…military options.” “If” (!) Iran will build a nuclear bomb? It will build dozens. And this agreement promises Iran the intercontinental missiles for a nuclear strike against the United States. So what “military options” would a future president have?

This agreement promises Iran the intercontinental missiles for a nuclear strike against the United States.

Obama in yesterday’s speech says Iran’s support of Hezbollah is old news, because “Iran has been engaged in [terrorism] for decades.” Hezbollah, with the money Obama would give them, could help guide and target Lebanon-based rockets, embedded in residential areas, to start a new war with Israel.

Obama asserts “sanctions relief” will not make Iran the region’s dominant power, but his overall policy toward Iran assures that nation’s regional hegemony. His syntax is worse than his logic: “Iran’s defense budget is eight times smaller than the combined budget of our Gulf allies.” Presumably he meant one-eighth the size, and that’s before he gives Iran tens of billions, just for starters. He even compares the U.S. defense budget of $600 billion, with his politically correct dumbing down of standards, and our international obligations, with Iran’s $15 billion focused on its lean, mean regional terrorist machine.

Obama says Israelis have a “deep skepticism” of Iran and its “ideology of anti-Semitism.” That paradigm might describe Obama’s one-time spiritual mentor Rev. Jeremiah Wright and his colleague, Lewis Farrakhan. They call Jews names. Iran’s rulers want to exterminate Jews. Of course, Kerry says not to take such statements seriously.

Obama correctly said yesterday the growth of ISIL has benefitted Iran. But here’s what he didn’t say: Near its inception, ISIL could have been destroyed. But Obama ignored and belittled intelligence briefings warning him about ISIL. In his speech, Obama disingenuously said we should approve his deal to “confront the immediate and lethal threat posed by ISIL.” That’s chutzpah.

The Iran Deal Is Precursor to War, Not a Block to It

Two days ago at the White House, on President Obama’s birthday, his supporter and friend Lee Rosenberg critically questioned the president about a familiar administration theme pushed hard by Kerry and Obama that the “the same people” who promoted the Iraq war now want a war with Iran. Obama was defensive, then threatened that if the deal did not go through, Iran would attack Israel.

The message tonight must be that no deal is better than this deal.

But Obama yesterday in his speech returned to his recurring theme: his current opponents are Iraq War retreads. Former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren says he opposed the Iraq war and many Israeli leaders thought it imprudent, but as allies they supported the United States. Sen. Ben Cardin from Maryland, a Democrat who is leaning increasingly against the Iran deal, notes he voted against the Iraq war and finds the Obama-Kerry line offensive. So does liberal Democrat Alan Dershowitz, the famous Harvard Law School professor who also opposed the Iraq war.

Tonight the candidates must seem reasonable and not reinforce Obama’s caricature of trigger-happy Republicans. They must explain how Obama’s deal, even if Iran keeps to the agreement, empowers its nuclear military capability. The deal not only insures a generation of graduated terrorism and rampant warfare, but far worse, a nuclear threat to our homeland.

America is weary of war, especially ground conflicts imprudently fought on the enemy’s terms. The message tonight must be that no deal is better than this deal, and Democrats and Republicans should work together for a strategy to prevent Iran from closure on its nuclear weapons program.

The 3 Saddest Things About Hillary Clinton Comparing Pro-Lifers To Terrorists,"Hillary Clinton compared pro-lifers to terrorists on Thursday. Really. Even the liberal Talking Points Memo admits “Hillary Clinton Compares Anti-Abortion Republicans To Terrorists.”

You can watch it here, if you’d like:

She says:

Now, extreme views about women, we expect that from some of the terrorist groups, we expect that from people who don’t want to live in the modern world, but it’s a little hard to take from Republicans who want to be President of the United States, yet espouse out of date, out of touch policies. They are dead wrong for 21st century for America. We are going forward. We are not going back.

Her erratic comments showing contempt for those who oppose ending human lives after they’ve begun come in the midst of a campaign that has gone from presumed coronation to questionable, if well-funded, proposition over the past few months.

Here are the three saddest things about someone using such uncivil language against Americans opposed to ending unborn human life.

1) The reversion to the failed War on Women

Democrats have been engaged in something called the “War on Women” since 2010. Women—so long as they stay single and don’t get married—are a key component of Democratic victories. This explains a bit about why ABC’s George Stephanopoulos introduced “contraception” questions, of all things, into the 2012 Republican primary debates.

It seems the War on Women messaging has reached a limit.

Others in the media played along as well, trumpeting Sandra Fluke, the grad student who fought to force religious employers to provide contraception and abortifacients for free in employee benefit packages. Interesting side note is that her public relations campaign (you didn’t think she ended up on your nightly news by chance, did you?) was handled by SKDKnickerbocker — the public relations firm handling the current Planned Parenthood scandal.

It worked really well—President Obama lost married women by 7 points but won single women by a stunning 36 percentage points.

It worked really well, that is, until it didn’t.

2014 should have been the War on Women’s best year. You had Texas State Sen. Wendy Davis running for governor after leading a dramatic filibuster of a late-term abortion ban. Sen. Mark Udall, reliable abortion rights supporter, built his entire campaign around an attempt to portray his opponent—the cheerful Cory Gardner—as an opponent of “women’s health” (the euphemism for abortion used by people who support the right to end the lives of unborn children). And the poster child of the entire War on Women movement—Fluke—tried to win a race for a California legislator position.

Davis’ campaign could not have had more mainstream media support. From head to toe-filled tennis shoes, she was profiled and praised on nearly every major network and cable news outlet, in nearly every major political magazine, and throughout the websites and print editions of the country’s top newspapers. Udall didn’t even need to run a War on Women campaign, so easy was his re-election bid supposed to be. And Fluke raised more than $1 million for her little run.

Fluke’s Democratic opponent beat her by more than 20 points. It was a disaster for Planned Parenthood.

But they all crashed and burned. Davis garnered no more votes than another Democrat who didn’t even run a campaign. Udall’s obsession against pro-lifers was so over-the-top that the media dubbed him “Senator Uterus.” And Fluke’s Democratic opponent beat her by more than 20 points. It was a disaster for Planned Parenthood, which spent quite a bit of money trying to elect Democrats as part of the War on Women campaign.

So while Democrats are heavily incentivized to keep women single and, therefore, as reliable Democratic voters, it seems the War on Women messaging has reached a limit. If Udall went too far by saying outlandish things about his opponent, why would Hillary Clinton think that meant she should behave even more irrationally in her attempt to rescue her flailing campaign? She hasn’t learned the lessons Wendy Davis, Sandra Fluke and Sen. Mark Udall had to learn the hard way in 2014.

2) Planned Parenthood and its defender Hillary Clinton overuse hyperbolic statements

Listen, abortion is a difficult topic. Some people, particularly many of those in the media and Democratic political positions, believe that abortion should be legal at any time, for any reason, and throughout the entire pregnancy. Others believe that killing unborn children for any reason other than danger to the life of the mother is a tragedy that civilized societies should not support. Most Americans believe abortion should be limited but not banned altogether.

Clinton’s whole campaign is based on her not sounding like someone who has no control over her emotions or actions.

Yes, Planned Parenthood treats any position outside of theirs as extreme. But while the relationship between Planned Parenthood and the Democratic Party couldn’t be cozier, this is a tiresome rhetorical posture to take. When Planned Parenthood’s Cecile Richards was interviewed about her organization’s participation in an organ-harvesting scheme, she kept calling the people who had uncovered the practice “militant” and “sensational” and “extremists.” She sounded histrionic.

Presidential candidates need to gin up excitement and votes. That’s true. That’s definitely true for the flailing Clinton campaign. But calling people who defend human life “terrorists” is completely unbecoming of someone seeking to be president of a country such as ours. I know Donald Trump’s bombastic style is having an effect on other candidates, but Clinton’s whole campaign is based on her not sounding like someone who has no control over her emotions or actions. Calling people who care about human life “terrorists” suggests a lack of balance and thoughtfulness in someone who is already viewed as dishonest and deceptive.

I mean, I hate to pull this card but even Meghan McCain was down on it:

Hillary comparing pro-life Republicans to terrorists is a new low, even by Clinton campaign standards. Truly ignorant and desperate.

3) The extremism of supporting organ harvesting

But here’s the thing: there really is an extreme position in today’s abortion debate. Every week we learn more about the practice of harvesting organs for sale from unborn victims of abortion. I thought of this after reading a pair of tweets from Ryan Lizza:

I’m a little surprised that Clinton comparing GOP candidates to “terrorists” today isn’t getting more attention.



Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) August 27, 2015

What is ISIS’s view on federal funding for Planned Parenthood?



Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) August 27, 2015

It was meant as a joke, except that, well, it’s not a joke! As Stephen Miller put it:

People who support the harvesting of organs from victims, which ISIS does, don’t get to call other people terrorists. It’s as simple as that.

I know that Hillary Clinton is already in trouble with Planned Parenthood for stepping out of line a few weeks ago and admitting that the undercover videos were deeply disturbing. And asking for apologies is frequently a fool’s errand, so I won’t make such a request.

However, calling people who support the sanctity of human life “terrorists” is itself unsettling, unbecoming, and deeply wrong.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/08/28/the-3-saddest-things-about-hillary-clinton-comparing-pro-lifers-to-terrorists/,2015-08-28
ISIS Is A Storm We May Not Weather,"Once again, Islamist terrorism has reached out and wreaked havoc in the West. On Friday night, ISIS gunmen and suicide bombers took the lives of 129 men and women and injured hundreds more. In the midst of this horror, President Francoise Hollande declared a territory-wide state of emergency and closed France’s borders. This is the second state of emergency called in the French hexagon since 1945, indicating the severity of the situation, as well as the government’s uncertainty about how to contain it.

Sadly, though, France is no stranger to terrorist attacks. The Armed Islamic Group (one of the main insurgent groups in the Algerian civil war) was responsible for the 1994 hijacking of Air France flight 8969, and bombings in 1995 and 1996 that killed more than a dozen and injured hundreds.

These attacks were extensions of the ongoing civil war in Algeria, something that separates them from the more recent model of Islamist terrorism in France. They were perpetrated by Algerians in the context of France’s colonial past and the still-bitter memory of the Algerian war for independence. Their motivations were largely political and easily identifiable.

The new model of terrorism, which includes Mohammed Merah’s killing spree in Toulouse (2012), three separate incidences involving a stabbing and vehicle rammings by men yelling “allahu akbar” (2014), and the Charlie Hebdo massacre (January 2015), has more to do with religious fervor than political goals.

It is a new kind of enemy that France, along with the rest of the world, faces. It’s a threat that doesn’t belong to just one country or nationality, but rather is united in global militant Islamism. Because of this, it is far more dangerous.

Did Charlie Hebdo Teach Us Nothing?

Friday’s attack comes just ten months after Islamists gunned down employees at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo for publishing images of Mohammed. Afterward, there was international outpouring of sympathy with the twitter hash tag #jesuischarlie (“I am Charlie”) saturating social media.

People became more concerned with fighting Islamaphobia than with fighting radical Islam.

Yet those sentiments were quickly put aside in the name of tolerance. People became more concerned with fighting Islamaphobia than with fighting radical Islam. When Charlie Hebdo won the PEN freedom of speech award, several prominent authors boycotted, citing the publication’s “cultural intolerance” toward Islam.

What makes this weekend’s atrocity especially upsetting is the feeling that it could perhaps have been avoided. Perhaps if, upon the genuine emotional outpouring after the Charlie Hedbo massacre, people had then thought seriously about its causes and been willing to face the real threat of ISIS, maybe if they hadn’t so quickly taken refuge in the politically correct rhetoric of Islamaphobia, as President Obama did, if we weren’t all so afraid of offending, some of these lives might have been saved. It feels like the writing was on the wall.

We’re Deliberately Not Getting the Message

This is not to say that the French government has done nothing. After Charlie Hebdo, they passed a massive surveillance bill giving them more powers to monitor French citizens. They also joined United States-led aerial bombings of ISIS after intelligence emerged that Muslim French men were being recruited to train with ISIS, not to fight with them in the Middle East, but explicitly to return home to carry out attacks.

Muslim French men were being recruited to train with ISIS, not to fight with them in the Middle East, but explicitly to return home to carry out attacks.

However, what persisted after Charlie Hebdo, and what continues to plague the Western world, is a paralyzing level of political correctness that prevents us from naming the real problem. For all the hand wringing and hashtags, the denial continued.

Our supposed solidarity with those who were killed was only a knee-jerk, albeit well-intentioned, reaction to the tragedy. People weren’t willing to go further and commit intellectually to the idea that there is a problem with militant Islam. Instead, the insistence that Islam was being “hijacked” drowned out the fact that groups like ISIS have just as much of a “right” to claim Islam as their religion as the many peaceful Muslims around the world do.

Within hours of the Paris attack on Friday, people had changed their Facebook photos to show solidarity with France. Monuments around the world were lit up in red, white, and blue. There was a brief moment of hope while watching the terror unfold that this time things would be different. That there would be no defense of the terrorists’ actions because this time the victims were people who had made no provocation or political statement. That this time, perhaps, it would be harder for people to make excuses. They couldn’t turn away from the reality of our world in the twenty-first century: radical Islam is real, they truly believe what they do is their religious duty, and they aren’t going to stop.

Yet, less than 24 hours after the attacks, the top-trending hashtag on Twitter was “Muslims are not terrorists.” Somehow that became the main takeaway from the horror. Not the dozens dead, or their mourning families. Not the motives of the killers or their affiliation with a group that strictly interprets and enforces Sharia law.

We Can’t Fight What We Won’t See

The media was appallingly quick to run to Islam’s defense. Salon published a piece Saturday morning titled “Our terrorism double standard: After Paris, let’s stop blaming Muslims and take a hard look at ourselves.” Before the dead were counted, or the families and friends notified, before anyone had much time to process the scale and sophistication of the attacks and what they portend for the future, the sentry had stepped forward to proclaim that this is a problem not with any sect of Islam, but with us, the contemptible West. ISIS is openly calling the Paris attack the “first of the storm” while we’re fretting over whether this might give Islam a bad image.

ISIS is openly calling the Paris attack the ‘first of the storm’ while we’re fretting over whether this might give Islam a bad image.

The point is not that all Muslims are suspect or that monolithic Islam is to blame. Nor that countries should unilaterally shut down immigration from Syria and Iraq. But neither should we avoid talking about the violent and radical sects that do exist within Islam and that have as their explicit goal attacking the West, whose way of life they so despise. We cannot ignore that at least one of the attackers got to France via Greece with other migrants from Syria, and that this could be a real source of terrorist infiltration.

We must be able to name our enemies. How can we possibly “destroy and degrade” ISIS if we don’t even acknowledge their motivations? At the Democratic Party primary debate Saturday night, Hillary Clinton repeatedly refused to say “radical Islam,” opting for the euphemistic “jihadi terrorism” instead.

Even Charlie Hebdo fell prey to this thinking this weekend. In a cartoon, they discussed the importance of naming one’s enemies, and in the next breath said our enemies are “those who love death.” Certainly. But in this case, that moniker belongs to militant Islam.

Everyone Doesn’t Want Peace

While the attacks were still in progress, Obama declared them an attack on “all of humanity” and the “universal values we share.” He, like many others, mistakenly thinks that everyone fundamentally wants peace and love and acceptance and tolerance. He lacks the imagination (or the historical knowledge) to see that people don’t all share the same values.

This world isn’t an ivory tower utopia. In the real world, people sometimes believe in something so fervently that they’re willing to do great violence.

We need to understand the values that ISIS and its followers around the world genuinely hold, and which are rooted in their interpretation of Islam. Putting a French flag filter over your Facebook picture is well-intentioned, but almost entirely meaningless, because for most people it is a hollow pledge of solidarity. Without letting go of our fear of offending, and opening up an honest and uncomfortable conversation about the serious and real threats of militant Islamism, we will not weather this storm.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/16/isis-is-a-storm-we-may-not-weather/,2015-11-16
Obama On ISIS: I'm Not Interested In 'America Winning',"During a press conference detailing his administration’s strategy to destroy ISIS following several devastating terrorist attacks in Paris, President Barack Obama said he’s not interested in “pursuing some notion of American leadership or America winning[.]”

Obama’s remarks came several days after ISIS attacks in Paris that killed over 120 people and injured scores of others. Friday night’s attacks on France are believed to be the deadliest terrorist attacks in the country’s history.

“What I’m not interested in doing is posing or pursuing some notion of ‘American leadership’ or ‘America winning”’ –POTUS



Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) November 16, 2015

Throughout Monday’s press conference, Obama insisted that his strategy for defeating ISIS was working and did not need to change. On Friday, just hours before the deadly Paris attacks, the president insisted in a television interview with ABC News that his administration had “contained” ISIS.

Obama’s tone during Monday’s press conference alternated between defensive and disinterested. The two-term Democratic president repeatedly insisted that his strategy was working and scoffed at demands to change his plan to confront and defeat ISIS.

“What I’m not interested in doing is posing or pursuing some notion of American leadership or America winning or whatever other slogans they come up with that has no relationship to what is actually going to work to protect the American people and to protect the people in the region who are getting killed and to protect our allies and people like France,” Obama said. “I’m too busy for that.”

To prove that he was on top of the terrorist threat, Obama noted that he regularly meets with his national security team to review and respond to ongoing threats against the U.S.

“Every few weeks I meet with my entire National Security team,” Obama told the crowd of reporters.

Towards the end of the press conference, Obama shifted away from ISIS and targeted Republicans instead. He specifically attacked Senators Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for opposing Obama’s policy of allowing refugees from Syria to enter the U.S. The latest intelligence out of France suggests that at least one of the attackers responsible for Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris entered Europe as a refugee from Syria.

Stop Treating Radical Islam Like Voldemort,"This is a national security election now.

That’s the upshot for domestic American politics of the massive terrorist attack in Paris.

Is it too early to “politicize” this, to assess its impact on the presidential contest? Sorry, but this is what politics is for, particularly presidential politics. We’re picking the next commander-in-chief, someone who will have wide discretion over how to respond — or not respond — to a threat like this. We’d better know as soon as possible whether they’re up to it.

And we’ve just been reminded that one party really isn’t up to it. In fact, they’re caught up in a radical denial about radical Islam.

That’s the takeaway from Saturday night’s Democratic debate. Given how it turned out, some are wondering whether the Democratic candidates should have asked for the debate to be postponed. Apparently, one of Bernie Sanders’s people actually pitched a fit over the fact that the candidates were suddenly going to have to speak about foreign policy. But when a crisis hits, the president doesn’t get to ask for another week to get his act together. If the candidates want the office, they need to show us they’re prepared to respond to an event like this immediately.

They aren’t.

The first response of the debate was given by Sanders. With a full minute to respond to the events in Paris — and about 24 hours to prepare — he could not bring himself to talk about it for so much as 20 seconds before reverting to his stump speech on income inequality. Here’s the video of the full opening section of the debate.

Sanders’ response to Paris and ISIS is from the 3:38 mark to 3:57 — a full 19 seconds, the limit to which he could spread his attention span on a genuine national security issue.

Hillary Clinton seemed to take the issue more seriously, but not seriously enough to have anything specific to say. Instead, she assured us she will have a position some time in the future: “I will be laying out in detail what I think we need to do with our friends and allies in Europe and elsewhere to do a better job of coordinating efforts against the scourge of terrorism.”

For Democrats, radical Islam is the Ideology-That-Must-Not-Be-Named.

The essence of Martin O’Malley’s answer was that “We must be able to work collaboratively with others,” which is the sort of thing you say when applying for a job at a middling graphic design firm. I think this excuses us from the necessity of mentioning him again.

But the most revealing exchange came when moderator John Dickerson — who really showed how a good debate with good follow-up question is done — pressed the candidates on whether they would use the phrase “radical Islam.” He even went so far as to explain that “the critique is that the softness of language betrays a softness of approach, so if this language — if you don’t call it by what it is, how can your approach be effective?” He couldn’t get a single one of the candidates to use the words. Clinton demurred, “I don’t want us to be painting with too broad a brush.” Sanders declared, “I don’t think the term is what’s important.” The term “radical Islam” is so unimportant that he still wouldn’t use it.

For Democrats, radical Islam is the Ideology-That-Must-Not-Be-Named.

You know what this reminds me of? Lately, I’ve been reading the Harry Potter books to my kids. I’m actually quite grateful for it at the moment because my boys are going to hear some of the news of war and terrorism, and the books give them an understandable frame of reference for the existence and nature of that kind of evil in the world.

But readers of these stories will remember that there is a taboo on the name of the main villain, Lord Voldemort, who is referred to only as “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named” or “You-Know-Who.” It is a special mark of defiance when our heroes refer to him openly as Voldemort or even by his more prosaic original name, Tom Riddle.

Yet we have a bunch of serious adults running around acting as if the phrase “radical Islam” has been jinxed. All they can offer is oblique references to You-Know-What. Everyone knows we’re talking about Islam, that the Paris attack wasn’t planned and executed by the Presbyterians, but they have a superstitious awe of saying the words.

As Harry Potter’s mentor Dumbledore explains, “Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.” Part of the point of saying the name is to show that you’re not cowed into submission. And the effect of refusing to say it is to show that you are cowed.

But it’s deeper than just expressing defiance. To be able to name a thing is to be able to think about it. Without a word for it, you begin to lose the concept and the meaning. You literally cannot discuss important aspects of what it is, and you will be prevented from reaching meaningful conclusions.

To be able to name a thing is to be able to think about it. Without a word for it, you begin to lose the concept and the meaning.

Long ago, my wife made the same point to me about the prohibition on depicting Mohammed in art — another taboo superstitiously accepted by our cultural elites. To be unable to paint or draw something is to cut off a whole avenue of thought and expression on the subject. It is to give over mental control of the issue to those who impose the taboo.

Cut off your thinking on this issue, for example, and you might end up concluding the climate change and the (supposed) resulting competition over natural resources is the cause of terrorism — Sanders’ big howler of the night. Or that the way to defy terrorism is to take a lot of political donations from Wall Street — Clinton’s big howler of the night.

In short, you get pretty much what you saw at the Democratic debate: candidates who, being unable to name “radical Islam,” don’t seem to have spent much time thinking about it and how to respond and were therefore unprepared when that question suddenly become a central issue of the election.

All of which is to say that national security coming front and center will tend to tilt the election in favor of Republicans — but not equally.

Some Republicans suffer from their own taboos on the subject and are looking equally inadequate to the moment. Rand Paul was already fading, and this will prevent him from recovering. He may still have an audience among a hard core of libertarian anti-interventionists who think it’s okay to look at national security primarily as an issue of excessive federal spending. But that’s not a mainstream Republican position. If he sticks to it, he’s going to be the guy who looks like he’s at the wrong party’s debate.

For Donald Trump and Ben Carson, being an outsider with no foreign policy experience is going to become a liability. For Trump, being a guy who likes to run his mouth without thinking very hard about it is going to be an even bigger liability. A lot of Americans aren’t going to be able to imagine either of these men as commander-in-chief.

That brings me back to an observation I made in April, when he launched his campaign: that a foreign policy crisis will tend to push Marco Rubio to the center of the campaign. He’s the only candidate who has been emphasizing this issue and making it central to his campaign from the beginning. To be sure, he’s by far the most hawkish and the most committed to George W. Bush style democracy-promotion, which should make the contrast between him and Ted Cruz — the most interesting exchange of the last Republican debate — the new central issue of the Republican primary.

The scale of the Paris attacks concentrates the mind, particularly since we know that if it can happen in Paris, it can happen in New York City or Washington, D.C. If it can happen at the Bataclan theater, it can happen at Lincoln Center. Sure, maybe the shock of the news from Paris will fade between now and next November. I hope we are so lucky, but it seems a bit too much to ask. Online, the jihadists are already boasting, “The American blood is best, and we will taste it soon.” They’re certainly going to try.

To the extent that they try again in Europe or here, this is going to remain a national security election. And only one party has candidates who are really prepared to think about that.

16 Of The Worst Ways To Respond To ISIS’ Paris Attack,"Under President Francois Hollande, the French began their military and legal response to the horrific terror attacks that hit Paris on Friday. ISIS, which took responsibility for the terrorism, threatened the United States that it could be next.

In a video released on Monday, an ISIS fighter says, “I swear to God, as we struck France in its stronghold Paris, we will strike America in its stronghold, Washington.”

CIA director John Brennan said it is obvious that ISIS has an “external agenda” to carry out attacks outside of Syria, is engaged in careful planning toward that end, and that Paris was not the only operation that the group has in the pipeline.

Here are some of the misguided ways various people have responded to the threats posed by ISIS.

1) Obama’s Press Conference

President Obama made some brief comments on the evening of the attacks. “We stand prepared and ready to provide whatever assistance the people of France need to respond,” he said. Also, “This is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values we share.” He didn’t explain which universal values he was referring to or how the attacks occurred if the values are, in fact, universal. The attacks took place the day after Obama said ISIS, a group he once dismissed as the “JV” team, was being contained. ISIS had also just taken responsibility for bombing Beirut and downing a Russian jet.

He also addressed the situation at a press conference at the G20 summit in Turkey on Monday. In both encounters with the press, Obama seemed subdued. In Monday’s, he became righteously angry only when talking about Republicans who oppose his policies.

This was an unfortunate posture to take since he had a profoundly important task of trying to sell Americans on the idea that not much would change about U.S. attempts to fight ISIS while also telling other countries to do more. He haltingly discussed how he always knew it would take a long time to fight ISIS and that what happened in Paris was a “setback.” He said that other countries need to “step up” their resources, share more information, and strengthen their border controls. He also said the U.S. was showing how to take refugees from the conflict in Syria while also ensuring security of the country. These aren’t necessarily bad approaches to take, but he said all this while showing very little emotion or interest. It went over like a lead balloon.

Instead of assuring or reassuring Americans that the refugee program has good security controls, Obama conveyed precisely the opposite.

Instead of assuring or reassuring Americans that the refugee program has good security controls, he conveyed precisely the opposite. By the end of the day, some 26 governors had publicly said refugees couldn’t relocate to their states unless and until security concerns were addressed.

But even the press seemed shocked at Obama’s curiously detached, professorial posture. The first reporter asked, “The equation has clearly changed. Isn’t it time for your strategy to change?” The next question was, “Have you underestimated their abilities?” The next question asked whether Obama’s strategy “makes the United States weaker and emboldens our enemies.” That was followed by, “Why can’t we take out these bastards?” And the next reporter asked him if he was even concerned about ISIS before asking, “Do you think you really understand this enemy well enough to defeat them and to protect the homeland?”

When the press, which no objective observer would call hostile to the president, is asking questions such as these, it should be a wake-up call to Obama about the need to at least act like he takes the problem more seriously. Instead he responded with defensiveness and derision.

I actually support much of Obama’s strategy, as stated in this press conference, for dealing with ISIS. And yet rather than selling the idea that this was a strategy that would result in the best possible outcome, he sounded an almost defeatist tone as he claimed a lack of interest in notions of victory. When part of your foreign policy strategy is avoidance of another messy land war, it is absolutely incumbent on you that you communicate why it’s the best possible path. Instead of that, this press conference probably did more to make people think that war is the only solution to ISIS and that the current foreign policy leadership has no idea what it’s doing.

2) All Renditions of “Imagine”

Peter Cook had a great conspiracy theory yesterday: “John Lennon did not write ‘Imagine.’ I think Yoko did, and that’s why it is so terrible.”

The day after Paris was attacked, a man rode up with a piano and began playing “Imagine” to a crowd of mourners. People really enjoyed this. Then Coldplay did a cover of the song.

There are so many problems with “Imagine” on a good day — the lyrics are embarrassingly juvenile as well as godless and communistic. But for the aftermath of an attack that hit people at soccer stadiums, restaurants and music venues, I’m not sure even the lyrics “Imagine all the people/Living for today” work. I mean, enjoying the evening was precisely what the murder victims in Paris were doing at the moment they were gunned down by murderous Islamist radicals.

Simply pick a better song that doesn’t make you seem like you are literally at Chris Martin levels of maturity.

3) Opining On “What ISIS Wants”

When journalists and pundits didn’t support a particular course of action, they began claiming that the opposite was what “ISIS wants,” as if this would be a really effective argument. A few samples (links here, here and here):

ISIS leaders are actually pretty straightforward about what they want. And if you want to read just one article that gets to the heart of who they are and why they exist, I’d recommend “What ISIS Really Wants” from Graeme Wood earlier this year in The Atlantic. It’s not perfect — toward the end it pooh-poohs the idea that ISIS fighters might want to bring the fight back to their home countries — but it does a good job of explaining their motivation and what they seek.

Wood explains that ISIS is committed “to returning civilization to a seventh-century legal environment, and ultimately to bringing about the apocalypse.” ISIS probably does want you to respond to their attacks by playing Yoko Ono tunes rather than killing them before they can strike again, but that in itself is not reason to avoid playing “Imagine.”

Germany sought war as part of its goals, but that wasn’t a reason to avoid entering World War II. Japan quite obviously provoked the U.S. into entering that same war when it bombed Pearl Harbor. The idea that our country should then have sat it out is also not a tenable argument. And questions about balancing security and humanitarian efforts are not something you toss out the window because ISIS has a policy position on the matter. We are far too advanced to fall for such silly lines of thinking.

Or as this Twitter user noted:

4) Saying ISIS Fears Peace Talks

Green Party foreign affairs spokesperson, Tony Clarke said: “The killing has to stop and world leaders must find a way forward that defeats ISIS using the weapon that these terrorists fear most of all, peace talks.”

Fact check: Not true. ISIS doesn’t fear peace talks at all. Have they not the faintest idea what ISIS even is? This Facebook post that went viral is a bit long but worth sharing.

5) So Much Stupidity in Discussions About Refugees

Millions of people have left Syria in search of better economic prospects or relief from the ongoing civil war. As discussed in “When Is A Refugee Really A Migrant?” there are differences between different groups of people. For refugees, you frequently see entire families leaving and both men and women leaving. For migrants seeking work, different patterns emerge. In the case of the current migrant/refugee crisis, more than 70 percent are adult males, and only about 15 percent are children. It’s unclear why the demographics are so overwhelmingly adult and male, but it’s something journalists and policy makers should be interested in answering, particularly as they position the crisis as one affecting refugees.

Related to this discussion, one of the terrorists in Paris had a Syrian passport with him that he used to come in — with refugees — to France and passed through five countries on his way there.

Obama has promised to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. Some Americans question whether the country’s security bureaucracy would protect against threats from eager ISIS terrorists. Americans are concerned about border security in general, even before wondering if the government can handle something as delicate as a resettlement program. As mentioned above, more than half of the country’s governors are expressing concern about the plan. In fact, only 14 percent of the states are still accepting Syrian refugees. Other Americans say that it’s the country’s humanitarian duty to welcome Syrians. To my mind, both concern for security of the country and for Syrians in need are understandable.

But people pretty much lost their minds when discussing the situation. Some GOP presidential candidates, such as Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie, went way overboard in expressing concerns about security. Others caricatured security concerns with a notable lack of charity:

I actually don’t know enough about how well the U.S. is prepared to handle security risks in refugee and migrant resettlements, although I have spoken to some federal agents whose lack of confidence in bureaucratic handling of the size and speed of the resettlement gives me pause. My heart bleeds for those in need and also for those victims whose countries failed to protect them from exploitation of the refugee crisis. I can’t stop thinking about the family members of all those many Parisians who were killed on Friday.

People seriously need to have a more mature conversation about the seriousness of the problem facing some refugees, the presence of a migrant population seeking economic relief, the reality of security threats, and the challenges of resettlement for both migrants and refugees. And it is the most obvious common sense out there to be concerned about security — that’s basically the first order of business for humans — and the media could really stop all the signaling and moral preening about how people concerned about security are monsters.

6) A Fake Passport Means Governors Are Wrong to Worry

So the Syrian passport used by one of the Paris terrorists appears to be fake, not that this kept its user from registering with it when he arrived with a group of refugees and traveling through various countries with it as he made his way to France.

A Daily Beast story by Michael Weiss and Justin Miller begins this way:

One of the Paris attackers was supposedly found with a Syrian passport—leading Republican governors here in America to vow to block Syrian refugees from entering their states.



But that passport was a fake, French officials told The Wall Street Journal, which means the governors’ freakout over refugees was likely based on a lie.

Later, they wrote:

Texas Gov. Gregg Abott also fell for the ISIS ruse.



“A Syrian ‘refugee’ appears to have been part of the Paris terror attack,” he wrote in a letter to the Obama administration on Monday.

I don’t know how this isn’t obvious to the folks at the Daily Beast, but the fact that ISIS appears to have intentionally and successfully exploited the refugee system to bust an agent into enemy territory only helps the arguments of those concerned about security and refugees. It’s not like the fakeness of the passport means that the terrorist is fake. He was all too real. And it doesn’t mean he didn’t come into enemy territory by claiming to be a refugee. He still did that. And even that Abott specifically scarequoted ‘refugee’ to point out that the terrorists wasn’t an actual refugee but one posing as such means that he didn’t fall for a “ruse.” This is really stupid analysis, in fact.

If people spent a bit of time understanding the arguments of their opponents, they’d understand that the concern isn’t that refugees are all terrorists waiting to attack but that terrorists could pose as refugees. As happened, apparently, in Paris.

7) Mocking People Concerned About Refugees and Security

As seen above, many progressives were mocking people concerned about security risks in light of mass migration and refugee resettlement. Perhaps the best example of this is a whopping 18-minute snarkfest from TV’s John Oliver, an entertainer on HBO.

He relentlessly mocks those who point out that refugee and migrant programs involve tradeoffs — thinking that the mention of appeals to unspecified authorities and jokes and signaling are sufficient retorts that destroy such arguments. The piece, which aired in late September, included the following line:

“And I know lots of people still have fears… fears that migrants might have an ISIS member lurking among them, which there has been no credible example of.”

This elicited the predictable response from partisans.

And when it turned out that such concerns weren’t just rational but realized? Well, moving right along.

8) Migrants Are This Close to Joining ISIS

One of the less successful arguments made by people who encourage more openness to quick migration is exemplified by this piece in the Washington Post headlined, of course, “The Islamic State wants you to hate refugees.”

The piece is very pro-refugee, but it implies that refugees are pretty close to joining ISIS and all it would take to nudge them there is a bit of a snub from Western governments. This is a horrible argument to make to people already concerned that refugees harbor a terrorist or might include people who are close to joining ISIS. This poll, for instance, shows that not-insignificant percentages of refugees have a favorable view of ISIS.

9) Downplaying the Evil of ISIS

This tweet from a Democratic candidate for the Minnesota House has been deleted and, in fact, the campaign has ended. That is probably for the best, as such moral relativism that excuses murderous ideologues who gun down women in cafes is reprehensible.

10) Global Warming Caused ISIS

Just no.

And yes, I know Bernie Sanders says similar things, but if you believe climate change caused ISIS, you are simply not a serious person.

11) Your Hot Gun Control Take

Terrorism isn’t a word meaning “bad thing.” It’s a specific word with a specific definition. So not all bad things are the exact same things as other bad things. Someone tell the Philadelphia mayor, though.

There’s pretending to not understand what motivates ISIS. Then there’s this, from Boston Globe columnist Michael Cohen.

12) A Sudden Interest in Not Politicizing Something

Last month a man fatally shot eight students and a professor at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. The president, his fellow Democratic politicians, and the media immediately politicized the shooting. And I do mean immediately. With bodies still warm, Obama said, “this is something we should politicize.” He asked the media to write stories comparing gun deaths to terrorism, and they did just that.

But in the face of a terrorist attack, many people changed their tune. Then, then, then vs. now. Then, then vs. now.

The idea that we can’t talk about the political implications or solutions to Islamic extremism but must demand gun control (always gun control, never other solutions) at each mass shooting is inconsistent.

13) This Has Nothing to Do With Islam

Pioneered by President George W. Bush, Americans and other leaders are fond of protecting Islam each and every time Muslim terrorists kill people. It is certainly wise to distinguish between different types of Muslims and to encourage and recognize the many Muslims who live in peace with their neighbors. It is also beyond silly how much we pretend the Islam practiced (in this case) by ISIS isn’t a major animating force.

Here was Michael Gerson’s version of the “What ISIS wants” meme that captivated so many pundits this week:

The problem is that ISIS is Islamic. To go back to The Atlantic article referenced above:

The reality is that the Islamic State is Islamic. Very Islamic. Yes, it has attracted psychopaths and adventure seekers, drawn largely from the disaffected populations of the Middle East and Europe. But the religion preached by its most ardent followers derives from coherent and even learned interpretations of Islam.



Could ISIS Exist Without Islam?



Virtually every major decision and law promulgated by the Islamic State adheres to what it calls, in its press and pronouncements, and on its billboards, license plates, stationery, and coins, “the Prophetic methodology,” which means following the prophecy and example of Muhammad, in punctilious detail. Muslims can reject the Islamic State; nearly all do. But pretending that it isn’t actually a religious, millenarian group, with theology that must be understood to be combatted, has already led the United States to underestimate it and back foolish schemes to counter it. We’ll need to get acquainted with the Islamic State’s intellectual genealogy if we are to react in a way that will not strengthen it, but instead help it self-immolate in its own excessive zeal.

14) This White House Talking Point

VOX may not be taken very seriously, but it’s worth remembering that it funnels White House talking points. So consider that this may be something the White House wishes were believed.

Nailed it!

15) Enthusiastic Late Night Hosts Aren’t an Actual Victory Strategy

People really enjoyed a few of the late night shows’ reactions to the Paris terror attacks.

Oh no he di’int! Suh-nap! That John Oliver is amazing. He just “destroyed” ISIS!

Oh wait, no. They’re still totally thriving and killing Parisians, beheading Christians, and raping women. I guess we’ll have to come up with another plan.

16) Atheist Biblesplaining

One of the hottest responses to the Parisian terror attacks was to not just stop talking about ISIS by talking about all the refugees you care about more than the other guy. And one of the most popular ways to do that was by referencing Mary and Joseph not finding a room at an inn when they traveled to Bethlehem for the census.

So this abortion enthusiast, for instance, offered:

An “ultra-liberal gay atheist university professor from Massachusetts” wondered “How many conservatives who now turn away desperate Middle-Easterners seeking refuge will soon be putting up a Nativity?” Shaun King quoted Leviticus, of all books of the Bible, to attempt to shame those concerned about protecting the security of their families and neighbors.

One satirical Twitter account explained the silliness of these tweets that spread with righteous indignation throughout social media.

Like you, I love being lectured about human decency by people who defend Planned Parenthood. But since when did liberals decide the Bible should be the basis of public policy? Imagine the implications for marriage law! Except it’s not that they want the Bible to be the basis of public policy. They want their facile and smorgasbord-like interpretation of the Bible to be the basis for public policy.

Loving your neighbor is both simple and complex. Preserving security is a form of loving your near neighbors. Welcoming the foreigner is a form of loving other neighbors. These are at times competing concerns, and Christian theologians have discussed what to do in times of conflict for thousands of years. Americans would do well to learn from those discussions.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/17/16-of-the-worst-ways-to-respond-to-isis-paris-attack/,2015-11-17
11 Ways To Hate America Without Terrorism,"It takes a peculiar sort of narcissism to persuade yourself that your nation is so important, it could keep the whole world in line just by being nice. This delusion runs amok following a major terrorist attack, as partisans of the “Blame America First” school of thought come out of the woodwork. “Repent!” they tell us, “and we will all be saved!”

Foreigners, you see, are not really responsible for their atrocities. Thinking over the bad things we’ve done (from drone strikes to Monsanto to heinous carbon emissions), these Americans find that, actually, they do have some common ground with radical Islamists! They hate themselves, too.

When You Agree with Terrorists, They Win

If you’re a civilian, projecting this hangdog attitude is probably your most effective means of letting terrorists win. Radical Islam is a whirlwind of furious nihilism, and wherever it goes, its soldiers have a canny way of targeting the liveliest nerve. In the Middle East they destroy churches and murder people for their religious beliefs. Here, they strike at the heart of our economic and military power. In France, it’s cultural hot spots that find themselves in the crosshairs.

Why do they do this? Well, in the first place, terrorists are evil. They’re hoping to make us suffer by destroying what we most love. But there’s a strategic angle here, too. If you aren’t strong enough (yet?) to win through conventional warfare, it helps to undercut and demoralize your enemies. Poke their insecurities. Strangle and demean their greatest sources of confidence. Persuade them to think of themselves as the kind of people who don’t really deserve to win.

Judging by the president’s recent speech (and my social media feed), this strategy is paying considerable dividends. Quite a lot of people seem to be of the opinion that the world’s problems are more or less exclusively our fault, such that the only responsible course is to take full responsibility for the mortal enemies who terrorize us and our allies.

Stop Showing Weakness

I’m proud to be an American. That doesn’t mean I have an idyllic, Pollyannaish view of America’s role in the world. Of course we have defects. Of course we’ve made mistakes. It could hardly be otherwise in a fallen, uncertain world. Nevertheless, the weakest and most vulnerable are still better off when America is strong, confident, and willing to stand up to bloodthirsty men who would rule the world through fear.

Paris is grieving. We know ISIS has America in its sights. Our current president is obviously unserious about responding to this wanton aggression. What we really need now is strength, not self-indulgent simpering masquerading as introspection.

Therefore, I call on all my self-loathing compatriots to find another outlet for their insecurities. Here are some good, cathartic suggestions for those who are not so proud to be American.

1. Skip the Turkey

Thanksgiving is a wonderful holiday in which we remember the people who risked everything to help build a free society. If you’re not pleased with the results, why celebrate? Put down the pumpkin and convert Thanksgiving into World Cultures Day, when you can enjoy some borsht, paella, or Szechuan beef while reading excerpts from the Quran or Bhagavad Gita.

2. Burn Your Sports Paraphernalia

Americans have created some amazing sports, many of which are now beloved the world over. Basketball has made substantial inroads into Europe and Asia. The World Baseball Classic has proven that top-notch baseball is played in many countries across the globe. Meanwhile, the homeland remains the stronghold of the world’s single greatest sport: American football.

If you’re ashamed of America’s influence on the world, you’ll probably want to avoid these. Burn the jerseys and the No. 1 fingers! Quit your fantasy teams! What kind of person takes pleasure in a signature accomplishment of the Worst Nation on Earth?

3. Boycott Small-Town Parades

This is especially imperative on the Fourth of July. You know the sort of thing: ticker-tape floats with beauty queens, high-school marching bands and kids waving tiny flags. To an anti-America American, small-town parades are a disgusting cesspool of Americana. Skip them and curl up with a Theodore Dreiser novel instead.

Also to be avoided: flea markets, bowling alleys, and state or county fairs.

4. Shun Chocolate Chip Cookies

Did you know that this little piece of heaven was created right here in the good old U.S. of A? Ruth Graves, owner of the popular Toll House Inn in Whitman, Massachusetts, included it in her restaurant cookbook in 1938, and it quickly became beloved nationwide. Put the cookie down, America-haters.

Other forbidden foods on the Blame America First diet: barbecue, bourbon, apple pie (especially if baked by mom), Coca Cola, brownies, hot dogs (double demerits if eaten at a ball park), cold-climate fruits, peanut butter, cheeseburgers, s’mores, and root beer. Also, no drink refills of any kind. That’s insanely American.

5. Quit the Kiwanis Club

Americans have always distinguished themselves by their penchant for voluntary associations. Alexis de Tocqueville noted this, and while voluntary associations may have fallen off a bit since Tocqueville’s day, we still have an impressive number from the American Legion to the Knights of Columbus to Little League. We also have lots of voluntary giving of time and money. If you’re souring on the United States, show it by sitting out the next Parent-Teacher Association meeting.

6. Stick To Opera

America is a paradise of amazing fusion music. We can thank the American South for jazz and blues, while bluegrass combined those influences with Celtic instruments to make another spirited American musical style. Rock, hip hop, techno, barbershop, and gospel music should probably also be stricken from your playlists.

7. Lighten Up On Personal Hygiene

Americans are a very clean people. Multiple immigrant friends have told me how startling it was to them to learn that they were expected, in the United States, to shower every single day. We have an ongoing love affair with deodorant. We frown on (public) bodily emissions that many other cultures take far less seriously. If you’d like to be less American, try skipping a shower, or getting some distance from your Speed Stick.

8. Stay Away From Texas

You might be able to hunker down in certain enclaves of Austin, but basically, Texas oozes America from every pore.

9. Spit On A Tree

Americans aren’t the only nature-lovers in the world, of course, but we are awfully enthusiastic about it. Multiple times I’ve found myself abroad, explaining in broken Foreign (aka, some language that isn’t English) that yes, I’m looking for a trail just for the walking! It’s not about getting to a particular place! (Not every culture appreciates hiking.) Or I might be trying to explain that yes, we actually want to sleep outside under the stars and cook over a fire. Americans do this for fun!

It makes sense that we would appreciate our Great Outdoors. From the Shenandoah Valley to the Grand Canyon to the majestic Rockies, we have a lot of beautiful nature on these shores.

10. Don’t Smile Too Much

You notice this traveling abroad: Americans are very smiley. We grin at strangers on streets and beam at cameras. A stranger is a friend you’ve never met! Except not for you, anti-Americans. Turn that smile upside-down. You’ll feel that angst draining out of you in no time.

11. Watch a Telenovela

You could also do “Spirit of the Beehive” or “Flowers of Shanghai” if that’s more your speed, but sitcoms, Hollywood films, and musicals are obviously offensively American, along with Westerns and a host of old standards. Hitchcock? Sinatra? Forget about it. Anime, anybody?

Drawing on this list, America skeptics should be able to vent their hostile feelings without running for office, or leaving motivators sprinkled all over the Internet for foreign terrorists to enjoy. No need to help terrorists ruin things for everyone. It’s easy enough just to ruin them for you.

Obama Admin Paused Iraq Refugee Program In 2011,"Although the Obama administration currently refuses to temporarily pause its Syrian refugee resettlement program in the United States, the State Department in 2011 stopped processing Iraq refugee requests for six months after the Federal Bureau of Investigation uncovered evidence that several dozen terrorists from Iraq had infiltrated the United States via the refugee program.

Slamming the door in the face of refugees would betray our deepest values. That’s not who we are. And it’s not what we’re going to do.



President Obama (@POTUS) November 18, 2015

After two terrorists were discovered in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in 2009, the FBI began reviewing reams of evidence taken from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that had been used against American troops in Iraq. Federal investigators then tried to match fingerprints from those bombs to the fingerprints of individuals who had recently entered the United States as refugees:

An intelligence tip initially led the FBI to Waad Ramadan Alwan, 32, in 2009. The Iraqi had claimed to be a refugee who faced persecution back home — a story that shattered when the FBI found his fingerprints on a cordless phone base that U.S. soldiers dug up in a gravel pile south of Bayji, Iraq on Sept. 1, 2005. The phone base had been wired to unexploded bombs buried in a nearby road. An ABC News investigation of the flawed U.S. refugee screening system, which was overhauled two years ago, showed that Alwan was mistakenly allowed into the U.S. and resettled in the leafy southern town of Bowling Green, Kentucky, a city of 60,000 which is home to Western Kentucky University and near the Army’s Fort Knox and Fort Campbell. Alwan and another Iraqi refugee, Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 26, were resettled in Bowling Green even though both had been detained during the war by Iraqi authorities, according to federal prosecutors.

The terrorists were not taken into custody until 2011. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. State Department stopped processing refugee requests from Iraqis for six months in order to review and revamp security screening procedures:

As a result of the Kentucky case, the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ABC News – even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets. One Iraqi who had aided American troops was assassinated before his refugee application could be processed, because of the immigration delays, two U.S. officials said. In 2011, fewer than 10,000 Iraqis were resettled as refugees in the U.S., half the number from the year before, State Department statistics show.

According to a 2013 report from ABC News, at least one of the Kentucky terrorists passed background and fingerprint checks conducted by the Department of Homeland Security prior to being allowed to enter the United States. Without the fingerprint evidence taken from roadside bombs, which one federal forensic scientist referred to as “a needle in the haystack,” it is unlikely that the two terrorists would ever have been identified and apprehended.

“How did a person who we detained in Iraq — linked to an IED attack, we had his fingerprints in our government system — how did he walk into America in 2009?” asked one former Army general who previously oversaw the U.S. military’s anti-IED efforts.

President Barack Obama has thus far refused bipartisan calls to pause his administration’s Syrian refugee program, which many believe is likely to be exploited by terrorists seeking entry into the United States. The president has not explained how his administration can guarantee that no terrorists will be able to slip into the country by pretending to be refugees, as the Iraqi terrorists captured in Kentucky did in 2009. One of those terrorists, Waad Ramadan Alwan, even came into the United States by way of Syria, where his fingerprints were taken and given to U.S. military intelligence officials.

Obama has also refused to explain how his administration’s security-related pause on processing Iraq refugee requests in 2011 did not “betray our deepest values.”",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/18/the-obama-administration-stopped-processing-iraq-refugee-requests-for-6-months-in-2011/,2015-11-18
This Column Is Exactly What ISIS Wants,"President Obama was in Manila yesterday getting worked up about the only thing that really grinds his gears, the GOP. “I cannot think of a more potent recruitment tool for ISIL than some of the rhetoric that’s been coming out of here,” he said of Republicans, who were demanding a pause in the influx of Syrian refugees.

Oh, c’mon! Not one? I can. In fact, I can think of a bunch, because ever since Paris was attacked by a group of religiously unaffiliated men who happened to also yell “Allahu Akbar!” before randomly shooting civilians, liberals have offered an array of conceivable causes for the proliferation of terrorism. There’s Republican rhetoric, of course. Climate change. People drawing mean cartoons about Islam. Blowback for various wars Americans have started without any provocation whatsoever.

The problem is that no matter what the GOP says these days it is “doing exactly what ISIS wants” — the most popular platitude this side of ‘those Syrian refugees are just like Baby Jesus.’

ISIS: We hate Syrian refugees. GOP: Us too! ISIS: We want a “clash of civilizations. GOP: Ditto! *hugs* (Thank you, @AmandaMarcotte)

– Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) November 17, 2015

Y’all realize ISIS wants to provoke a war, right? If we go to war, we’re doing exactly what the terrorists want. – Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) November 16, 2015

Now, obviously we shouldn’t take things comedians say too seriously, but let’s talk about Sally Kohn’s contention anyway. The most obvious problem with it, of course, is that any elected official who gives two spits about what ISIS wants or doesn’t want when making decisions concerning immigration or foreign policy — or any policy, for that matter — is being incomprehensibly irresponsible. The idea that a nation would wage war or not because its enemy is trying to elicit a certain kind of reaction is absurd.

ISIS wants war, you say? Well, it doesn’t matter how many civilians it beheads or how many mass graves it fills or how many Western cities they terrorize, we’re not going to give into those bastards! Because when we annihilate the terrorists, we’re doing exactly what they want.

What ISIS wants is to kill infidels and build a caliphate. And perhaps ISIS has wishes that it will one day sincerely regret? There are innumerable instances throughout history when groups or nations initiated wars that they would disastrously lose. Maybe if terrorists target civilians because they want to be martyrs, we should help them achieve that life goal. Call it a ‘win-win’ if you like.

But the “that’s-what-the-terrorists-want” canard tells us something else about how progressives view this issue. For example, when they misrepresent or misunderstand what ISIS desires because they are often unwilling to concede the most obvious motivation of terrorism: faith. And they misrepresent what conservatives believe for political reasons. ISIS doesn’t hate refugees as a matter of principle. Maybe ISIS hates people who were once allied with Assad or other Shia terror groups. Now, I would hate them, too, of course, but that’s exactly what ISIS wants, I bet.

If Americans want to more vigilant — or even stop the influx of refugees from Syria and Libya completely — it doesn’t mean that people “hate” anyone. We’ll see what polling says on this topic, but a majority of Americans are already rightfully concerned about how well Islam comports to American society. This is not a condemnation of liberal ideals; it is a concern driven by a desire to preserve those ideals, and that is exactly what ISIS doesn’t want.

This is an honest-to-God talking point in lefty circles now? https://t.co/ob36NPQAFl — John Ekdahl (@JohnEkdahl) November 18, 2015

If we don’t take more refugees, we’re supposedly playing right into ISIS’ master plan. We will be perceived as being Islamophobic (though the preponderance of refugees admitted from this crisis so far have been Muslim) and thus we will be at fault for creating more refugees. But we take far fewer Christians fleeing the same war under nearly the same circumstances. Will those people also join death cults and start blowing up children? If not, what in the equation is different? I guess talking about that is exactly what ISIS wants.

If we don’t take more refugees, we’re supposedly playing right into ISIS’ master plan.

And about this nonsense about conservatives wanting the same “clash of civilizations” that ISIS does — maybe we are in a global conflict with an illiberal theology that too often manifests in violence. Certainly it’s not a war with all Muslims. In fact, Republicans are the ones incessantly pressuring political leaders to affix qualifiers like “radical” or “extremist” to the word “Islam.” It is the Left that refuses to make those distinctions, but then it is also the Left that turns around and accuses conservatives of waging war against all Muslims.

Liberals aren’t alone ones using the “that’s-what-the-terrorists-want” formulation, by the way. Rick Santorum argued this week that admitting either Muslims or Christians was a bad idea because “in so doing we would be accomplishing exactly what ISIS wants to accomplish, which is to rid the area of Christians.” So if Christians are refugees in Jordan and have no other country in the Middle East to emigrate to where they can be safe and prosper in the long term, we should force them to go back to Syria because that’s exactly what ISIS doesn’t want?

Seems counterintuitive, to say the least.

Barack Obama: Worst. President. Ever.,"I still remember a lot of people telling me in 2006 that George W. Bush was the “worst president ever.”

They had no idea what they were talking about. This is what the “worst president ever” looks like. In his response to the attacks in Paris, Barack Obama has shown us a leader who is not just inadequate to his core responsibilities, but contemptuous of them.

It started Friday night with his first statement about the attacks. He was perfunctory, devoid of content, and utterly listless. His delivery was flat and without affect — expressing neither outrage nor sorrow — giving the impression that he had no desire to be in front of the cameras or to make any comment at all.

I don’t demand much out of an early press conference like this. The president still knows too few facts about the case and has not had time to formulate a detailed response. But he should at least look as if he cares. If France is “our oldest ally” and “represents the timeless values of human progress,” shouldn’t Obama be very engaged with what happens there?

By contrast, here was his same-day reaction to a mass shooting in Oregon six weeks earlier.

See especially the part about four minutes in. It’s clear that the prospect of imposing gun control domestically gets Obama riled up. Fighting the enemies of America overseas does not. But the first of these goals is actually prohibited to him by the Constitution — while the second is mandated for him. I don’t know if we’ve ever seen a president whose personal priorities are so out of sync with the actual demands of his office.

The administration’s reaction has only gotten worse as it has had more days to respond. On Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry let out the howler that the terrorist attack in France earlier this year — wiping out the headquarters of a satirical magazine that had offended radical Muslims — was kind of understandable.

There’s something different about what happened from Charlie Hebdo, and I think everybody would feel that. There was a sort of particularized focus and perhaps even a legitimacy in terms of—not a legitimacy, but a rationale that you could attach yourself to somehow and say, okay, they’re really angry because of this and that. This Friday was absolutely indiscriminate. It wasn’t to aggrieve one particular sense of wrong. It was to terrorize people.

To be sure, this sentiment didn’t come from Obama himself. But he hired Kerry, who has a record of making horribly insensitive statements. He is the same guy who thought a James Taylor song was an appropriate response to the Charlie Hebdo massacre — and Obama apparently agreed that this would make up for skipping out on an international unity rally in support of France. So maybe we know now why the administration couldn’t really get mobilized to show support for Charlie Hebdo: deep down, they thought the magazine had it coming.

Obama’s administration can’t even get the easy, symbolic stuff right. But the real problem is the substance of his response.

Obama can’t even get the easy, symbolic stuff right.

That brings us to Obama’s petty, peevish press conference on Monday. This is the president who infamously dismissed the Islamic State as the junior varsity squad and described it as “contained” just hours before the attacks in Paris. So naturally, he faced a flurry of questions challenging him on that. At which point, as Politico put it, “he appeared to lose patience with repeated questions about whether he underestimated the threat of the terror network.”

Even Democrats are concerned that “at times he was patronizing, at other times he seemed annoyed and almost dismissive.” Nothing was more dismissive than this comment:

If folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they think they would do, present a specific plan. If they think that somehow their advisors are better than the Chairman of my Joint Chiefs of Staff and the folks who are actually on the ground, I want to meet them. And we can have that debate. But what I’m not interested in doing is posing or pursuing some notion of American leadership or America winning, or whatever other slogans they come up with that has no relationship to what is actually going to work to protect the American people, and to protect people in the region who are getting killed, and to protect our allies and people like France. I’m too busy for that.

This was supposed to show that he doesn’t give a damn what his critics think, but it just shows that he doesn’t give a damn. This is the point inadvertently made by a blogger who praised him and put the issue in no uncertain terms, though I have bowdlerized it a bit to make it publishable on a family website.

We’ve kinda suspected it before, but President Obama genuinely gives no [damns] at this point. He is [damn] devoid. [Damn] deficient. [Damn] deprived. [Damn] destitute. His cupboard of [damns] is barren; his tank of [damns] has been depleted. You know how, on cloudy nights, you might look up into the vast and endless sky and not find any stars? The same thing would happen if you looked at Obama and searched for [damns]. And this, this total absence of [damns], is where pop off came from.”

This is supposed to make Obama “cool,” I guess, because it shows that he is defying the “haters” — those “haters” being his critics back home, not the guys shooting people on the streets of Paris. But it actually shows contempt for pretty much everybody. It’s contemptuous of some of his political allies, like Dianne Feinstein, who are concerned that the Islamic State is “not contained.” It’s contemptuous of the reporters who are asking him good, tough questions. And it’s contemptuous of the American people, who are suddenly concerned that attacks like the one in Paris are going to start happening in our own cities and who want some kind of reassurance that the president of the United States is on the job. They don’t want to be told that they are just “popping off,” or that the president isn’t taking their concerns seriously.

When Obama thinks of empty slogans, he thinks of ‘America winning.’

What they really want to hear is that America is leading and America is going to win. And Obama told us that he is above such petty concerns. Sure, he phrases it as opposition to empty sloganeering, but it’s revealing that when he thinks of empty slogans, he thinks of “America winning.”

So was this also empty sloganeering?

You ask, what is our policy? I can say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.

Because that’s the sort of thing we need our president to say — and not just to say it, but to mean it.

We’ve had presidents before who made big mistakes. I remember George W. Bush, who messed up the occupation of Iraq (but fought like hell to recover). We’ve had presidents who were incompetent and inadequate. I remember Jimmy Carter and Desert One, his bungled response to the Iran hostage crisis. But I don’t know that we’ve ever had a president who didn’t really care about America winning — and who announced it to the public.

To realize how seriously he takes this, consider the detail with which he describes his basic discomfort with the core responsibility of the commander-in-chief. In response to suggestions (which, in his typical style, he exaggerated) to increase our efforts against the Islamic State, he responded:

Let’s assume that we were to send 50,000 troops into Syria. What happens when there’s a terrorist attack generated from Yemen? Do we then send more troops into there? Or Libya, perhaps? Or if there’s a terrorist network that’s operating anywhere else—in North Africa, or in Southeast Asia?

If I were Obama, by the way, I wouldn’t mention the idea of not sending troops to respond to a terrorist attack in Libya. Because he already did that, in Benghazi, and our ambassador and three other Americans died.

But the general point is a fair one. We can’t send troops everywhere. Does that mean we send them nowhere? Isn’t it his job to make those strategic allocations, to decide which threats are the most serious and require the most resources? And shouldn’t he consider that the threat from the Islamic State is getting a lot more serious? But he sees only the costs of action, not the costs of inaction, and he is paralyzed by it.

[E]very few months I go to Walter Reed, and I see a 25-year-old kid who’s paralyzed or has lost his limbs, and some of those are people I’ve ordered into battle. And so I can’t afford to play some of the political games that others may.

This is patronizing to our service members, who signed up for the job of killing terrorists, not just to sit around on base. But in case we didn’t get the point, he added:

[T]here are costs to the other side. I just want to remind people, this is not an abstraction. When we send troops in, those troops get injured, they get killed; they’re away from their families; our country spends hundreds of billions of dollars.

Obama’s outlook on national security is profoundly defeatist. He sees only the costs of action and regards victory as an illusion. Vox’s Matt Yglesias offers an essential explanation, from a sympathetic source, of how things look to Obama administration insiders.

Many senior administration officials at this point are part of the permanent national security apparatus, but the core group of real ‘Obama people’ has a surprisingly dovish self-conception, where they see themselves operating in a world in which demands for military intervention are constant and endless—from the media, from congressional Republicans, from foreign governments and their allies in Washington, and from the permanent security bureaucracy itself—but America’s actual ability to engage in non-counterproductive interventions is quite limited.

Thus, Yglesias concludes, “the hardest problem in US counterterrorism policy is in some ways as much a speechwriting challenge as anything else. The next time something goes wrong and an attack hits the United States, how do you sell the American people on the idea of not really doing anything about it?”

So the hardest problem in counter-terrorism is how to write speeches, or better yet, how to write speeches about doing nothing?

So the hardest problem in counter-terrorism is how to write speeches?

Well, I supposed that’s what we should expect from a president who got elected for his speeches and not for doing anything. And this, I suspect, is how he is going to end up being remembered as commander-in-chief: as the guy who, in a crisis, gave us petulant speeches about why he was doing nothing.

This is one of those moments when you almost appreciate the parliamentary system, which can hold a vote of no confidence in the chief executive. You want to talk about popping off? If Obama is traumatized and overwhelmed by the job of being commander-in-chief, he can pop off to the golf course and clear the way for someone else to do it.

Keep Letting Refugees Into The United States,"On 9/11, I was in Washington DC. It was of course chaotic, but I wanted to help. After I started hearing stories, later, of Canadians who had taken stranded passengers in, I thought, “Why didn’t I go down to the airport and bring some people home that day?” It had never occurred to me.

Fast-forward to Hurricane Katrina. I called the number they gave and volunteered to house some people forced out of their homes. A guy from the government came by. He inspected my home. He had to make sure the space was up to code, of course, and was dubious over small things (We lived there, after all).

But we lived in an urban, mixed-class neighborhood, and had a house nicer than approximately 99 percent of the world’s people. It was better than good enough for us, so I can’t really understand how it wouldn’t be fabulous for someone fleeing utter destruction. But they never sent anyone to stay. Government sucks.

I have little confidence in the Obama administration to effectively screen Syrian (and other) refugees legitimately fleeing rape and annihilation. But we do have systems and protocols for refugees. It’s something Americans know how to do.

My husband worked for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2006 when the short Lebanon war happened. He helped U.S. citizens who had evacuated the country. Some of them literally swam to the boat with nothing. Somehow it wasn’t a problem to sift through them and send them to where they needed to be. We screened and sorted tens of thousands in a few days.

We Can’t Stop Being America

This reaction against accepting Middle Eastern refugees is fear-based, not rational. It’s a scary world that President Obama’s ineptitude has made scarier, which is even more reason to stick to the core of our values. Clearly the nationwide reaction against accepting more refugees is in part an expression of doubt that the Obama administration won’t screw it up or willfully do it badly. We don’t trust this administration. That is legit. They have an awful track record.

Clearly the nationwide reaction against accepting more refugees is in part an expression of doubt that the Obama administration won’t screw it up.

But we are the good guys and we seek the good guys. We shouldn’t forget that. The Bush doctrine makes sense. There are those who want freedom and democracy. We cannot leave them hanging. We have, and it kills me.

There are people who want to hurt us and who can get here whether we accept refugees or not. In Europe, the path is physically possible. Here, it’s not the same. Our oceans are a barrier. Frankly, I think it would be easier for terrorists to cross the Mexico border than blend in with refugees into the United States.

I do get the efficiency argument that other places are closer and easier for taking in refugees. That’s a strong argument. I don’t see how we’re supporting refugees as a country in other places. But we probably are because that’s what we’re set up to do and we just do it without fanfare.

Muslims Aren’t One Monolithic Group

My bigger problem is philosophical. I think some on the Right do not like people without white skin. It’s ugly. I am for controlling immigration, but not for the same reasons as people who fear and dislike, let’s face it, non-white people entering the country. I think racism is real in this issue. Not everyone is racist, but some are, and it’s a big motivator in the debate.

It really bothers me to hear people lumping in with terrorists the very people who should be our allies against the terrorists.

So when Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists, that’s what I see: Racism. And it’s only worse with this refugee issue.

Secondly, I think there’s a lot of willful ignorance here. Muslims are vastly varied, like Christians are. There are different kinds, different schools. It really, really bothers me to hear people lumping in with terrorists the very people who should be our allies against the terrorists.

There are Muslims who have fought and spilled their blood to stop the totalitarians. Who want reform. Who want modernization. Who have suffered for it. Muslims have suffered, and will continue to suffer, in this conflict of civilizations more than we ever will in the West. To say “The Muslims” are more dangerous than other peoples is not only devastatingly ignorant but also offensive.

Further, it’s un-American to judge such a large people group with so many variations on just the fact that they follow, in some way, Mohammed. We don’t do that. That’s what the other side does. We are capable of finding nuance and difference. We are capable of judging by the content of the character rather than the ethnicity or faith of a huge group of people.

For me, here’s a bottom line. We all know there are Muslims who have blown themselves up to kill people. In many of these cases, in the Middle East, there are Muslim men who threw themselves in front of the bombers to save others. It’s been documented several times. Why are we saying those two people are the same? The heroes should be celebrated and encouraged.

Why Women And Child Refugees Are A Threat,"In response to legislators and GOP candidates calling for Barack Obama to halt his Syrian refugee program, the president is accusing them of being scared of women and children. But in light of the evolution of terror in the Middle East, why are we stopping at identifying only men as potential terrorists?

Let’s begin with some numbers. According to the United Nations’ Refugee Agency, the majority of Syrian refugees are made up of men and women between ages 18 and 59: 22.1 percent men (49.7 percent for all age groups) and 23.7 percent women (50.3 percent for all age groups). An overwhelming number of those (98 percent) are Muslim.

It’s true (at least according to these stats) that many of the refugees are women and children, but this doesn’t mean they’re necessarily friendly. To make that assumption is to ignore the fact that jihadists use women and children in terrorist operations.

We only have to look to an attack as recent as Paris to see that this is true. When police raided a suburban Paris apartment where they believed the mastermind of the attacks was holed up and planning another attack, they found a woman, who blew herself up with an explosive vest. How many other women are playing either a support or active role in terrorism plots across the West? The use of women is becoming increasingly common as radical Islamists seek to breach areas on high alert for military-aged men.

Female Suicide Bombers Aren’t Freak Occurrences

Since the 1980s, women have accounted for nearly a quarter of attacks in several countries, including Iraq, Egypt, and Israel. Some research indicates that since 2002 women have carried out 50 percent of suicide attacks in Sri Lanka, Turkey, and Chechnya.

The new mantra is ‘even women must fight.’

According to an article in the Los Angeles Times that calls these attackers “Terror’s ‘invisible women,’” “a younger generation of female jihadists has come to believe that acts of violence can be just as liberating politically and spiritually for women as for men. A religious woman can deflect her parents’ or husband’s objections by invoking the name of religion, which trumps all. The new mantra is ‘even women must fight.’”

The Center for American Progress is critical of America’s ability to deal with radicalization, saying there’s a gaping hole in U.S. counterterrorism strategy: “the fact that terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and the Taliban continue to exploit uniquely female motivations as a tool to recruit female suicide bombers to attack U.S. soldiers and international aid workers.”

Female Suicide Bombers Are More Lethal

The number of female suicide terrorists is on the rise, and it’s becoming “increasingly important to acknowledge and address this threat to American lives and interests.” Not only are female terrorists growing in number, they’re extremely successful bombers.

Mia Bloom from the International Center for the Study of Terrorism attributes their success to several factors, most notably the fact that many people still do not expect women to be involved in violence. The common social assumption that women are inherently weaker, gentler, and more peaceful than men discounts their ability to engage in such lethal activity. That assumption allows female suicide terrorists to be overlooked by and escape through security inspections in many conflict zones, despite recent attempts to correct this security lapse.

Attacks by women are more lethal, too. They’re able to more easily reach high-profile targets and carry out more assassinations because of the lack of security focus. For example, “Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s 1991 assassination by a Tamil Tiger female suicide bomber, who was close enough to touch his feet when the bomb went off, shows how much closer women can get to their targets in many scenarios.”

These unique capabilities are probably why women are responsible for 65 percent of all assassinations among groups that use female suicide terrorists, even though they only make up 15 percent of total suicide bombers in these same groups, according to Lindsey O’Rourke.

American Progress rightly says that “Women’s success in suicide attacks highlights just how little this national security threat is being addressed” and “if we want to actually protect our country, we can’t simply forget about half of the world’s population.”

Following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January of this year, The New York Times reported that intelligence agencies have failed to appreciate the role women play in terror. While much will be made in the coming months of France’s intelligence failures, the West’s dismissal of female terrorists should come under the highest scrutiny.

Take the role of women in the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. While the group oppresses many women, many also flock to its ranks. Roughly 10 percent of its Western recruits are female, often lured by their peers through social media and instant messaging. The percentage is much higher in France: An estimated 63 of the 350 French nationals believed to be with the group are women, or just under 20 percent.

The media and policy makers “are playing catch-up when it comes to understanding the full extent of women’s roles in jihadist groups.”

A large part of the problem is the tendency to fixate on terrorist violence against women, whether it be Boko Haram’s mass kidnapping of schoolgirls in Nigeria or the Islamic State’s sexual violence, slavery, kidnappings and forced marriage. We prefer to see terror through the lens of gender, positing radical Muslim men against women, with the West as their only defender….



Terrorists are strategic about using women, in increasingly chilling ways. To fight them, we have to move past simplistic assumptions about gender and terror and get serious about helping women and girls who are on this deadly path, as well as their would-be victims.

Children Become Suicide Bombers, Too

While The New York Times calls for us to get more serious about female terrorists, those on the Right who are worried about terrorists posing as refugees are accused of being cold-hearted toward women and children.

In Nigeria, four women blew themselves up and a ten-year-old girl with an explosive belt was taken into police custody.

Yet think about the children: there have been reports of children being used as suicide bombers for years. In Nigeria, four women blew themselves up and a ten-year-old girl with an explosive belt was taken into police custody. CBS News has reported that “It is difficult to know how many children have been trained in Iraq and Syria, but there have been reports the number in recent months is in the hundreds.”

It’s a tactic the Taliban and other terrorist networks have perfected, recruiting children to kill as they yell, “Allahu Akbar.” PBS has reported as recently as this week that children and teens are being trained as ISIS suicide bombers. “It’s also a record of one particularly disturbing way the group is trying to expand its influence: training children and teenagers to become the next generation of jihadis,” PBS writes.

The children who are being trained are sometimes as young as five years old. This ISIS video is a disturbing picture of what we’re facing on the terrorist front. It shows lines of young children participating in drills and chanting verses from the Quran.

U.S. Government Exists to Protect U.S. Citizens

Given these facts, how can our president continue to allow Syrian refugees into our country, even if they’re mostly women and children (and that is up for debate)? Remember the Boston Marathon bombers? They were refugees too, fleeing the Chechen conflict. They were “vetted” and, just like those who knew the terrorists in France, friends and associates said they never suspected these refugees were radical Islamists.

When Obama mocks those who want to protect our citizens from the bloody hell those innocent people suffered in France, he needs to be reminded of the true face of our enemy. It’s not just a man’s face. It’s a woman’s face. It’s a child’s face. This isn’t xenophobic or uncharitable. It’s reality.

The job of the federal government is not to play Mother Teresa to the world. Its primary job is to protect Americans from harm. If President Obama is not willing to step up and do that job—even when it means denying women and children access to our homeland—then he needs to step aside.

Democrats' New Secret Weapon Vs. Terrorists? Gun Control,"Having overwhelmingly lost the public debate about whether the Obama administration’s Syrian refugee screening policy should be enhanced, Democrats have retreated to more comfortable rhetorical ground: demanding more gun control.

Their new secret weapon? A bill that would ban anyone whose name appears on a terror watch list from buying or possessing a firearm. The idea sounds reasonable enough until you dig into the details and realize that the proposed Democratic legislation is a shocking assault on the constitutional right to due process. What makes the proposal even worse is that the Democrats’ assault on due process isn’t necessary to accomplish what they say is their only goal: preventing “dangerous terrorists” from legally purchasing or possessing a firearm.

The new bill, which Democrats have dubbed the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015, gives the U.S. attorney general the authority to “deny the sale, delivery, or transfer of a firearm or the issuance of a firearms or explosives license or permit to dangerous terrorists.”

According to several Democratic sponsors of the bill, the proposed law would allow the attorney general to deny a criminal background check clearance to any individual whose name appears on the national terror watch list. The huge problem with this expansive new power is that there are precisely zero statutory criteria for inclusion on this massive list. In fact, when statutory authority for the centralized government database was first codified into law via the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Congress gave all authority for determining criteria for inclusion in the watch list to unelected, unaccountable government bureaucrats. If some faceless Beltway bureaucrat decides you might be a terrorist, then you’re a terrorist. End of story.

There's a legal loophole that allows suspected terrorists to buy guns in America — and the NRA wants to keep it – https://t.co/aVL638VPny



Grasswire (@Grasswire) November 19, 2015

It gets even worse, though. If your name erroneously appears on that watch list, which as of 2013 included nearly 900,000 names, the Democrats’ proposed legislation renders you virtually powerless to find out why your name is on there, let alone to have it removed. And having your name erroneously or fraudulently added to that list isn’t as far-fetched as you might think.

In 2014, for example, Weekly Standard writer and Fox News contributor Stephen F. Hayes was informed that somebody added his name to the Department of Homeland Security’s terrorist watch list. There is zero credible evidence that he has any ties whatsoever to terrorism or to any terrorist organizations. Yet, under the Democrats’ new bill, he and everyone else who is erroneously listed would be banned from ever purchasing or possessing a firearm. Hayes’ apparent crime was traveling overseas for a cruise. Hayes is not alone. Each year, thousands of names end up on the terror watch list for no good reason whatsoever.

Under the Democrats’ proposal, the government doesn’t have to tell you why your name is on the list. The proposed law allows the government to keep that information secret. And if you decide to take the government to court over it, the Democrats’ bill creates a brand new legal standard that tilts the scales of justice against you.

Unlike a standard criminal trial, in which a jury must decide beyond a reasonable doubt whether you have violated a criminal law, under this proposed law the government must only show a preponderance of evidence–evidence which will almost certainly be redacted–in order to strip you of your Second Amendment right to defend yourself and your family from terrorists:

In any case in which the Attorney General has denied the transfer of a firearm to a prospective transferee pursuant to section 922A of this title or has made a determination regarding a firearm permit applicant pursuant to section 922B of this title, an action challenging the determination may be brought against the United States. The petition shall be filed not later than 60 days after the petitioner has received actual notice of the Attorney General’s determination under section 922A or 922B of this title. The court shall sustain the Attorney General’s determination upon a showing by the United States by a preponderance of evidence that the Attorney General’s determination satisfied the requirements of section 922A or 922B, as the case may be. To make this showing, the United States may submit, and the court may rely upon, summaries or redacted versions of documents containing information the disclosure of which the Attorney General has determined would likely compromise national security.

Remember, you don’t have to be convicted of any crime whatsoever to end up on the terrorist watch list. You don’t even have to be charged with a crime to lose your constitutional rights under the proposed law. If this proposed legislation were to become law, some DHS bureaucrat–perhaps the type of bureaucrat who wrote earlier this year that “right-wing terrorists” pose the biggest threat to American national security–only needs to snap his fingers and add your name to the blacklist in order to immediately deprive you of your Second Amendment rights and your constitutional right to due process. You don’t even get to review the entirety of the evidence against you.

The blatant unconstitutional deprivation of due process is more than sufficient reason to oppose this piece of legislation, but it’s not the only reason. There may actually be an even bigger reason to reject it: it is completely unnecessary, because the U.S. attorney general already has the power to prevent “dangerous terrorists” from legally buying guns, and that power can be exercised without unconstitutional deprivation of due process.

All the attorney general has to do to prevent “dangerous terrorists” from legally purchasing firearms is to indict them. That’s it. Charge these terrorists with terrorism, and their legal right to purchase firearms goes up in smoke. That’s because existing federal law states that anyone who’s been indicted for any crime that carries a prison sentence of more than one year–and felony indictment for conspiracy to commit terrorism certainly satisfies that standard–automatically becomes ineligible to purchase or possess a firearm:

The Gun Control Act (GCA) makes it unlawful for certain categories of persons to ship, transport, receive, or possess firearms. 18 USC 922(g). Transfers of firearms to any such prohibited persons are also unlawful. 18 USC 922(d).



These categories include any person:



Under indictment or information in any court for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;



convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;



who is a fugitive from justice;



who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance;



who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution;



who is an illegal alien;



who has been discharged from the military under dishonorable conditions;



who has renounced his or her United States citizenship;



who is subject to a court order restraining the person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of the intimate partner; or



who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence (enacted by the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-208, effective September 30, 1996). 18 USC 922(g) and (n).

The language in the Democrats’ new gun control bill certainly suggests that these “dangerous terrorists” should be indicted for terrorism. After all, it gives the attorney general authority to deny background check clearance to anyone “known (or appropriately suspected) to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism, or providing material support or resources for terrorism[.]”

Engaging in terrorism is a federal crime. Providing material support for terrorism is a federal crime. Preparing to engage in terrorism is a federal crime. If there is sufficient evidence to show that these individuals are engaged in terrorism, the best way to make America safer is to indict these terrorists and arrest them.

The attorney general absolutely has that power, which raises a very troubling question given the premise of the Democrats’ proposed legislation: why are hundreds of thousands of known, dangerous terrorists walking free in America right now? Why have they not been indicted for their crimes? Why is American law enforcement not working 24/7 to secure indictments for these terrorists, to arrest them, and to convict them for their crimes against America?

Why won't Obama's DOJ indict these terrorists and arrest them? Why is Obama so intent on letting them roam free? https://t.co/Rsn14C8jSz



Sean Davis (@seanmdav) November 21, 2015

The simple answer is that there’s not sufficient evidence to indict, let alone convict, the hundreds of thousands of names included on the terrorist watch list. Once you realize that fact, you realize that the purpose of this bill isn’t to prevent “dangerous terrorists” from possessing guns–the attorney general can already accomplish that with a simple indictment–it’s to prevent evil Republicans from possessing political power. The proposed legislation from Democrats is nothing more than a clumsy attempt at wedge-issue politics: rather than dealing with an actual terror threat from ISIS, just pretend that Republicans and the monstrous National Rifle Association are hell-bent on protecting a “loophole” that allows dangerous terrorists to get guns.

Due process isn’t a “loophole,” though. Due process is a fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. It states that the government cannot permanently deprive you of your constitutional rights unless and until a jury of your peers has decided beyond a reasonable doubt that you have committed a criminal act.

The silly gun control proposal from Democrats attempts to turn the principle of due process on its head. Instead of requiring a jury of your peers to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that you have committed a crime, Democrats have decided that power should belong to a handful of Washington, D.C.-based bureaucrats. Instead of allowing you to review and challenge all evidence presented against you, Democrats have decided that evidence should be kept secret. Instead of requiring a legal standard that all reasonable doubt must be eliminated prior to the government-sanctioned revocation of your rights, Democrats have decided that a mere preponderance of evidence should be plenty.

Democrats aren’t doing this because they think it’s the only possible way to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons. We know this because we’ve established that the attorney general already has all the power she needs to indict, arrest, convict, and sentence known, dangerous terrorists. Democrats are doing this because they think it will benefit them politically. In the wake of a massive terrorist attack on free, innocent people in Paris, Washington Democrats have decided that their real enemy isn’t ISIS. Just like Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton declared in a recent debate, their real enemies are Republicans.

And they’ll do whatever they can to defeat these dangerous electoral terrorists…even if it requires the wholesale elimination of the constitutional right to due process.

U.S. Officials Can’t Ask Syrian Refugees Key Questions,"U.S. law enforcement officials involved in screening Syrian refugees are forbidden from asking key questions about individuals’ religious affiliations or beliefs based on policy guidance created by the Obama administration, according to a recent report published at The Daily Caller.

The piece notes that both Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) policies have increasingly restricted the ability of law enforcement to query individuals about their religious behaviors or associations.

“These gradual but severe restrictions were coupled with a simultaneous reduction in accurate, fact-based training to address the nature of the threat we face, leaving us inadequately prepared for the challenges we face today,” The Daily Caller cites a “government source familiar with national security” as saying.

That means DHS officers screening for Syrian refugees are likely prohibited from asking questions like, “Are you a member or supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood or Tablighi Jamaat?”

These Are Dangerous Buddies to Have

The Muslim Brotherhood is the oldest global Islamist group in the world. Muslim Brotherhood thinkers formed the core ideology of al-Qaeda, and former FBI Director Robert Mueller testified in 2011 that “elements of the Muslim Brotherhood both here and overseas have supported terrorism.” Tablighi Jamaat is an Islamic proselyting group that al-Qaeda has used as a cover to facilitate moving across borders, and which U.S. intelligence has described as “willingly supporting terrorists.”

A 2005 report on the Pakistan-based group noted:

Tablighi Jamaat has also facilitated other terrorists’ missions. The group has provided logistical support and helped procure travel documents. Many take advantage of Tablighi Jamaat’s benign reputation. Moroccan authorities say that leaflets circulated by the terrorist group Al-Salafiyah al-Jihadiyah urged their members to join Islamic organizations that operate openly, such as Tablighi Jamaat, in order ‘to hide their identity on the one hand and influence these groups and their policies on the other.’

It would also prohibit law enforcement from asking key questions about how an individual views jihadist ideologues, such as Anwar Awlaki, Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, or Yusuf al Qaradawi. That’s vital when such jihadi scholars have played roles in influencing terror attacks.

For example, support and admiration for Awlaki was key to terror cases including the Christmas Day underwear bomber, the Fort Hood shooter, the Charlie Hebdo killers, and the more recent Chattanooga Recruiting Center shooter.

Yet during an investigation into Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hassan before his attack, the FBI described email correspondence from Hassan to Awlaki as “not pertinent” to the investigation.

Islamist Sympathizers Place Pressure

In 2011, the Civil Rights Civil Liberties division of DHS launched an investigation into multiple Customs and Border Protection agents, because of complaints by groups like Hamas-linked Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR) that agents were asking individuals questions about their affiliation with Islamic organizations (including those linked to the Muslim Brotherhood), or attendance at conferences where pro-jihadist ideologues are known to have spoken.

One officer was being investigated because he had asked for an individual’s view of Anwar al-Awlaki.

According to DHS authorities, one officer was being investigated because he had asked for an individual’s view of Anwar al-Awlaki. In another, FBI agents referenced the underwear bombing plot. Even that much was considered offensive.

The CRCL investigation was motivated by pressure from the American Civil Liberties Union, CAIR, and Muslim Advocates, a group closely linked with U.S. Muslim Brotherhood groups and with a long history of opposing U.S. counterterrorism efforts.

In response to lawsuits related to the issue of questioning by CBP officers, the DHS established a “hands-off” list of known individuals with terror ties, which included Muslim Brotherhood leader Jamal Badawi, an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation Hamas finance trial. These individuals were given a green light to enter the country, and were not to be referred to secondary questioning. Sen. Chuck Grassley investigated the matter in 2014, calling it “disturbing.”

If U.S. law enforcement agents are no longer able to question individuals who are already known to have terror affiliations about their ideological views or the organizations with which they associate, how much more pressure will there be to avoid pertinent questions to Syrian refugees, a hot-button issue upon which the Obama administration has taken a strong public position?

Hillary Clinton's Denialism Sets Off Trump's Rhetoric On Islam,"The media are continuing their codependent obsession with Donald Trump by focusing, in this week’s edition of media-fueled Trumpmania, on comments he made regarding Muslims. You can look anywhere for evidence of this, but the first five Google hits for Donald Trump + Muslims are a good indication:

And on and on and on it goes. I get it. Trump is good for traffic. It’s fun to write outraged pieces about him! The media seem to have no limit for their love of covering everything he says. I was trying to find out what exactly, he’d said that had the media in such a tizzy and landed on an article headlined “The 7 Most Ridiculous Things Donald Trump Has Said In The Last 2 Weeks.” It was published in 2011. So forgive me if I opt out of this round of groupthink outrage on The Donald.

Or rather, while what Trump says (now, in 2011, in 1984, I could go on) is in fact, “ridiculous,” what other things are politicians saying that are also ridiculous?

Check out what Hillary Clinton said last week about the role Islam plays in global terrorism.

Let’s be clear, though. Islam is not our adversary. Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.

Part of this is fine rhetoric for a politician. And obviously the majority of Muslims, particularly American Muslims, are peaceful and tolerant. But to say that Muslims have “nothing whatsoever” to do with terrorism is simply not true. The world may wish it were so, but it’s not. It’s as clownish and cartoonish and demonstrably false as anything Trump has said in the last week.

To say that Muslims have ‘nothing whatsoever’ to do with terrorism is simply not true.

Clinton’s statement is extreme rhetoric that has no place in adult conversations in the aftermath of 9/11, which claimed the lives of 2,997. Or the attacks on U.S. embassies and consulates in Beirut, Karachi, Nairobi, Tanzania, Kenya, Sarajevo, Jeddah, Benghazi, Herat, and Erbil. Or the Moscow theater hostage situation, which killed more than 100 and injured more than 700. Or the nine synchronized bomb blasts in Jaipur that killed 80. Or the Ahmedabad bombings a year later that took the lives of 56 and injured 200. Followed two months later by the Delhi bombings that took another few dozen. Or the Islamabad Marriot hotel bombing that killed two U.S. servicemen and 52 others. The Qahtaniya bombings of the Yazidi that killed nearly 800 and wounded 1,600. The 2008 attacks on Christians in Mosul that killed more than 40. The siege of Mumbai, killing 166. The Little Rock recruitment office shooting. Fort Hood. The 2009 Marriott and Ritz-Carlton bombing in Indonesia. The Nag Hamadi massacre of Coptic Christians. The Moscow Metro bombings that killed 40. The London Underground bombings that killed 53 and injured 700. The Madrid train bombings that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800. The Mumbai train bombings that killed 209 injured more than 700. The Beslan school hostage crisis, where some 385 people — including 186 children — were killed. The murder of Theo Van Gogh. The 2005 Delhi bombings. The Amman bombings that killed more than 60 and injured 115. The Westgate shopping mall attack where 67 were killed and 175 wounded. ISIS’ beheadings of Americans, of Christians, of other enemies of the state. Paris.

Each of these attacks — and countless others — were done in the name of Islam. And while it might comfort us to issue platitudes about Islam being peaceful and having “nothing to do” with these attacks, such statements are unbecoming of serious politicians.

Anyone with a brain wave and a pulse knows that Islam and Islamist terrorism have a relationship.

Anyone with a brain wave and a pulse knows that Islam and Islamist terrorism have a relationship. What’s more, refusal to acknowledge that Islam contains within it groups of people dedicated to such carnage actually does more damage to peaceful Muslims than otherwise. Would you rather have those people who are cognizant of world events understand that there is a stream of thought within Islam that lends itself to such violence or to believe that all Muslims are so inclined? Because in a world with the reality of Islamist terrorism, that’s the option its prominent deniers are giving people.

Cathy Young made this point when she noted a Daily Beast article about some group of college students saying that remembering 9/11 was offensive to Muslims, “Are you saying that all Muslims are terrorists?” she asked.

Seriously. Check out this ad that was put out by Democrats this past week. It’s mindboggling.

First off, if you told me that this was a Republican ad, I would have believed you. It was produced in a country where fully two-thirds of respondents to a recent poll used the term “radical Islam” to describe the enemy. You will of course note that there is not a drop of conflict between GOP politicians talking about Islamist terrorism or the other problems of radical Islam and George W. Bush’s statements about not being at war with Islam. That’s because both of these statements are true. Islamist terrorism is a problem, and the U.S. is not at war with Islam. It’s Democrats who come off bigoted in this ad by their implicit argument that all Muslims are indistinguishable from one other, no matter their particular political or religious views.

‘Strange New Respect’ For George W. Bush

In the hours after Islamist terrorists carried out their attacks on American soil in 2001, President George W. Bush and his advisors agreed on a strategy for talking about the role Islam. It was difficult because the attacks were perpetrated by Muslim terrorists who based their violence in their understanding of their religion. So the Bush administration was trying to manage what they worried could be a touchy situation both domestically and globally. They wanted to make sure that American Muslims weren’t subject to retaliatory violence. And they wanted to make sure that global Muslims didn’t feel the need to pick a side against the U.S. in the coming days.

So on September 17, 2001, President Bush visited the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C., and said, “The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That’s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don’t represent peace. They represent evil and war.”

This was a political statement, as were other similar statements. Bush was no more qualified to opine on Islamic theology than the vast majority of politicians and talking heads who have done so in the years since. What’s more, it was an emergency political statement, a measure taken to address immediate problems.

‘Strange new respect’ is the term for how the media do everything they can to demonize and tear down whichever Republican is in power or in the news.

It’s been hilarious to watch the media and other progressives pull out the “strange new respect” routine for Bush’s political positioning of Islam. “Strange new respect” is the term for how the media do everything they can to demonize and tear down whichever Republican is in power or in the news. Then, a decade later, they pretend that the Republican they loathed was in fact totally reasonable all along in order to demonize and tear down whichever Republican is in power or in the news.

Many reporters are probably too young to remember, but the media treatment of Bush was so bad by 2004 that non-unhinged observers referred to it as Bush Derangement Syndrome. If there was one Republican I was sure wouldn’t get the “strange new respect” treatment — much less so quickly — it was George W. Bush. In any case, he’s getting it now.

“Islam means peace,” we’re told, but it actually means submission. Not to make a qualitative judgment, but if it did mean peace, it would have never left the Arabian Peninsula, but it did and almost immediately. The battle of Yarmuk, one of the most significant battles in human history, took place in 636, just four years after Muhammad died. In Syria, as it happens. A small band of Muslim soldiers overtook the mighty Byzantines in just six days, ending Byzantine rule there. Military historians say what was needed to defeat the Muslim invaders was a quick deployment of forces. That didn’t happen, so the Muslim army worked quickly to overpower a much larger opponent. It was one of the battles Osama bin Laden mentioned in his inspirational statements about how to overtake Westerners.

Here’s a quick and dirty animated map showing the expansion of Islam via conquest:

According to historian Will Durant:

The Islamic conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precious good, whose delicate complex of order and freedom, culture and peace, can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within.

The Cost Of Denialism

Politico published a piece this week headlined, “Molenbeek broke my heart: A former resident reflects on his struggles with Brussels’ most notorious neighborhood.” How did Molenbeek become Europe’s jihadi base? Teun Voeten says:

But the most important factor is Belgium’s culture of denial. The country’s political debate has been dominated by a complacent progressive elite who firmly believes society can be designed and planned. Observers who point to unpleasant truths such as the high incidence of crime among Moroccan youth and violent tendencies in radical Islam are accused of being propagandists of the extreme-right, and are subsequently ignored and ostracized.



The debate is paralyzed by a paternalistic discourse in which radical Muslim youths are seen, above all, as victims of social and economic exclusion. They in turn internalize this frame of reference, of course, because it arouses sympathy and frees them from taking responsibility for their actions. The former Socialist mayor Philippe Moureax, who governed Molenbeek from 1992 to 2012 as his private fiefdom, perfected this culture of denial and is to a large extent responsible for the current state of affairs in the neighborhood.



Two journalists had already reported on the presence of radical Islamists in Molenbeek and the danger they posed — and both became victims of character assassination. In 2006, Hind Fraihi, a young Flemish woman of Morrocan descent published “Undercover in Little Morocco: Behind the Closed Doors of Radical Islam.” Her community called her a traitor; progressive media called her a “spy” and a “girl with personal problems.”

No, Islam isn’t synonymous with peace, and Bush was just doing politics when he claimed otherwise in the stressful aftermath of 9/11. But as much as his apologetics were amateur, they were significantly more excusable than pushing out the same false rhetoric now.

We are not children. We have read the news in the last 14 years. The attack on the Radisson hotel in Mali is simply the latest bloody demonstration that Islamist terrorism is real. We know that the terrorists are truly and genuinely motivated by their religious beliefs, however much the professors writing op-eds assert they are not. And while there may be an earnest debate about what can and should be done to deal with Islamist terrorism, no serious person can deny its existence.

So yes, Trump’s rhetoric is extreme. (Can you believe it? Donald Trump! The man known for his probity and reasonableness.) But the other extreme is also dangerous. That’s the extreme that denies the reality of Islamist terrorism, the threat it poses in Paris, London, New York, Mumbai, Madrid, Karachi, Delhi, Cairo, Jerusalem, Khobar, Washington, D.C., Moscow, Nairobi, Benghazi, and throughout the world.

It’s telling that much of the media find only one of the views extreme.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/24/hillary-clintons-denialism-is-the-other-extreme-of-trumps-rhetoric-on-islam/,2015-11-24
Media That Claimed Bush Chilled Speech Strangely Quiet Under Obama,"On September 30, 2001, Maureen Dowd published a column in The New York Times in which she lambasted the Bush administration for creating a climate where she said speech was restricted. A mere 19 days after Islamist terrorists had launched their most successful attack against the U.S., Dowd sounded the alarm.

Her primary example was actually not quite accurately conveyed. The real story is that Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer had critiqued a Republican congressman’s bigoted remarks against turban-wearers as well as comedian Bill Maher’s comments that the U.S. military was cowardly while terrorists had the virtue of bravery. Louisiana Rep. John Cooksey had said, “If I see someone come in and he’s got a diaper on his head and a fan belt around that diaper on his head, that guy needs to be pulled over and checked.” Maher had said, “We have been the cowards, lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That’s cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building, say what you want about it, that’s not cowardly.”

Asked about those comments during a presser, Fleischer had called for prudence saying, “I’m aware of the press reports about what he’s said. I have not seen the actual transcript of the show itself. But assuming the press reports are right, it’s a terrible thing to say. And it’s unfortunate. And that’s why there was an earlier question about, “Has the President said anything to people in his own party?” There are reminders to all Americans that they need to watch what they say, watch what they do. This is not a time for remarks like that; there never is.”

Many people lost their minds. For years after that. Dowd’s column probably started it all, but even years later New York Times columnist Paul Krugman said Fleischer “ominously warned” Americans to “watch what they say, watch what they do.” He accused him of telling Americans “to accept the administration’s version of events, not ask awkward questions.”

A few years after that, then-New York Times columnist Frank Rich said Fleischer “condemned Bill Maher’s irreverent comic response to 9/11 by reminding ‘all Americans that they need to watch what they say, watch what they do.’ Fear itself — the fear that ‘paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance,’ as FDR had it — was already being wielded as a weapon against Americans by their own government.” These are just three examples of prominent columnists from one media establishment. Over at The Washington Post in 2009 (!), the imaginative Dana Milbank said of Fleischer’s remarks that they were “intended to be chilling” and that he “was basically telling people ‘we’re at war; shut your mouth.'”

Dissent, we were told time and time again during the Bush presidency, is the highest form of patriotism.

Fleischer, for his part, has said his words “could have been more carefully chosen,” but that “my remarks urged tolerance and openness and were addressed to those who made statements and threatened actions against Muslims or Sikhs in America.”

The media and various other progressives also were upset by Bush’s remarks from his September 20, 2001, address to Congress in which he bluntly said, “Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.”

Dowd said, “Even as the White House preaches tolerance toward Muslims and Sikhs, it is practicing intolerance, signaling that anyone who challenges the leaders of an embattled America is cynical, political and — isn’t this the subtext? — unpatriotic.”

Dissent, we were told time and time again during the Bush presidency, is the highest form of patriotism.

Is Dissent Still Patriotic?

Cut to last week when Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) explained why he was one of the rare, unquestioning supporters of President Obama’s proposed Syrian refugee policy:

Hickenlooper: “If your President decides something, you have to support it… if it’s a matter of National Security” #copolitics — 9NEWS Denver (@9NEWS) November 18, 2015

Which is nothing at all compared to what Obama said about how people opposed to his policy distractions needed to watch what they said and did because they were helping recruit terrorists. Really:

I cannot think of a more potent recruitment tool for ISIL than some of the rhetoric that’s coming out of here during the course of this debate.

This is years after both Hillary Clinton and Obama were featured in a video the Obama administration aired in Pakistan. In that video, which was a response to the incendiary, anti-Islam video made by an American, Obama claimed that in the U.S., “we reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others.” Clinton said of the U.S. government, “we absolutely reject its content and message.”

Except that our country doesn’t reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. In fact, we state quite clearly that we believe everyone has the right to denigrate the religious beliefs of anyone, from Mormon to Methodist to Muslim. And the U.S. government has no business weighing in on videos made by Americans and has no right to try to get Google to pull it down when people object to it.

Obama further “chilled” religious and political speech by saying before the U.N. that “The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.”

An Obama official just last week made ominous comments about critics of Islam when he said that the massacre of Charlie Hebdo employees had a “legitimacy” and certain “rationale” to it.

In these cases, Obama officials have gone far beyond admonitions to prudence and lobbed direct assaults against principles that underlie multiple aspects of the First Amendment. I’m sure I’ve missed Dowd, Krugman, and Rich’s columns sounding the alarm.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/11/25/media-that-claimed-bush-chilled-speech-strangely-quiet-under-obama/,2015-11-25
"On ISIS, Barack Obama Is Baghdad Bob","“ISIS is contained” is the new “American tanks are not in Baghdad” of 2015.

In the throes of a tight re-election campaign in October of 2012, President Barack Obama declared that al Qaeda was “on the run.” In one sense, he was right: al Qaeda was running into the arms of ISIS, which was running wild in the Middle East. But his intended implication–that his policies had routed the terrorists, rendered them incapable of hurting Americans, and as a result made America safer from the threat of terrorist attack–was demonstrably false.

In an interview with ABC News the day before deadly terrorist attacks in Paris which killed 130 people and injured scores more, Obama famous declared that ISIS had been “contained” due to his administration’s policies.

On Wednesday, while the San Bernardino terrorists were still at large, Obama told CBS News in a taped interview that America was safe from the threat of ISIS attacks.

“The American people should feel confident that, you know, we are going to be able to defend ourselves and make sure that, you know, we have a good holiday and go about our lives,” Obama said.

As a result of Wednesday’s terrorist attack in San Bernardino, at least 14 people will most certainly not be going about their lives, nor will their families and friends be enjoying a “good holiday” this year. On Friday, just a day after Obama’s ISIS comments were aired, law enforcement officials disclosed that one of the San Bernardino terrorists had pledged allegiance to ISIS on her personal Facebook page.

In other words, the 44th American president is now our very own Baghdad Bob. He is a man clinging so desperately to his narrative–terrorists are on the run because I ended the war in Iraq and killed bin Laden–that no amount of facts or evidence could possibly convince him his narrative might be wrong, even as that narrative is unraveling in real-time before his very eyes:

In March of 2003, Saddam’s Minister of Information was everybody’s favorite inadvertent comedian. Sporting a kicky black beret and delightfully bombastic lexicon, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf appeared on TV daily to predict American failure and deny the Baghdad invasion–sometimes even as U.S. tanks appeared behind him. “He’s great,” President George W. Bush said of Sahaf, admitting that he occasionally interrupted meetings to watch Sahaf’s briefings. “Someone accused us of hiring him and putting him there. He was a classic.”



Sahaf became the subject of T-shirts, mugs, adoring websites, a pop song, and an action figure. Besides adding levity to news cycles otherwise filled with fuzzy green explosions, Sahaf represented everything that made Iraq’s invasion seem not quite like a real war. Wars are serious, and this guy was adorable. Even if you opposed the Iraq invasion, you had to admit it’s hard to respect a government whose official mouthpiece told a reporter, “Shock and awe? It seems that we are the awe on them. They are suffering from the shock and awe, okay?”

We all laughed at Baghdad Bob at the time, because what kind of delusional apparatchik would declare that there are no America tanks in Baghdad when American tanks can be seen in the background rolling through Baghdad? Baghdad Bob was funny, because Baghdad Bob was not in charge of protecting us. He was in charge of protecting Saddam Hussein.

But when your own president engages in the same absurd behavior–declaring that ISIS is contained while the group was planning a devastating attack in Paris that it would launch the very next day, or declaring that America is safe from the terrorist threat of ISIS while a terrorist who had pledged allegiance to ISIS was on the run from police after assisting in the execution of at least 14 completely innocent people at an office party in California–it’s not even remotely amusing. It’s terrifying.

And it’s not just Obama. This disease of delusion has spread to members of his cabinet as well.

U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino that her “greatest fear” was not future deadly terrorist attacks against innocent Americans. Instead, Lynch said her “greatest fear” was that there might be an anti-Muslim backlash as a result of the terrorist attacks. She then transitioned into a discussion about the need for America to accept more refugees from the Middle East, according to Politico, which covered her remarks at a Muslim Advocates dinner event on Thursday. She did not mention during her remarks that one of the San Bernardino terrorists was an immigrant with a Pakistani passport who had passed a Department of Homeland Security background check prior to being admitted into the U.S.

This is madness.

Barack Obama refused to admit that Americans are most certainly not safe from the threat of ISIS attack, even while ISIS apostles were murdering American citizens in California. The White House refuses to admit that ISIS, an acronym in which the very first letter stands for “Islamic,” is driven by a devotion to a radical interpretation of Islam that declares all infidels must be slaughtered by faithful Muslims in service of Allah. This is not foreign policy. It is a deadly form of political schizophrenia that has all but crippled the president’s ability to differentiate between reality and fantasy. “ISIS is not Islamic” and “Americans are nowhere near Baghdad” are two sides of the same delusional coin.

Our president has decided that his narrative is more important than our safety. That his legacy is more important than our security. Extreme Islamic terrorists are not “on the run.” ISIS is not “contained.” And America is not safe from the threat of future terrorist attacks from ISIS and its radical Islamic adherents.

That is the reality of 2015, whether Baghdad Barack wishes to acknowledge it or not.

Why The Planned Parenthood And San Bernardino Shootings Are Not Alike,"It’s never a good idea to jump to conclusions.

That seems like a rather silly thing to say in the days of instantaneous reaction. But a government official did tell CNN that the San Bernardino shooters had “overseas communications and associations” with terror suspects. The police say Syed Rizwan Farook was “radicalized” and had watched ISIS propaganda videos. We know he had an arsenal in his home, including a dozen pipe bombs, and left behind a remote-control explosive that was similar to the one used by the Boston bombers. The shooting seems to have something to do with Islamic extremists.

When that reality began to kick in, chatter in the liberal Twitterverse quickly turned from torturous efforts to steer motivations in a certain direction, to dismissing motivation altogether, to dressing down Christians for praying too much, to accusing the National Rifle Association and pro-gun Republicans of being complicit in 355 mass shootings (a concocted statistic used by many gun control advocates.)

Since neither of the shooters was known to the police nor had been tagged as a terror risk by the feds, there’s probably no amount of regulation (barring confiscation) that could have stopped them from engaging in this premeditated rampage. It’s debatable whether gun control efforts would reduce violence, anyway.

But, terror or no terror, most of the media would not be knocked off message. Politico ran a piece with this headline: “GOP unmoved on gun control as massacres pile up.” “Democrats unmoved on fighting terror as bodies pile up” would be an equally ugly headline, but we’re used to this kind of bias being embedded in coverage.

What is somewhat new to our discourse—now a standard among progressives—is the idea that there’s a white-Christian-conservative-male-terror problem sweeping though the nation just as serious and scary as radical Islam.

Amazing to watch people who said the motive didn’t matter at Planned Parenthood shooting now saying motive here is all that matters.



— Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) December 3, 2015

Have pro-lifers ever argued that the motives of the Planned Parenthood shooter didn’t matter? Of course motive matters. Motives are exactly what make Islamic terror so unique and dangerous.

Motives are exactly what make Islamic terror unique and dangerous.

There is an important distinction between the type of violence we saw at the Colorado Planned Parenthood facility (and we don’t know everything about that incident, either) and what likely happened in San Bernardino. Those who kill for Islam are part of a worldwide ideological and political movement that includes, to various degrees, radicalized men and women from both great factions of the faith. Terrorism—as well as recruitment and propaganda tools—are often funded by Islamic regimes and radicals in them, and applauded by millions of adherents around the world.

In addition to those poor souls radicalized by climate change or poverty or Republican rhetoric, people often leave their free and prosperous environment to join the Islamist cause. The Inland Empire is not perfect, but it is not Raqqa. These terrorists not only slaughter thousands of infidels every year, they also instill fear in countless others, throwing entire regions and nations into chaos. They undermine “stable” Islamic nations (themselves profoundly illiberal by our standards), generate massive numbers of refugees whom non-Islamic nations are compelled to deal with, and perpetuate acts of brutality on nearly every continent. Governments spend trillions of dollars to protect their citizens from this constant threat. All too often, our civil rights and liberal ideas suffer, and the perverse externalities of Islamic terrorism are incalculable.

But #PlannedParenthood shooting had nothing to do Dear’s religion or his pro-life ideology. Got it. https://t.co/kVTcOQSE7Q



— Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) December 3, 2015

Farook and Tashfeen Malik—if what appears to have happened in California is true—were part of that campaign. Whether they took direct orders from an ISIS operative or whether they merely harmonized philosophically with the terror group, they were in league with the Paris shooters and Charlie Hebdo shooters and, in a broader sense, with Boko Haram and Hamas.

Rampant Christian terror exists only in fevered imagination of the far Left.

Robert Dear, though, was on his own. He might have imagined some purpose, but it was disconnected from any genuine political or ideological movement within the United States, much less the world. Even if we concede that it was “heated” rhetoric about Planned Parenthood that motivated Dear, no one I know writing or speaking critically about abortion advocates violence. Rather, they advocate for the cessation of violence. Dear’s actions were not supported or cheered or funded by any real church, movement, organization, think tank, or nation. And the idea that a lone psychotic (or anyone) should have veto power over political speech is deeply illiberal—although it is widely embraced by the Left today.

Rampant Christian terror exists only in fevered imagination of the far Left, who like to count every murder by a white person as a politically motivated act. That’s not to say it never happens. It’s to say that acts of violence like the one we saw in Colorado Springs are almost always self-directed and disconnected from discourse or a particular political aim, despite attempts by many Democrats to tie raucous debate they dislike to violence.

Moreover, we might want to remember that there’s a reason Islamic radicals haven’t been more successful in targeting Americans. After a highly effective day of carnage back in 2001, the United States has been more vigilant. In fact, since 1993, nine abortion-related murders have occurred in the United States—including the recent shooting in Colorado Springs—and it is nine too many. During that same time, however, Islamic terrorists have murdered more than 3,100 Americans. For more context, in this year alone more than 850 Christians have perished because of Islamic terror around the world.

For those who intimately deal with these horrifying attacks, the motivations and broader implications are probably irrelevant. But for us, context also matters. Stringing together every act of random violence in the nation—no matter how ambiguous, disconnected, and muddled the political motives of the perpetrators might be—does not make a Christian terror problem.

President Obama’s Gun Speech Proclaims His Impotence,"Saturday afternoon I began to write a response to The New York Times’s page-one editorial, “End the Gun Epidemic in America.” It had many of us worried.

None fear, or should fear, the NYT’s editorial persuasive power. The last time the NYT put an editorial on its front page, it was to lament the nomination of Warren G. Harding, who went on to one of the top five landslide victories in U.S. history. And this current offering is so rhetorically loaded with shame at its opponents and complete ignorance about what motivates them that it will not change minds, at least not in the way the editorial board hopes. The first linkable reaction I saw on this effect came from Roger Simon. He was not an outlier.

It is not effectiveness but what the editorial signals about elite and current government viewpoints that has people concerned. The government and Manhattan intelligentsia look set to act against the right to keep and bear arms, a very ominous development in already trying times.

A U.S. Gun Grab Is Impossible

That was how my planned piece began. I then laid out how the Obama administration might go about reducing gun ownership. I looked at voluntary surrender and registry options. Assuming for the sake of argument that Congress would pass any such legislation (Sen. Dianne Feinstein tried in 2013, if you recall) I could not conceive of a plan that would be more “successful” than the Canadian or Australian programs. Too few citizens would comply.

I looked at coercion options, such as a sin tax on ownership or a hefty tax for any owners refusing to register or turn over certain weapons. All of this would be challenged as an unconstitutional tax on an inherent right, especially coming right after the Internal Revenue Service audit moratorium while it was investigated for targeting organizations for their political views. Furthermore, the agency would need a huge chunk of money to hire enough auditors to make the plan look less like a failure than say, Cash for Clunkers. (Remember that bit of governmental brilliance?)

I could not conceive of a plan that would be more ‘successful’ than the Canadian or Australian programs.

Finally, I looked at search and seizure options using federal enforcement agencies, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the U.S. Marshal Service, the Secret Service, a federalized National Guard, and the Department of Homeland Security. Even if Obama saw everything break the government’s way on executive order challenges and cooperative state and local officials—all highly improbable—these agencies combined do not have enough people to do the job. We are simply too many, too spread out, and too motivated to defend our right to keep and bear arms.

In short, a gun grab in the United States is impossible. And based on Obama’s Oval Office speech last night, he seems to have finally figured that out.

The Speech Was an Utter Failure

Obama’s speech was a collapse. It had no teeth. It offered no comfort. It was full of policy blunders. And his delivery was soft—not comforting, but resigned.

We will ‘continue to’ do the things we’ve been doing. Because those things have been so effective?

On terrorism, Obama didn’t really say anything other than—finally—admitting that many of the shootings during his tenure were not tragedies, but terrorist attacks. The rest was vague phrases about how we’ve been working tirelessly to combat terrorist organizations.

We will “continue to” do the things we’ve been doing. Because those things have been so effective? Recent events and the resurgence of Russian influence suggest otherwise. We will defeat terrorism by being “smart and strong, resilient and relentless.” Besides the lack of specifics, is it not odd to claim relentlessness given things like the Iraqi pullout and our refusal to aid France and NATO? We will “draw upon every aspect of American power,” yet Obama foreclosed the option of anything beyond air bombing a few minutes later. (Yes, in a public address, he told our enemies what his limits were. If they can weather our bombs, which they are managing quite well now, then they’ll be fine.)

In a flourish of hypocrisy, he also asked Congress to authorize these bombing actions. They’ve not done so yet. The Nobel-winning president that the world once loved dropped bombs on his own authority. Now that the world knows exactly how effective those raids have been, he wants congressional cover.

On life here at home, he lectured us. He lectured us about religion. He lectured us about defense. He lectured us about discrimination. He basically admonished us to stay still and trust him, even though his record has given us no reason to do so and his speech offered no tangible new hope.

We Can’t Protect You, and You Shouldn’t Protect Yourself

The world and our nation are far more dangerous and angry places than they were when he first took office. His message: stay the course and worry about our own behavior. That is a lesson I often tell my children. But it is a message about enduring things we cannot change. It is not what I would tell them to do in the face of a violent bully in the school yard, yet it is the message Obama gave to the American people after a terrorist attack on our own soil.

The world and our nation are far more dangerous and angry places than they were when Obama first took office.

Despite all the despair above, the collapse was most obvious with gun control. Most political journalists and news outlets expected a longer speech. They suspect that he cut a significant portion, most likely about gun control. Even with a perfect storm of elite passion on the issue—the NYT editorial, the New York Daily News screed, and the New Yorker cover—somebody must have made him finally realize the danger and futility of a gun grab of any sort. As I had planned on publishing, there is simply no winning scenario for the federal executive branch versus the Second Amendment. Long before it is the defense against tyranny, it is a most effective deterrent.

Obama dropped all but a bit of control rhetoric and a single, terrible idea. He introduced the call for gun limits by lamenting that the government could not root out every lone terrorist. So government admits that it cannot protect us from lurking, individual evil—again not a comforting speech—and he asks us to lower our personal defenses? Why? So we might be reduced to waiting for a terrorist to reload while we helplessly cower?

Regardless, it was just words. The only specific gun control plan they left in the speech was a supposedly common-sense gun purchase ban for the no-fly list. In the one spark of passion in the speech, Obama said he could think of no reason why we don’t curtail the rights of people on the no-fly list.

Obama Is Out of Ideas

Well, for one, the Senate already rejected the idea on Thursday, so I’m baffled as to what he thinks he options are. Executive orders die in challenges when the legislature has spoken on the issue. More significantly, however, the Senate rejected the ban probably because they, like the American Civil Liberties Union, can think of a bunch of reasons not to use the no-fly list.

The speech reaffirmed to our enemies Obama’s lack of resolve.

The no-fly list is not a just a list of strongly suspected terrorists. It is just billed that way to the public. The criteria are not published, but the most famous lister was the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. He had sufficient pull in the government that he got removed relatively quickly—three weeks. The rest of us are not notified if we are added or removed. We are not informed about why we make the list. We can write a letter to get removed, but there is no guarantee of timely consideration. (Doug Mataconis has a great summary of abuses and usurpations with the no-fly list.)

The speech accomplished nothing. It did not reassure U.S. citizens of their safety here at home. It offered no new ideas for combating terrorists abroad. It reaffirmed to our enemies Obama’s lack of resolve. And the one new, specific proposal for “keeping America safe” will more likely see the no-fly list struck down than allowed as an obstacle for gun purchases.

It seems President Obama has become a lame duck a year early.

"If We're Shaming Verbal Violence, Target Muslim Brotherhood","Following the murderous attack at a Colorado Planned Parenthood by disturbed loner Robert Lewis Dear, the discussion quickly centered on a “climate of hate” or “culture of violence” pro-life organizations supposedly created against abortion supporters.

This was in part because Dear may have uttered the phrase “no more baby parts,” a possible reference to a series of pro-life undercover videos documenting how individuals affiliated with Planned Parenthood have engaged in the sale and transfer of fetal issue.

This messaging targeting pro-life organizations was not accidental, but rather part of a concentrated effort, BuzzFeed reported:

The word ‘terrorism’ is important, activists told BuzzFeed News. They’re trying to make the case that anti-abortion rhetoric ties directly to abortion clinic vandalism, and, finally, to the Colorado shooting. ‘Terrorism’ signals that the ideology behind the shooting was extreme in nature, activists said, and suggests a network of anti-abortion groups and advocates are helping to fuel violence.



Hogue said she knows a thorough investigation into the Colorado shooting is ongoing, and that details of the shooter and his motivations will continue to come out. But the deaths at a Planned Parenthood clinic are about more than one man’s acts, she told BuzzFeed News in an interview.



‘The story is not about this one guy,’ she said. ‘The story is about a really well-funded, really well-connected infrastructure that outlives any one candidate, any one guy, and creates a culture.’

By comparison, following the attack at the Inland Regional Center, where Syed Farooq and his wife Tasheen Malik killed 14 and wounded many more, the Left’s reaction was almost entirely the opposite, seeking to limit the discussion to just the perpetrators. While finally forced to do so following the discovery of an entire “IED factory” in their home, reports admitted Farooq had “been radicalized,” a passive phrase offering no clues as to who or what had created the “culture of violence” surrounding the two terrorists.

Isn’t it possible the Muslim Brotherhood and its front groups bear some responsibility for rhetoric that might invite violence?

A recently revealed Twitter account evidently belonging to Syed Farooq was discovered, however, showing the shooter followed several organizations typically viewed as “mainstream” Islamic groups, including the Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR), CAIR-San Francisco Bay-Area, the Muslim American Society (MAS), and the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA)’s “Why Islam” campaign Twitter, in addition to several pro-Islamic feeds and the official Free Syrian Army page.

Will there be any analysis about whether these organizations may have used rhetoric resulting in a “climate of hate?” Every one of these groups has been recognized as members or allies of the Muslim Brotherhood, a global Islamic organization dedicated to imposing Sharia law. Isn’t it possible that the MB and its front groups bear some responsibility for rhetoric that might invite violence?

Islamists Certainly Use Violent Rhetoric

Consider that in 2010 Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohammed Badie (now in prison in Egypt) gave a speech entitled, “The U.S. Is Now Experiencing the Beginning of Its End,” where he described the United States as “immoral” and headed for its demise, and called for waging jihad.

CAIR San Francisco leader Zahra Billoo encouraged anti-American hatred on her Twitter feed.

Closer to home, in 1998 CAIR National founder emeritus Omar Ahmad told an audience, “Islam wasn’t in America to be equal to any other faith but to be dominant.” CAIR executive director Nihad Awad informed readers of Islam Online that there is a “coordinated campaign against Islam” in the United States carried out by Christians and the pro-Israel lobby, and that the anti-terror policies of the U.S. government were racist. In 2001, Awad said “resistance” to Israel “may be necessary.”

CAIR San Francisco leader Zahra Billoo encouraged anti-American hatred on her Twitter feed, raising questions of whether U.S. troops should be honored for fighting “unjust wars” but seeking help for a “clack liberation soldier,” Jamil Abdullah Amin (a.k.a. H.Rap Brown), a Georgia-based imam and former Black Panther in jail for murdering a police officer.

Amin’s arrest also motivated now-deceased al-Qaeda terrorist Anwar Awlaki, who was investigated by the FBI while he went on tour speaking to raise funds for Amin’s defense. In fact, that speech occurred in southern California just two days after 9/11, and was sponsored by CAIR, MAS, and ICNA, among other MB-affiliated groups.

Islamists Have Also Gone from Words to Violence

Nor is CAIR alone in ratcheting up tensions with their words. Former ICNA President Abdul Malik Mujahid has described American Muslims as “living in a Virtual internment camp,” and as a population “under siege.” Mujahid has been criticized for his statement at a 1995 Islamic Society of North America conference apparently attempting to encourage Muslims to fight jihad in Bosnia:

Qital [killing] is an essential element of Islam. And sometimes you don’t like it. Qital is ordained upon you, though it is hateful to you, but it may happen that you hate a thing which is good for you, and it may happen that you love a thing which is bad for you…. And one example is, now we have 60 or so Muslim countries, and not a single one of them wants to go for Qital and Jihad for Bosnia. Qital is ordained upon you though it is hateful to you.

Mujahid has admitted to making the statement, but claims it was taken out of context. Mujahid was also one of the organizers of a “Stand With the Prophet” rally against the “blasphemous” drawing of Islam’s prophet Mohammed in Garland, Texas. A cartoon contest held in the same location in support of free speech was attacked by Islamic State supporters Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi earlier this year.

Mahdi Bray has described the United States as waging a ‘war on Muslims.’

ICNA is the U.S. front of Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), a Pakistan-based Islamic movement related to the Muslim Brotherhood. The leader of JeI in Pakistan, Sirajul Haq, declared in January that the West had chosen a path leading “to a third world war” due to its “extremist” stance supporting freedom of speech by permitting people to draw Mohammed.

Former MAS Freedom Foundation director Mahdi Bray has described the United States as waging a “war on Muslims” (a propaganda point also frequently used by al-Qaeda and the Islamic State), of “stealing from poor Muslim Americans,” and said a U.S. anti-terrorism trial “legally lynched” convicted (and deported) Palestinian Islamic Jihad organizer Sami Al-Arian.

Given Farooq’s support for these groups, and given their rhetoric, perhaps its time to ask how these statements influenced the “climate of violence”? There’s certainly a better case to be made that Muslim Brotherhood-linked groups, whose leaders extol “resistance” and say “killing is ordained upon you” might have a bigger role in those who carry out murder than a series of investigative videos.

Not All Shooting Sprees Are Terrorism,"For a long time it seemed many liberals couldn’t utter the phrase “terrorism.” President Obama even dropped “terrorism” from the war on terror. In recent months and especially this past week, however, liberals have finally started to embrace talking about terrorism.

Unfortunately, many pundits and journalists have either been misapplying terrorism or intentionally misusing the charge for political purposes. The New York Daily News is a prime offender. On December 4, they published National Rifle Association (NRA) President Wayne LaPierre’s photo on their front page, alongside the photos of some of America’s most infamous mass shooters, calling all of them terrorists.

Smearing the NRA as terrorists is standard fare for New York’s daily bird cage-lining rag. On October 3, it published a column by its own Linda Stasi calling for the State Department to list the NRA as a terrorist organization.

It is just a bit more surprising and irresponsible that the Daily News printed LaPierre’s photo just five days after publishing Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains President Vicki Cowart’s comments that she thought “hateful language [and] hateful speech” contributed to the shooting at Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs.

Television anchors asked Republican politicians if they would modify their language. But no Republican lawmaker has called the Planned Parenthood head a terrorist, nor have they called Planned Parenthood their “enemy” with the righteous fury Hillary Clinton and other Democrats hurled at the NRA at their debate. Hillary even compared opponents of abortion to terrorists and the NRA to “the Iranians or the communists.”

Murder Isn’t Terrorism

Labeling democratic activism as terrorism is the kind of thing authoritarian governments do to silence their critics. Beyond the irresponsible, illiberal, and hypocritical smear against a non-violent activist, the Daily News cover is wrong for misapplying the terrorist label to two psychopathic thugs who are not terrorists—the Sandy Hook shooter and the Aurora shooter.

Labeling democratic activism as terrorism is the kind of thing authoritarian governments do to silence their critics.

To make this distinction is not to excuse or show sympathy for the savages, for they deserve not. Murder is wrong for any reason. But terrorism is a different thing than a random shooting and requires a different response. Confusing the two would make our response less effective.

The definition of terrorism in the U.S. Code is a good starting point: “the term ‘terrorism’ means premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents…”

Legal definitions applied by the United States, United Kingdom, and many Western countries all include a requirement for terroristic violence to be “politically motivated.” There are substantive debates about whether violence against military personnel constitutes terrorism and whether violence perpetuated by the state should be considered terrorism (as the U.S. government’s definition excludes), but those questions are irrelevant to the shootings in question, all of which were conducted by non-state individuals and targeted civilians.

Some governments do have definitions of terrorism that are so broad as to include non-politically motivated violence, or non-violent political activism, that can result in the state arresting protesters on terrorism charges, but those undemocratic measures, like proposals to label the NRA terrorists, must be avoided in our constitutional republic.

We Talk This Way in Real Life, Too

Legal definitions are one thing, but language exists in the popular parlance as well. I propose that the definition requiring political motivation is right and should be accepted and used by the public. The end game of terrorism is not just to murder people. Rather, the murders are intended to intimidate us into acting in accord with the terrorist’s beliefs.

The murders are intended to intimidate us into acting in accord with the terrorist’s beliefs.

Think about the fatwa against “The Satanic Verses” or the murder of Theo van Gogh and the Charlie Hebdo attack. The point of each of those brutalities was to scare people into shutting up about Islam. They were largely successes insomuch as many media outlets have subsequently censored publication of newsworthy cartoons mocking Muhammad or Islam.

When James Holmes stepped into the theatre and pulled the trigger, spraying wildly at the 100 or so people watching “The Dark Knight,” what was his motivation? What was he trying to coerce people into doing or refraining from doing? Many of these shootings have no discernible ideological motivation. Perhaps they are inspired by a disturbed young man’s sexual frustration and sick need for fame after failing at life, as Tom Nichols argued here earlier this year. (That factor can also be coupled with ideologically motivated shootings.)

Whatever it is, in the case of the Aurora theatre shooting and most school shootings, the shooters usually do not leave evidence they picked their targets for broad political reasons that exist beyond themselves, and if they don’t have such motivations, their attacks will not have coercive effects beyond the carnage. If the target is chosen randomly and for no rational reason, then the victims would be just as at risk no matter where they were.

What This Means about Charleston and Colorado Springs

This means the Charleston shooting can be called terrorism based on what we know, and after more evidence comes out, the Planned Parenthood shooting could also turn out to be terrorism. Dylann Roof was quite clear that his motivation to attack an African-American church was racism. He attacked blacks as a race and railed specifically against miscegenation and “race mixing.” This shows his intent was to intimidate African-Americans, to make them feel unsafe in public places and in expressing themselves on racial issues.

Dylann Roof was quite clear that his motivation to attack an African-American church was racism.

The perpetrator of the Colorado Springs shooting was said by an unnamed authority to have referenced “baby parts” and expressed anti-abortion views in his interview. While the full information about his motive has not yet been released, this suggests he could have targeted Planned Parenthood, like Scott Roeder targeting George Tiller, in order to intimidate people out of getting or performing abortions. If that is indeed his motivation, then he too is a terrorist.

That those shootings were politically motivated makes them somewhat more significant in the public view. They might make someone who wants to use one of his constitutionally protected rights just a little bit more apprehensive about doing so. Terrorism is both an attack on the immediate victims’ rights to life and the public’s right to live their lives. We need a separate word to describe it.

Democrats Are Lying About Their Gun Sales Ban,"Gun deaths are down. Gun crimes are down. And progressives still want to take your guns. To aid that purpose, and also because they think it will give Democrats a boost during election season, they are pushing legislation that would allow the Justice Department to forbid the sale or transfer of firearms to, they say, terrorists. Or maybe just to suspected terrorists. Or maybe to people on the federal no-fly list. Or maybe to all of these people. The Democrats have not been clear about just who would be prevented from purchasing firearms under the proposed law.

We’ll Decide Who Gets Guns, on a Rolling Basis

President Barack Obama said in his weekly address, “Right now, people on the no-fly list can walk into a store and buy a gun. That is insane. If you’re too dangerous to board a plane, you’re too dangerous, by definition, to buy a gun. And so I’m calling on Congress to close this loophole, now.” Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also refers to the no-fly list when advocating for the gun sales ban.

On the other hand, the legislation itself, introduced most recently by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California), is entitled the “Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015.” Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nevada) said it must be passed to keep individuals on the terrorist watch list from buying firearms. But Feinstein herself has referred to both the no-fly list and the terrorist watch list when talking about the bill.

So which watch list does the Democrats’ gun ban rely on, and why the obfuscation? The Democrats aren’t going to give anyone a straight answer, but we can go straight to the bill’s text (Senate version, House version). It turns out that the gun sales ban is not tied to the no-fly list, as falsely stated by the president and Clinton and numerous other people, including journalists who have baked this false assumption into their writing. But neither is it directly tied to the terrorist watch list.

We’re Keeping a Private List

Instead, the relevant statutory text links the gun sales ban to individuals who are ”known (or appropriately suspected) to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism, or providing material support thereof.” That language is cribbed from Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-6, which is what created the terrorist watch list (PDF). Thus, the bill gives the U.S. attorney general the discretion to decide whether a person meeting the terrorist watch list criteria should be prevented from purchasing a firearm.

The only way you might find out that you are a suspected terrorist is if you apply for a background check to purchase a gun and are denied.

The Democrats’ lie matters for four reasons. First, the terrorist watch list is much larger than the no-fly list. It varies over time, but there are approximately 1,000,000 people listed in the former, and somewhere around 47,000 people on the no-fly list. Feinstein defends using the criteria that creates a larger list by saying only a fraction of the million-or-so people on the terrorist watch list are U.S. citizens, but whether that’s a large or small fraction is classified.

That’s the second thing. We don’t have precise numbers because these lists are secret. At present, the government has no obligation to inform you that you have been placed on the terrorist watch list, and there are no statutory means to get off of the list. All of that is left in the hands of unknown and unknowable bureaucrats. Under this bill, the only way you might find out that you are a suspected terrorist is if you apply for a background check to purchase a gun and are denied. Even then, the legislation gives the government the discretionary authority to withhold its reasoning for why you were denied.

We’re Playing Loose With the Facts

Third, this will shock the president and Clinton, but people forbidden from buying a gun under this legislation will still be allowed to travel by air. This is because people on the terrorist watch list are not forbidden from flying. They get extra scrutiny at airports, but can come and go as they please, making the president’s pitch even more nonsensical. The terrorist watch list was never designed as a vehicle for adjudicating an individual’s rights or benefits in relation to the government.

The terrorist watch list was never designed as a vehicle for adjudicating an individual’s rights or benefits in relation to the government.

Fourth, the terrorist watch list already gets pinged when an individual applies for a background check for a firearm purchase. Matches are passed to the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division, which may then investigate and block the purchase if it is illegal. Individuals on the terrorist watch list routinely pass this extra screening because the government usually lacks evidence to forbid the purchase. After all, that’s why these individuals are on a watch list, and not in a jail cell.

Thus, when Democrats say the no-fly list should be a no-gun list, they are misleading the public about the bill before Congress. Even Feinstein, who introduced the legislation, gets this wrong some of the time, willfully, according to one of her aides.

The fact that they are pushing for this law now is also pure opportunism. Feinstein introduced this particular legislation in February 2015. It didn’t go anywhere. Nor did it get any traction when it was introduced back in 2009, 2011, and 2013. That’s because, as discussed here previously, the law as written would violate both the Second and Fifth Amendments. Democrats obviously think the time is ripe.

Know Your Tropes For Exploiting Terrorism,"On Sunday, President Obama gave us another dull, rote speech on terrorism in which he promised to stay the course on whatever it is he thinks he’s doing about ISIS. And then lectured us about our intolerance.

It was notable for only one thing: the presidential adoption of the Exactly What ISIS Wants trope.

You know the one. If someone doesn’t like any particular response to the latest terrorist attack, he’ll tell you that this response is “exactly what ISIS wants.” It has been dreadfully popular since last month’s attacks in Paris, and it is threatening to become 2015’s answer to 2001’s trope, “Or the Terrorists Win.”

You remember that one, right? In case you don’t, here’s a handy guide to help you know your tropes for the political exploitation of terrorism.

‘Or The Terrorists Win’

This is the claim that people should engage in some utterly ordinary activity — shopping, watching television, eating bacon, etc. — as an act of defiance against terrorism. Because if they don’t do it, “then the terrorists win.”

This trope originated with exhortations from President Bush just after 9/11 for people to keep going about their normal lives in spite of the fear al-Qaeda wanted to instill in them. Which is reasonable enough, I suppose, but then it got out of hand. It was summed up by Ellen DeGeneres at the 2001 Emmy awards about two months after 9/11: “We’re told to go on living our lives as usual, because to do otherwise is to let the terrorists win, and really, what would upset the Taliban more than a gay woman wearing a suit in front of a room full of Jews?”

Note that in its pure form, Or the Terrorists Win is not about the need to pursue some actual foreign policy that might disrupt or defeat terrorists. It’s about asking us to “go on living our lives as usual” — which means that there is no activity too trivial or mundane that it cannot be recast as an act of defiance against terrorism.

Or the Terrorists Win is no longer a trope, strictly speaking, because it has become a running joke. No one uses it non-ironically any more.

But they are still oh-so-serious about knowing Exactly What ISIS Wants.

‘Exactly What ISIS Wants’

The bodies were barely cool in the Paris shootings when we were treated to lectures that “The West Is Giving ISIS Exactly What It Wants,” usually accompanied by very dubious projections of what ISIS wants, which just so happen to correspond to any policy proposed by someone on the American right.

Exactly What ISIS Wants may seem as if it is the opposite of Or the Terrorists Win. Or the Terrorists Win urges action to defy terrorism — albeit trivial and ineffectual — while Exactly What ISIS Wants demands inaction. But both effectively say the same thing: act as if the situation is normal, go on with our lives as if nothing happened. Or the Terrorists Win tells us to go shopping or hold awards ceremonies or whatever else we were already doing — even though many young men, thankfully, did disrupt their lives by volunteering to join the armed forces. Exactly What ISIS Wants tells us to change nothing about our policies toward terrorism, toward ISIS, toward Syria, toward refugees, or anything else — even if such changes might be warranted.

The purest, most absurd use of Exactly What ISIS Wants is to declare, “If we go to war, we’re doing exactly what the terrorists want.”

Y’all realize ISIS wants to provoke a war, right? If we go to war, we’re doing exactly what the terrorists want.— Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) November 16, 2015

Get that? Don’t destroy ISIS. Don’t bomb them, shoot them, or hunt them down like dogs. That’s exactly what they want!

As absurd as it may sound, this is the specific form Obama used in his appeal to Exactly What ISIS Wants: “We should not be drawn once more into a long and costly ground war in Iraq or Syria. That’s what groups like ISIL want.” To which he then adds: “They know they can’t defeat us on the battlefield.” Strange, then, that they would want to draw us into a war they know they can’t win, isn’t it? It reminds me of the famous Patton quote: “No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.” If terrorists are eager to die for their cause, why not accommodate them?

Surely it is possible that ISIS may not be the best judge of what is in its own interests, just as Japan was not the best judge of its interests when it bombed Pearl Harbor. Surely it is possible that talking heads who only sporadically discuss foreign policy are not the world’s foremost experts on exactly what ISIS does, in fact, want. And maybe we should decide our response to terrorism based on our own judgment of our interests, without worrying too much about what ISIS has to say on the matter.

Exactly What ISIS Wants is the black hole of arguments.

But Exactly What ISIS Wants is the black hole of arguments. It pulls any proposed action against terrorism into its gravitation field and sucks all motion and energy out of it. Which is interesting, because I’m pretty sure that dithering and inaction on our part is exactly what ISIS wants. It has certainly served their interests so far.

But we have not exhausted the tropes for the political exploitation of terrorism, not by a long shot. Exactly What ISIS Wants, for example, is merely an inverted version of Vicarious Terrorism.

‘Vicarious Terrorism’

Vicarious Terrorism is when you advocate responding to terrorism by taking away the grievances that motivate it — which means, in effect, granting the terrorists’ demands.

The person who makes this argument is not a supporter or sympathizer of the terrorist group in question and would never dream of committing an act of terrorism himself. It’s just that the terrorists’ supposed grievances happen to correspond in some way to his pre-existing agenda, and he just can’t help using the attack to promote that agenda.

Some of the most garish examples of Vicarious Terrorism come not from the left but from the right (sort of). In his 2007 book “The Enemy at Home,” for example, Dinesh D’Souza declared, “The cultural left in this country…is responsible for causing 9/11” because it is “the primary cause of the volcano of anger toward America that is erupting from the Islamic world.” It is our decadent, godless, secular lifestyle that enrages Muslim fanatics, and gosh, they really have a point.

Note that D’Souza, whatever else you might think of him, is not the sort of person who would go on a shooting spree or plan a bombing campaign against those liberal heathens. He would never be a terrorist himself. But he does advocate the suppression of leftist secularism — a goal that just happens to coincide with his own ideological prejudices — as an answer to terrorism.

Or consider Ron Paul, who has developed the unfortunate habit of quoting Osama bin Laden as an authority on U.S. foreign policy. In 2007, he told the Des Moines Register:

Have you ever read about the reasons they attacked us? They attack us because we’ve been over there. We’ve been bombing Iraq for 10 years. We’ve been in the Middle East…. I’m suggesting that we listen to the people who attacked us, and the reason they did it and they are delighted that we’re over there, because Osama bin Laden has said, “I am glad you’re over on our sand, because we can target you so much easier.”

Before going to war in Syria was Exactly What ISIS Wants, fighting al-Qaeda in Afghanistan was exactly what Bin Laden wanted.

In both of these examples, the proposals obviously amount to appeasement: assuage the enemy’s anger by meeting his demands, either for the persecution of infidels or for American disengagement from the Middle East. But what makes them examples of Vicarious Terrorism is that the appeasement is repackaged as a way of undermining terrorism rather than giving in to it.

Tropes are always used to justify a pre-existing agenda.

One of the common threads among these tropes — the thing that makes them tropes — is the fact that they are always used to justify a pre-existing agenda. They are less a response to terrorism than an attempt to exploit terrorism to promote or defend an existing political program. In one variant of this trope, that becomes even clearer.

When Ron Paul used the same argument in response to the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris in January, I noted an important difference. He asserted that the cause of the attack was Muslims’ anger at French intervention in the Middle East and West Africa. But this motive was Paul’s own invention. The attackers themselves shouted that they were targeting the French magazine because of its blasphemous depictions of their prophet. As I put it, “Ron Paul wants to overrule the Islamists’ own statement of their motives,” substituting invented motives that correspond better to his own agenda.

That makes this a whole new trope, and one that has also been taken up by Obama in his response to ISIS. I call it Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy.

‘Bin Laden Syndrome By Proxy’

In Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy, you take someone else’s terrorist attack, fantasize what you think its causes and motives ought to be according to your world view, then advocate a response intended to address this pretended cause.

In Vicarious Terrorism, the terrorists’ real motives and agenda have some overlap with your own, and you succumb to the temptation to exaggerate the connection and use the attacks to promote your agenda. But in Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy, the overlap is entirely a product of your own imagination, spurred by naked opportunism.

Probably the best example I have ever seen of Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy is giving a speech after an ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in which you tell the American people that gun control is now “a matter of national security” — which is exactly what Obama just did. Obviously, he did not start wanting to ban “assault weapons” because a couple of terrorists used them last week. He’s been advocating it all along as his standard response to domestic shootings by crazy people with no ideological motive at all. But these shootings haven’t mobilized the public to support gun control, so he repackaged his argument to connect it to an issue on which people do seem to want strong action.

Then again, maybe that’s not the very best example, because it’s hard to top “climate change caused the Paris attacks.”

What unites Exactly What ISIS Wants and Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy is that they both help the user avoid addressing the essential cause behind the current terrorism threat: the religion of Islam. This avoidance has spawned a whole constellation of tropes, starting with the assertion that the Islamic State and Islamic terrorism have Nothing to Do with Islam.

‘Nothing To Do With Islam’

“This has nothing to do with Islam” is a standard description for anything bad done by a Muslim in the name of Islam, based on arguments offered by Islamic imams citing quotations from Islamic scripture.

Hence Hillary’s Clinton’s assurance that “Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism” — in response to attacks in Paris by Muslims who were not peaceful or tolerant and had something to do with terrorism.

This is a variant of The Religion of Peace.

‘The Religion Of Peace’

The Religion of Peace is the religion that did not motivate the San Bernardino shootings, the Paris attacks, the Charlie Hebdo massacre, the Fort Hood shootings, the beheading of hostages in Syria, the mass execution of policemen and soldiers in Iraq, the shooting schoolgirls in the head, and so on and on. It definitely didn’t motivate the 9/11 attacks, and that is why it is not even supposed to be mentioned at the Ground Zero museum.

Must be some other faith. Try the Presbyterians.

The purest examples of either trope are when non-Muslims — who endow themselves with the authority to speak on behalf of somebody else’s religion — offer assurances about the essential peaceful and tolerant nature of Islam. This culminates in No True Muslim.

‘No True Muslim’

This is a variant on the No True Scotsman trope. In its original inspiration, this is a type of circular reasoning used by a Scotsman to endow his countryman with some particular, virtuous quality. When confronted with the counter-example of a Scot who fails to possess this virtue, he merely declares that the miscreant must be “no true Scotsman.”

In this case, the trope is used by a non-Muslim to disavow the association of Muslims with any negative qualities — particularly religiously motivated violence — by asserting that anyone who commits such violence must be No True Muslim.

Thus, when a British Muslim began stabbing people the London subway and declared, “This is for Syria,” an onlooker was recorded telling the attacker, in impeccable London slang, “You ain’t no Muslim, bruv!”

Tropes are tools of mental laziness and evasion, intended to help us to stick to our prejudices in the face of inconvenient facts.

The person who said this has not been identified, so he may himself have been Muslim, which is not a perfect example of the trope. What is a perfect example of the trope is British Prime Minister David Cameron taking up the slogan and responding, “Some of us have dedicated speeches and media appearances and sound bites and everything on this subject, but ‘You ain’t no Muslim, bruv,’ said it all much better than I ever could.” Amazing, isn’t it, that a white British Christian’s assertions about the peaceful nature of Islam don’t seem to have had much effect?

But as Hillary Clinton explained above, describing Islamic terrorists as Muslims would “play into their hands.” It is Exactly What ISIS Wants.

You see how it all fits together. If we can’t admit to the real motive of Islamic terrorists or address their actual strategic goals, we need to invent new motives and goals and use these polite fictions to dictate what actions are acceptable and unacceptable as a response. And if we’re going to do that, we might as well invent motives and responses that allow us to remain comfortably in the rut of our established domestic political routine.

In declaring that No True Muslim is inspired by the Religion of Peace to engage in terrorism, which has Nothing to Do with Islam, we invite ourselves to engage in Bin Laden Syndrome by Proxy, because otherwise we might be tempted to do Exactly What ISIS Wants. We had better continue along undisturbed in our pre-existing routine, Or the Terrorists Win.

In literature and drama, it may be the case that Tropes Are Not Bad, but in politics, they usually are. They are tools of mental laziness and evasion, intended to help us to stick to our prejudices in the face of inconvenient facts. Which makes it all the more important to know your tropes.

Why Does Obama Contradict What His Government Says About Terrorism?,"In the wake of the Paris and San Bernardino attacks, President Obama has consistently told the American people three things:

1. ISIS is contained.

2. His current strategy to defeat ISIS is working and will ultimately succeed.

3. The San Bernardino terror suspects do not appear to be a part of a larger global conspiracy to threaten the homeland.

At this point, it’s fair to ask, “Where is Obama getting his information?” because government officials have been saying the opposite of these talking points for quite some time. This week, agencies have begun to take matters into their own hands and ramp up efforts to combat terrorism. Clearly, this goes against the White House’s reassurances that the threat is being contained.

ISIS Is Not At All Contained

The notion that ISIS is contained and Obama’s current strategy is winning the fight against terror has been largely debunked. Several weeks before the San Bernardino attack, intelligence reports warned the White House that ISIS was gaining traction, and it would continue to spread globally unless it lost significant territory on battlegrounds in Iraq and Syria, The Daily Beast reported.

Even now, Obama refuses to acknowledge intelligence contradicting what he says in public.

The report — which the Obama administration itself requested — was issued before the Paris and San Bernardino attacks, and well before Obama assured the nation that ISIS is “contained.” So it’s curious the president decided to use that word when describing the situation to the American public, as it contradicted the information we now know was available to him at the time.

Wednesday morning, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter saidISIS was not contained during his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. His words contrast starkly to the narrative the president has been pumping out.

For some context, consider the president’s Oval Office address, in which he said there’s no evidence the suspected San Bernardino terrorists were directed by ISIS or “part of a broader conspiracy here at home.”

He also alluded to ramping up efforts to fight jihadists abroad. However, the steps he outlined to combat ISIS seem largely unchanged from the strategy, which has been failing for quite some time. By now, it’s clear that air strikes and climate change talks are not working. ISIS is gaining — not losing — influence in the global sphere. According to intelligence analysts working at the president’s disposal, the best way to counter ISIS is to ensure that it suffers serious territorial losses on the battlefield. So why isn’t Obama listening?

Why is it so difficult for him to accept that the actions taken in San Bernardino are in fact part of a larger conspiracy at work: to exterminate those who hold Western ideals of freedom and establish a global caliphate ruled by Sharia law? And why isn’t he willing to try a new strategy?

Is Obama Still Insulated From the Truth About the War On Terror?

There’s another example of the Obama administration’s tendency to ignore intelligence that contradicts a desired public narrative. Earlier this year, analysts came forward to publicly reveal that the U.S. military’s Central Command was selectively editing information gathered about the war on terror. The analysts claimed higher-ups altered reports before sending them to the White House so the intelligence would match a more favorable public narrative.

The best way to counter ISIS is to ensure that it suffers serious territorial losses on the battlefield. So why isn’t Obama listening?

We don’t know exactly how high this intelligence cover-up goes. It isn’t clear if Obama fostered a culture that drove higher-ups within the intelligence community to pass along only good news, or if those close to the president tried to insulate him from the truth. Or if perhaps intelligence higher-ups did it for their own self-serving purposes.

Regardless of where the directives to edit intelligence came from, it’s clear Obama wasn’t getting the truth for quite some time, which casts a shadow on his tenure in office and his decisions today as commander in chief.

Even now, Obama refuses to acknowledge intelligence contradicting what he says in public. Last year, an estimated 250 Americans attempted to join ISIS. This number has spiked significantly from the 100 Americans who tried to join militant Islamists overseas last year. These figures don’t include the number of U.S. citizens who have been radicalized here, like the terrorists behind the Boston bombing and the Fort Hood attack. Yet, as recently as Sunday, Obama affirmed the notion that we are succeeding in our efforts to combat ISIS.

Perhaps he is so insulated within the walls of his Pennsylvania Avenue residence that he’s unable to gain access to the truth. Or, worse, he may actually believe he possesses the ability to dictate reality. Whatever the case may be, Obama’s unchanged public narrative — that his strategy is working to defeat ISIS — is cause for alarm.

Government Agencies Are Going Rogue To Protect Americans

The secretary of Defense isn’t the only government official to speak in direct opposition to the White House’s narrative, either. The Department of Homeland Security announced earlier this week that in the wake of the San Bernardino attack — the deadliest terrorist attack since 9/11 — it will launch an emergency alert system warning civilians of terror threats.

It’s both an interesting mystery and an alarming question as to where the president has been getting his information on terror.

This announcement is revealing for two reasons: first, the need for an emergency alert system indicates DHS expects more terror activity to occur on U.S. soil. This directly defies the notion that ISIS is contained. Second, it suggests the San Bernardino attack could be part of a larger conspiracy against U.S. civilians that continues to endanger American lives. If last week’s attack was, as Obama said, a lone wolf shooting that wasn’t directed by overseas terrorists, then why is the government preparing for more attacks? Does Obama think Americans won’t notice that his narrative contradicts with DHS’s actions?

The source of Obama’s intelligence, which is driving his decisions in combatting ISIS, doesn’t seem to be coming from the DOD, DHS, or intelligence agencies. So it’s both an interesting mystery and an alarming question as to where the president has been getting his information on terror.

In any case, it’s clear there’s an apparent breakdown in communication between intelligence officials and the White House when it comes to fighting terrorism. While the cause of this breakdown is anyone’s guess, we can’t hope to defeat ISIS until it is repaired.

The NYT Has No Clue How The Assault Weapons Ban Worked,"Another day, another series of embarrassing errors and obfuscations by gun controllers who are ignorant of how guns, and the laws that seek to control them, actually work.

In its quest to drive up gun sales even further and make gun control even less popular, the New York Times published yet another overwrought editorial on Friday demanding more gun control. Here’s how the editorial, given the very measured and objective title of “Gunmakers’ War Profiteering on the Homefront,” began:

As each new mass shooting leaves dead and wounded Americans strewn like casualties on a battlefield — a butcher’s toll that has now intersected with the international terrorist threat — the gun industry’s culpability amounts to war profiteering through the reckless sale of military weapons tailored for the civilian homefront.

It only got more hysterical from there. Notably missing from the editorial? Any basic understanding of guns or gun control laws. In this paragraph, the New York Times claims that .50-caliber sniper rifles are now flooding the streets due to the expiration of the 1994 federal assault weapons ban:

Assault weapons were banned for 10 years until Congress, in bipartisan obeisance to the gun lobby, let the law lapse in 2004. As a result, gun manufacturers have been allowed to sell all manner of war weaponry to civilians, including the super destructive .50-caliber sniper rifle, which an 18-year-old can easily buy in many places even where he or she must be 21 to buy a simpler handgun. Why any civilian would need this weapon, designed to pierce concrete bunkers and armored personnel carriers, is a question that should be put to the gun makers who profit from them and the politicians who shamelessly do their bidding.

Those icky guns aren’t just destructive, they’re super destructive. There’s just one teeny, tiny problem with that paragraph: bolt-action .50-caliber rifles were never covered by the federal assault weapons ban. There’s no possible way the expiration of the assault weapons ban could have led to the proliferation of a weapon that was never actually banned by the law, but editorial page editor Andy Rosenthal has never been one to let simple facts get in the way of an unhinged screed.

The 1994 assault weapons law banned semi-automatic rifles only if they had any two of the following five features: a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor, or a grenade launcher. I am unable to see how a collapsible stock or a pistol grip or a mere bayonet mount (not the bayonet itself) is capable of turning a regular weapon into a deadly assault weapon, but your mileage may vary. A bolt-action rifle, even a super destructive .50-caliber bolt-action rifle, that contained all of those features still would not have been covered by the 1994 ban. And to get a .50-caliber semi-automatic rifle around the 1994 restrictions, you would just need to pin the stock and switch out the pistol grip.

And then there’s the fact that a .50-caliber rifle has never been used in a mass shooting in the U.S. Never. That’s probably because those guns are hugely expensive (potentially costing $10,000 or more, not to mention the cost of ammunition) and difficult to lug around given their size and weight (the gun is nearly four feet long and weighs 24 pounds with a loaded magazine). But this is the gun-confiscating New York Times we’re talking about. Expecting its editorialists to understand the objects about which they are editorializing would be a bridge too far.

Which brings us to my next favorite selection in Friday’s editorial: the insinuation that lax control laws allowed the San Bernardino terrorists to build their deadly arsenal with “ease”:

Across recent decades, gun manufacturers, facing a decline in general gun ownership as demographics shifted and sports hunting faded, have cynically created a domestic market for barely altered rifles and pistols developed for the military. These are weapons designed for the rapid spray-shooting of multiple enemy soldiers in wartime, not homeland civilians living in peace.



Yet the latest casualty count of 14 killed and 21 wounded last week in the gun carnage at San Bernardino, Calif., is another horrendous confirmation of how these easily available weapons — marketed as macho tools for a kind of paramilitary self-defense — are being used again and again for rapid-fire attacks on innocent people. The fact that the California killers were self-proclaimed Islamic warriors makes the ease with which their arsenal was assembled all the more outrageous.

What the New York Times predictably fails to tell its readers is that the rifles used by the San Bernardino terrorists were, in fact, illegal. What made them illegal? California has its own version of the expired federal assault weapons ban, which for some reason failed to prevent terrorists from obtaining the weapons and using them to kill people. You read that correctly. Terrorists hell-bent on death and destruction were somehow still able to get their hands on illegal weapons. Imagine that. Criminals with no regard for laws against murder weren’t dissuaded by laws against the possession of certain weapons. It’s almost like gun laws, like drug laws and early-20th century alcohol laws, don’t do a very good job of keeping banned items out of the hands of criminals who wish to possess them. Weird, right?

And don’t get me started on the New York Times‘ silly assertion that a semi-automatic weapon is just a “barely altered” version of a military grade automatic weapon. For years, gun controllers deliberately obscured the difference between the two, regularly referring to semi-automatic guns (one trigger pull, one bang) as automatic weapons (one trigger pull, lots of bangs until you run out of ammunition). In fact, the New York Times did that very thing when it suggested that “rapid spray-shooting” weapons are available to “homeland civilians living in peace” (the families of the 14 victims of the San Bernardino terrorist attack might reject the characterization of the Inland Regional Center as peaceful). But just in case the New York Times was unable to get away with its blatantly dishonest conflation of automatic and semi-automatic, its writers decided to parrot the notion that there’s no real difference between the two types.

It’s almost enough to make one pity these poor, ignorant simpletons, especially when you consider the latest results from the New York Times’ very own poll: support for the assault weapons ban is now at record lows:

For first time in 20 yrs of @nytimes poll, a majority of Americans opposes ban on assault weapons pic.twitter.com/xosjHoDNTi



Patrick J. Egan (@Patrick_J_Egan) December 11, 2015

Here’s how the New York Times described the results of its poll in the 24th paragraph of a 25-paragraph story on the survey:

What has shifted notably are attitudes on gun control. Only 44 percent of Americans favor a ban on assault weapons, 19 percentage points lower than after the mass shooting in Tucson in 2011. And while 51 percent favor stricter gun control in general, that is down from 58 percent in October.

The truth of the matter is that gun control is less popular than ever, thanks in large part to the fears of Americans that their government is either unwilling or incapable of keeping them safe from domestic terrorist attacks. You’d never read this in the New York Times, but the National Rifle Association (NRA) is far more popular than either President Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. That’s no accident.

What gun controllers either don’t realize or refuse to accept is that their radical agenda is not supported by most Americans. The more gun controllers talk, the more popular gun rights become. Most people understand that they have a God-given right, acknowledged and protected by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, to defend themselves and their families from anyone who would harm them. Unhinged demands for gun control by ideologues like Andy Rosenthal and Barack Obama have the exact opposite intended effect. Whenever they lecture, gun sales go up, and gun rights become more popular.

As a result, silly and uninformed rants like those published in the New York Times on Friday don’t bother me. They amuse me to no end. Keep it up, gun controllers! Your rhetoric just might be the most effective advertisement for guns ever devised.

"We’re All Being Pretty Quiet About Obama’s Failures, Aren’t We?","President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign was built on the claim that he was not just tough on terrorists, but also he was successful in fighting them. “President Obama has placed the killing of Osama bin Laden at the center of his reelection effort,” began one Washington Post story about the effort.

Vice President Joe Biden was sent out on the campaign trail to repeat the mantra daily: “Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive!”

And it wasn’t just bin Laden. The campaign wanted to emphasize how successful Obama’s strategy was when it came to containing Islamist terrorism. Throughout the 2012 campaign, Obama described al Qaeda as being “on the path to defeat” or “decimated.” One media outlet counted 32 instances of him saying this even after the al Qaeda-linked attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.

At a campaign stop in Colorado, he said, “Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq — and we did. I said we’d wind down the war in Afghanistan — and we are. And while a new tower rises above the New York skyline, al Qaeda is on the path to defeat, and Osama bin Laden is dead.”

A seven-minute video that made the case for re-electing Obama includes the now-even-more-outlandish promise that 32 million uninsured Americans would be covered under Obamacare by 2016, along with various other domestic claims. The foreign policy section touted an Obama speech where he said, “and now the war in Iraq is over,” and “for nearly nine years, our nation has been at war in Iraq. As your Commander-in-Chief and on behalf of a grateful nation, I’m finally proud to say these two words, ‘Welcome home.'” Graphics that read, “Iraq War Ended,” and “Libya Liberated” flashed across the screen.

The media carried the message forward. Al Qaeda was on the run. When the GOP presidential nominee talked about Russia being a major geopolitical threat, Obama chided him: “The 1980s are calling, they want their foreign policy back.” Snap! Zing! The media loved it. They bought the claim that Benghazi was not an orchestrated, successful, Islamist terror attack so much as a very good reason to re-evaluate the First Amendment in the U.S. They bought the Sunday morning show talking points and carried the candidate to victory.

Can you even imagine such journalistic avoidance under the Bush administration?

Cut to not even two weeks ago when 14 Americans were brutally killed in San Bernardino, California, and another 22 injured by Islamist terrorists Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik. This was the deadliest such terror attack on American soil since September 11, 2001.

There has been a smattering of in-depth media coverage in the aftermath, including local reporting by the Los Angeles Times, and some solid investigations into the federal bureaucracy’s inability to prevent these attacks by The New York Times. But you’d be forgiven for darkly laughing at one wag’s observation from Twitter:

“How The Murder of 14 American Civilians on Our Own Soil Doesn’t Reflect Badly On Obama In Any Way Whatsoever” ~ every article today



Will Antonin (@Will_Antonin) December 7, 2015

Indeed! The media have seemed willing to go in any direction but there. Maybe the problem is people praying to God for mercy, some with actual jobs in the media suggested. Others went to their quasi-religious discussions of gun control. Many have stayed there. Still others have responded to Donald Trump’s every utterance with codependent yelps and squeals. Anywhere, anywhere, but a discussion of Obama’s handling of national security as it relates to Islamist terrorists. Can you even imagine such journalistic avoidance under the Bush administration? Particularly, seven long years into the Bush administration? Let’s look at a few Obama talking points that very quietly took a beating in recent weeks.

Women Can’t Be Terrorists

Shortly after ISIS’ horrifically deadly attack throughout Paris a month ago, Obama responded to concerns about terrorists exploiting refugee and immigration paths to entry to the U.S. In an odd press conference in the immediate aftermath of Paris, the president sounded detached and disinterested, except when he mocked Republicans for expressing such concern. Later, in the Philippines, he revised and extended those remarks. Here’s a sample:

Speaking to reporters Wednesday morning in the Philippines, Obama scoffed at attempts to block refugees following the Paris terror attacks as “political posturing” that “needs to stop.” “Apparently they are scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America,” Obama said of Republicans. “At first, they were too scared of the press being too tough on them in the debates. Now they are scared of three year old orphans. That doesn’t seem so tough to me.”

Whenever he talked about Paris — an attack, which investigators suspect, saw some terrorists exploit refugee systems in Europe — Obama seemed more passionate about making fun of Republicans who worried about terrorists exploiting refugee systems. He kept making the point that women and children are nothing to fear. It’s of course true that most Islamist terrorists are male. But women can also commit acts of terrorism, as was the case in San Bernardino when Malik and her husband killed and injured so many innocent Americans. Obama quickly dropped the taunts about fearing women, but no media called him on it.

We Vet Immigrants Well

Another claim made repeatedly by the Obama administration was that people were stupid idiots to be worried about terrorists exploiting entry pathways to the country on account of how good our vetting is. When the Republicans in Congress worked on a bill to improve the process of vetting refugees from Syria, the White House issued yet another — yet another! — veto threat. The statement began:

The Administration’s highest priority is to ensure the safety and security of the American people. That is why refugees of all nationalities, including Syrians and Iraqis, considered for admission to the United States undergo the most rigorous and thorough security screening of anyone admitted into the United States…. The current screening process involves multiple Federal intelligence, security, and law enforcement agencies, including the National Counterterrorism Center, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), State, and Defense, all aimed at ensuring that those admitted do not pose a threat to our country.

And so on and so forth. Media coverage — which included numerous stories trying to guilt critics by making Biblically questionable comparisons with the Holy Family — strongly suggested that skeptics were evil. Either way, if poor, vulnerable refugees are vetted this much, surely we must be vetting regular immigrants even more, right? Bad news. One of the San Bernardino murderers came into the country on a fiancé visa. Her tough application included questions such as, and I’m not joking:

“Are you a member or representative of a terrorist organization?”

“Have you ever ordered, incited, committed, assisted or otherwise participated in genocide?”

“Have you ever committed, ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated in torture?”

I mean, what answers do they think they’re going to get? The New York Times further reports that the murderer was openly calling for violence against the U.S., but we totally missed it because of how bad our vetting is:

WASHINGTON — Tashfeen Malik, who with her husband carried out the massacre in San Bernardino, Calif., passed three background checks by American immigration officials as she moved to the United States from Pakistan. None uncovered what Ms. Malik had made little effort to hide — that she talked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad. She said she supported it. And she said she wanted to be a part of it… Had the authorities found the posts years ago, they might have kept her out of the country. But immigration officials do not routinely review social media as part of their background checks, and there is a debate inside the Department of Homeland Security over whether it is even appropriate to do so.

ABC News also reported that a “Secret US Policy Blocks Agents From Looking at Social Media of Visa Applicants, Former Official Says.” Remember how much crap we gave President Bush for his “heckuva job, Brownie” comments in the aftermath of Katrina? Well, heckuva job everyone responsible for vetting new Americans. You couldn’t be doing better. A++ work.

But back to Obama. He issued a veto threat after claiming we couldn’t do any better at screening people. Turns out we’re asking them to volunteer information about how bad they are and respecting the “privacy” of their public comments calling for violent jihad. And yet, the media undoubtedly spent 200 times more time talking about whatever a certain floppy-haired presidential candidate muttered than this. Seriously, we saw the media make fun of Trump’s claim that he’d screen Muslim visitors by simply asking them whether they were Muslim. And rightly so, because that’s a plan that makes no sense. It’s also exactly what we were doing to screen out threats — asking people to tell us whether they were one — but the breathless and concerned coverage about the policies of an actual administration currently in power seems notably lacking.

ISIS Is No Biggie, Everything Is Awesome

As we discussed at the beginning, a major theme of Obama’s presidency has been that Al Qaeda’s on the run, ISIS is the JV team, they’re totally contained, and we’re going to stay the course while fighting them. This is quite obviously wrong to everyone outside of most newsrooms. Also, Obama has claimed that we’re out of Afghanistan and Iraq. Except that we’re in no way out of Afghanistan and Iraq. In October, he announced that the U.S. would keep 10,000 troops in Afghanistan, contrary to the campaign promise he’d end the war there. On December 6, the Los Angeles Times rather softly noted, “The Obama administration quietly announced a significant new escalation in its war against Islamic State last week: It’s deploying U.S. special operations troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria to go after leaders of the Islamist movement.” And yet again, the media aren’t particularly concerned. During the Bush administration, newscasts ended with solemn music and a scroll of the names of men and women who had died fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Newspapers ran sections listing the dead. Yet for some reason, the media coverage of the cost of such wars has been eerily quiet, even though 75 percent of the soldiers killed in Afghanistan have been killed during Obama’s time in office.

Protecting The Homeland

A Gallup poll just came out showing that American concern about terrorism has spiked:

Americans are more worried about terrorism than they have been in a long time https://t.co/A2XjpsHCm1 pic.twitter.com/p5zpj5nchK Aaron Blake (@AaronBlakeWP) December 15, 2015

A Wall Street Journal poll shows similar results:

Heightened fear of terrorism is rippling through the electorate, thrusting national-security issues to the center of the 2016 presidential campaign, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released on the eve of Republicans’ latest presidential debate.



Some 40% of those polled say national security and terrorism should be the government’s top priority, and more than 60% put it in the top two, up from just 39% eight months ago.

A whopping 70 percent say the country is “on the wrong track,” and 60 percent disapprove of Obama’s handling of ISIS.

Meanwhile, more than 50 intelligence analysts working out of the U.S. military’s Central Command “have formally complained that their reports on ISIS and al Qaeda’s branch in Syria were being inappropriately altered by senior officials, the Daily Beast reported.

The New York Times also reported that classified assessments about ISIS were significantly changed to “mask some of the American military’s failures in training Iraqi troops and beating back the Islamic State. The analysts say supervisors were particularly eager to paint a more optimistic picture of America’s role in the conflict than was warranted.”

And yet too many in the media sound downright Vox-y in their overall analysis of Obama’s foreign policy. This wasn’t even true when Matt Yglesias wrote it on November 16, but here’s how Vox Voxsplains Obama’s foreign policy:

Obama’s excellent record on national security

Consider, for example, the crowd-pleasing high points of Obama on national security. Unlike George W. Bush he really has “kept us safe” and avoided any terrorist attacks on the US homeland.

Even more wrong now than it was November 16.

And yet The Atlantic‘s James Fallows writes this week:

Obama: Chessmaster, not Pawn

Many of the president’s supporters fear that he hasn’t really known what he is doing. Many of his critics worry that he is all-too-skillful at attaining his ends. There’s increasing evidence that the critics may be right.

I think this may be the most obsequious subhead about Obama I’ve read yet: His supporters have a minor criticism that doesn’t dissuade them from supporting him! His critics think he’s a genius! The critics are right!

Even worse, this is the headline and subhead for an article claiming that Obama is totally awesome at foreign policy because of the mere existence of a climate deal; because of rapprochement with Cuba; and because of the Iran deal.

The media coverage of the cost of such wars has been eerily quiet, even though 75 percent of the soldiers killed in Afghanistan have been killed during Obama’s time in office.

Now, let’s assume he included Cuba because he needed at least three examples. And let’s acknowledge that there are people, such as Fallows, who earnestly believe the Iran deal is not a disaster. The climate deal? Are you kidding? I know it got journalists excited, but there was no risk of not getting a deal, particularly when it demanded so very little of the signers.

In any case, it’s 2015. We’re at war in Afghanistan, war in Iraq, helped destabilize Libya and Syria, have seen the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, have no ability to vet visitors and entrants to the country or otherwise protect our borders, and have no coherent strategy for dealing with ISIS. We have a president who actually claims that climate deals are a good way to fight ISIS, and a press that treats this as a reasonable claim to make.

Must be nice to be a Democratic president.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/12/15/were-all-being-pretty-quiet-about-obamas-failures-arent-we/,2015-12-15
4 Things Obama Prioritized Over Visiting San Bernardino,"President Obama will make a pit stop in San Bernardino on Friday to visit the families of the 14 victims who were gunned down by during a terrorist attack on December 2. This means Obama has waited two weeks before visiting the site of the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.

Worse, he’s not even bothering to go out of his way to mourn the loss of 14 American lives. He’s stopping in San Bernardino on his way to his family’s annual Christmas vacation in Hawaii, which cost taxpayers $16 million last year.

I’m not criticizing the Obamas for taking a vacation, but I am angry that he is making this a political pit stop in the backyard of my childhood hometown on his way to a fun-filled getaway. If the loss of 14 American lives isn’t enough of a reason to get Obama on a plane out to the West Coast, I’m not really sure what is. Apparently it takes a Hawaiian vacation to get the president to make an appearance at the site of the attack he has used to push stricter gun laws.

So why didn’t President Obama visit San Bernardino sooner? What was so important that it kept him from flying out to mourn with the families of the victims?

Besides pushing for the power to take away one’s constitutional rights on a whim, here are four other things Obama thought were more important than visiting the site of the San Bernardino attack.

1. A Conversation About Gun Safety

Two days after the attack, Obama met with former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a gunshot wound to the head during a failed assassination attempt in 2011, to talk about gun safety. Apparently Obama is under the delusion that a conversation about gun safety will keep America safe from terrorist attacks.

2. A Party

When Obama addressed the nation from the Oval Office on December 6, four days after the attack, much of his comments centered around a push for more gun control laws. His remarks seemed to dismiss radical Islam as the cause of the attack, and instead placed the blame on gun violence.

Right after his message to America, he slipped into a tux and threw a party at the White House for the Kennedy Center Honors.

3. An A Capella Concert

On Dec. 9, Obama hosted Israeli President Reuven Rivlin during his visit to the United States, and the two attended a private a capella concert. While welcoming a foreign dignitary is certainly important, it’s odd that the president prioritized a concert over visiting the site of a terrorist attack.

#HappyHanukkah from the White House, and the @maccabeats! A video posted by The White House (@whitehouse) on Dec 9, 2015 at 6:26pm PST

The question persists: Why didn’t President Obama take time during the week between the attack and this concert to express solidarity with survivors of the attack and the neighboring community by making an appearance in San Bernardino?

4. Politicize a Naturalization Ceremony

On Thursday, Obama plans to attend a naturalization ceremony, where he will speak about tolerance and “reframe the national conversation” about immigration.

This is a nice gesture and I’m sure these soon-to-be American citizens will remember it forever, but Obama isn’t choosing to attend it to support these new Americans, he’s using it as an opportunity to further politicize immigration.

Unfortunately, it seems that Obama isn’t interested in events or public appearances that don’t further his political agenda. His decision to wait two weeks before announcing an impromptu pit-stop sends the message that he can’t be bothered to go out of his way to visit the site of a tragedy that has forever changed everyday American life. Perhaps the trip to Hawaii will clear his head and help him deal more honestly with terrorism and face the truth about the threat radical Islam poses to the safety of his fellow Americans who entrusted him with that duty.

Ehh, probably not.

Rand Paul’s Foreign Policy Wouldn’t Leave Us Vulnerable,"Sen. Rand Paul stood out with his steady, uncompromising appeal to remain committed to the foundation of our republic: the Constitution. No matter the threats from Islamic jihadists, we can’t abandon the fundamentals of freedom that make this nation great. This is why we need Paul. We need his voice.

We constantly hear that while Paul is a great defender of liberty who speaks for the people as well as any “outsider,” his foreign policy somehow disqualifies him from being the commander in chief. The term “isolationist” is often leveled against him, but is this an accurate descriptor of his foreign policy? Is he soft on terror? Would he make America weaker? Nothing could be further from the truth.

Let’s begin with Paul’s response to the question of how to keep America safe from terrorism:

Trump says we should close that Internet thing. The question really is what does he mean by that? Like they do in North Korea? Like they do in China? Rubio says we should collect all of Americans’ records all of the time. The Constitution says otherwise. I think they’re both wrong. I think we defeat terrorism by showing them that we do not fear them. I think we if ban certain religions or censure the Internet I think that at that point the terrorists will have won. Regime change hasn’t won. Toppling secular dictators in the Middle East has only led to chaos and the rise of radical Islam. I think if we want to defeat terrorism, I think if we truly are sincere about defeating terrorism we need to stop arming the allies of ISIS. If we want to defeat terrorism, the boots on the ground need to be Arab boots on the ground. As commander in chief, I will do whatever it takes to defend America. But in defending America, we cannot lose what America stands for. Today is the Bill of Rights’ anniversary. I hope we will remember that and cherish that in the fight on terrorism.

When it comes to keeping America safe, Paul is committed to a sound foreign policy without abandoning the Constitution. This is an important point, as the electorate is tempted to crown Caesar in its fervor to defeat our enemy “at any cost.” While the passion and fear are understandable, sacrificing liberty is too high a price to pay.

Peace Through Strength

But this doesn’t mean we just lie down and let our enemies storm the gates. This is Paul’s point. He will defend our nation, but without losing our nation’s soul. In a speech in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, Paul made this point clear when he talked about going to war:

There is no greater responsibility for a legislator or leader than to determine when we go to war. The consequences are potentially ominous. That responsibility should never be given to any individual who frivolously or cavalierly calls for war. War brings with it great obligations. These obligations do not end when our brave men and women come home. It’s just the beginning. One thing I know is true is we owe a debt of gratitude for the men and women who fight for our Bill of Rights. We owe the next generation of warriors the wisdom to know when war is necessary or not necessary. I promise you this, I will never forget our veterans. I will never forget our soldiers in the field. I will never take the country to war without just cause and without constitutional approval of Congress.

As commander in chief, Paul would let the world know that our objective is peace: “but the world will not mistake our desire for peace for pacificity. The world should not mistake our reluctance for peace for inaction. If war should prove unavoidable, America will fight with overwhelming force and we will not relent until victory is ours.” In this, Paul echoes Ronald Reagan’s “Peace through strength.”

Integral to that effort is understanding how to actually defeat ISIS. That means not tearing down regimes that help stabilize the region, not arming our enemies or supporting allies of terror, not providing safe spaces for the rot of terrorism to fester and expand, empowering law enforcement with the tools they need at home, and putting stricter controls on those who come here.

The Obama administration has failed in all of these areas, destabilizing the Middle East and strengthening radical Islamists. Not only has Obama failed to destroy ISIS as he promised last year before adopting the slippery language of “containment,” but he has put Americans’ liberties at risk. Many in the Republican Party want to do the same.

Face It: We Armed ISIS

Paul places the blame for the rise of ISIS not only at the feet of Obama but GOP hawks who unwittingly armed our enemies. “ISIS exists and grew stronger because of the hawks in our party who gave arms indiscriminately,” Rand has said. “And most of those arms were snatched up by ISIS. These hawks also wanted to bomb [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad], which would have made ISIS’s job even easier. They created these people. ISIS is all over Libya because these same hawks in my party loved — they loved [former Secretary of State] Hillary Clinton’s war in Libya. They just wanted more of it.”

Paul places the blame for the rise of ISIS not only at the feet of Obama but GOP hawks who unwittingly armed our enemies.

The Republican Party, Paul says, has been wrong on foreign policy for the last 20 years, yet they criticize him for wanting a smarter, stronger, more fiscally responsible, and—this is key—more constitutionally sound foreign policy that will actually defeat our enemies. We can be both strong and protect American liberties.

Paul wrote in his budget proposal, “A Clear Vision to Revitalize America,” that “in the name of national security, the fundamental rights and protections of the American legal system have been eroded; bureaucrats have assumed the power to label, at their discretion, individuals as ‘terrorist,’ and deny these individuals due process. The government has further expanded their ability to secretly wiretap Americans and store the email of virtually every web user in the country without a court-ordered warrant. Intrusive new bureaucracies, like the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), have become a staple of our life. Where the pinnacle of a democracy was once the freedom of travel, it has now become an arena which consistently violates our protections against search and seizure, as well as a forum where citizens are harassed, abused, and mistreated.”

America’s national security mandate shouldn’t reflect isolationism, Paul insisted, but it shouldn’t be reckless, either: “A foreign policy that is reluctant, restrained by constitutional checks and balances but does not appease; this balance should heed the advice of America’s sixth president, John Quincy Adams, who advised, ‘America goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own.’”

Fiscal Prodigals Threaten Our Security

One key to securing America’s freedoms is fiscal responsibility. “In fiscal year 2013, the Department of Defense will spend roughly $600 billion,” Paul has said. “Our ability to continue to spend at this rate and level is limited, and therefore the ability to preserve our military strength can only continue if we begin to strengthen our fiscal standing.”

‘The ability to preserve our military strength can only continue if we begin to strengthen our fiscal standing.’

Fiscal responsibility is fundamental to Paul’s foreign policy, and it makes sense. If we’re indebted to other nations, we are beholden to them and are weaker because of it. If we can’t fund our military, we can’t defend our nation. Paul rightly said he is the most fiscally responsible candidate on the stage. But does this mean that he wants to cut our military to ineffective levels at a time when our enemy is growing stronger? No.

“We need a national defense robust enough to defend against all attack, modern enough to deter all enemies, and nimble enough to defend our vital interests,” Paul said at the beginning of his campaign and after he proposed a $48 billion increase in the Pentagon budget.

Those who accuse Paul of wanting to cut the military in half are wrong. He proposes a reduction by approximately 23 to 30 percent, not 50, and these cuts will be focused on overseas operations that are no longer effective. His budget would take defense appropriations from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. That’s not as much of an increase as the Congressional Budget Office suggests, but it is still not the draconian cuts people have accused him of making.

Fiscal responsibility is inextricably bound to national security. His proposals to make $2 trillion in tax cuts, repeal the entire Internal Revenue Service tax code, and to replace it with a low, broad-based tax of 14.5 percent on individuals and businesses would go a long way in making America safer.

I would eliminate nearly every special-interest loophole. The plan also eliminates the payroll tax on workers and several federal taxes outright, including gift and estate taxes, telephone taxes, and all duties and tariffs. I call this ‘The Fair and Flat Tax.’ The Fair and Flat Tax eliminates payroll taxes, which are seized by the IRS from a worker’s paychecks before a family ever sees the money. This will boost the incentive for employers to hire more workers, and raise after-tax income by at least 15 percent over 10 years.

By balancing the budget and paying down government debt, Paul’s plan will let Americans go back to work. Paul’s plan would reduce the national debt by trillions of dollars over time when combined with his package of spending cuts. This is just as important to foreign policy as proposing increased air strikes or boots on the ground, a point only Paul is making. This along with his focus on being loyal to the Constitution even in the face of terrorism makes his voice in the debate invaluable.

The NYT Just Disappeared A Devastating Obama Admission,"A story published by the New York Times late Thursday night caused some major media waves. The story, which was written by reporters Peter Baker and Gardiner Harris, included a remarkable admission by Obama about his response to the recent terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California.

By Friday morning, however, the entire passage containing Obama’s admission had been erased from the story without any explanation from the New York Times. Here’s the passage that was included in the story when it was published Thursday night, courtesy of CNN’s Brian Stelter:

Obama needs more cable news in his media diet? Revealing comment in a private meeting with newspaper columnists… pic.twitter.com/iUHz6Ey38g



Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) December 18, 2015

In his meeting with the columnists, Mr. Obama indicated that he did not see enough cable television to fully appreciate the anxiety after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, and made clear that he plans to step up his public arguments. Republicans were telling Americans that he is not doing anything when he is doing a lot, he said.

The version of the New York Times story that was published early Thursday evening indicated that Obama knew he was out of touch with the country on terrorism, and he thought that was due to not watching enough television. Obama critics immediately pounced on the stunning admission from the president, expressing shock that he would claim that a lack of TV time was the real reason for him not understanding Americans’ anxiety about terrorism.

As of Friday morning, however, the passage containing Obama’s admission was gone. Newsdiffs.org, a web site which captures changes made to online news stories, indicates that the major revision to the NYT story happened late on Thursday night, several hours after the story was published (text with a red background and strike-through is text that was eliminated from the story; text with a green background is text that was added to the story since its last revision):

NYT: Oh that part embarrassed the boss? So sorry, we'll delete it ASAP. https://t.co/uc7L9yEhaa pic.twitter.com/ME8WJauXZ5



Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) December 18, 2015

The unexplained deletion of that major passage wasn’t the only significant change made to the story since it was first published. New York Times editors also changed the story’s headline four separate times, according to Newsdiffs.org. Each headline revision either put Obama in a better light or put the GOP in a worse one.

The original headline when the story was first published was “Obama Visiting National Counterterrorism Center.” Less than two hours later, the headline was “Obama, at Counterterrorism Center, Offers Assurances On Safety.” Then the headline was changed to “Frustrated by Republican Critics, Obama Defends Muted Response to Attacks.” Two hours later, the headline was once again revised to “Under Fire From G.O.P., Obama Defends Response to Terror Attacks.” The most recent headline revision, which accompanied the deletion of the passage where Obama admitted he didn’t understand the American public’s anxiety about terrorism, now reads, “Assailed by G.O.P., Obama Defends His Response To Terror Attacks.”

The addition (116 words) was much longer than the deletion (66 words) of the section that made Obama look bad. https://t.co/CAqgHVDbyN



Sean Davis (@seanmdav) December 18, 2015

Baker and Gardiner, the two reporters who authored the NYT story, have yet to explain why Obama’s admission about being out of touch with the public on terrorism was deleted from their story.

UPDATE #1: The New York Times claimed in a statement late Friday morning that its deletion of the Obama passage was not “unusual” and that it was merely “trimmed for space in the print paper”:

Statement from NY Times re: deleting that passage about President Obama not recognizing anxiety over terrorism. pic.twitter.com/PwZngc88G2



T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) December 18, 2015

The problem with this explanation is that it doesn’t make any sense when you review the first major online revision, which Newsdiffs.org archived at 10:21 p.m. EST. In that version, only one substantive revision was made: the paragraph about Obama not watching enough cable TV was removed and replaced with two paragraphs about Obama’s plan to combat ISIS.

The section that was removed contained 66 words. The section that was added in its place contained 116 words. If the New York Times was indeed “trimming for space” in that particular revision, it will need to explain why its revision to that section added 50 words.

UPDATE #2: Thanks to this CNN story on Obama’s remarks before an audience of progressive writers, we now know why the NYT deceptively memory-holed Obama’s admission that he was ignorant of Americans’ terrorism anxiety, and why the NYT refused to divulge the real reason behind its stealth edits: Obama didn’t want that remark attributed to him.

Here’s how CNN described the meeting and its ground rules:

The meeting, which took place in the White House Roosevelt Room, included journalists, columnists and editors from the Times, The Washington Post and The Atlantic, as well as digital outlets like Yahoo, Slate, Vox and Mic. Per the ground rules, attendees were not allowed to discuss the meeting or attribute any remarks to the president (emphasis added).



Yet the purpose of these off-the-record meetings, which have been a feature of Obama’s tenure, is to influence the national dialogue. The White House achieved that goal on Wednesday when the Post’s David Ignatius, who was at the meeting, penned a column based almost entirely on Obama’s remarks without any mention of the meeting.



In addition to detailing Obama’s thoughts on his ISIS strategy, Ignatius’ column alluded to the president’s remark about cable news: “Obama seems to have realized that he was slow to respond to public fear after the jihadist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif.,” Ignatius wrote. “His low-decibel approach led the public to worry he wasn’t doing enough to keep the country safe. Obama, not a cable television fan, apparently didn’t realize the state of anxiety.”

The NYT excuse that it had to erase the mention of Obama’s remarks due to space constraints–even though its initial revision and deletion of those remarks actually added 50 words to the story–now looks even more absurd. It’s completely obvious what happened. The White House wanted all these reporters and writers to act as stenographers of the president’s spin, just so long as they pretended the spin never came from him.

In his column on the meeting, the Washington Posts‘s David Ignatius did exactly what Obama wanted him to do: regurgitate Obama’s spin and blame cable news for stirring up anxiety about terrorism. Obama’s remark was meant to accomplish two things: 1) to place him above the fray–he has far more important things to do than just sit around and watch silly cable news programs all day, and 2) to subtly place blame on cable news (guess which network he had in mind) for ginning up fears–unfounded in Obama’s mind–of future terrorist attacks.

The Obama team’s spin cycle would’ve continued without a hitch, if not for that messy little New York Times article which not only attributed the remarks to Obama, but reported them in a way that made Obama look obscenely aloof and out of touch with the concerns of most Americans.

The solution? Easy: just demand that the NYT eliminate the remarks entirely. Problem solved, except for one thing. The Internet never forgets.",https://thefederalist.com/2015/12/18/the-new-york-times-just-memory-holed-this-devastating-obama-admission/,2015-12-18
2015 Story No. 5: The Phantom Menace (Of Global Warming),"It’s time to count down the top stories of the year, looking back at the big events of 2015 and reviewing my own coverage of them.

We’ll start the countdown with #5, which is the least important of the big stories because it’s not about something that’s actually happening. It’s about how a whole section of our top political and cultural leadership is pretending that something that isn’t happening is actually the most vital and pressing issue of the day. That is pretty important in its own right.

I’ll call this The Phantom Menace, which you can consider a tribute to the return of the Star Wars saga, or perhaps an unwelcome reminder of everybody’s least favorite prequel. (It’s a close call between the three, but Phantom Menace had the most Jar-Jar Binks, so it wins.)

I am talking, of course, about “climate change,” the lame euphemism for claims about catastrophic human-caused global warming.

The role of global warming in this year’s news is summed up in the recently concluded Paris Agreement: a gigantic international meeting held within a month of a massive terrorist attack on that city, for the purpose of diverting everyone’s attention away from the threat of terrorism.

As I wrote last week:

After last month’s massive terrorist attack brought the disastrous civil war in Syria and the renewed threat of radical Islam back to the forefront of everyone’s minds, world leaders met in Paris to forge an ambitious agreement — about global warming.



You didn’t think they were going to do something big and important about terrorism, did you?



No, they’re much more interested in what our own president clearly regards as the real issue of the day, “climate change.” And so the global warming conference ended with the Paris Agreement, which was hailed by both The Guardian and Slate as the “end of the fossil fuel era.”

I also noted that, for all that triumphalism about ending fossil fuels, the Paris Agreement is just a massive pretense in which “everything is legally binding, except the actual heart of the agreement.” But I noted that it serves a purpose.

Consider President Obama’s pronouncement that the agreement is “a testament to American leadership.” “We came together around a strong agreement the world needed. We met the moment.” For a president whose administration is known for the absence of American leadership and who is palpably not “meeting the moment,” you can see the incentive to pretend that he is by signing some phony-baloney agreement to solve a phony-baloney problem.

The intellectual basis for this evasion is summed up in the preposterous claim that global warming caused ISIS. After tracing the actual causes and origins of the Syrian civil war, I noted:

All of these facts are readily available to anyone who follows the news. And then there is the role in these attacks of a major world religion with about a billion followers that has been around for 1400 years — a primary cause that is a little hard to miss. Yet President Obama, [Bill] Nye, and many other water-carriers for the left offer us glib pronouncements about how this is all about water shortages in Syria. This is spectacular, willful ignorance dressed up as love for science.

This is the reason Obama doesn’t have much of a strategy for destroying ISIS and recently admitted that he was out of touch about how important the Paris attacks were because he didn’t watch enough cable news shows. I don’t even know where to start in describing how pathetic that is.

But the Left does have a plan to vilify and censor global warming skeptics, with New York’s attorney general launching an investigation to punish Exxon-Mobil for having briefly funded a few climate skeptics.

To be sure, this case will take forever to go through the courts…. But this is another case where the prosecution is the punishment. Just the prospect of being dragged through the courts and publicly maligned by prosecutors is deterrent enough.



This prosecution is not really aimed at Exxon, which has pockets deep enough to fight if it chooses…. [T]he real target is everybody smaller than Exxon. The message is going out that they will face political reprisals, including embarrassing and expensive persecution in the courts, if they ever give a dollar to a climate skeptic….



It seems Schneiderman has learned from the neo-authoritarians in Russia and China how to impose political control. There is no need for anything so crude as outright censorship. Anybody can say what they like, if they’re shouting on a street corner or writing in the pages of some obscure journal for intellectuals. But nobody can get any money to broadcast their views more widely because anyone with money faces ruin if they stand out against the powers that be.

And President Obama has a plan of attack for destroying our most plentiful sources of energy, under the guise of a transition to “clean power.” This “clean power,” as I explained, is based on absurd assumptions and is scientifically impossible.

So why create a national electricity scheme that is impossible to build? Perhaps because its purpose is not to build but to tear down. If you come up with a plan that claims it will reduce existing sources of energy in favor of new sources of energy — and those new sources turn out to be speculative at best, and physically impossible at worst — then it’s fair to conclude that the real essence of the plan is simply to reduce existing sources of energy.

So our leaders are dispirited and ineffective when it comes to deciding on a plan to destroy our actual enemies — but apply endless vigor and initiative to coming up with plans to dismantle our own civilization.

The delusion that global warming is the only really important issue of our era, eclipsing everything else, is embraced by elites in all areas of the culture. It benefits from the kind of universal dissemination characteristic of a new religion — which is reflected in the inroads it has made in converting leaders of the old religion.

Thus, for example, Christians are under unprecedented attack in the Middle East. Syrian Christians who speak the language of Christ, Aramaic, and whose churches were first established by the apostles themselves, have survived for 2000 years but are now fleeing the expansion of ISIS. Yet Pope Francis, who should be one of their most outspoken champions, has been devoting much more of his time as a partisan shill for global warming. I pointed out the totally one-sided presentation of the scientific claims about global warming in the Pope’s latest encyclical.

Francis is just repeating what he has heard from mainstream environmentalists and international green activists. The problem is that those are apparently the only people he is listening to….



Pope Francis has sealed himself off in an ideological bubble that is harder and more impenetrable than the Popemobile. He refuses to recognize that there are alternative ideas outside the leftist orthodoxy on capitalism and the environment. The result is a sense that I’ve never quite gotten before from a papal encyclical: the sense of the pope as a narrow ideologue, captive to a relatively recent political fad.



This is a real shame because the Vatican and the papacy are supposed to operate on a longer time scale, less affected by the political fads of the moment, or even of the century. After all, the Catholic Church is a 2,000-year-old institution with a timeless spiritual remit. It’s what usually makes the popes so interesting to contend with, even for an atheist who frequently disagrees with them.

But Francis has a whole history of merging leftist politics with religion in a kind of “reverse syncretism,” a trend I discussed after a Latin American socialist gave Francis a “Marxifix,” a bizarre mash-up of the crucifix and the hammer and sickle.

I am not a Catholic nor even a Christian, and I know many American Protestants who, shall we say, were never deeply invested in the moral authority of the pope. So what does it matter to us whether or not this pope is surrendering the Church to the left?



Historically, it does matter, because in the 20th century the Church helped change the course of history, vastly for the better, by offering ideological and material resistance to Communism. It mattered that there was a large institution with deep historical roots that was independent from the socialist state and politically correct orthodoxy, driven a different set of values. And it’s discomforting to think what might happen if that’s no longer true.

The religion of global warming is being invoked as a reason to overturn every big institution in our society, from Wall Street to the Vatican. Yet this is just another false god, based on an illusion.

That’s why the biggest theme in my coverage of global warming this year was fighting to reassert a truly scientific outlook in the face of pseudo-scientific propaganda. I debunked the claim that 2014 was the “hottest year on record.” Expect a repeat for 2015, if they can fudge the numbers enough. And expect that the real data will indicate the same thing: that 2015 was about as warm as 2014, which was about as warm as 2010 and 2005. Climate stasis, a plateau in temperatures that has lasted nearly 20 years now, will be re-defined as a runaway increase, in a testament to the warmists’ dedication to post-facto rationalization.

There is an important difference between prediction before the fact and explanation after the fact. Prediction requires that you lay down a marker about what the data ought to be, to be consistent with your theory, before you actually know what it is. That’s something that’s very hard to get right. If your theory is going to be able to consistently predict data before it is gathered, it has got to be pretty darned good. Global warming theories have a wretched track record at making predictions.



But explanations of data after the fact are a lot easier. As they say, hindsight is 20/20. It’s a lot easier to tweak your theory to make it a better fit to the data, or in this case, to tweak the way the data is measured and analyzed in order to make it better fit your theory. And then you proclaim how amazing it is that your theory “explains” the data.

Speaking of predictions, I catalogued seven big failed predictions from environmentalists, from global cooling to overpopulation. (On that one, to my great surprise, even the New York Times is starting to come around — after only 47 years.)

But by now you can get an idea for the major outlines of an environmental hysteria. The steps are: a) start with assumption that man is “ravaging the Earth,” b) latch onto an unproven scientific hypothesis that fits this preconception, c) extrapolate wildly from half-formed theories and short-term trends to predict a future apocalypse, d) pressure a bunch of people with “Ph.D.” after their names to endorse it so you can say it’s a consensus of experts, e) get the press to broadcast it with even less nuance and get a bunch of Hollywood celebrities who failed Freshman biology to adopt it as their pet cause, then finally f) quietly drop the whole thing when it doesn’t pan out — and move on with undiminished enthusiasm to the next environmental doomsday scenario.

I traced that pattern with five more recent debunked claims, including an astonishing and eye-opening report about “horizontal gene transfer.” Seriously, the article is worth reading if only for that one piece of genuine science.

Most fundamentally, I examined what it would really take to prove that catastrophic global warming is happening and that humans are causing it. No one ever lays out the steps it would take, because if they did, they would have to acknowledge how far they are from proving it.

They’re elevating the imagined threat of global warming over real and immediate threats like terrorism because they don’t want to grapple with the implications.

That’s the same reason they’re elevating the imagined threat of global warming over real and immediate threats like terrorism: because they don’t want to grapple with the implications. Terrorism is a problem that calls for solutions the Left doesn’t want to pursue — whereas global warming calls for solutions they have been longing to implement for more than a century. It’s almost as if they called the problem into existence for precisely that reason.

Hence the monumental absurdity of events like the Paris climate summit. The more important other issues become — the more our political leaders are called upon to deal with problems whose solutions don’t fit their agenda — the more they have to double down on the failed predictions, overinflate the phantom threat, project it as the real root of every other problem, and then proclaim every minor, ineffectual attempt to address the problem as a historic achievement of bold leadership.

But behind this there is a palpable desperation. Global warming persistently remains near the bottom of voter’s priorities — while terrorism is back on the top of the list. It seems that the more they try to puff up their phantom menace, the more insubstantial is appears alongside all of our real problems.

The First Order Are The (Anti)-Heroes Of ‘The Force Awakens’,"Editor’s note: The following contains spoilers.

The Force has awakened, and boy, did its beauty sleep produce good results. “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” convincingly washes out the stink of the prequel trilogy and gives the franchise the kind of life it probably hasn’t seen since 1983. Now that “Star Wars” is more than the literary equivalent of the steaming wreckage of a once majestic Star Destroyer, at last we can settle in for an avalanche of thoroughly justified thinkpieces on the politics of that galaxy far, far away.

While plenty of commentators have argued (correctly, in my opinion) that the original trilogy really portrays the tragic fall of a great and meritocratic, if imperfect, empire brought low by ISIS-esque rebels, at first blush “The Force Awakens” makes this sort of contrarian spin look very difficult. Where the Empire in the original Star Wars only blew up one planet and never really committed much aggression beyond attacking its declared foes, “The Force Awakens” features what looks like a planet and several moons being blasted to smithereens by a sun-eating monstrosity called the “Starkiller Base,” seemingly without provocation.

Worse, this act of genocide is set against the backdrop of an address screeched by the all-too-fascist sounding General Hux, who can best be described as the ginger equivalent of Josef Goebbels. The Empire might have been necessarily brutal, in other words, but it’s hard to see its successors, the First Order, as anything but fascist, mass-murdering madmen, determined to destroy the galaxy if they can’t rule it.

Worse, this franchise’s younger, more petulant equivalent to Darth Vader—Kylo Ren—murders his own father, Han Solo, in cold blood. Say this for Vader: at least he let Obi-Wan put up a fight. In other words, it seems very hard to argue that the First Order is anything but pure evil.

That is, until you spend any time at all thinking about the stated causes for their behavior, and their parallels to the problems faced by, say, the United States today. In fact, if you spend even a little time applying sound realist foreign policy logic to “The Force Awakens,” then the narrative of the First Order as irredeemably evil completely falls apart. The First Order, in fact, are the heroes of this story.

The Empire and Rebels Flip Places

Start with the destruction of the New Republic’s capital planet. While the movie skimps a lot on details regarding just what the New Republic is and why it’s so defenseless against such an attack, Disney and Lucasfilm released sources that explain it. Put simply, the New Republic is the highly provisional government set up by the victorious terrorists known as the Rebel Alliance in the previous series. One of the first acts it imposed was the unilateral disarmament of the galaxy as a means of cracking down on pro-Imperial dissidents.

Hannah Arendt’s line that a revolutionary becomes a hardline conservative after the revolution has never seemed so ironic, nor so true.

In other words, the first thing the New Republic did was impose gun control to stop any other rebellions. Hannah Arendt’s line that a revolutionary becomes a hardline conservative after the revolution has never seemed so ironic, nor so true.

However, the First Order, which is made up of previous Imperial officers and soldiers, refused to obey this edict and instead retreated to unregulated reaches of space, where it set up its own government. The New Republic, having already disarmed not only its citizens, but its own fleet (nuclear disarmament, anyone?), couldn’t really object, plunging the galaxy into a Cold War.

Except it’s not completely cold, because the New Republic actually sent one of its own generals—Leia Organa—to head up a covert “Resistance” in the First Order’s territory as a means of undermining their authority. Anyone familiar with Cold War history should immediately recognize the pattern of an ostensibly disinterested foreign power sponsoring a covert resistance to take down the remnants of a once-great Empire. If not, I’ll spell it out: Princess Leia is basically leading the Viet Cong.

But fortunately for the First Order, its leader, Supreme Leader Snoke, is no LBJ. Instead, like Barry Goldwater, he seems to be concerned with the question, “Why not victory?”

How to Justify What Looks Like Genocide

This brings us to the firing of Starkiller Base and General Hux’s speech preceding that event. At first blush, this speech might seem like a fascist rant, but strip away the aesthetics of General Hux’s dress and delivery, and you end up with a fairly convincing indictment of the New Republic as not merely an inefficient, bureaucratic mess incapable of protecting its own citizens, but also as a disingenuous state sponsor of terror.

While the acts of the First Order in the film’s opening scene are undoubtedly brutal, they are also completely justified once you realize a few facts.

In other words, the firing of Starkiller Base is anything but unprovoked. It is an attempt to cut off the head of a serpent that is killing numerous First Order troops and leading to the deaths of hundreds of First Order-governed civilians all the time.

Ah, but I hear the cries of complaint: The First Order kills its own civilians! Look at the first scene in the movie! Sorry, but no. While the acts of the First Order in the film’s opening scene—where the ominous Captain Phasma massacres an entire village at the order of Kylo Ren—are undoubtedly brutal, they are also completely justified once you realize a few facts.

First of all, there’s no evidence that the village in question was ever governed by the First Order. In fact, given that many residents of that village begin firing on First Order troops the instant they land and that they are harboring an old friend of the Resistance’s leader, the opposite seems to be true. In a world where terrorists use living shields and there’s no guarantee that one of them might not be hiding among the survivors of the assault, taking the entire village captive would be the minimum required course.

Except that in the process of holding these beings, a major secret is revealed: Luke Skywalker, the Resistance’s equivalent of a Messiah, is still alive. Imagine someone revealing that Muhammad had been reincarnated in ISIS-occupied territory, and you have an idea of the scale of this bit of intelligence. It’s a potential rallying point for every even remotely Resistance-sympathetic citizen of the First Order.

It’s also the last thing you need someone revealing to any other captives the First Order might have. Unlike the Empire, their resources are pretty limited, and a prison riot could do real damage, especially considering that even the Empire couldn’t keep smugglers and Wookies from freeing high-value prisoners. What can you do in this situation but kill anyone who might let this kind of information out?

Han Solo, Deadbeat Dad

Speaking of smugglers and Wookies, let’s talk about the death of Han Solo. I refuse to call it murder, because “The Force Awakens” establishes Solo as one of the more despicable characters in fiction.

Han Solo smuggles weapons of mass destruction to criminals. What a swell guy.

Let me count the ways: Number one, he is a deadbeat parent by every definition of the term. He outsources the raising of his own son to his brother-in-law, a religious extremist who trains child soldiers. Picture a daycare run by Joseph Kony and you have some idea of what the young Ben Solo (later Kylo Ren) was abandoned to endure.

Not only that, but he’s a terrible husband, as he runs away from his wife Leia the instant their son’s defective parenting gets exposed. This is the kind of behavior you expect from Maury Povich guests, not heroic soldiers.

But, and this is the absolute crowning problem, Han Solo goes back to being a smuggler. And not just any smuggler. We’re not talking about someone who’s committing a victimless crime. We see in vivid detail just what Han Solo smuggles in “The Force Awakens,” and what he smuggles are vicious, tentacle monstrosities called Rathtars, just one of which is apparently responsible for a fabled massacre. And who does he sell these monsters to? Criminals. That’s right. Han Solo smuggles weapons of mass destruction to criminals. What a swell guy.

In view of this, any sane government who caught this man would have him put to death for crimes against humanity (or whatever you’d call it in a universe populated by several sentient species). The fact that his son Ben, a.k.a. Kylo, lets him have a moment of peace and reconciliation before plunging a lightsaber through his chest shows almost saintly magnanimity.

The First Order Is Merciful to Criminals

Nor is Solo the only criminal to whom the First Order shows an unbelievable degree of mercy. To begin with, the deserter calling himself Finn (aka FN-2187), who displays open insubordination toward his commander during his first scene onscreen, gets let off not with torture or even with 50 push-ups, but merely with a light recommendation for reconditioning by his commanding officer.

The First Order treats its soldiers as such valuable assets that it literally tries to talk disobedient soldiers around rather than lock them up.

In other words, the First Order treats its soldiers as such valuable assets that it literally tries to talk disobedient soldiers around rather than lock them up, or do anything far less humane regimes do. This ends up being a policy failure, seeing as FN-2187 steals their most valuable asset, deserts, and gets millions of First Order soldiers blown up by revealing the structural weaknesses of Starkiller Base, thus leading to the destruction of yet another inhabited planet.

More than that, the rogue scavenger Rey, whose Force sensitivity, unremitting hostility, and clear brainwashing by the Resistance would mark her as a clear threat, instead merely gets restrained, and even offered amnesty for her crimes by Kylo Ren. Even when Rey has spent several minutes trying to kill him, Ren tries to reason with her and offers her the prospect of training with him under the watchful eye of Supreme Leader Snoke. This is humane to a fault. In fact, it is a fault, since Rey nearly succeeds in killing Ren for his trouble.

In fact, the only criminal who gets treated even remotely the way a criminal and terrorist should get treated is the Resistance fighter pilot Poe Dameron, who gets subjected to enhanced interrogation to discover the location of vital intelligence assets—namely, the map to Luke Skywalker (one wonders if a First Order equivalent of “Zero Dark Thirty” is in the offing).

So efficient is Kylo Ren as an interrogator that even Dameron is left in sufficiently good physical and mental condition to walk out of his cell and then pilot a TIE fighter out of the First Order’s headquarters. Your average Guantanamo Bay interrogator would probably be envious of someone who was that humane and efficient, even if he might criticize the First Order’s security protocols.

Terrorists Versus Enlightened Society

In other words, the battle in “Star Wars: Episode VII” is morally crystal clear. On one side, you have an unscrupulous terrorist organization led by the sister of a religious terrorist responsible for the deaths of millions of people and the training of child soldiers, which allies with weapons smugglers and allows its operatives to hide among civilians and use them as shields in its operations.

The First Order, like the Empire before them, deserves to rule the galaxy.

On the other, you have a humane, fairly enlightened militarized society defending itself against said terrorists and their state sponsors in the most efficient way they can, given their acquisition of a massive power asymmetry.

The First Order, like the Empire before them, deserves to rule the galaxy. One only hopes that the Skywalker twins’ reign of terror will be reversed, and that Kylo Ren—like the descendants of Josef Stalin—will be able to rest easy about the guilt of his connection to such fanatical, barbaric criminals.

For the time being, I mourn the deaths of the millions slaughtered in the attack on Starkiller Base, and the lost opportunity to eradicate the leadership of a dangerous terrorist threat in “The Force Awakens.” Rather like the next president, Supreme Leader Snoke would do well to become the sort who does not lead from behind.

Terrorists Hate Themselves For Loving The West,"Another New Year’s Eve, another terror scare. This time, it was Munich, but every year the major cities in the developed world brace for attack. Every year, we ask the same question: why are these young men (and, far less frequently, their girlfriends) so determined to strike the societies in which they live? What can we do to make them stop?

What do they want?

Guilt-ridden Westerners, of course, assume the answer lies somewhere in our foreign policy. There are lot of worn, hackneyed theories out there: they hate our relationship with Israel, they want us to leave their lands, they resent our interference in their politics, they detest how we pollute their culture.

These are all nonsense. Remember, most of these terrorists live in the West and seem to enjoy it. Some of them were even born here. Do they want U.S. and Western forces to leave Muslim lands? That would be a good explanation, except that young Muslims seem perfectly happy to follow the Crusaders home and settle in Brussels, Athens, and Paris.

Perhaps Islamic extremists resent our culture and its influence. Again, that would be an interesting idea if there weren’t so much evidence that they come to the West to bathe in our culture, to immerse themselves in it, to gorge on it. (The Paris attackers ran a notorious dive bar that was shut down for drug violations.)

These ardent young “Muslims” are excoriating the decadence of the West between bong hits while watching porn, listening to hip-hop, and playing video games on the Devil’s Box known as “a computer.” Europe is under siege, not from Hydra but from Ali G. Let’s face it: if the jihadis ever managed to bring our culture to an end, no one would miss it more than they would. They’d be heartbroken.

We Can’t Bribe Them to Stop

So what can we give them to make them stop? The answer is: nothing. They want nothing from us. There is no policy we can change, no political accommodation we can make, no demand to which we can accede.

These young men are fueled by the most intense kind of hatred there is: self-hatred.

Even if we wanted to surrender completely, there’d be no way to do it. Insofar as their demand is to convert to their religion, we can’t meet that demand because, on any given day, they can’t meet it. If the way European jihadis live day to day is “Islam,” and the terrorists want me to convert to that, then all I can say is that I’ll have to stick to Christianity because I’m too old for that much partying.

These young men are fueled by the most intense kind of hatred there is: self-hatred. There is no accommodation with self-hatred. Would-be jihadis lash out at Western society not because they hate it so much, but because they love it so much. They hate us for who we are, and hate themselves for their addiction to a culture and all of its pleasures—sex, drugs, music—they’ve been told are the basest of sins. Too weak to resist the temptations of life among us, they hope that by destroying the source of the sins that tempt them, they will find redemption.

Some part of them, I suppose, wants to fail: if London, Sydney, New York, or even Moscow is destroyed, where would these men aspire to live? Where would they go? Where will they find the clothes, music, even the reliable electricity and good drugs that fuel their lifestyle? They talk a good game about life in Muslim lands, but it’s not hard to notice how few of these noble young warriors choose to live in those lands.

The Only Answer Is War

When ISIS crowed about the Paris attacks, they celebrated their strike at the “capital of adultery.” This, while their own deep thinkers back in Syria were having arguments over who gets to rape whom. These boys, like all boys with screwed-up identities, are obsessed with sex and power. But unlimited rape and murder are not political demands; they are the attributes of an insane cult that must be destroyed root and branch.

Soft power and propaganda have their place, but there is no way around a military solution here.

Make no mistake, all this mayhem must be destroyed at the source in the Middle East by Western arms, without apology or too much emotion. (If we cared about African lives, we’d take out their friends in Boko Haram while we’re at it.) Soft power and propaganda have their place, but there is no way around a military solution here. Emotional adolescent males understand sex and glory, but by nature they really do not have a firm grasp of death. To young men in a cult, death is a romantic abstraction.

We have to make it real to them, quickly and decisively. When enough of these guys are dead—and not the glorious imagined death of a music video, but a humiliating death at the hands of professional soldiers—the next recruits might reach the sensible conclusion that getting high in their subsidized European flats is a better option than running away to join the Syrian circus.

Don’t Export Western Self-Loathing

Until then, Westerners should neither overplay nor ignore the threat. ISIS and its cadres of porn-addled, stoner jihadis are not existential threats. That doesn’t mean they are not lethally dangerous: rabid coyotes are not a threat to my way of life, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want every single one of them put down as effectively as possible.

We must match jihadis’ self-hatred with quiet self-confidence in our own values.

Most of all, we must remain optimistic. Optimism, self-confidence, and a can-do attitude are Western qualities that utterly confound our enemies. Soviet commissars hated all of that about Americans and their allies during the Cold War as much as Islamic extremists hate it now. Our virtues as free, tolerant, and open societies terrify them, because they will never find these qualities in themselves, which reinforces their own well-deserved sense of inferiority.

We must match jihadis’ self-hatred with quiet self-confidence in our own values. Otherwise, our enemies will interpret our doubt as weakness. They will assume that we feel about our culture the way they do: that the West is nothing more the sum total of its decadence. They would like nothing better than to feel they have our assent in their attacks on us, and we must never give it even by implication.

So be cheerful. It’s a new year. The West will always have enemies, and if we are honest with ourselves, we have to admit the jihadis aren’t even close to the worst we’ve ever faced. This war won’t go on forever, but the sooner we accept that this is about them, and not us, the sooner we can get on with doing what needs to be done.

When I Supported The Terrorists,"It was a chilly night in Philadelphia, back in the early ’80s when it still looked like it does in the first “Rocky” movies. The crowd, some holding signs, marched in its circle, chanting the name Bobby Sands. Across the ocean, in the infamous H-Block prison in Northern Ireland, Sands, a member of the Irish Republican Army, lay dying of his hunger strike. It is a very early memory of mine, and one that underscores a basic fact about growing up in my Irish Catholic family. We supported the IRA.

Like most American supporters of the IRA, we did not celebrate the death of innocents, we did not hate Protestants, and we did not provide any material support. We did, however, believe that the United Kingdom was an occupying force in Northern Ireland, which the Irish people had a right to fight. Since a standard military engagement was out of the question, that left only acts of terror.

I remember going as a child with my parents to hear Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers perform at a little restaurant just outside Philly. They would sing Makem’s classic, “Four Green Fields,” about the old woman Ireland, whose fourth county was still in bondage. He sang, “But my sons had sons, as brave as were their fathers, my fourth green field will bloom once again said she.” It was stirring. It literally got my Irish up.

There is little similarity between the goals and techniques of ISIS and those of the IRA. The latter was not typically targeting Americans, and they were not seeking to expand territorial control beyond the borders of the island. But there are striking similarities between the actions of the IRA and those of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Hamas. In fact, the Irish and Palestinian terror organizations often worked in concert.

What I regret most is the negative attitude I felt toward anything English for much of my life.

In retrospect, I regret my feelings about the IRA, though clearly I had no impact on events. What I regret most is the negative attitude I felt toward anything English for much of my life. It took me until well into my twenties to read English history and philosophy without a bias against it. That was a loss for me, especially in terms of understanding the United States.

I now understand I wasn’t just against the UK’s occupation of Northern Ireland—I was against England as a concept. The undeniable wrongs it had done to my not-so-distant ancestors had poisoned the entire culture for me. That is not a healthy way to think; it blinded me. But I do understand it.

Terrorism Versus Terrorism

My support for the IRA back in my youth does not lead me to any relativism regarding ISIS. There are very distinct differences between terror used in an effort to obtain territory and terror used to pursue purely religious ends. War is never pretty. It always involves death and injury to noncombatants. But the IRA and the PLO had specific and concrete goals.

There are very distinct differences between terror used in an effort to obtain territory and terror used to pursue purely religious ends.

The supporters of the IRA and the PLO in the United States mainly supported those organizations’ goals, not their methods. In the case of Ireland, I still support reunifying the island, even though I can no longer support acts of terror to that end. I imagine many Muslim Americans still support the re-conquest of the Levant. I believe in Israel’s right to exist, but I also believe that loyal fellow American citizens might disagree with me.

But what is the goal of ISIS? What territorial goal does an American supporter of ISIS wish for? President Obama reduced our military footprint in the Middle East dramatically. He allowed Assad to prance over his red line on chemical weapons in Syria. The president has sought to fight terror by giving Muslims in the Middle East less reason to resent us. But far from being rewarded for these efforts, the United States and its allies have been subject to increased attacks.

This is what Sen. Marco Rubio is referring to when he talks about a civilizational conflict. He said: “This is not a geopolitical issue where they want to conquer territory, and it’s two countries fighting against each other. They literally want to overthrow our society and replace it with their radical Sunni Islamic view of the future.” This difference is essential. It must govern our unique approach to this unique terror threat.

Should we be alarmed by polls that show 25 percent of Muslims in the United States agree that killing civilians is sometimes acceptable? Sure, but let’s not kid ourselves. Plenty of Irish Americans like me supported that exact thing in the case of the IRA. In a broader sense, most Americans feel that General Sherman burning Atlanta and President Truman dropping the bomb on the Japan were justified actions. And they were.

Sympathizers Aren’t Terrorists

In the past few weeks, we have seen a host of claims from the Left that the Right is engaged in terrorism. In the wake of the Colorado killings at a Planned Parenthood facility, liberals claimed that videos from the Center for Medical Progress widely reported in these pages stoked the firing of Robert Dear’s guns. The New York Daily News proclaimed that National Rifle Association head Wayne Lapierre is a terrorist. The Right too often holds the Black Lives Matter movement responsible for police officers’ deaths.

Neither incident is an excuse to blame dedicated, peaceful activists for horrendous acts.

Is it possible that aggressive political speech contributed Dear’s actions? Yes. Is it possible that aggressive political speech contributed to the execution of two New York City police officers? Yes. But neither incident is an excuse to blame dedicated, peaceful activists for horrendous acts. Almost nobody on any side is calling for killing.

Casting a wide net on Muslims based on the belief of some that Palestinians were unfairly treated and have a right to violent recourse is unfair. A good number of Irish Catholics felt the same way, and nobody talked about kicking us out of the country or barring our access. Muslims deserve the same sane restraint that supporters of Irish nationalism were granted for much of the twentieth century.

Learning From the Irish Experience

The end of centuries of hostilities in Ireland was one of the great accomplishments of the twentieth century. Efforts by Sen. George Mitchell and his partners on all sides actually made peace. It’s something we don’t talk much about any more, but it was a remarkable triumph.

Trump and Obama’s cowardice are of a piece.

What can we learn from that success? A big lesson is that the United States matters. Our power and diverse population grants us a unique ability to stabilize conflicts. We cannot shy away from that role.

We can run and hide. We can build great Trumpian walls and cower behind them. We can shy away from the world’s conflicts, as Obama would have us do. Both of these are the same answer. Trump and Obama’s cowardice are of a piece. But it is not a road to peace. Peace must be a result of American strength, not disengagement and apology. Peace can only come when people like me abandon their tribal emotions and refuse to accept the bombing of innocent people in the name of freedom.

11 Things Obama Never Cried About,"While announcing executive actions to further restrict gun sales on Tuesday, President Obama became emotional when recounting the children who died during the Sandy Hook shooting.

This very public display of emotion surprised many, as Obama doesn’t cry in public very often. In fact, he has a reputation of being rather stoic and emotionless.

“Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,” he said as he brushed away tears.

Over the past seven years, there have been numerous tragedies he didn’t publicly shed a tear over, including the deaths of black men and children at the hands of police officers.

Here are 11 other things that Obama never (publicly) cried about.

1. Laquan McDonald’s death

Obama’s hometown of Chicago has been rife with tension after police shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald then apparently colluded with city officials in an attempt to conceal details surrounding his death. Many were upset that the dashcam footage showing a police officer fatally shooting the teen was released to the public 13 months after the October 2014 shooting. The delay in releasing the video raised suspicions that Rahm Emanuel, Chicago mayor and Obama’s former chief of staff, was involved in covering up the police’s actions surrounding his death.

A deluge of emails from city officials show that the Emanuel administration was concerned about the optics of the shooting, and it appears that they tried to minimize attention to the tragic event. The emails, which total over 3,000 pages, were made available to the public on New Year’s Eve.

While Obama did release a statement saying that he was “deeply disturbed” by the footage, he hasn’t publicly shed tears over a police officer shooting this teenager 16 times even after McDonald had already fallen to the ground. Nor has he claimed to have lost sleep over the subsequent cover-up that his former pal seems to have participated in.

2. Tamir Rice’s Death

Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice was shot to death while playing with a toy gun at a park in November 2014. The police officer who shot Rice has been cleared of any legal wrongdoing, but video footage showing the child’s death is truly horrifying.

3. Eric Garner’s Death

Eric Garner was choked to death by police last year while they apprehended him for selling untaxed cigarettes. Though he was resisting arrest, Garner can be heard repeatedly saying: “I can’t breathe.”

4. San Bernardino Attack

Obama was so undisturbed by the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11 that he waited two weeks before he finally making a pit stop at the site of the tragedy before taking off on his vacation to Hawaii.

5. Paris Terror Attacks

In the wake of the attacks that killed 130 people, Obama said climate change negotiations would be a “powerful rebuke” to ISIS — the terror group claiming responsibility for the carnage. While standing alongside President Francois Hollande to give a joint press conference on the attacks, Obama’s eyes remained dry, even as he embraced the leader of the country that had just suffered a great loss.

6. Fort Hood Massacre

Thirteen American soldiers were shot to death in Fort Hood, Texas, by an Army major who was repeatedly promoted despite continual warnings that he had become radicalized. Before opening fire in a processing center, he shouted “Allahu Akbar,” an Arabic phrase often used by jihadists that means “God is great.”

While Obama denounced the shooter’s actions, he had avoided publicly calling the shooter’s actions “terrorism” until a few weeks ago, six years after the fact.

7. Planned Parenthood’s Baby Butchery and Organ Harvesting

Employees of the nation’s largest abortion provider, which aborted over 300,000 babies last year, were caught on tape mutilating and picking through dead baby bodies to find sellable organs.

Other Planned Parenthood officials haggled over the price of organs and some were caught attempting to minimize the public attention to their organ-harvesting scheme for fear of bad press.

If the death of 26 children was enough to warrant a tearful response in public from the president, certainly the 300,000 babies who were aborted last year by Planned Parenthood deserve to be mourned as well.

8. Kayla Mueller’s Kidnapping and Death

The 27-year-old American aid worker was killed earlier this year while in captivity to ISIS. Despite having her fingernails ripped out and being raped repeatedly, Mueller refused to escape with some of her fellow hostages because she was reportedly afraid that her foreign appearance would inhibit their escape.

Mueller isn’t the only woman to be forced into the role of a sex slave to ISIS. The terror group has reportedly kidnapped thousands of women and girls for the purpose of raping and exchanging them with one another. They released a fatwa last month regulating the practice of sex slavery and rape in order to justify it with their beliefs, which are rooted in a radical interpretation of the Quran.

9. James Foley’s Beheading

Not only did Obama not cry when responding to the news of American journalist James Foley’s beheading by ISIS, he immediately ran off to play a round of golf. When he was confronted about this rather aloof behavior, Obama responded by saying that he “should have anticipated the optics” of playing golf immediately after condemning ISIS’ brutal actions.

The terror group is known for killing their prisoners in particularly inhumane ways, like lighting them on fire, drowning them in cages, or strapping explosive collars around their necks.

10. ISIS’s Attack on a Russian Plane Carrying 224 Passengers

A Russian plane carrying 224 passengers crashed earlier this year, killing everyone onboard. U.S. authorities believe ISIS planted a bomb on the plane. Don’t panic, though: Obama says he is taking the whole thing “very seriously.”

11. Boko Haram’s Kidnapping of More than 300 Girls

Radical Islamist terrorist organization Boko Haram kidnapped more than 300 girls from a school in Nigeria in order to enslave and sell them as sex slaves last year. While the kidnapping and trafficking of hundreds of girls got Michelle Obama to use the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls in a cringe-worthy photo op, it did not elicit any tears from the president.

"Terrorists, Mass Shootings, And The Rise Of The Warrior Kid","The continuing armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon has produced a few media novelties. (The other day I spotted a #VanillaISIS hashtag.) But more than anything it has reinforced the traditional narrative about what’s wrong with kids today. This is a mistake.

The standard description of today’s failing youth begins by dividing them into two groups — contrasting, yet mutually reinforcing. On the one hand, there’s the immature, weak, and peaceful; on the other, the immature, weak, and violent. We tell the same story at home and abroad, comparing those who fail to launch and infantilize themselves against those, from our mass shooters to the Islamic State’s alienated Western recruits, whose abortive maturity leads them to last out against those around them.

Losers and Lost Boys Theories Explain Somewhat

Indeed, what goes for “us” goes for “them.” To this day, terroristic bad guys from foreign lands are cognitively lumped into the category of “radical losers” — people who had so little going for them that they became nihilistic killers. “The loser may accept his fate and resign himself; the victim may demand satisfaction; the defeated may begin preparing for the next round,” as Hans Magnus Enzensberger put it in a long and influential 2006 essay. “But the radical loser isolates himself, becomes invisible, guards his delusion, saves his energy, and waits for his hour to come.”

Although it is a stretch to view Ammon Bundy and his compatriots as just kids, most Americans paying attention have happily made the leap in depicting them as radical losers positively reeking with the adolescent and juvenile conviction that their performative, threatening spectacle matters — so, therefore, they matter.

Terroristic bad guys from foreign lands are cognitively lumped into the category of ‘radical losers.’

In a similar key, author and professor Tom Nichols recently characterized our radical losers as Lost Boys. “Stuck in perpetual adolescence, they see only their own imagined virtue amidst irredeemable corruption,” he wrote. “In a typical sentiment, [mass shooter Dylan] Roof wrote before his rampage that ‘someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.’”

Western societies, Nichols worried, are producing ever more narcissist losers, sometimes creative but often drearily predictable in the way they unburden themselves of the grudges they carry against neighbors, schoolmates, strangers, and society.

Check Out of The Office and Become a Warlord

Although the narratives of the radical loser and the Lost Boy carry more than a kernel of self-evident truth, we do ourselves a disservice in failing to think beyond those narratives. Despite the shooters’ and terrorists’ stranglehold over our imagination, another binary set of character types has dramatically arisen to challenge our fundamental faith that those who break violently with the social system reserved for ordinary law-abiding citizens are losers — losing at life and destined to lose.

They see themselves as adults who have found a way to recover their personal agency and fully mature.

Rather than thinking solely in terms of shooters and terrorists, we must now also think in terms of mercenaries and warlords — the new character types whose violent breaks with the system are predicated on the simple idea that resigning yourself to a most ordinary life is now the ultimate losing proposition. They see themselves not as radical losers but as radical winners — not as lost children, but as adults who have found a way, despite our stultifying social order, to recover their personal agency and fully mature.

It is important to contrast this thinking to the other syndrome or delusion associated with the more adventuresome radical loser: crackpot religious fanaticism. To be sure, some mercenaries and warlords are motivated at root by a messianic or otherworldly mission. But the logic of the life of a mercenary or a warlord is quite unlike that of a martyr-murderer. Above all, the goal is to independently sustain one’s life, not to flame out as a vengeful parasite or fleeting scourge.

Rather than spiritual purity or existential nihilism, the moral appeal of that life is the much more pre-monotheistic objective of physical self-actualization and the pathos of glory. Plus, at its best, the mercenary or warlord life promises just a lot of fun. In that life, even an “ordinary” day likely revolves around freely killing your enemies with your friends, and bedding those drawn to your power. Not bad for a day’s work.

Reach Beyond this Feeble Existence for Glory

Not by the prevailing standards within today’s feeble, enfeebling social confines, at least. For the cost of a security deposit, you can train, travel, and become a mercenary. For the cost of what people put in their 401(k)s, you can hire an army in a foreign land and become a warlord.

Their life offers a sharp alternative to the contemporary dominance of anonymous struggle in interchangeable insignificance.

By no means do we need to celebrate the mercenary’s and warlord’s ethos in order to recognize that their life offers a sharp alternative to the contemporary dominance of anonymous struggle in interchangeable insignificance — one that doesn’t require throwing your own life away in a tide of innocent blood.

Drinking last night with a friendly mercenary, talk turned to Aristotle’s famous heuristic that he who doesn’t live as a citizen is either a beast or a god. Why, I asked, did mercenaries think they ought to break violently with basic political order as a framework for life? How could today’s most radical vision of winning depart so dramatically from the mainstream of modern and ancient philosophy alike — harkening more to the battlefield of Troy than to Plato’s academy? The response was as circular and lyrical as the vision of life expressed by Homer himself, and not entirely on account of the booze.

Above all, I was struck by how grown-up were the mercenary’s reflections. This was a considered adoption of potent, life-narrowing burdens, carried over time. It occurred to me that I was being allowed a very slight glimpse into the future. It seems outlandish that lots of today’s mopey and hopeless millennials would make the choice to become a warlord or a mercenary — or even to try. Yet many of them, in a barely-suppressed panic, increasingly share the same vision of failure as the mercenaries and warlords — the corporate cubicle, the dead-end life, the tamed and imprisoned habits, the long, wearying going through of the economic and cultural motions.

As diligently as we “other” the world’s growing ranks of mercenaries and warlords, somewhere within, as Joseph Conrad seemed to suggest in “Heart of Darkness,” we ought to find — and to seek — a shock of recognition.

Why Mass Muslim Migration Eviscerates Western Liberalism,"For the past few months, the question of admitting tens of thousands of Syrian refugees has rocked the American political landscape, and predictably the issue has been remarkably polarized. Many on the Left, including both Democratic presidential candidates, have advocated for a massive domestic resettlement effort, while those on the Right favor either granting asylum only to Christian refugees or admitting no refugees.

On February 3, Congress joined in the debate through a public hearing hosted by the Senate’s Homeland Security Committee. The hearing, which analyzed Canada’s plans to screen and admit 25,000 Syrian refugees, invoked the testimony of both Canadian and U.S. experts, including U.S. border officials. This scrutiny of our northern neighbor’s refugee plans is evidently Congress’s attempt to check for flaws in the Canadian system (which could result in potentially violent migrants living dangerously close to the United States) and to better understand whether the Obama administration’s vetting program will be effective.

The Senate’s hearing comes hot on the heels of terrorist acts perpetrated by Middle Eastern immigrants across the globe, which have seriously complicated the conversation on Syrian refugees. Last month, for instance, an Islamic State operative from Syria killed 10 Western tourists through a suicide bombing in Turkey, and on New Year’s Eve a group of 1,000 confirmed Arab and North African asylum-seekers robbed and sexually assaulted literally hundreds of women in Cologne, Germany. Even in the United States, the federal government recently arrested two Iraqi-born refugees, in Sacramento and Houston, for plotting with terror groups and lying about their activity.

As the hearing demonstrated, the controversy surrounding refugees in America has focused almost entirely on the potential threat to national security, and the possibility—or probability, rather—of ISIS capitalizing on open borders to plant insurgents into the country.

While these points are undoubtedly legitimate and signify cause for concern, the potential cultural implications of a large-scale Muslim migration into the United States have, on the whole, been relegated to the sidelines of the national conversation. This part of the discussion is equally important, however, because it exposes how open borders are quite contrary to liberal Americans’ own values and interests.

A Culture Antithetical to American Values

According to available statistics, the vast majority of Syrian refugees that have been admitted to the United States since 2011 are Muslim, and given the fact that only about 10 percent of all global refugees are Christian, it’s safe to infer that the majority of refugees settling in other parts of the globe are also Muslim.

Many liberals have apparently forgotten how marginalized groups are treated in the majority-Muslim countries of the Middle East.

In their rush to appear as compassionate champions of Syrian refugees, many liberals have apparently forgotten how marginalized groups are treated in the majority-Muslim countries of the Middle East. According to a report by the World Health Organization in 2013, rates of domestic violence are the highest by far in the Muslim countries of North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

It’s only been within the past 15 to 20 years that women have gained access to political rights and offices in some of these countries, yet despite this, women are still openly harassed in public, completely undermined by many of their states’ legal systems, and severely restricted from basic civil rights, particularly the freedoms of choice and expression. Incredibly, it’s still not uncommon for young women to be forced to marry someone who rapes or assaults them—a reality that stems from regional religious and cultural views of honor.

Gays have it even worse than women. Homosexual behavior and LGBT expression is either illegal or severely restricted in all countries of the Middle East besides Israel, and punishments include lifelong imprisonment or execution. Indeed, Israel is the only country in the region that recognizes same-sex marriage, provides for adoption by same-sex couples, and allows gays to serve in the military. As for transgender individuals, the Left’s darling new minority group? Only Israel, Iran, and Syria provide legal recognition for changes in gender identity.

Is it really the progressive thing to do to grant indefinite sanctuary to individuals who are committed to such fundamentally different ways of life?

Recent events in Europe show that incoming refugees are not so quick to abandon their native cultural attitudes. Last month, gay refugees in the Netherlands had to be moved to separate facilities after other refugees attacked them, and across Europe facilities are being built specifically for LGBT refugees because of at least a hundred reports of assault.

The Cologne attacks clearly demonstrate that many refugees have no qualms assaulting and robbing women, and several other European countries have been dealing with a spike in rapes in migrant-heavy areas for the past several years. This has lead some, like Norway, to institute classes at asylum centers teaching refugees how to treat women properly.

While this may help prevent further attacks, it likely won’t be that easy for refugees to conform to Western cultural standards so quickly. After all, many have grown up in extremely patriarchal societies where any scantily clad woman is understood to be a prostitute and even the slightest display of skin is taken as an invitation for sex.

Is it really the progressive thing to do to grant indefinite sanctuary to individuals who are committed to such fundamentally different ways of life? This is a question that liberals—especially women and gays—should ask themselves before jumping into the open border abyss.

A Potential Long-Term Problem

Presented with this mounting evidence, some on the Left have attempted to negate concerns that Europe’s refugee problems will manifest in America, arguing that the overseas case is different because their incoming refugees are overwhelmingly young men, a demographic naturally prone to such violent behavior. They further point out that the United Nations has said it plans to direct mostly women and children across the Atlantic, and that the Obama administration has sworn the government’s vetting process will grant preference to these ostensibly less-threatening refugees.

Liberals are creating an environment for deadly anti-American sentiment to fester when they encourage migrants to simultaneously preserve their native culture and abhor their new American one.

While women and children do make up a large portion of the potential refugees to the United States, no one can say for certain that young men or potential ISIS insurgents will not get past government screening. But let’s say for a moment that, unlike most things run by the government, the vetting system is actually effective and does bar potentially disruptive refugees, allowing only the harmless women and children as Obama promised. Would this situation leave liberals with no cause for concern?

Peter Skerry at The Weekly Standard offers insightful information about the nature of Muslim immigration and assimilation that suggest otherwise. He explains that, generally, immigrant parents reconcile with what’s known as “the brutal bargain.” They reluctantly come to terms with what they lost in leaving their homeland by comparing their past circumstances to their newer, better prospects in America.

Moreover, while Muslims are remarkably assimilated in some respects—most speak English, earn a decent living, and attend American schools—a notable shift occurs as the second generation comes of age. This generation likely grows up seeing their parents deal with the realities of the bargain. For example, first-generation parents might acquiesce to American social norms in the public sphere, grateful to be making a decent living in a safe environment, but at home they’ll express intense disapproval of American culture—especially youth culture—even if they aren’t particularly observant Muslims.

Skerry explains that their children, whose only real home has been the United States, may inherit their parents’ cultural disapproval but lack the same sense of obligatory appreciation that led their parents to assimilate. Thus, when it comes to assimilation, they may “[try] self-consciously to apply the brakes, even to reverse the process in order to regain what many feel has been lost.”

Children whose only real home has been the United States may inherit their parents’ cultural disapproval but lack the same sense of obligatory appreciation.

What’s more is that today’s liberals—who control most of education, including the public schools and colleges these immigrant children eventually attend—relentlessly teach immigrants and minority groups that they’re perpetual victims of a racist American society, and that they should hate the governing system that granted their ancestors protection.

Indeed, many on the Left have completely abandoned assimilation, which they regard only as a synonym for “racism,” “xenophobia,” and “white supremacy,” while worshipping their religions of multiculturalism, diversity, and tolerance. It’s likely because of the global Left’s obsessive, coercive commitment to these principles that German police attempted to cover up the sexual assault epidemic—something authorities in other European nations have also been doing—to protect refugees from any perceived “discrimination.”

While there may be no apparent threat in admitting fleeing Muslim families to the United States, liberals are creating an environment for potentially deadly anti-American sentiment to fester when they encourage migrants to simultaneously preserve their native culture and abhor their new American one.

ISIS and other terror groups have already proven their digital arms extend across the Atlantic and into the United States. The San Bernardino shooters, for instance, long-time residents in the United States who became radicalized domestically, as evidenced by their communication with overseas terror groups prior to the massacre. Who’s to say ISIS or another terror organization won’t similarly manipulate future Muslim-Americans?

Open Borders Lead to a Culture of Fear

You’ll recall that the media absolutely lost its collective mind when Donald Trump suggested a temporary ban on Muslim immigration in response to the Paris attacks. You couldn’t go to any news outlet without seeing Trump’s name in top headlines. Yet despite all the attacks and accusations of Republican xenophobia most mainstream media outlets launched, Trump’s lead in the polls only expanded after his suggested ban, proving that a good chunk of Americans actually liked the sound of his policy.

We know that liberals’ unequivocal support for open borders and unfiltered immigration on a massive scale only increases ‘xenophobic’ sentiment among Americans.

Liberals are right when they say that closing our borders to refugees in desperate need of help is inconsistent with our American (and Judeo-Christian inspired) values. They are also right when they argue that increasing surveillance on American Muslims and letting in some refugees over others—based on religion, perhaps—is discriminatory and inconsistent with constitutional principles.

But as the Wall Street Journal correctly notes, sometimes it’s in our national interest to “accept small infringements on liberty” such as these, because “the consequences of failure will be so much worse for liberal values” and for the nation as a whole. Keeping out certain demographics of immigrants as a temporary policy solution might certainly be worth it if the wrong handful of individuals gain access into the country and commit a Paris-style terror attack.

If you have trouble imagining the restrictions placed on the personal liberties of all Americans that would likely follow such an event, think back to the Patriot Act and the post-9/11 paranoia. Or, even more extreme, think of the Japanese internment camps during World War II, which were an egregious violation of civil rights that grew out of the fear instilled by Pearl Harbor.

In any case, we know that liberals’ unequivocal support for open borders and unfiltered immigration on a massive scale only increases “xenophobic” sentiment among Americans. We’ve already seen some lawmakers move further down that path as a consequence of the massive amounts of Hispanic aliens who have entered the country and not assimilated particularly well. Adopting the same unwavering stance for Muslim migration would only compound the polarized political landscape, reducing the chances of the United States providing assistance for any refugees.

It’s certainly tempting to sift through heart-wrenching pictures of starved Syrian children and passionately condemn those opposed to their immediate entry as heartless, nonsensical, and even monstrous. But liberals shouldn’t let their commitment to compassion blind them to the potential consequences of mass Muslim migration—consequences that would utterly contradict their own interests and beliefs. If they don’t lift the veil, they’ll fail to realize that the most compassionate thing to do isn’t to open the border, but rather to focus their efforts on eliminating the evil that’s pushing the refugees out of their homeland in the first place.

Correction: The classes for refugees in Norway were voluntary, not mandatory. And one of the San Bernardino shooters was born outside the United States. We regret the errors.

"If FBI Can Make Apple Open An iPhone, It Can Do Anything","On February 16, California Judge Sheri Pym issued a court order to Apple, Inc. to create new software that would allow the FBI to bypass the safety protocols in iPhones that force them to lock down or wipe memory after 10 failed passcode attempts. The FBI needs it to gain access to a phone that belonged to Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters.

Apple CEO Tim Cook issued a public letter to customers from the Apple website not only stating the government’s intentions, but also declaring Apple’s resistance to the FBI’s request to create such a program.

“We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good.” states Cook. “Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.”

The FBI has asked Apple to create a master key for government bodies to use that would allow them to break user encryption by entering various number combinations in the blink of an eye without the phone going amnesiatic. This gross overreach of power has even gotten the attention of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which has taken Apple’s side on the issue.

“We are supporting Apple here because the government is doing more than simply asking for Apple’s assistance.” said the EFF in a statement on their site. “For the first time, the government is requesting Apple write brand new code that eliminates key features of iPhone security—security features that protect us all. Essentially, the government is asking Apple to create a master key so that it can open a single phone. And once that master key is created, we’re certain that our government will ask for it again and again, for other phones, and turn this power against any software or device that has the audacity to offer strong security.”

The EFF also plans on submitting an amicus brief in support of Apple resisting the government order.

The FBI’S Demand Isn’t Simple Terrorism Fighting

I’m more afraid of my own government than I am of any terrorist. I can shoot at ISIS when they decide to get forceful with me. Al-Qaeda can’t legally imprison me for resisting them. This is not the case with the American government, which can confiscate your money for mere suspicion of trafficking and use violence against you if you resist. The idea that the government could brute-force my phone into giving up my location, texts, and turning on my microphone and camera to gain information—or, more likely, proof of their suspicions of me—seems more dangerous to my personal security than a terrorist I can shoot back at.

You don’t ask for a master key because you want access to one lock. You ask for a master key because you want access to all locks.

Secondly, I don’t believe that the FBI asked for Apple to make this software because it just wants to force their way into this phone, because if they wanted Apple to provide that phone’s info, they could have gotten it by asking, as Apple has helped in similar instances in the past.

You don’t ask for a master key because you want access to one lock. You ask for a master key because you want access to all locks. The very nature of this master key is that it unlocks any phone the FBI wants access to. The pretense that it’s strictly the San Bernardino shooter’s information that they want to acquire by creating this new hack-friendly operating system—coined the “FBiOS” by National Review’s Kevin Williamson—seems like weak reasoning at best.

Furthermore, this operating system creates too many security issues. Eliminating the consequences of entry failure defeats the purpose of passcode security. Any Aiden Pearce wannabe with the capability to brute force a passcode would be a security nightmare to customers and providers alike. The government wants this operating system to combat terrorism, but it will, in effect, open the door for unprecedented levels of cyber terrorism.

Remember ‘Innocent until Proven Guilty’?

Like Cook, I have no sympathy for terrorists. In the San Bernardino case, we have a confirmed terrorist, and access to his phone is more than warranted. However, Farook is one man with one phone that Apple could help the FBI investigate. What the government is asking is access to all phones. I can’t help but feel this is the government saying that every citizen is a potential Syed Farook, and that all phones should be easily accessed…just in case.

This is the government saying that every citizen is a potential Syed Farook, and that all phones should be easily accessed…just in case.

In this situation, “just in case” denotes the mere suspicion that a citizen might be a terrorist. The trouble is that “terrorist” is defined rather loosely, and sometimes inaccurately in today’s world. It wasn’t long ago that Janet Napolitano’s Department of Homeland Security was vaguely defining Tea Partiers and veterans as likely terrorists. Mere suspicion has also put innocent civilians on the “no fly list.”

If suspicion is enough to violate the Fifth Amendment rights of American citizens without trial regarding travel, then it’s certainly enough to give bureaucrats reason to utilize the master key against citizens they suspect…just in case. Some would say this cannot be done without a warrant, but they should remember that the government is no stranger to warrantless spying. Just ask the National Security Agency, which engaged in warrantless surveillance at least from 2001 to 2007.

Wisdom says that if someone has abusable power, expect them to abuse that power. The government is no exception, and has proven repeatedly to be the rule.

Most important in Apple’s resistance is its refusal to set a precedent. That a corporation or business could be court-ordered to create a product that specifically caters to the needs of government entities would be a massive overreach officials would undoubtedly abuse for years to come. In this specific case, Apple’s success in resisting the government isn’t just a security issue, it’s a matter of how much further government can push itself into the private sector. This isn’t about one iPhone, this is about all iPhones, and possibly more than that.

"U.S. Soldier To Donald Trump: ‘Hell No, Sir’","As soldiers, we are called to respect and obey our commander-in-chief, but not if he issues unlawful orders. This moral commitment is one of the things that keeps soldiers from becoming barbaric in the most barbaric of circumstances—war. It also is a constant reminder that no man stands above the law he serves.

When questioned on how he would make a nation, group, or person do what he demands, Donald Trump often replies with something menacing, along the lines of “They will—” with an implied “or else.” The Mexican government disagrees with him on who will pay for his wall, so now it’s ten feet taller. House Speaker Paul Ryan expresses reservations about Trump’s KKK equivocations, and Trump concludes they’ll get along, or Ryan will “pay a big price.”

In last week’s Republican primary debate, Donald Trump used the same veiled threat toward the military if it refused his unlawful orders to torture captured terrorists and target their families. He repeatedly insisted that they—we—would do what he said. Of course, confronted on his comments afterward, he was forced to rethink his answer and backpedaled. It’s hard to take such an immediate 180-degree turn seriously. He was given numerous opportunities to correct himself during the debate and didn’t do so.

A Presidency Too Far

Since his initial comments are more in line with his previous statements, which is why he was asked the question, I take them seriously. As a soldier, I expect commanders to say what they mean and not play political games. My response to Trump’s position (as best we can determine): Hell no, sir.

As a soldier, I expect commanders to say what they mean and not play political games.

You have repeatedly belittled our former commander-in-chief, President George W. Bush, whose unequivocal response to 9/11 was the reason so many of us joined the military. You claim—with no evidence—that he lied about Iraq. You can fault the intelligence that Bush, both Clintons, Barack Obama, and most of Congress believed, but you cannot fault the moral integrity of the man.

In fact, that was why many of us took our oath of offices under his presidency—you could question his policies, but you could not question his principles. We knew President Bush would give us the tools to fight a cause he earnestly believed in (and many of us did, too), and that he would try to get us out with minimal casualties. Yet you called him a liar.

While lambasting the ethics of our former commander-in-chief, you seek to go beyond his enhanced interrogation techniques to the use of outright torture. You seek to go beyond his discriminate targeting of terrorists by illegally and inhumanely targeting terrorists’ families. You must have a low view of our military to think they will mindlessly abide the dictatorial edicts of a man who pretends to stand above the Constitution they pledged to defend.

American Soldiers Need a Strong Conscience

You said last Thursday that not only would you favor these policies as commander-in-chief, but you would make sure the military did what you said. You not only doubt our mental faculties and moral character, you doubt our moral fortitude in refusing your unlawful orders. You play to the progressive stereotype that soldiers are nothing but pre-programmed kill machines.

We are not mindless, human drones that can be deployed through whatever means to any sort of immoral end.

As a chaplain, much of my job is to counsel soldiers, because they are the exact opposite—they are spouses and parents, called to leave their families behind to preserve the country they love. They see horrendous things, including the weaponization of children, but bear the moral weight of such a sacrifice for the greater cause they carry. Moral conscience and moral fortitude are the chief characteristics of each soldier. These characteristics enable them to endure the sick and sadistic for the sake of greater things—country, freedom, values, family, and the battle buddy alongside them.

It is also these characteristics that separate soldiers from terrorists. We are not mindless, human drones that can be deployed through whatever means to any sort of immoral end. We represent moral ideals (the Constitution), moral causes (defending home and hearth), and bear moral discretion in defending these ideals and causes. A U.S. soldier is a soldier specifically for these reasons.

I shouldn’t have to instruct you on the basic nature and tenets of the military, for you are dangerously close to controlling this venerable force. You should have listened to General Hayden’s warning that we would not abide your unlawful orders. Our moral conscience, which makes us soldiers, commits us to a moral purpose higher than your megalomaniacal ambitions for our use.

So now a low-ranking young officer in the Army Reserves is telling you what hundreds of thousands of other soldiers will echo: “Hell no, sir.”

"Hate ‘London Has Fallen’ For Its Camp, Not ‘Islamophobia’","Critics cannot abide “London Has Fallen,” the terrorist-foiling actioneer starring Gerald Butler as Mike Banner, once again fighting to keep his boss, President Mike Asher (Aaron Eckhart), out of the clutches of terrorists. Is it because of the muddy, confusing cinematography, the ridiculous storyline, the ludicrously durable hero fighting off hundreds of poorly aiming terrorists with a medium-sized knife? Yes, but mostly because in a day and age of terrorist attacks in European cities by Middle Easterners, it’s apparently offensive and racist to make an action movie about Middle Eastern terrorists attacking European cities.

“London Has Fallen” is a sequel to 2013’s “Olympus Has Fallen,” which didn’t win many awards but benefited from an enclosed “‘Die Hard’ in the White House” setup. Its lukewarm reception was positively rapturous compared to the moralistically scathing notices that have trailed “London,” perhaps because North Koreans are somehow more acceptable villains than Arabs.

The story, more or less: Two years after a drone strike aimed at a terrorist blows up a Pakistani family at a wedding, an incredibly thorough revenge plot comes to fruition as world leaders gather in London for the funeral of the British Prime Minister. From there, a motley collection of terrorists (including a Beefeater) start picking off Europe’s finest, bombing Parliament, and blowing up boats on the Thames. President Asher, who really only wanted to send flowers, must once again be saved by his loyal Secret Service agent, played by Scottish action star Butler, from a fate worse than death: death on YouTube.

Cue the Social Justice Whining

Film critics, taking cues from the new crop of social justice binge-watchers who consider every new show episode a potential problem, are desperately unhappy about the terrorists’ Arabic mien. (Apparently they’re supposed to be British, like they are in every other action movie.)

The new crop of social justice binge-watchers consider every new show episode a potential problem.

Problematic? Oh, “London” goes way beyond “problematic.” It’s “freely offensive,” racist, and Islamophobic to boot. Even the massacres in Paris by radical Islamists last November are seen not as a post-justification for the movie’s plot, but somehow make it even more offensive.

Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly, a formerly entertaining read now in a sharp decline into PC activism, found using an ISIS-like villain morally dubious: “By casting its villain as a suspiciously ISIS-like Middle Eastern terrorist network, London Has Fallen makes itself into a political movie – but its politics are heinous…. At one point, Banning even tells one of the terrorists to ‘head back to F–headistan or wherever you’re from.’ (Incidentally, this racism extends to the terrorists speaking accented English the whole movie, where the European leaders are given the luxury of subtitles).”

As if having the terrorists speaking in Arabic would make him feel any better.

We’ll Virtue Signal Real Big So Terrorists Don’t Hate Us?

Variety’s take was standard Hollywood PC: “Cruddily crafted, grimacingly performed and effortlessly racist….coldly snarling and vindictive about its sequel’s flag-waving….While North Korea was the enemy in ‘Olympus,’ ‘London’ predictably reverts to familiar Islamophobia….ugly brand of reactionary fear-mongering.”

Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The Onion’s AV Club was strangely not amused and eviscerated the ‘grab bag of dog-whistles and dog-shit filmmaking.’

Metro critic Matt Prigge condescendingly fretted that for conservatives the movie “indulges their worst instincts” while hinting its “Cro-Magnon charm” may have perverse appeal to lefties who want to see actors like Morgan Freeman spout right-wing platitudes. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The Onion’s AV Club was strangely not amused, and eviscerated the “grab bag of dog-whistles and dog-shit filmmaking” on his way to awarding an F grade, while describing the movie’s politics as ranging from “tone deaf to irredeemable…dumpster of xenophobia.”

The left-wing Independent (UK) ran a full aggrieved news article on the critical hash with a headline that shows just how intimately our cousins understand this vast, diverse country: “London Has Fallen movie condemned as racist ‘terrorsploitation’ for Donald Trump era.”

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes summed it up: “London Has Fallen traps a talented cast — and all who dare to see it — in a mid-1990s basic-cable nightmare of a film loaded with xenophobia and threadbare action-thriller clichés.” It currently stands at 27 percent positive reviews at Rotten Tomatoes, although 63 percent of actual moviegoers liked it. That’s not a stellar number, but does show a gap between elite opinion and the hoi polloi, who aren’t frittering away their precious time on earth tabulating how many seconds imaginary female princesses get to speak in Disney movies.

That Doesn’t Mean You Should See It

With respectable opinion lined up against it, one would hope “London Has Fallen” can’t be all bad. Alas, the critics are half-right. You can’t call “London” a good movie (or even a bad one in that “so bad it’s good” vein). Its superficially shocking premise is undone by murky, graceless filming (some of it done on the cheap in Bulgaria), some unconvincing explosions of London landmarks, and a ridiculously durable hero in the form of Butler’s Mike Banning.

Watching Butler mowing down dimly illuminated terrorists like so much grass gets rather ridiculous.

There are lot of f-words, some slick, sardonic exchanges between Banning and his friend the prez, and a surprising lack of blood. Watching Butler mowing down dimly illuminated terrorists like so much grass gets rather ridiculous, and you began to wonder how the same terror masterminds who came up with the elaborate, expensive, painstakingly planned operation would hire passive lunkheads with sub-Stormtrooper aim to carry it out.

Reviewers may be snottily PC in bashing the movie’s “Islamophobia,” though the term “radical Islam” makes not a peep, and Director Babak Najafi is a Swede inconveniently born in Iran. Still, Londoners may rightly take offense at “London Has Fallen’s” portrayal of its MI6 as completely clueless and its security forces as corrupt. But while it may offend English pride, there’s nothing in “London Has Fallen” that should offend an American’s political sensibilities. Only his aesthetic ones.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/11/hate-london-has-fallen-for-its-camp-not-islamophobia/,2016-03-11
Socialism’s Bloody History Shows Millennials Should Think Twice Before Supporting It,"Nikolai Bukharin was executed by shooting in Moscow on March 15, 1938. He had been revered as a giant of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, as one who even worked side by side with Vladimir Lenin himself. Alas, Bukharin’s Marxist chickens had come home to roost by the time he was shot like a dog during Josef Stalin’s reign of terror. His execution marked the pinnacle of Stalin’s show trials of high-level officials.

You see, Bukharin invested in building a political system that inevitably puts the reins of power into the hands of just a few strongmen who end up calling all the shots. It’s a system in which suspicion and the smell of treason tend to hang in the air.

Socialism, by the way, is just such a system. This is the case whether you call it by any other name, whether communism, utopianism, or collectivism. Oh, go ahead and slap some lipstick on that pig and call it “democratic” socialism or “progressivism” or “communitarianism.”

Lenin and his gang all started out calling themselves socialists. Social democrats, to be exact. So the fact remains: the path of socialism is ultimately paved with coercion, censorship, and, yes, terror. Does stating this make me an alarmist? No. It makes me a realist.

Socialism Is a Bait-and-Switch Scheme

Socialism and communism both involve ceding to the state control over the distribution of goods and services for the masses. This involves giving up individual rights, and giving the state a good measure of control over our personal lives. This road always leads to tyranny, no matter what you pave it with, and no matter what you name it.

Socialism requires a power clique—or, as Lenin put it, an elite ‘vanguard’—in order to pretend to function.

Socialism requires a power clique—or, as Lenin put it, an elite “vanguard”—in order to pretend to function. This means going heavy on executive power and rubber-stamp light on the legislative. Socialism demands that we place blind trust in whoever takes the reins of power to distribute society’s goods and services. This tiny elite, by the way, typically enjoys enormous privileges and a much higher standard of living than the hoi polloi, simply by being a part of the elite “nomenklatura.”

Sure, this oligarchy claims to distribute in the name of “equality.” That’s typically the cover story. The historical fact is that the vanguard, the power clique, eventually takes control of everything that’s produced—medicine, education, housing, food, transportation, etc. Its members then bureaucratically ration out—as they see fit—the means of human survival. In the end, you’ve basically got an elite corps of mobsters with the power to decide which folks are more equal than others.

Socialism also has a way of producing bloated bureaucracies that in turn produce ever greater scarcity. Along the way, this produces ever more corruption and cronyism. Censorship puts down deep roots because dissent cannot be tolerated or the system would collapse. Those are all prime ingredients for a closed society and surveillance state. Yet everybody is supposed to lay back and enjoy it.

Millennials for Bernie Sanders, Be Careful What You Wish For

So why should we meditate on the gruesome anniversary of Bukharin’s execution 78 years after the fact? Because Stalin’s purges and the reign of terror he invoked throughout Soviet society are actually pretty natural outgrowths of a system that puts too much power in the hands of too few people. That’s why.

The current professed yearning for socialism—a system so conducive to corruption, cronyism, censorship, and coercion—just keeps rearing its ugly head.

Yet the current professed yearning for socialism—a system so conducive to corruption, cronyism, censorship, and coercion—just keeps rearing its ugly head. One case in point is the open support for Stalin himself in today’s Russia. On March 5, the anniversary of Stalin’s death, a group of communists led a brazen procession to his grave to pay homage to this man who is responsible for the deaths of untold millions during his reign of terror in the Soviet Union.

We are also witnessing a new trendiness for all things socialist and communist among college youth. They sport T-shirts featuring the image of nauseatingly murderous tyrants like Che Guevara. Thanks to the popularity of the avuncular Bernie Sanders, coupled with an astonishing ignorance of history, millennials have fast become trusty mouthpieces for socialism. This is ironic, because socialism has a way of redistributing power away from the “99 percent” and puts it into the hands of the few central planners—a teensy fraction of 1 percent—at the top.

Then what? Well, too often the answer is in the title of this recent article written by libertarian Matt Kibbe: “Socialism Kills.” R.J. Rummel chronicled and documented the killing habits of socialist regimes in his work “Death by Government.” There’s an indisputable correlation between big government and terror that keeps turning up throughout history. That’s because big government is really Borg government. It just can’t get enough of itself.

We’d better get acquainted with it if we’d like to avoid it, no?

Nikolai Bukharin’s Wretched Ides of March

Bukharin’s execution, as well as all of the wild show trials with forced confessions and executions of so many high-level Soviet leaders, caused shock and disillusionment among several prominent communists in the West. (One of them, Arthur Koestler, reflected on the impact of the show trials in his novel “Darkness at Noon.”)

In that last letter, he requested poison to drink rather than a bullet to the head.

Bukharin wrote more than 30 letters to Stalin while in prison, none of which were answered. But his last letter is particularly poignant. It’s an utter mess of emotions and contradictions: wailing self-pity, confession to crimes, pleas for his innocence, Stockholm Syndrome, total despair, and hope against hope. He referred to Stalin by his revolutionary nickname “Koba,” in an attempt to hearken back to their old Bolshevik days of being comrades-in-arms.

But Bukharin knew he was finished. In that last letter, he requested poison to drink rather than a bullet to the head. (According to one report, he was made to watch the executions of 16 other defendants, then shot last.) He requested to see his wife and infant son. (Obviously, not granted or answered. His wife was sent to a gulag prison camp.)

He even requested to be exiled to America, where he promised to wage Stalin’s war against by-then-enemy-of-the-people Leon Trotsky, the founder of the Red Army. (This seems a pathetic Hail Mary pass.) He also expressed regret for pal-ing around with Lev Kamenev, another high-ranking Bolshevik Stalin had purged earlier.

Here’s how Bukharin’s letter to Stalin ends:

In me you have lost one of your most capable generals, one who is genuinely devoted to you. But that is all past. It is bitter to reflect on all this. But I am preparing myself mentally to depart from this vale of tears, and there is nothing in me toward all of you, toward the party and the cause, but a great and boundless love. I am doing everything that is humanly possible and impossible.



I have crossed all the t’s and dotted all the i’s in spite of a headache and with tears in my eyes. My conscience is clear before you now, Koba. I ask you one final time for your forgiveness (only in your heart, not otherwise.) For that reason I embrace you in my mind.

One Soviet scholar in particular, Stephen Cohen, has defended Bukharin as courageous, and as one who never truly confessed but engaged in a war of words—in an Aesopian language—during his spoken defense at the trial itself. Be that as it may, Bukharin’s letter displays the full human wreckage that lay at the end of the road of socialism.

A fascinating postscript here is that Cohen came into possession of the last letter Bukharin wrote from prison to his young wife Anna Larina. Cohen actually delivered it into her hands in 1992, 54 years later.

Socialism Separates People and Causes Great Human Misery

Bukharin’s letter to Anna displays in stark clarity what a socialist system ultimately does to the most intimate of human relationships. Once socialism is entrenched, it is tailor-made to separate human beings and stand in the way of intimacy. Indeed, its general premise is that the good of the collective trumps the good of the individual, which means it is actually invested in wreaking havoc on family relationships and loyalties.

Below is an excerpt from Bukharin’s letter to Anna Larina. It’s loaded with pathos, suffering, loneliness, and all manner of contradictions. It’s a testament to the fact that in the end, we only want familial closeness with real, flesh and blood people. Not “communitarian” efficiency. Yet, at the same time, Bukharin extols the very system, socialism, that would destroy these relationships for him and for everyone:

My sweet Anushka! My Darling!



I write to you on the eve of the trial, and I write to you with a definite purpose, which I emphasize three times over: No matter what you read, no matter what you hear, no matter how horrible these things might be, no matter what might be said to me nor what I might say – endure everything courageously and calmly. Prepare the family. Help all of them. I fear for you and the others, but most of all for you. Don’t feel malice about anything. Remember that the great cause of the USSR lives on and this is the most important thing. Personal fates are transitory and wretched by comparison. A great ordeal awaits you. I beg you my dearest, muster all your strength, tighten all the strings of your heart, but don’t allow them to break.



Do not talk carelessly with anybody about anything. . . .

There you have it. Bukharin feels compelled to say that the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) is “the most important thing.” And be careful, oh, so very careful, what you say to anybody. Political correctness on steroids. That’s socialism in a nutshell for you.

No doubt the stated intentions are oh-so-pure and oh-so-good, like “liberte, egalite, fraternite.” It’s the sort of compassion Flannery O’Connor wrote of when she noted that “tenderness leads to the gas chamber.” That’s because, at the end of the day, socialism is a manipulative machine of human cruelty powered only by a blind greed for power. It forces people to finely mince their words, or remain silent.

Of course it operates under the fig leaf of “equality.” Because how else can it seal the deal?

Socialism Is a Well-Trod Path to Absolute Power

Somehow, a lot of folks missed the memo that a system without checks and balances on political power is conducive to creating power-mongers, and even monsters. Lord Acton famously stated: “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”

A system without checks and balances on political power is conducive to creating power-mongers, and even monsters.

Lord Acton’s warning is oft quoted, but little noted, despite the fact that history proves it correct time and bloody time again. Witness Nazi Germany, Mao’s China, Kim Jong Un’s North Korea, Pol Pot’s Cambodia, and myriad other examples. Lord Acton’s statement has even been laboratory-tested, and you can check that out in this Leadership Quarterly article.

Bukharin’s Bolshevik comrades had held him in the highest esteem. He was a prominent leader of the Russian revolution and party theorist who worked side by side with Lenin himself, the firebrand who overthrew czarist Russia and entrenched communism there. Lenin even dubbed Bukharin “the golden boy of the revolution.”

But Bukharin basically had two killers, as did all of the other cronies in the government’s power clique. One, of course, was the Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. The other killer was the ideology of socialism that Bukharin put into place—a system of unchecked power that grows monsters like Stalin.

We need to remember that, when soft socialism with its siren song of “equality” is left to its own devices, it takes ever more rigid forms. The political hubris of “progressives” who know better than you and me—and with such utter certainty—always leads to central control, corruption, cronyism, censorship, and abject conformity.

The more than 100 million victims of communism shows just how slippery a slope socialism is. Any person of goodwill who is familiar with the history and realities of socialism would do everything possible to avoid going down that minefield of a road.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/15/socialisms-bloody-history-shows-millennials-should-think-twice-before-supporting-it/,2016-03-15
Here’s What We Know About The Terrorist Attacks In Brussels,"A series of terrorist attacks on Brussels’ airport and subway system today left more than 30 dead, the European Union’s capital city on lockdown, and world leaders mourning as they ordered increased security. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks.

The number of dead stands at 34: at least 20 were killed in a subway blast in the district of Maalbeek, and at least 14 were killed in two explosions at Brussels Airport, at least one of which was a suicide bombing, according to CNN reporting. Belgian media reports that as many as 170 were injured in the attacks.

“We were fearing terrorist attacks, and now that has happened,” Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said, calling for calm and solidarity in a “tragic moment.” Brussels residents were told to “avoid all movement.”

The attacks come just days after the world’s most wanted terrorist suspect was captured in Belgium. Salah Abdeslam, suspected in the Paris terror attacks that killed 130, was arrested after a gun battle Friday along with four other suspects. Michel said there was no information tying the attacks to the arrest but noted the timing.

Frédéric Van Leeuw, a Belgian law enforcement official, said additional border security and police had been mobilized and the country’s threat level was at its highest. The New York Police Department is “increasing security around the city,” according to Washington Post reporting.

President Obama was briefed on the attacks on his trip to Cuba.

World leaders responded in the wake of the attack, with UK Prime Minister David Cameron calling a meeting of his country’s special security team, dubbed Cobra and increasing police at “ports, airports, Tube stations and international railway stations.”

I have just spoken to the Belgian PM and offered our sympathies and condolences. We must stand with Belgium at this very difficult time. — David Cameron (@David_Cameron) March 22, 2016

“The whole of Europe has been hit,” said French President Francoise Hollande, calling for increased intelligence sharing across the European Union to prevent future attacks.

The scene inside the airport was bloody and frantic, according to New York Times reporting:

Belinda How, a traveler from Malaysia who was in Brussels for a vacation, said she had been lining up to check in for an Etihad Airways flight when she heard the blast. “I was the last passenger queuing up,” she said. “I was very close to the first blast. Everybody was screaming.” She added: “I said to my son — he is a Down syndrome special-needs child — ‘You have to run.’ He said, ‘My leg hurts.’ I think he was panicked. I left my luggage, dragged him and ran. Before I ran out, there was another bomb.”

Facebook activated its Safety Check feature to allow those in Brussels to report on their well-being.

CAIR Cannot Be Trusted To Police Radical Muslims,"In the wake of Tuesday’s deadly terror attack in Brussels, presidential candidate Ted Cruz issued a statement calling on a renewed effort to oppose Islamic terrorism, and warning against what he described as Europe’s “toxic mix” of migrants infiltrated by terrorists and “isolated radical Muslim neighborhoods.”

The threat these neighborhoods pose to both public safety and social cohesion has been well-identified, even if disputes over the use of terms like “no-go zone” have been heated. They are largely abandoned by European law enforcement and left to the devices of a mixture of criminal gangs and Islamist imams.

In the terror attack in Brussels, the neighborhood in question is Molenbeek, where Paris massacre terrorist Salah Abdelslam was captured following a major shootout between gunmen and Belgian counterterror forces. Media outlets ranging from the reliably left Atlantic, to NBC News and the Telegraph, to the more conservative Fox News have all explored Molenbeek’s role as neighborhood where criminal gangs and Islamic jihad intermix.

None seem to dispute that Molenbeek is a problem for Belgian security. So who would be surprised by Cruz’s suggestion to “empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized”?

CAIR Constantly Opposes Anti-Terrorism Efforts

Enter the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). CAIR rapidly charged that Cruz’s suggestion that Muslim neighborhoods ought not be left to the ravages of Islamic radicals was “Islamophobia.” This is par for the course for the Hamas-linked CAIR, which has never met a law enforcement effort against terrorism that it didn’t oppose.

CAIR officials have even threatened Muslims who work with law enforcement.

CAIR is notorious for urging Muslim community members not to talk to law enforcement. In 2009, while Somali residents of Minneapolis were desperate for law enforcement assistance in dealing with imams recruiting their children for the terrorist group Al Shabaab, CAIR intervened.

As Abdirizak Bihi, a Somali activist testified to Congress: “CAIR held meetings for some members of the community and told them not to talk to the FBI, which was a slap in the face for the Somali American Muslim mothers who were knocking on doors day and night with pictures of their missing children and asking for the community to talk to law enforcement about what they know of the missing kids.” CAIR later attacked Bihi as an “Islamophobe.”

CAIR officials have even threatened Muslims who work with law enforcement, with one-time CAIR chapter leader Cyrus McGoldrick warning that “snitches get stitches.”

Elsewhere, McGoldrick threatened a suspected informant on his Facebook page, claiming he intended to “blast him later,” an ominous reference that probably referred to exposing the suspected informant publicly. In one California case, CAIR held a press conference to elicit information about the identity of an FBI informant in an anti-terrorism case.

The End Result Is More Radicalized Locales

To the extent law enforcement must be “empowered” to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods (as it does all literally all other neighborhoods in America), it’s because of the constant effort by CAIR and its allies to disrupt and eliminate counterterrorism efforts. Such disruptions include successfully pressuring the city of New York to abandon a successful New York Police Department intelligence program because it targeted a number of mosques, even though the NYPD was able to demonstrate that the surveillance targets were the focus of legitimate investigations involving criminal and terrorist activity.

CAIR’s end goal isn’t preventing American Molenbeeks but rather creating them.

CAIR doesn’t only oppose U.S. law enforcement patrolling Muslim neighborhoods, but it opposes U.S. law enforcement even knowing where Muslim neighborhoods are, which is why it bitterly fought and successfully killed a Los Angeles Police Department project to map the demographics of Muslim neighborhoods. The LAPD intended to use the project to conduct outreach and better understand community needs, not to profile, but CAIR and its allies nixed the plan anyway.

Ultimately, CAIR’s end goal isn’t preventing American Molenbeeks but rather creating them. Muslim communities alienated from law enforcement and the wider American society, totally reliant on Islamist groups like CAIR for representation, is CAIR’s end goal. That’s why it continually invokes the risible claim that America is “at war with Islam,” and seeks to portray all law enforcement as villains who frame innocent Muslims, rather than trying to protect Americans, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, from the threat of Islamic terrorism.

Stop Whining About Islamophobia And Focus On Jihadis,"Even before ISIS claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack in Brussels that broke early Tuesday morning, folks on Twitter, including members of the leftist media, immediately began offering condolences to Muslims, blaming bigotry, and making other ridiculous apologies.

After San Bernardino, Paris, and now Brussels, to name just a few recent cities attacked by the same global terrorist network that shares one religious identity, it’s intellectually dishonest at best and evil-enabling at worst to focus on Islamophobia rather than examine Islamic jihadism for what it is. By Islamophobia, of course, I mean what the Left means when it essentially accuses people of bigotry for expressing valid concerns about radical Islam.

Concern for perpetrators over victims is a hallmark sign of political correctness gone awry. Nothing demonstrates a person’s allegiances better than seeing for whom they offer condolences in the wake of tragedy. In this case, members of the media and Muslims seem to be more worried people will be afraid of them or mock their belief system than interested in dissecting why and how those who embrace said beliefs continue to terrorize parts of the world (it’s not too difficult a question to answer) and, as importantly, how they can be stopped.

To my Muslim sisters & brothers: I know horrible things will be said about you & Islam today – I am so, so sorry. Please know I stand w you.

There is only one global religion right now that has major sects teaching that eternal bliss will come to those who carry out acts of terrorism. That’s Islam. This doesn’t mean every Muslim is a violent person or is actively planning to commit acts of terrorism, and no one is accusing all Muslims of this. However, when’s the last time an ISIS member was not a self-described Muslim? Indeed, “ISIS supporters cheered the attacks as stalwart expressions of the noble teachings of Islam.”

Ben Shapiro’s classic video neatly explains why radicalism is not a tiny minority of Islam. These poll findings persist, and are a serious, credible reason it is fair to ask the Muslim community to deal with its obvious internal problems that consistently lead to the reprehensible mass murder of innocent people.



This is a matter of emphasis. The message the Muslim world does not need to hear right now is “Please forgive us because our existence makes your religious brothers and sisters so angry that they keep mass murdering us,” but “Deal with your violence problem or we’ll do it for you.”

Things that ""radicalize"" Muslims: – YouTube videos

– Cartoons

– Hashtags

– Climate Change Strangely never on the list: – Islam



— Countermoonbat (@CounterMoonbat) March 22, 2016



As Don Hodges said in The Telegraph following the Paris attacks: “There is a link between Islam and terror. That is an indisputable fact. Those carrying out the Paris attacks claimed to be doing so in the name of the Islamic faith. All the attackers self-identified as Muslims. Their statements made clear that – perverse though their interpretation of it may be – Islam was their ideological inspiration.”

An ISIS supporter posted on Twitter: “With the permission of God, the lions came to take revenge for the killing of Muslims in Syria and Iraq.” Another declared: “#Brussels, if you continue your war against the religion of Allah then this is our response.” Another shared a graphic image that allegedly showed a man who was wounded, and declared: “Allahu Akbar, #Belgium_is_on_fire_from_explosives.” (These accounts have since been suspended.)

How many more innocent people must die around the world before we care more about security than political correctness? How much more must we eagerly placate overblown concerns of Islamophobia before we address the clear and present danger of Islamic jihadists? You know what will really reduce Islamophobia? Stopping Islamic terrorism. People react strongly against Muslims in the wake of terror like this because Muslims are the ones committing global terrorist attacks. If more Muslims publicly denounced terrorism and demanded increased cooperation with law enforcement within their communities like Christians and pro-lifers do in analogous circumstances, people would treat Muslims more like they do Christians and pro-lifers — which is to say, not with generalized suspicion and fear.

It’s time we stopped worrying after every terrorist attack if Muslims will get their feelings hurt, and started discussing the radical jihadists systematically attempting to destroy the way we live and murdering people we love—and the means by which we will protect ourselves from this dangerous doctrine.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/03/23/stop-whining-about-islamophobia-and-start-focusing-on-islamic-jihadis/,2016-03-23
Ted Cruz Is Right About Policing Muslim Neighborhoods,"Yesterday, in the wake of the horrific Islamic terrorist attack on Brussels, Ted Cruz said we must ignore political correctness and “empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslims neighborhoods before they become radicalized.” As has often been the case this election cycle, Cruz’s measured and rational words have been twisted into some kind of fascistic call for rounding up Muslims. Nothing could be farther from the truth.

Later in the day Cruz clarified his comments, citing the example of the New York City Police Department’s (NYPD’s) anti-terrorism efforts under former mayor Michael Bloomberg. But even this clarification was misunderstood by those convinced Cruz is unhinged. Vox’s Matthew Yglesias thought Cruz was talking about “Stop, question and frisk.”



As it turns out, Cruz was referring to a successful counter-terrorism program that was undermined by liberal journalists and abandoned, leaving the city and the country less safe. In 2012 the Associated Press won a Pulitzer Prize for its reporting on the NYPD’s counter-terrorism efforts. By their account, a frightening malfeasance of spying and violation of rights was at the heart of the program. But in fact, the much-needed work of the NYPD was not only legal, it was also successful.

In a 2012 article for Commentary magazine, Mitchell D. Silber takes on the AP’s criticism with an astounding point-by-point admonishment of their take. The entire article is well worth revisiting, especially in light of the recent attacks in Paris and Brussels, but here a few key points.

Let’s Count the Ways this Program Protected Innocents

On criticisms that the NYPD’s Demographics Unit was violating the rights of Muslims, Silber counters: “Plainclothes officers of the Demographics Unit were deployed for this mission. They went into neighborhoods that had heavy concentrations of populations from the ‘countries of interest’ and walked around, purchased a cup of tea or coffee, had lunch and observed the individuals in the public establishments they entered. This is an important point: Only public locations were visited. Doing so was perfectly within the purview of the NYPD.”

Critics of the program object to police being in public places, observing public situations.

Let’s understand this clearly. Critics of the program, apparently including the Pulitzer committee, object to police being in public places, observing public situations. Where are they supposed to be? In some kind of game show silent tank? Unable to deal with crime or acts of war until they have already occurred? This is madness. It’s not a game show; it doesn’t have to be fair.

On criticisms that the NYPD had no real results to show for its program: “the Demographics Unit was critical in identifying the Islamic Books and Tapes bookstore in Brooklyn as a venue for radicalization. Information the unit collected about the store provided a predicate for an investigation that thwarted a 2004 plot against the Herald Square subway station. The unit also played a role in forming the initiation of an investigation that led to the 2008 identification ofAbdel Hameed Shehadeh, a New Yorker who was arrested and is currently facing federal charges for allegedly lying about his plans to travel to Afghanistan in order to kill U.S. servicemen.”

But hey, that’s only two examples. I’m a New Yorker, so now and then I find myself at the Herald Square subway station. I’d prefer that the NYPD pursue relevant information regarding terrorist attacks there before I take my kid to see Santa at Macy’s. This is just common sense—a quality that has been lost in the quantity of big talk that has distracted us so completely.

I’d prefer that the NYPD pursue relevant information regarding terrorist attacks before I take my kid to see Santa at Macy’s.

On the need for police to predict: “By portraying the NYPD efforts as rogue operations, the AP and the Pulitzer committee are seeking to slacken attempts inside the United States to stop terrorist plots before they happen. Letting these false and misleading stories alter local counterterrorism work would be catastrophic. It has taken many hard years to craft the effective anti-terrorism policies that serve us so well today.”

This is frankly an area where Bernie Sanders socialists and Gary Johnson libertarians find some common ground in opposition. And I dig it; law enforcement predicting complicity seems to run counter to every American ideal of jurisprudence.

But in predicting, or anticipating, potentially catastrophic actions by terrorists, law enforcement is playing defense, not offense. These methods aren’t new. They were used to take down the Mafia. But in 1980, nobody in the liberal press was insisting that if you are investigating the Mafia you need just as many cameras in Bed Stuy and the Upper East Side as in Little Italy and Bensonhurst. You got to go where the game is.

Stop with the Double Standards

If Cruz deserves any criticism here, it is for invoking the idea of political correctness in a nuanced approach to anti-terrorism. PC has become a linguistic dead wood. This term conflates legitimate concerns about surveillance and civil liberties with the cultural appropriation of taco night, and has probably outlived its usefulness. But in as much as political correctness suggests that legal measures must not be taken if they insult anyone’s sensibilities, then Cruz has a point.

In as much as political correctness suggests that legal measures must not be taken if they insult anyone’s sensibilities, Cruz has a point.

Perhaps the most telling aspect of this scrutiny into Cruz’s sober and reasonable opinion is the scrutiny himself. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders gaffe at will. Donald Trump takes three positions contradicting each other in a news cycle and the bobble heads keep bobbling. But Cruz is subjected to a soul-searching deep dive every time he puts on his boots. It’s like he’s the presidential candidate defending his PhD dissertation.

The tragedies in Paris and Brussels show us that we need more, not less of former NYPD commissioner Ray Kelley’s approach to counter-terrorism. Cruz is right to cite his example. Honestly, folks, that’s all he was saying. He wasn’t calling for balaclava-bearing Special Ops to target shop owners in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. He was calling for a return to a policy that recognizes the unique challenge terrorism presents.

Sometimes Cruz reminds me of Jessica Rabbit: He’s not bad, he’s just drawn that way. His look, his style, his place in recent political history all paint him easily as the villain. But there are two kinds of villains. There are the ones who are irredeemable and vanquished, and the ones who learn great lessons and go on to lead. On the issue of police and counter-terrorism, Cruz is leading. And we would be wise to follow.

What World War II Can Teach Us About Islamic Terror,"On March 18, international counterterror authorities celebrated the capture of Salah Abdeslam, the ISIS-linked Belgium national heavily responsible for last year’s Islamic terror attacks in Paris. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel awoke Tuesday morning to find ISIS had rocked Brussels again. Two explosions at the Brussels airport and a third at the city’s train station killed 34 people and injured hundreds.

The escalating acts of Islamic terrorism in the last six months—with multiple attacks on Paris, attacks in Brussels, and even the far-reaching relatively unprecedented domestic attack in San Bernardino, California—show the deep-rooted hold of the greatest generational challenge of our time: radical Islam. ISIS has already devastated a Muslim population in the Middle East. Now, the most grotesque manifestation of radical Islam to date has its eyes deadlocked on the West.

In the two and a half years since the Obama administration began countering ISIS, details on how to counter the bloodthirsty group are still vague at best, and further complicated by the mass exodus of Muslim refugees pouring into Europe. In this country, Obama’s foreign policy has excelled in pressing our government and media elites to deflect a real conversation about jihadist violence to emphasize a fictional narrative full of politically correct shibboleths, from non-existent “Islamophobic” backlashes to a context-less understanding of the Crusades.

Meanwhile, European leaders try their best to ignore the consequences of decades of apologetic politics, including the backlash from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s recent open-door policy that accepted 1 million refugees, no questions asked. In a twenty-first-century world softened through pseudo-intellectualism, the most devastating enemy since Nazi Germany has left global leadership confused and overwhelmed.

Yet ours is not an impossible task. We can rely on the past as a guide through this defining moment in history. Although it was aimed at domestic policy, when President Franklin Roosevelt outlined his four freedoms in January 1941, he was making an equally strong case against the totalitarianisms that were on the march across the world—totalitarian regimes the United States would be facing before the bloody conclusion of that year. He outlined freedom of speech, the freedom of worship, the freedom from want, and the freedom from fear as symbolic aims that would come to chart America’s course through World War II.

America knew what it stood for then; the same can’t be said in today’s muddled “War on Terror.” But rather than caricaturizing everyone we don’t agree with as a Nazi, the default social stigma of the hour, we can see how Allied powers worked with language, ideology, alliances, and geography to counter Axis powers, and we can weaponize these tools to defeat an enemy more dangerous than Nazi Germany.

Reclaim the Power of Clear Language

World War II gave us clear definitions that distinguished Allied forces from the nations that fell under Axis powers. Americans understood the harsh judgments embedded in shorthand of Vichy France and Norway under Quisling. Today, we lack clear boundaries. We’re confounded by multiple extremist groups, Islamist organizations, crumbling nation-states in the Middle East, Arab lobbies, and a host of other players who are not easily recognized. America is also grappling with a politically correct environment stemming from a desire to elevate dialogue in pursuit of higher ideals.

Naming the problem is the single most important step in psychological power over radical Islam.

Yet the highest ideal today is no different from the highest ideal over 70 years ago: freedom. Securing that freedom requires every man, woman, child, and elected leader once again unite against a common enemy. To do this, we absolutely must be comfortable with naming the enemy: radical Islam.

Naming a thing is an incredibly powerful act that grants dominion. Whether it’s the naming of animals in the biblical book of Genesis, the power that comes with knowledge of a name in the Old Testament, or even awareness of a thing through knowing its name, identification is instrumental to understanding. Naming the problem is the single most important step in psychological power over radical Islam. It’s also key to driving policy-based solutions.

Being able to say “Islamic extremism” or “radical Islam” or “jihad” without fear of backlash is what it’s going to take to get America on the same page. Being on the same page means recognizing that Islam birthed this “radical” interpretation of faith more than 1,400 years ago, and stands today as the ultimate threat to a free world—greater than any threat posed by a fleeting moment in time that gave rise to Adolf Hitler. We didn’t hesitate to call a thing by its name 70 years ago, and we cannot hesitate now.

As a society, this is going to require a hard psychological reset that wipes out political correctness. A crippling PC culture devastates a civilization’s ability to move forward. If we’re going to move forward in this war on terror, then we also need to fall into ranks and recognize we’re dealing with more than just terror.

Combat the Ideology Head-On

While the Third Reich was a politically driven machine that relied on belief in National Socialism, it’s well known that Adolf Hitler was also heavily influenced by the occult. Whether the war is seen through Hitler’s occultist motivations or in the more common thread of a totalitarian ideology, the fact is that Allied forces fully accepted they were battling an ideology that believed in a greater force.

Allied forces fully accepted they were battling an ideology that believed in a greater force.

Yet very few people today can engage in a conversation about the ideological motivations of jihadis, choosing instead to pin the blame on “extreme interpretations of scripture,” economic devastation, or retaliation against Western foreign policy. While any of these three are factors, the driver today is no different than it was over two generations ago. As before, it comes down to belief systems.

But twenty-first-century societies have a hard time accepting religious ideology as a driver in a larger war due to a growing displacement from faith and religion. In the West, there’s a sense of estrangement that lingers in the air; purpose and meaning are lost when everything is secured through the push of a button. Our relationships are transactional, and the only god most of us worship is at the other end of a selfie stick. So it becomes difficult to understand how jihadis and Islamists could have enough belief in an ideology to the point of self-sacrifice.

Meanwhile, the label “Nazi” is freely pressed upon conservative viewpoints, while failing to see how real extremism in the form of radical Islam desires to completely obliterate any oppositional view. So while we’re squabbling over who is the most unfair, radical Islam is looking to destroy us all equally.

The only real and permanent solution is rising to meet an ideology with an even more powerful ideology.

This is still a stretch of the imagination for those who cannot see how modern history’s most notorious villain, Adolf Hitler, is anything like the self-appointed caliphate of ISIS. William L. Shirer in “Rise and Fall of the Third Reich” shows us how: “[Hitler] was twenty-four and to everyone except himself he must have seemed a total failure. He had not become a painter, nor an architect. He had become nothing, so far as anyone could see, but a vagabond – an eccentric, bookish one, to be sure. He had no friends, no family, no job, no home. He had, however, one thing: an unquenchable confidence in himself and a deep, burning sense of mission.”

This is the same conviction found in the innumerable thousands of Muslim extremists who hold the same deep, burning sense of mission, and among Islamists who are aligned in radical philosophy with their jihadi counterparts. At the center of our generational struggle, we have a faith-driven ideology surfacing from the darkest hour in Islam, one that has branded its followers with a sense of infallible destiny. The only real and permanent solution is rising to meet an ideology with an even more powerful ideology, within and outside of Islam.

Make Alliances with Moderate Islam

In recent months, France and Belgium were united in their common cause to apprehend terrorists behind the Paris attacks. Belgium is also part of an international coalition against the Islamic State. In fact, in response to every attack against a Western state, the whole free world comes together in a show of empathy.

There is no central alliance created to tackling the root cause of this ideological problem.

Leaders promise action, national monuments light up, Facebook default pictures change to flags and peace signs, and hashtags and drawings fill social media. And nothing changes beyond having pacified a momentary sense of duty. Nothing changes because we haven’t named the problem; we still deny an ideological war; and we haven’t formed strategic and necessary alliances.

In WWII, a collection of nations came together committed to thwarting the spread of Nazism. Today, we have countries that are banding together, even working together to thwart terrorism—but there is no central alliance created to tackling the root cause of this ideological problem. Quite ironically, some of us are sitting across the table from the enemy.

The War on Terror launched on October 7, 2001, directing its first strike against the Taliban in Afghanistan. Nearly 16 years later, the United States is now negotiating with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda is the lesser evil compared to the new strain of religious extremism in ISIS. Alliances are clearly blurred, but we’re losing the war because we’re engaged in the wrong kind of alliances.

The right kind of alliances look to history first. Islamic fanaticism was kept at bay when Islam’s rational thinkers, the Mu’tazilites, had total political support. Sufi Muslims, Islam’s mystical branch, are also historically powerful players in moderating the field. Newer alliances include modern-day outliers including Muslim reformists and futurists.

This is where we take a page from history and look to see who holds the same views as us, building from it a hybrid new allied force that goes beyond traditional powers. A problem born of faith needs first and foremost people of the faith. Secondly, it needs individuals who can understand that there won’t be a heroic landing on the coast of Normandy. Our D-Day is at least a generation away.

Recognize a Scattered Geographic Playing Field

Wars in the last century were geographically recognizable. Today, no such clarity exists. Paris attacker Salah Abdeslam is a Belgian-born French citizen of Moroccan ancestry. At least one of the terrorists killed in the Paris attacks was suspected to be a refugee of unknown origin; it would be near-impossible and highly-resource intensive to verify passport documents. The San Bernardino shooters were self-radicalized Pakistanis. Last week, a New York pizzeria owner and a naturalized U.S. citizen from Yemen was sentenced for recruiting for the Islamic State.

It is ultimately a war of ideas and the battlefield is the mind.

Today’s enemies don’t wear a uniform. They don’t have distinguishable accents or a unified language. They don’t have the same country of origin. In fact, there is nothing that unifies them beyond radical Islamic ideology.

This means the battle isn’t just an issue with ISIS, which has become the predominant focus of most leaders and public opinion. Radical Islamic terrorism isn’t going to end with taking the fight over there; there is no “over there,” or playing whack-a-mole, a fact that Brussels has already conceded to, admitting it is being challenged in tracking radicals. The war is taking place multiple fronts and in several forms. It is ultimately a war of ideas and the battlefield is the mind.

Winning this war is going to take leadership that can recognize and advocate for the four frames: language, ideology, alliances, and geography. We’re going to need leaders who can bring together a team of outliers who are unafraid of being disliked, because the choices that need to be made are going to be unfavorable—and we need the same caliber of character with iron resolve as in generations past.

Europe Needs To Get Serious About Radical Islam,"The latest news out of Brussels shows that Europe is not prepared to deal with radical Islam in its cities or ISIS cells across the continent. It also shows that to stop radical Islamic terrorism, Europeans will have to confront the contradictions at the heart of the European project.

The reported failures of Belgium’s intelligence agencies to date have been appalling. But given the country’s byzantine legal system and lax security, they have hardly been surprising. The latest news, however, is shocking. It appears the Brussels attacks might have been carried out by the same ISIS cell that struck Paris in November.

A Belgian judge in charge of the investigation into the Paris attacks issued an arrest warrant in December for Khalid el-Bakraoui, who blew himself up at a subway station near EU headquarters on Tuesday. Another man, Najim Laachraoui, may have built the explosive vests used last year in Paris. He was the second man who blew himself up Tuesday at the Brussels airport.

This news comes with the revelation that el-Bakraoui’s brother, Ibrahim, who also blew himself up at the airport, was detained in Turkey last summer and deported to the Netherlands with a warning to Belgian officials that he was a foreign terrorist fighter. Belgium did nothing, and allowed him back into the country. On Thursday, Koen Geens, Belgium’s justice minister, told reporters he had no idea that el-Bakraoui had been deported by Turkey.

European Security Measures Are Inadequate

The incompetence of Belgian officialdom would be comical if it hadn’t turned out to be so deadly. It’s not like they didn’t have time to put security measures in place. Days after the Paris attacks in November, the government announced 18 counterterrorism measures to improve security, like the ability to tap the phones of radical imams or allow 24-hour house searches in terrorism investigations. (One of the reasons authorities believe Salah Abdeslam, one of the suspected Paris attackers, slipped through a security net is because Belgian law prohibits house searches between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. He hid in Brussels for four months before he was caught last week.)

If a single ISIS cell in Belgium can pull off attacks in Paris and Brussels, imagine what hundreds of cells across the continent could do.

But even if the measures pass it’s doubtful any of it will go far enough. European countries like Belgium will have to change how they think about isolated Muslim communities—and how they think about European society at large. That appears to be the one thing they aren’t prepared to do.

Johan Verbeke, Belgium’s ambassador to the United States, on Thursday told NPR that Belgium is “an extremely open country” that will not “close its windows to the world because it’s not in our mindset. We live as world citizens and we are not going to change our lives because a bunch of terrorists are making our life difficult.”

That’s a fine sentiment, but it doesn’t do much for the people killed in Tuesday’s attacks, or the Paris attacks, or their families, or the people who will die in future attacks. Europe now faces a reckoning. Some 5,000 EU citizens have traveled to Syria to join ISIS. When ISIS is eventually deprived of territory, it will change its tactics.

Since ISIS has already shown that targeting Europe is a strategic priority, you can imagine what it might do in response to territorial losses in Syria and Iraq: send European fighters home to wage jihad in Europe. Some reports indicate hundreds have already come back. If a single ISIS cell in Belgium can pull off attacks in Paris and Brussels, imagine what hundreds of cells across the continent could do.

Some 5,000 EU citizens have traveled to Syria to join ISIS. When ISIS is eventually deprived of territory, it will change its tactics.

In the near-term, European authorities must implement the kinds of old-school police measures adopted by the New York City Police Department in 2003, like surveillance and undercover agents. Those methods might be hard for some Americans to stomach, as Sen Ted Cruz found out this week when he called for the need to “empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslims neighborhoods before they become radicalized.”

But, as David Marcus noted, NYPD’s methods were both legal and successful—and in fact they were the same tactics used to take down the Mafia in the 1970s and ‘80s. That’s the approach European countries will have to take if they want to stop terror attacks in the coming years. They’ll need Muslim Donnie Brascos.

Is the European Union a State, Or Not?

But that won’t be enough. In the long term, European leaders will have to admit not only the scale of the threat they face, but that they themselves created the threat by turning a blind eye to radical Islam lurking in unassimilated Muslim neighborhoods.

Europe faces not just the threat of terrorism, but a kind of simmering insurgency.

Since the end of the Cold War, European leaders have convinced themselves that there’s no need to invest in security because all major world conflicts have been resolved. They are done with history, all that remains is to perfect the welfare state. The truth is that Europe faces not just the threat of terrorism, but a kind of simmering insurgency. And there are no easy, or perhaps even tolerable, solutions.

One way or another, Europe will have to confront a question it has been avoiding for more than a generation: is the EU a state, or not? If so, it must begin acting like one, with all the attendant coordination of security services and immigration policies you would expect from a large state. If not, then individual European countries will have to figure out how to deal with what amounts to radical Islamic insurgencies in their cities.

That is something to fear, and not just because of terrorism itself. Europe has a long and bloody history of putting down insurgencies, and it would be a grave mistake for Europe’s leaders to assume they couldn’t repeat that past.

How Brussels Will Affect The U.S. Presidential Race,"On Tuesday morning, explosions at the Zaventem airport and the Maelbeek metro station in Brussels, Belgium, killed more than 30 people and wounded more than 200 more. Hours later, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks, which marked the group’s second massive-scale terrorist offensive since last November’s attacks in Paris, France.

What impact can we expect the Brussels attacks to have on our presidential primaries? To investigate, let’s first consider how similar attacks in Paris affected the race late last year.

This first chart compares polling done prior to Paris with polling done after Paris. Specifically, it looks at pollsters who conducted polls both before and after, but only within a 30-day period in either direction.

Every single comparison showed at least a five-point bump for Donald Trump, with four of the six pollsters profiled registering a bump in double-digit territory. That’s a remarkable turnaround. But within a 30-day period there were more than just six polls conducted. The above chart looks at six in order to give a sampling. Let’s look at them all.

The Paris attacks, which took place on November 13, represented a pivotal event for Trump, enabling him to reclaim the polling lead he enjoyed prior to Ben Carson’s surge in mid-to-late October. We see a clear upswing for Trump post-Paris. In the above chart, you can hover over each data point to see Trump’s lead (or deficit) in each individual poll, the whole series of which are arranged chronologically. I look at 11 polls done in the 30 days prior to Paris, and 11 polls done in the 30 days after. The results show that Paris correlated with a significant positive effect for Trump’s candidacy.

The Attacks Also Shifted the Debates

In addition to polling, we can take a look at what preoccupied the Republican Party before and after Paris by tallying up the amount of times “ISIS,” “Islam” (and its cognates), and “terror” (and its cognates) were uttered in the Republican debates. What do we find?

In the October and November debates, which took place prior to Paris, these issues were not front and center; in the December debate, they most certainly were. In the above graph, you can click on each term to see how many times it was uttered in each of the three debates (the October debate had zero mentions of the latter two terms).

The October 28 debate was the infamous CNBC debacle, and the three terms received three measly mentions, combined. The November debate, which took place just three days before the Paris attacks, contained 20 total mentions. Admittedly, the November debate was focused on economic questions; after all, it was hosted by Fox Business News in combination with The Wall Street Journal.

Yet both of these outlets regularly provide commentary on foreign policy, so it’s not as if the low mentions can be entirely explained by considering the night’s overriding focus. The December debate, which took place a month after Paris and focused on foreign policy, produced 232 mentions of these terms. It’s clear that Paris intensified interest in discussing Islamic terrorism, at least on the Republican side.

We can also see that the Google search interest for these terms was greatest around the middle of November, in the immediate aftermath of the Paris attacks. The following graph filters out any searches not done on American soil.



Effects on Trump Versus Carson and Cruz

Although this is hardly surprising, I include it in order to investigate what about Trump caused his numbers to go up in response to Paris. Perhaps Trump’s rise had less to do with Trump and more to do with who his chief opponent was at the time: Carson. Indeed, around that time reports had surfaced about Carson’s ongoing struggles with grasping the intricacies of American foreign policy concerns. His own foreign policy advisors were publicly announcing Carson’s deficiencies in this area.

There’s no evidence that in the aftermath of the Brussels attacks, Ted Cruz, who is currently Trump’s biggest rival, will see his numbers go down the way Carson’s did back in November. When we look at exit polling data from CNN, it shows voters who prioritize “terrorism” as the most important issue in this election rate Cruz very highly.

In my five-state sample, I make sure to include the first three contests in order to not skew the results against Carson, who after February was even less competitive than he was initially. Cruz does better than Trump in Iowa, gets blown out in New Hampshire, stays competitive in South Carolina, matches Trump in Oklahoma, and stays right on his trail in Illinois. The point isn’t necessarily to show how Carson’s numbers are low in comparison to Cruz’s, but to show how Cruz is very competitive with Trump on the issue of being tough on terrorism, according to the voters.

Extreme Responses to Extreme Actions Seem to Work

But let’s assume that Trump’s November rise wasn’t just due to an underwhelming rival in Carson but also due to Trump’s own abilities to generate support as a strong leader. Yet it’s not clear that the Paris event itself, as opposed to related but separate concerns that emerged out of it, was responsible for Trump’s reemergence as the clear leader in the national polls.

It’s likely that these positions played a major role in Trump solidifying his status as GOP front-runner.

Consider that Trump used the Paris attacks to introduce a series of escalating anti-immigration ideas, beginning with a call to ban Syrian refugees from entering the country (November 17), a promise to monitor mosques using law enforcement surveillance and to re-implement waterboarding as an interrogation tactic (November 22), and finally to ban all Muslims from entering the country (December 8). It’s likely that these positions played a major role in Trump solidifying his status as GOP front-runner.

The Paris attacks gave him the opportunity to apply his anti-immigrant platform, and he did, which means the attacks themselves weren’t responsible for his rise, strictly speaking. This is a subtle but important consideration, since it suggests he may not see a bump in response to the Brussels attacks unless he finds a way to harness them into an inspiring (well, inspiring to fearful voters) anti-immigrant message.

The problem is that while in November the Syrian refugee crisis was a prominent news item, there is nothing of comparative newsworthiness going on today in that same category. The question of whether to embrace Syrian refugees has largely receded from the current news cycle. This means whatever Trump says in response to Brussels might come across as contrived, or at any rate less inspirational to some Republican voters, than what he said late last year proved to be.

In Destabilizing Times, People Seek Leaders

Of course, it’s hard to use the data we have to confidently predict what will occur going forward. This is not due to a deficiency in the data, but rather due to the nature of the 2016 elections. A 2001-2004 study by the sociologist Robb Willer found that government-issued terror warnings generated a bump in support for the president. Willer’s conclusion is that “fear of external attacks leads to increased support for standing leaders.” Yet the 2016 race doesn’t have an incumbent running.

What makes all of this hard to apply to this year’s race is that it’s unclear what sort of leadership voters will prefer.

In a 2009 study, political scientists Jennifer L. Merolla and Elizabeth J. Zechmeister found that terror threats cause voters to weight leadership into their decision more heavily than they would during “good times,” defined as a period characterizable by “positive indicators about the economy, health, and the environment.” Terror can even destabilize, the same researchers find in a later study, the stability of democracy within a regime and can erode confidence in democratic norms among a citizenry.

But what makes all of this hard to apply to this year’s race is that it’s unclear what sort of leadership voters will prefer: Trump’s corporate leadership combined with a rhetorical strategy that eschews political correctness and evokes nationalistic fervor? Or Hillary Clinton’s executive leadership combined with a rhetorical strategy aimed at avoiding inflaming hostilities between us and the broader Muslim world? Or can Cruz, whose numbers on terrorism are solid, emerge to rally the “strong leadership” vote then bury Clinton with her record of foreign policy missteps?

We will have to wait to find out.

"On Easter, Terrorists Bomb Christian Children In Pakistan","Yesterday, as America’s Christians went to church and sat down with family and friends to celebrate Christ’s defeat of death, tragedy struck our community in Pakistan. Islamic terrorists detonated a bomb at an amusement park in Lahore that killed 70 people and injured more than 300. According to a Pakistani Taliban spokesperson, they “claim responsibility for the attack on Christians as they were celebrating Easter.”

Many of the dead are women and children guilty of nothing more than sharing a faith with so many of us in the United States. But while Americans mourn, fear, and post on social media about attacks in Paris and Brussels, attacks like yesterday’s fly under the radar. They are treated as the natural course of things in territories on fire.

But they are not. They are a careful and constructed attack on Christianity. As such, they are a direct attack on us all.

There But for The Grace of God

Most Christians in the United States are shy about public professions of faith. For every follower of Christ who vocally fights for “Merry Christmas” over “Happy Holidays,” dozens simply keep their head down and practice their religion. This is understandable. Christianity, although by no means the official religion of the United States, has been the dominant religious force throughout its history. It is a good thing America’s Christians are sensitive to that dominant status.

But it is equally important for us to understand that this status is not universal. There are places in the world, including Lahore, where being a Christian can and does get people killed. While they might not look like us or talk like us, as Jesus taught us, they are us. He taught us that what we do unto the least of his, we do unto him.

I’m not sure if Pakistani Christians are the least of his, but frankly they risk a lot more in his name than we do. Ether way, how we treat them and react to their persecution is a test.

Deliver Us from Evil

In our modern English translation of the Lord’s Prayer, we pray that our Father not “lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” In the original Greek, the word we translate as temptation has a broader meaning. It also means a “test.” We are asking the Lord not to test us. But as with the other things asked of God in this prayer—our daily bread, forgiveness of trespasses, the ability to forgive others—we don’t always get what we ask for.

Evil is not part of Christ. It is part of us.

We all pray that abominations like the horrific attack on innocents yesterday may never happen. We pray we may not be tested by such horrors. But just as Christ by himself cannot protect us from these tests, he cannot on his own deliver us from evil. Evil is not part of him. It is part of us. Although we seek deliverance from it through him, it is we who must make the journey through.

These are the times when stark images of violence against Christians, although painful, help us. They shake us out of our relativistic musings into the stark revelation that there is evil. We think of our own children, and tremble at the notion that some want to kill them because we teach them to accept Jesus.

We Can Do More for Oppressed Christians

As Bill McMorris at the Washington Free Beacon pointed out, only 1.5 percent of the 2,000 Syrian refugees allowed into the United States as of November of last year were Christian. Syria’s population is 10 percent Christian, almost all of whom exist under dire threat.

Make no mistake: white Christian privilege does not extend to Syria or Pakistan.

Just as many American Christians are shy about outward displays of faith, many are worried about apparent preferential treatment for Christians. As McMorris shows, in this case such fears are unfounded and dangerous. Make no mistake: white Christian privilege does not extend to Syria or Pakistan.

Awkward though it may feel from our cozy confines, we must face and defeat the aggressive destruction of Christian communities around the world. This is a nuanced situation. We know the vast majority of Muslims would never commit such an act, and do not believe their religion condones such acts.

Atheist activists are wont to remind us of brutal passages in our own Old Testament, and even in the New Testament. So we understand the subtleties at work, and we can face this threat without painting with too broad a brush.

But we must face this concern. We must accept this test. Through our churches, our petitions to our government, and even our votes, we must insist that the persecution of Christians be treated as a unique and deadly phenomenon.

The Complexity of Tribalism

Attacks on white Europeans dominate our headlines for very tribal reasons. We see ourselves more closely resembled in their faces. Just as pretty white women who go missing get much more coverage than minority kidnapping victims at home, pretty Parisians that terrorists kill get more attention than murdered exotic brown people do. This is true for complicated and discomfiting reasons that we must struggle with and better understand.

The more deeply and broadly we consider ourselves, the bigger the tent of our empathy and spirit of brotherhood becomes.

One step in such understanding is to remember that most of the world’s Christians do not look alike. If Europe, through its cultural and class ties, resembles us, so do the countless third-world Christian communities around the globe. This latter resemblance is very deep. It is a shared understanding of right of wrong. It is a commitment to live by a set of moral standards that apply equally, to everyone, and which we ourselves did not create.

We are tribal, but we are of many tribes. It is only when we define ourselves in superficial ways that we find a primary commonality based on superficial similarities. The more deeply and broadly we consider ourselves, the bigger the tent of our empathy and spirit of brotherhood becomes. Eventually it can contain almost everyone as a member of our tribe. Almost.

Call Evil by Its Name

Christian charity may demand that we pray for the soul of a person who straps a bomb on himself and walks into an amusement park to kill and maim children. But the Christian faith also demands that we recognize the existence of evil. The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia drew mocking scorn from many when he said he believed in the devil — not as an abstraction, but as a figure in the universe as distinct as God.

Evil is a more difficult enemy than Islam. But it, not the religion of Mohammad, is our true enemy.

Such ideas are not fashionable. Surely attacks like the one in Lahore can be understood, if only we try hard enough to walk a mile in their suicide-bomb vest.

Such actions can and have been understood. They are evil. They are not the tragic result of Donald Rumsfeld’s failed policies, they are not the natural result of centuries of colonialism, they are not the deserved result of a history of Christendom replete with terror and murder. They are simply evil.

Evil is a more difficult enemy than Islam. But it, not the religion of Mohammad, is our true enemy. No walls can stop it. It respects no borders. It resides in all of us. The rejection and suppression of evil is why the religious pray and why the non-religious study. But where and when evil thrives until it twists men into murdering children, we must see it for what it is. We must not be too afraid, in the recognition of our own sins, failings, or privileges to destroy it.

Those of us who celebrated Christ’s resurrection yesterday mourn and pray for the victims of this terrible attack. But we must do more. Even as we feel our culture pulling away from us, becoming less accepting of our beliefs, we must use our freedom to protect Christians everywhere. For, as Christ teaches us, it is in protecting others that we find protection for ourselves.

Obama White House Censors Phrase 'Islamist Terrorism',"President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande met in Washington on Thursday to discuss ways for the two countries to work together to defeat terrorism. But the White House apparently had zero appetite for Hollande’s mention of Islamist terrorism, since it censored the phrase from the official White House video of the meeting posted on the White House website.

Media Research Center, a non-profit media watchdog, was the first to report the White House censorship.

While the official transcript available on the White House web page includes Hollande’s use of the phrase “Islamist terrorism,” the White House video of the remarks muted the audio during that portion of Hollande’s remarks. The audio of the French-to-English interpreter stops right before Hollande characterizes “Islamist terrorism” as the root of terrorism in Syria and Iraq.

“But we’re also well aware that the roots of terrorism, Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq,” Hollande told Obama, according to the transcript of the exchange provided by the White House. “We therefore have to act both in Syria and in Iraq, and this is what we’re doing within the framework of the coalition.”

Watch and listen to the video below, which is available on YouTube through the White House’s official account, and you can hear the audio cut out right before Hollande says “Islamist terrorism”:

Here is the transcript of what Hollande said, with strikethrough notation to show what the White House censored in its video of the exchange between the two presidents:

Europe has been hit more, given that it is also the target of the terrorists and ISIS. We’ve seen it in Paris last year, as well as in Brussels. And together with President Obama, we worked on coordinating further our commitments, our organizations, our services when it comes to fighting against these terrorists. We are also making sure that between Europe and the United States there can be a very high level coordination.



But we’re also well aware that the roots of terrorism, Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq. We therefore have to act both in Syria and in Iraq, and this is what we’re doing within the framework of the coalition. And we note that Daesh is losing ground thanks to the strikes we’ve been able to launch with the coalition. We are continuing to support Iraq. This is also a decision we have taken, supporting the Iraqi government and making sure that they can claim back their entire territory, including Mosul.

In the video, the entire audio of the feed is muted right before Hollande says “Islamist terrorism.” After he says the phrase, the audio returns, but without an English translation. The interpreter’s voice is not restored in the video until 12 seconds later.

Hollande’s use of the phrase “Islamist terrorism” is also censored in the White House’s official MP3 recording of the event.

4 Problems With Obama Censoring ‘Islamist Terrorism’,"It’s no secret that President Obama has refused to use the phrase “Islamist terrorism” to describe Muslim militant groups who do violence in the name of their religion. He took a lot of heat for this linguistic side-stepping during the 2015 summit on “violent extremism” in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks.

This kind of doublespeak refuses to openly acknowledge the Muslim religion, or at least a jihadist interpretation of it, as a motivating factor for terror attacks occurring globally from California and Brussels to Pakistan and Turkey.

But on Thursday, the Obama administration took things one step further. At a meeting between President Obama and French President François Hollande, the latter noted, unremarkably, that the roots of Islamist terrorism are in Syria and Iraq. The official White House video, however, cuts out Hollande’s voice and that of his interpreter when he says “Islamist terrorism” and references a coalition to act in the region.



There are four important things to take away from this brazen attempt to shelter Americans from associating Islam with violence and terrorism.

1. Censorship Is a Slippery Slope

Yes, we’ve seen Obama avoid using the phrase “Islamist terrorism” before, but this goes way beyond any previous attempts to skirt the issue with bland references to “violent extremism.” This is an effort to expel the phrase from the conversation—literally. It’s one thing to refuse to acknowledge the threat oneself, but it is quite another to suppress the speech of a foreign head of state. This is full-blown censorship.

This is an effort to expel the phrase from the conversation—literally.

It feels more like a cautionary tale we read in high school—more like Soviet Russia than the United States. It brings to mind the recently lifted three-year ban of YouTube in Pakistan. The ban was put in place purportedly to “protect” Pakistanis from viewing anything insulting about Islam. The real purpose was to shape the way people think. This is how censorship works.

Of course, this was always going to be the logical conclusion of Obama refusing to call Islamist terrorism by its name. It starts innocently enough, by claiming that it’s meant to spare the feelings of the Muslim community. It ends, inevitably, in censorship. Somewhere down the line, there’ll be a push for hate speech laws. This is why intellectual honesty is so important, and intellectual dishonesty so dangerous. It’s a slippery slope.

2. Ignoring Islam Makes Addressing Terrorism Impossible

Obama staunchly rejects that ISIS, al-Qaeda, or any self-professed Islamist group has anything to do with “real” Islam. One reason for this is the lack of imagination to see that these terrorists, and the communities that support them, actually believe what they’re saying.

Never mind what they themselves say motivates them to commit violence.

It’s assumed that we’ve all “gotten past” religion and that no one could really believe that stuff anymore—we all know now that it’s just nonsense. Rather, these jihadists must be motivated by economic uncertainty, unfair treatment by non-Muslims, and all-around disaffection and cultural disenfranchisement. Never mind what they themselves say motivates them to commit violence.

Obama also seems to reject what most Muslims accept—that there are multiple interpretations of Islam. He treats the religion as a monolithic entity, as though there is only one “true” Islam and the rest are just fringe radicals. He calls them a “tiny faction” within Islam. This ignores the reality that many Muslims in the Middle East adhere to what Obama would call “extreme” interpretations of Islam.

Take Egypt as an example, where 74 percent of Muslims want Sharia law enforced, and of those, more than 80 percent approve of stoning for adultery and the death penalty for leaving Islam. That’s around 47,360,000 people who would stone an adulterer to death in Egypt alone. This is more than a fringe movement.

Obama’s naïveté about the connection between Islam and terrorism is dangerous because we can’t fight an enemy that we won’t even acknowledge.

3. People Notice Obama Doesn’t Take Terrorism Seriously Enough

Censoring a foreign leader’s use of the phrase “Islamist terrorism” is yet more proof that our president is not taking the threat of ISIS seriously enough (see his trip to Cuba during the Brussels attack). He’s much more concerned with being in ideological lock-step with political correctness than he is with acknowledging and combatting the global threat of Islamism.

Maybe if our president hadn’t been so unwilling to speak plainly about Islamism, we wouldn’t be seeing such extreme reactions to it.

This isn’t lost on the American people, or our allies. Imagine if President Reagan had been unwilling to utter the word “communism” during the Cold War, instead calling it “extremism.” This would have seriously undermined his efforts and our allies’ confidence in working with us. It also would have terrified the American people, signaling that their commander-in-chief doesn’t understand the fundamental beliefs that motivated our enemies in the Soviet Union.

It’s no surprise therefore, that so many people are flocking to Donald Trump, who projects strength and is willing to say uncomfortable things. Fifty percent of Americans now agree that non-citizen Muslims should be temporarily denied entrance into the United States, and 45 percent approve of waterboarding in the war on terror, both policies Trump has espoused. Maybe if our president hadn’t been so unwilling to speak plainly about Islamism, we wouldn’t be seeing such extreme reactions to it.

4. Obama Holds Low Expectations for Muslims

Obama’s fears of uttering “Islamism” alongside “terrorism” show his low opinion of people in general, non-Muslims and Muslims alike. On the one hand, he seems to view the American people as unhinged bigots, who, if they hear that Islam is associated with terrorism, will attack the nearest Muslim.

He seems to view the American people as unhinged bigots, who, if they hear that Islam is associated with terrorism, will attack the nearest Muslim.

After every Islamist terrorist attack, we are told that anti-Muslim hate crimes are on the rise. Yet the rate of anti-Muslim hate crime is significantly lower than incidences of anti-Semitism in the United States. Obama underestimates the ability of the American people to handle the reality of Islam’s relationship to terrorism. He should have a little more faith.

Obama also has very low expectations for the Muslim community’s ability to react rationally to hearing world leaders point out that ISIS and their ilk are, in fact, Muslim. In his Atlantic interview with Jeffrey Goldberg, Obama says he doesn’t want to scare off “tolerant Muslims” by painting the issue with a broad brush. They, apparently, are too irrational to discern that linking Islamism and terrorism isn’t a de facto war on the imaginary monolithic Islam. He condescendingly treats them like simple-minded children who need to be protected.

In the end, Obama’s tactics didn’t work. In fact, he’s brought more attention to the matter than if he’d just not tampered with the recorded interpretation of Hollande’s remarks in the first place. The more he tip-toes around this issue, the more weight he actually gives to those words. Obama is setting a dangerous precedent of censorship and continuing a reckless pattern of underestimating the threat that Islamism poses. At least the French president seems to take things more seriously.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/04/04/4-things-to-know-about-obama-censoring-the-words-islamist-terrorism/,2016-04-04
The Soft Bigotry Of Jimmy Kimmel’s Low Muslim Expectations,"Between laughs and fluffy, getting-to-know-you questions this past Wednesday, late-night host Jimmy Kimmel challenged presidential candidate Ted Cruz on his articulated policy of “patrolling” Muslim neighborhoods in response to the recent terror attacks in Brussels.

During the talk, Kimmel pushed back against the candidate, arguing:

Don’t you feel that human nature is such that if people who are Americans in a Muslim community – who you might make an argument are more upset about what their brothers in religion are doing – if they feel they’re being singled out and they feel like the police are keeping a special eye on them, that that is going to make them anti-American and then we’ll have an even bigger problem because we won’t have to import terrorism; we’ll be creating them here.

The audience, predictably, burst out in riotous applause, as Kimmel’s assertion reflects the prevailing sentiment of the Left. But as an American and a Muslim, I’m deeply frustrated by the Hollywood host’s statement, which green-lights two very dangerous myths.

Many Muslims Want Terrorist Sects Monitored

Myth 1: “Keeping a special eye on” Muslim communities in response to increased Islamic terrorism will make Muslim-Americans “anti-American.”

While blanket surveillance has proven to be largely ineffective unless it is targeted based on viable intelligence, there are plenty of tangible leads in Muslim communities that—for reasons of simple political correctness—are being ignored. In some cases, law enforcement or intelligence officials face bureaucratic retaliation for pursuing these leads.

Their argument leads one to believe the most authentically ‘Muslim’ one can be is a sharia-supporting Grand Mufti or a Hamas sympathizer.

Yet there are plenty of them, beginning with the network of Islamist-controlled mosques, Islamic centers, and Muslim organizations that have troubling and documented ties to Islamists like the Muslim Brotherhood and its Palestinian offshoot, the terrorist group Hamas. Both the American people and our government broadly agree that, at least, individuals and entities linked to State Department-designated terrorist groups are dangerous—just the kind of thing a responsible government would be “keeping a special eye on.”

In addition, what’s more genuinely “anti-American” than being an Islamist or supporting a genocidal terrorist group? Apologists like Kimmel may mean well, but their argument leads one to believe the most authentically “Muslim” one can be is a sharia-supporting Grand Mufti or a Hamas sympathizer. Needless to say, this is just what Islamist groups in this country want.

Islamists rely on Western tolerance to accommodate all these things no matter how devastating their practice is to the Western culture of individual freedom. It happens when popular media personalities don’t distinguish between hard-core Islamists and secular Muslims; when publications repeatedly pair stories about Muslims with images of gender-apartheid-suffering hijabis; and when the media praises Islamist efforts to promote the most sharia-adherent and extreme Muslim “identity” but doesn’t challenge the theology.

The Soft Bigotry of Low Expectations

Myth 2: Anti-Americanism triggers homegrown radicalization.

They reinforce the stereotype of the aggressive Muslim.

If opposing a government policy leads to increased homegrown terror, then we have a telling problem: the belief that Muslim Americans can be activated to terror for no other reason than a vague sense of perceived oppression.

If “radicalization” occurs that easily, as Kimmel and the audience seem to assume, even liberals believe there is something innately hostile about the Islamic faith. That may seem like a stretch, but when the Left paints Muslims with such broad strokes—implying we’re all just a one offense away from raising our pitchforks in domestic jihad—they reinforce the stereotype of the aggressive Muslim. More than reinforce it, they excuse it.

The question is, how does this “soft bigotry of low expectations” get missed—especially when the American Right is demonized for caricaturizing Muslims?

ISIS Fighters Aren’t the Only Radicals

As a Muslim who has grown up across three continents and in four cultures, I have the unique perspective of both insider and outsider—and essentially outlier. I’ve predicted an American society completely blind-sided by itself. Isolationists at heart, most Americans see radical Islam as a problem central to the Middle East, occasionally splattering onto the West. This sort of categorical approach to the world has made it easy for militant Islam to dominate the headlines while letting graver and more sinuous threats at home go relatively unnoticed because, frankly, there isn’t the expectation of a threat in any other form.

While ISIS has captured the American imagination, we’ve left the back door wide open for Islamist activity.

The problem with the national dialogue, as we see from the Kimmel-Cruz exchange, is that, while there is a hyper focus on kinetic terrorism, that focus is an inch deep. American discourse also takes place in a sequestered environment of privilege, comfort, and relative unawareness of an outside world, especially of how the outside world sees it.

Islam sees itself as essentially superior to Judaism and Christianity. It sees an Eastern history in competition with Western history, running parallel up until our recent and inevitable clash of civilizations. That sense of superiority and divine infallibility has obliterated free thought in the Islamic faith, retarded reform efforts that should have been secured centuries prior, and given rise to both militant and political Islam.

So while ISIS has captured the American imagination, we’ve left the back door wide open for Islamist activity, unable to recognize the diplomatic branch of radical Islam as essentially another form of the same threat. The Left’s fear that Muslim-Americans will be radicalized if challenged isn’t just outlandish, it’s dismissive of the fact that these types of Muslims are already politically and culturally radical.

The Islamist agenda isn’t just politically driven, it’s also culturally driven parasite that relies on its host for survival. Last week, host Jimmy Kimmel and his over-exuberant audience did a fantastic job of scoring a win for radical Islam.

4 Ways Pornography Hurts The Environment And National Security,"ISIS calls on Muslims to draw swords because “the flocks of blind sheep fear losing their animalistic societies and carnal cultures that serve their lusts…” Some say climate change is the greatest threat to national security, but pornography actually poses a serious national security threat.

Pornography is harmful to the environment and a national security risk in four ways: it (1) is an intellectual-environmental hazard; (2) changes our view of sexuality and women; (3) causes selfish, self-absorbed, self-centered (S₃), and narcissistic people; and (4) discriminates against women.

Definitions are important, so the following are the definitions of environment and environmentalism. Oxford Dictionaries defines “environment” as: the surroundings or conditions in which a person, animal, or plant lives or operates. “Environmentalism” is defined by Merriam Webster as: a theory that views environment rather than heredity as the important factor in the development and especially the cultural and intellectual development of an individual or group.

Bernie Sanders said “climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism…[C]ountries all over the world [are] going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops, and you’re going to see all kinds of international conflict.” So, an environmental wasteland of limited resources will trigger terrorism.

“Environment” is not restricted to the natural order, but includes the cultural, intellectual, and spiritual order. If carbon dioxide can cause a climate change in the natural order leading to a wasteland triggering terrorism, pornography can cause a climate change in the intellectual, cultural, and spiritual order leading to corresponding wastelands, also triggering terrorism.

1. Pornography Is an Intellectual Hazard

A German study that investigated the neural correlates associated with frequent—not addictive—viewing of pornography found that watching porn may shrink certain areas of the brain. The study finds that men who watch porn have less gray matter volume, and the area of the brain associated with processing rewards is smaller. Porn affects the neural response in the reward network of the brain, gray matter regions, motivations, and memory receptors by saturating it with dopamine. Dopamine causes the feeling of pleasure.

The brain remembers this pleasure and wants to repeat it. This may lead to watching more pornography. Soon, the brain is accustomed to pleasure and pornography de-synthetizes the brain. It is no long aroused by the same pleasure. This leads some to hardcore porn to experience pleasure again. Additionally, since most porn is viewed on the Internet, Internet addiction “reduces impulse control, decision-making, and the ability to foresee consequences.”

Addiction to pleasure-seeking could lead to porn addition. Porn addiction may cause brain damage.

2. A Cultural Hazard: Porn Changes How We View Sex and Women

A recent study at the University of Amsterdam analyzed 400 of the most popular pornographic videos found on popular online porn sites since 2013. The study found that objectification was depicted more often for women through instrumentality; however, men were more often objectified through dehumanization. Also, men were shown more often as dominant and women submissive. Additionally, there was more gender inequality towards women in amateur porn than in professional porn.

Women view themselves as sexual objects because men view (expect) them to be sexual objects. It’s a cycle.

Most women watch porn because their man wants them to, and men watch porn because it arouses them. Soon, men want to act out what is on screen: “[A] decrease in sexual satisfaction and a tendency to adopt pornographic scripts have been associated with frequent Internet pornography consumption.” This does two things: (1) men view women as sexual objects, reducing the relationship to purely a sexual one, and (2) women consciously or subconsciously view themselves as sexual objects, resulting in low self-esteem. Women view themselves as sexual objects because men view (expect) them to be sexual objects. It’s a cycle.

This cycle affects dating and marriage. Vanity Fair ran an article on how dating (hook-up) apps, like Tinder, permeate our culture. These apps are a result of the porn cycle. They continue the porn perception of a surplus of women to use for sex. When men reduce women to objects to be used as the men please, women’s value is reduced to just that: please men.

So, expectations in all areas of the relationship are that the woman pleases the man. The effect of this changed perspective on human sexuality and objectification of women is that over time the commitment of men to women in the relationship diminishes, leading to infidelity and cheating. “Marriages become unstable. Divorces increase. Men don’t have to commit, so they pursue short-term mating strategy…women are forced to go along with it in order to mate at all.”

3. Porn Leads to Narcissistic Men and Women

Pornography is the epitome of self-satisfaction. The content and the reason to watch it speaks for itself. The more addicted to pornography an individual becomes, the more self-absorbed he or she becomes. The more centered an individual becomes with satisfying personal needs, and the more he or she objectifies human beings, the less he or she is capable of empathy, respect, and charity. While centered on what pleases the self, the self does not care to treat humans with dignity since it puts the needs of the self above others.

4. Pornography Discriminates Against Women

For the following reasons, pornography discriminates against women: (1) reduces women to their sexual organs; (2) depicts women as tools of pleasure similar to objects purchased in stores; (3) some of its content is violent—hitting, spanking, spitting, grabbing, choking, and even raping women; (4) equates consent to use and mistreatment; (5) promotes, institutionalizes, and authorizes dominance and submission; (6) legitimizes and glamorizes humiliation and de-humanization—e.g., the act of ejaculating on a woman like she is worth nothing more than that; (6) falsifies facts that freedom is in being possessed; and (7) violates feministic principles of equality and respect.

Creating self-centered individuals, and discriminating against women are cultural, spiritual, and environmental hazards.

“Men treat women as who they see women as being. Pornography constructs who that is.” Pornography creates a social construct that women are sexual possessions.

Some feminists (sex-positive feminists) argue that pornography is sexual expression and freedom. Sex-positive feminists participate in this discriminatory act by creating a mechanism by which men view women as something to possess. These feminists are either enslaved to their sexual passions or their consent to objectification is rooted in some psychological occurrence, like depression, a past triggering event, or is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Arguably, their consent is under duress because it is in response to the violence of their passions or a psychological response to a past event; or under coercion because of their enslavement to the field of work (the inability to escape), or made while they are under the influence. So, although they argue it is freedom, their consent is not.

Altered societal views on sex and women, creating self-centered individuals, and discriminating against women are cultural, spiritual, and environmental hazards.

Plato said music and literature are education and a moral law. Media affects the environment because it forms minds, shows human behavior, teaches socially acceptable norms, and influences viewpoints. Pornography constructs a society of a false reality while at the same time changing the reality of how we view women, men, and sex. In turn this produces an environmental wasteland. Limited intellectual, cultural, and spiritual resources trigger terrorism since terrorists justify their actions, in part, for the West’s decay in these climates.

The Fight Against Islamism Is The New Cold War,"Even today, with the West and Russia edging closer to outright conflict, there’s a simple nostalgia for the Cold War era, when conflict was easier to visualize and manage than it is now. Instead of today’s hellbroth of terror groups, failed states, and warring militias, we faced a single, unified foe, an iron curtain drawn across the middle of the world to cleanly demarcate where we ended and they began.

2016 is the year—as the truth comes out about how last year’s Paris attacks could have happened—that this strangely comforting Cold War myth should die. As the latest revelations about those attacks confirm, today’s world bears much more of a resemblance to the world of the Cold War than we might wish to think—and, somehow, the West must respond accordingly.

History confirms the comparison. Think back. The geopolitically bipolar structure of the Cold War world was just one feature of the threat matrix the West faced. As conventional armies and nuclear arsenals squared off against one another, seeds of the unconventional warfare that bedevils us today had already begun to sprout. Beyond the third-world proxy conflicts and arms shipments that defined the age, the Cold War saw the beginnings of state-sponsored terrorism and infiltration as we know them today.

This Time, It’s Not Different

Many may want to cling to the “clean” Cold War myth for its own sake. But the myth also shores up the entrancing idea that the matrix of conflict jihadist Islam and its allies pose today does not rise to threat level when militant communism straddled the globe.

Circumstantial evidence has suggested to our impressionable minds that it’s different this time. After all, “nobody” really thinks absolutist Islam is a genuine intellectual and emotional competitor to Western life. To be sure, some of the West’s losers and rejects have found themselves in the arms of the Islamic State, or loosely associated with foes who appreciate, if not aid and abet, jihadist gains against the United States and Europe.

But at the height of the Cold War, a host of respectable Westerners believed communism might actually be right and capitalism wrong—whether at the level of ideology or sheer practicality. Because absolutist Islam is so alien and particular, relative to the grand yet familiar abstractions Marx ushered in, we’re apt to think the jihadists and their allies may be able to attack our people and our systems, but they cannot really defeat our civilization.

It’s easy to think this way because we’re so resistant to the prospect of another existential threat to our civilization. It doesn’t just strike people as reasonable that terror attacks won’t rise to the level of catastrophe promised by a strategic nuclear exchange. It strikes them as emotionally correct or necessary—not just because it’s easier to live in a world where a few major cities might be destroyed and not all human life on earth, but because so few people really believe we could actually win a world war against the jihadists and their allies.

If the Soviet Union seemed prohibitively difficult to defeat, at least there was a plan and enough willingness in the West to execute it. Today, it’s psychologically unacceptable for many people to imagine that we’re at acute risk of civilizational defeat yet lack a viable, acceptable blueprint to avoid that fate.

Subterfuge May Be More Effective Than Instant Destruction

Well, it’s time for a wake-up call—even though the head check we need raises the risk that fear and recklessness will increase as a result. As the emerging truth about the Paris attacks shows, the parallels are clear between the “dirty” truth about the Cold War and the dark reality of the state of play in our conflict with international jihadists and their allies. The nexus of state-sponsored terror, subversion, and infiltration established during the Cold War has been reactivated, threatening not just Western people or Western systems but Western civilization itself. We can argue over whether this threat is “existential” or not. Most significant is that it really is a civilization being targeted, on top of people and systems.

Let’s be clear about what this means. In theory, terror, subversion, and infiltration could destroy Western civilization by carrying off a kind of coup on the communist model: you wake up one day and a revolutionary vanguard has seized state power and the means of production. However nightmarish, that’s not the kind of attack on Western civilization we should focus on.

More plausible, more efficient, and more effective is an attack with more limited and devious aims. Much as a Russian spy might opt against killing a victim outright, choosing instead to administer a debilitating but nonlethal dose of poison, jihadists and their allies are now well-positioned to cripple Western civilization, inflicting harm without provoking a true world war the West would eventually win.

This is the lesson we are only now able to learn from Paris. France, in a jihadist proof of concept, is now on the verge of becoming a garrison state. Officials have been reduced to monitoring airport and public transit workers for signs of jihadist activity—or mere sympathy. The French head of intelligence, Patrick Calvar, admitted to Parliament that he expected “a new form of attack” from the Islamic State, “characterized by placing explosive devices in places where there are large crowds and repeating this type of action to create a climate of maximum panic.”

What is new here is not terrorism’s fear factor. Rather, it is the active and passive paralysis that comes from a judgment that one’s society is so badly compromised from the inside that one’s civilization—one’s rights, freedoms, pleasures, celebrations, and moral values—is now inoperable.

The Paris Attacks Were More Sophisticated Than We’d Thought

Thanks to Paris, just that kind of judgment is in danger of being formed. That attack, like any attacks to follow, was about far more than the Islamic State. Rather than a ragtag band of psychotic losers engaged in random bloodshed, a growing body of evidence now suggests that the Paris attacks were driven by a Cold War-style project that united subversion, infiltration, and terror into a single plan of attack.

Doubtless, ragtag losers linked to ISIS served as the tip of the spear. But the profile of the attack’s logistician, 26-year-old Salah Abdeslam, runs curiously counter to that of a true mastermind or true jihadist, who’d have shown more brains and more of a willingness to martyr himself—especially given, as Abdeslam was, more than one perfect opportunity.

Yet the Paris attackers carried out a plan crafted at a level of sophistication that raises serious and immediate questions, complete with strict communications security and explosives too dangerous and delicate to be wired by amateurs. In a pattern last exposed so dramatically during Algeria’s struggle with Islamism in the ‘90s, the Paris attack shows hallmarks of involvement by a foreign intelligence agency.

“Who might have stood behind the Paris attacks has been the subject of extensive speculation in Western intelligence circles since last November,” one former National Security Ageny counterintelligence expert recently noted. “We need answers to these complex and messy questions, but nobody publicly wants to ask them.”

The Paris attack shows hallmarks of involvement by a foreign intelligence agency.

Nobody, perhaps, but those with the most to say and the least to lose. In an interview with Gavin McInnes published at old-school paleocon Taki Theodoracopoulos’s eponymous online magazine, Eagles of Death Metal frontman Jesse Hughes made a series of superficially astonishing claims about what really happened when his Bataclan concert was turned into a slaughter.

“There’s no denying the terrorists were already inside, and they had to get in somehow,” he said. “During the shooting I went outside and the backstage door was propped open. How did that happen?” “There were two girls who were involved,” Hughes added. “They were at the venue and vanished before the shooting, and these women were in traditional Muslim garb.”

Jihadis May Not Be Working Alone

In a quip assured to trigger some skepticism, Hughes claimed he saw “Muslims celebrating in the street during the attack. I saw it with my own eyes. In real time! How did they know what was going on? There must have been coordination.” Shortly after the Paris attack, however, I was quietly told the same by a well-connected North African: an operation like that, the individual explained, simply could not be conducted without sympathizers and accomplices on the inside.

An operation like that simply could not be conducted without sympathizers and accomplices on the inside.

Although there is no smoking gun linking a foreign government or organization to the Paris attacks, there is a prima facie case that some were involved, most likely utilizing the triad of subversion, infiltration, and terrorism that gave the Cold War its truly dirty and messy character. What’s more, it’s easy to hazard an educated guess about who the attacks’ putative foreign operators might be. You’d be hard-pressed, for instance, to find an outside organization with the requisite motives and capabilities if you ruled out Hezbollah. From there, it’s not unreasonable to imagine connecting a line of complicity to individuals within one of Hezbollah’s favorite foreign governments.

There is no question that this kind of theorizing can get out of hand—not just due to human beings’ love for a gripping story, but because (let’s face it) most people are required to make sense of today’s world without ever getting to learn the most crucial information. Still, what we can glimpse of that information is pointing good analysts toward a view of today’s deepening world conflict that’s starkly reminiscent of the Cold War at its most shadowy and lethal. “Existential” or no, the threat posed to Western civilization is real, and the time to adopt a workable plan to confront that threat is growing short.

What We Know About The Orlando Terrorist Who Killed 50,"Authorities say Omar Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce, Fla., killed 50 people and injured 53 others early Sunday morning. ISIS has claimed responsibility for his actions, making it the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, and the worst terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.

Twenty minutes into the attack, Omar Mateen dialed 9-1-1 and pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, and mentioned the Boston bomber. After a three-hour confrontation with local police forces, during which he held a group of people hostage, he was shot dead by a SWAT team.

ISIS has since claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the Amaq News Agency, ISIS’s official news arm.

“The armed attack that targeted a gay night club in the city of Orlando in the American state of Florida which left over 100 people dead or injured was carried out by an Islamic State fighter,” Amaq News Agency said.

39. Here is a screen grab of the Amaq announcement. Notice the wording regarding information from a source: pic.twitter.com/uBTNfbeelY — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) June 12, 2016

Omar Mateen was born in New York and is of Afghani descent. His ex-wife said he was unstable and was abusive towards her during the few months they were married.

“He was not a stable person,” she told The Washington Post under the condition of anonymity. “He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that.”

Omar Mateen’s father, Seddique Mateen, claimed that his son’s actions had “nothing to do with religion,” and said his son was angered several months ago after he saw two men kissing.

Seddique Mateen, who hosted a talk show on an Afghani news channel that broadcasts from California, has publicly spoken in support of the Afghan Taliban and denounced the Pakistani government. Episodes of the show have been uploaded to a YouTube channel under Seddique Mateen’s name. Contact information featured on the show was traced to the Mateens’ Florida residence, The Washington Post reported.

Another friend described Omar Mateen to WaPo as being “very religious,” and said he went on a pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, which is considered to an important part of the Muslim faith.

The FBI had investigated Omar Mateen twice, once in 2013 and again in 2014, as a person of interest whom they suspected had connections to a known terrorist, The Daily Beast reported. The FBI subsequently dropped its investigations into Mateen when the probes resulted in nothing to warrant further examination.

In a news conference Sunday, President Obama called the Orlando shooting an act of terror and hate.

“Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate,” Obama said. “As Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.”

Mateen used a rifle and a handgun, which authorities say he purchased legally in the days leading up to the attack.

The United States has failed to come up with a response that actually targets the cause of terrorist attacks perpetuated by radicalized lone wolves, said Federalist publisher Ben Domenech on CBS’s “Face The Nation” today.

“Evil men will always exist, they will do evil things,” Domenech said. “The victory over evil is not something that’s within our capacity to grasp and so it’s the fight that counts, and I think in this context that fight is an ideological fight more than it is over ‘policy X’ or ‘policy Y’ that wouldn’t have removed small arms from this man’s hands and spared these lives.”

“You have these over and over again,” Domenech said. “These small arms massacres and then a policy response that I think the people feel is either insufficient or actually actually targets the victims — taking guns out of their hands, or engaging in policies that are not actually going to prevent these sorts of things in the future.”

“I’m not sure that we’ve figured out a response to this and I think that helps these active folks in the Middle East who encourage these types of terrorist attacks,” he said.

Hillary: People Under FBI Investigation Should Lose Constitutional Rights,"If something horrifying happens, we must ignore due process and deny Americans their rights. To be safe. This was basically the argument many conservatives (and Democrats) made post-9/11 to help pass the Patriot Act, and it’s exactly the argument most liberals are making when they push gun bans to people on terror watch lists.

“If the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links,” Hillary Clinton said today in her supposedly apolitical speech, “you shouldn’t be able to just go buy a gun.”

If we’re going to do this, let’s be consistent.

If the FBI is conducting a criminal investigation of your suspected illegal use of a home email server to transmit classified intelligence, you shouldn’t be allowed to just go and run for president. Obviously. The idea that we would allow a person who can’t be trusted with our most vital secrets to hold the most powerful office in the nation is absurd. It’s just not safe.

It’s worse than that, actually. Being on a watch list would probably be best described—using Hillary’s own euphemism—as having a “security inquiry.” The Democratic Party nominee is under criminal investigation by the nation’s prime federal law enforcement agency. She’s practically guilty.

Or maybe Hillary (and Donald Trump, as far as we know) only believes the Fifth Amendment should be discarded if talking about Muslim surnames? Because then it gets perplexing. Many of the same voices—Hillary, included—who claim that those of us focusing on the ideological affiliations of terrorists are perpetuating hate, also argue that denying the rights of Muslim Americans is a necessity. Surely, Muslims—most of whom are “innocent people” who “are blacklisted without a fair process to correct government error,” as the ACLU puts it—dominate the list.

At last count there were over 700,000 people on the various terrorist watch lists. Most Americans still have no idea if they are on the list. They have no idea how someone gets on the terror list. They have no idea how someone gets off the list, either.

Here’s an exchange from a few years ago in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals:

Chief Judge Alex Kozinski had a simple question for the government attorney: what would you do if you found yourself on the No Fly List? After some hemming and hawing, the attorney said that he would seek “redress” from the Department of Homeland Security – even though DHS does not place people on the No Fly list and has no authority to remove them (that’s the FBI’s job). Because, the lawyer conceded, DHS would not be able to confirm or deny whether he was on the list, he would then seek review in a federal appellate court. And what would the court be able to do?, asked Judge Kozinski. Not much, said the government lawyer. In fact, the lawyer would not even concede that a federal court possessed the authority to order someone removed from the No Fly List.

This kind of system is not only ripe for abuse, it’s primed for failure. Because, by the way, no one “is able to just go buy a gun.” Omar Mateen reportedly passed a background check. He was not on a terror watchlist, according to a U.S. intelligence source, so none of this would have mattered anyway. As far as we know, the FBI had questioned him and then removed him from the list once it closed its investigation. That is not a failure of gun laws, if anything, it’s a failure of law enforcement.

Not that this stops anyone. Every time there is a horrific shooting or terror act we’re in for some scaremongering meant to bolster some predetermined political agenda. Places like Vox openly call for frightening people about terrorism in an effort to scare people out of their individual rights, codified by the Bill of Rights and upheld by the Supreme Court. They offer not one single idea that might have hindered this act of terror, or any of the mass shootings we’ve seen. It’s worth remembering the next time liberals claim to have reverence for due process.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/13/hillary-people-under-fbi-investigation-should-lose-constitutional-rights/,2016-06-13
Assault Weapons Ban: A Dumb Idea Pushed By Dumb People,"It happens like clock work: as soon as there’s a mere whisper of a terrorist attack or a mass shooting, the usual suspects kick in to high gear. Their destination is always the same: a faraway land where a so-called assault weapons ban magically eliminates not only guns but also prevents guns from walking of their own volition, without need of human agency, into crowded places and killing people.

The reaction after the terrorist attack in Orlando, in which a radical Islamist who pledged allegiance to ISIS murdered at least 49 people in a packed night club, was as predictable as it was pathetic.

These shootings are a regular occurrence. You don't get to be ""shocked"" anymore unless you take action to stop them. Ban automatic weapons.



Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016

Prayers are not enough. Time for a ban on automatic weapons. There is only one reason they exist and that is to kill our fellow man.



Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) June 12, 2016

BBC just said the gun used in the shooting can ""fire 700 rounds per minute.""



Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) June 12, 2016

Set aside for the moment the fact that no automatic weapons were used in the Orlando terrorist attack (an automatic weapon is one for which a single trigger pull will fire multiple bullets), and that it is literally impossible for a semi-automatic weapon to fire 700 rounds per minute. Nor, to my knowledge, have automatic weapons ever been used in a mass shooting in the modern era.

When silly people like Seth MacFarlane and Susan Sarandon say they want to ban “automatic weapons,” what they mean is that they want to ban guns that look scary. They don’t understand that you can’t walk into a gun store and walk out with a military-style assault weapon (one that can fire multiple rounds with a single trigger pull). That’s because 1) most gun dealers don’t carry the military version of the scary looking gun, 2) you have to jump through an obscene number of hoops with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to even obtain a tax stamp that says you may purchase such a weapon (a process that takes months, if not years), and 3) the actual versions of rifles used by the military are really expensive and unaffordable for the vast majority of prospective gun owners.

What you can buy from your local gun dealer, after that licensed gun dealer has confirmed that you passed a federal background check (yep, that’s required by existing law), is a semi-automatic rifle. And now, a bunch of gun controllers who don’t understand the slightest thing about guns have decided that rifle needs to be banned. Not because it’s more deadly than a typical hunting rifle (it’s absolutely not), but because it looks scarier.

Repeat after me: Owning a deadly assault weapon is not a second amendment right.

But before we dive into whether the assault weapons ban was merely dumb, or if it was monumentally stupid and counterproductive, it’s important to define what the previous federal ban covered and how it defined an “assault weapon.” The 1994 assault weapons law banned semi-automatic rifles only if they had any two of the following five features in addition to a detachable magazine: a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor, or a grenade launcher.

That’s it. Not one of those cosmetic features has anything whatsoever to do with how or what a gun fires. Note that under the 1994 law, the mere existence of a bayonet lug, not even the bayonet itself, somehow turned a garden-variety rifle into a bloodthirsty killing machine. Guns with fixed stocks? Very safe. But guns where a stock has more than one position? Obviously they’re murder factories. A rifle with both a bayonet lug and a collapsible stock? Perish the thought.

A collapsible stock does not make a rifle more deadly. Nor does a pistol grip. Nor does a bayonet mount. Nor does a flash suppressor. And for heaven’s sake, good luck finding, let alone purchasing, 40mm explosive grenades for your rifle-mounted grenade launcher (and remember: the grenade launcher itself is fine, just as long as you don’t put the ultra-deadly bayonet lug anywhere near it).

The complete unfamiliarity with guns and how they work that led to the inept definitions in the 1994 law was on full display in a now-infamous television interview with Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a New York congresswoman who backed the so-called assault weapons ban. In the interview, Tucker Carlson asked McCarthy to define “barrel shroud,” a firearm feature regulated by the law. Here’s how she answered:

CARLSON: I read the legislation and it said that it would regulate “barrel shrouds.” What’s a barrel shroud and why should we regulate that?



MCCARTHY:The guns that were chosen back in those days were basically the guns that most gangs and criminals were using to kill our police officers. I’m not saying it was the best bill, but that was they could get out at that particular time.



CARLSON: Ok. Do you know what a barrel shroud is?



MCCARTHY: I actually don’t know what a barrel shroud is. I think it’s the shoulder thing that goes up.”

“The shoulder thing that goes up.” It’s not the “shoulder thing that goes up.” There is no “shoulder thing that goes up.” The “barrel shroud” (a term nobody uses) is simply a hand guard that goes around a barrel. That embarrassing spectacle happened over seven years ago, and yet over that period of time, McCarthy’s fellow gun banners still haven’t seen fit to learn the slightest thing about the objects they wish to regulate.

If the cosmetic features used to define an “assault weapon” in the 1994 law strike you as really stupid ways to define an “assault weapon,” it’s because the 1994 law was a stupid law with stupid definitions written by stupid people. And not only was it a stupid law, it was a stupid law that didn’t even accomplish its stated goal. How do we know? Because today, more than a decade after the law’s expiration, the number of people murdered by rifles is 36 percent lower than it was during the last full year the assault weapons ban was in effect.

The law expired in September of 2004, making 2003 the last full calendar year in which the law was in effect. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) crime statistics, 390 people were murdered with rifles in 2003, making rifles the weapon of choice in 2.7 percent of murders that year. But in 2014, more than a decade after these vile weapons of war flooded American streets, the number of rifle murders surely skyrocketed, right?

Not so much. Quite the opposite. In 2014, the most recent year for which detailed FBI data are available, rifles were used in 248 murders. And not only are rifles used in far fewer murders over a decade following the expiration of the 1994 gun ban, they’re also used in a smaller percentage of homicides. In 2003, when the gun ban was in full effect, rifles were used in nearly 3 percent of murders. In 2014, they were used in barely 2 percent.

That’s the exact opposite of what gun banners said should happen. After the assault weapons ban, guns were supposed to flood the streets and just start killing people. Crime was supposed to skyrocket. But that’s not what happened. Yes, Americans bought a ton of rifles after the law expired, but rather than going up, the number of homicides in which rifles were used drastically fell. There were way more guns, but way less crime.

Are you ready for a mind-blowing statistic? In 2014, you were six times more likely to be murdered with a knife than you were with a rifle. Knives were the weapon of choice in 1,567 murders in 2014, according to the FBI. It gets crazier. You were also nearly three times more likely to be killed by someone’s fists or feet than you were to be murdered with a rifle. In 2014, 660 people were murdered with what the FBI calls “personal weapons”–hands, fists, feet–compared to 248 with rifles.

In the United States, knives are more deadly than rifles. So are fists. And feet. This is not my opinion. It is an incontrovertible fact. And it’s a fact that highlights a point that far too many people refuse to acknowledge: the human desire to kill is far more deadly than any weapon. Weapons do not of their own volition and agency decide to kill people. That requires human intervention. Humans hell-bent on death and destruction will get their hands on whatever tools they need to wreak their desired havoc. Restricting the use of those tools by innocent people who only want to protect themselves and their families is delusional madness.

Yet here we are. Rather than blaming individuals and ideologies, the leading lights of American society have decided to demonize inanimate objects. Despite the fact that the terrorist in Orlando was a radical jihadi who pledged allegiance to ISIS, progressives have decided to blame the NRA for what happened. Even though the terrorist was registered to vote as a Democrat, his fellow Democrats have decided that Republicans are the true culprits.

This is apparently how 2016 is going to go. If a boy tells you he’s a girl, then he’s a girl. If an Islamic terrorist who pledges allegiance to ISIS tells you he’s killing for Allah, then he’s probably a Republican with a lifetime NRA membership. After all, Islamic terrorists don’t kill people; peaceful, law-abiding citizens who believe the Second Amendment means what it says kill people.

Collective leftist denial about the existential, radical Islamic threat facing America is not going to prevent Islamic terrorism. Gun bans that ban guns based on nothing more than scary-looking cosmetic features are not going to prevent radical jihadis from murdering innocent people. Pretending that Republicans and the NRA are the real villains is not going to prevent ISIS from killing more Americans. Ignoring the fact that these attacks seem to only happen in gun-free zones won’t prevent violent psychopaths from waltzing into those gun-free zones and gunning down the unarmed civilians who congregate there.

But all those things will make progressives feel better about themselves, and who are you to deny them that right?

The Orlando Attack Is The Price Of Not Destroying ISIS,"In the wake of the Orlando terrorist attack, which left 50 dead and for which ISIS claimed responsibility on Sunday, there’s one question we probably will not debate seriously: whether we should return to the Bush doctrine and shut down terrorist safe havens overseas, and specifically whether we should deploy troops to the Middle East to destroy ISIS.

Instead, gun control and anti-gay bigotry will be the going concerns, especially among our liberal and media elite in the days ahead, just as they were in the hours after the attack. Partisans on the Left believe they can bend those aspects to their advantage in domestic political battles, and that’s what they’ll talk about.

Indeed, it only took President Barack Obama a few minutes in his remarks Sunday afternoon to suggest that one of the proper responses to Orlando would be to pass stricter gun-control measures. This is one of the president’s favorite talking points after a “mass shooting,” regardless of who does the shooting or why. It matters little that the shooter, Omar Mateen, was armed with firearms he appears to have acquired legally, or that he was a licensed security guard and thus wasn’t the type of person who would be denied a firearm even under a far stricter gun control regime.

Obama Doesn’t Think Terrorism Is A Big Deal

No matter. We will hear more about gun control. But we won’t hear the president announce a new foreign policy to defeat ISIS because on a fundamental level Obama think these kinds of terrorist attacks are an acceptable price to pay for American nonintervention in the Middle East.

A passage from Jeffery Goldberg’s lengthy piece in the April edition of The Atlantic, “The Obama Doctrine,” captures the essence of Obama’s thinking about ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism generally. In the immediate aftermath of the Paris attacks last November, Obama, who had been on a globe-spanning presidential trip when the attacks occurred, was lambasted for failing to understand the fear among many Americans that something like that might happen here. But there was a reason Obama appeared to be unmoved, and it wasn’t just jet lag. Goldberg goes on to note that Obama

has never believed that terrorism poses a threat to America commensurate with the fear it generates. Even during the period in 2014 when ISIS was executing its American captives in Syria, his emotions were in check. Valerie Jarrett, Obama’s closest adviser, told him people were worried that the group would soon take its beheading campaign to the U.S. ‘They’re not coming here to chop our heads off,’ he reassured her. Obama frequently reminds his staff that terrorism takes far fewer lives in America than handguns, car accidents, and falls in bathtubs do.

Obama’s courtiers in the media often parrot this talking point, in some cases explicitly following the president’s instructions to tally up the number of Americans who’ve been killed by terrorist attacks and compare them to the number of those killed by gun violence. It’s a useful exercise if you want to minimize the threat of terrorism and push for stricter gun control, but it doesn’t do much to address the central problem of radical Islamic terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.

That, of course, was precisely what the Bush doctrine tried to address in the wake of 9/11. The idea was that terrorist safe havens could not be allowed to persist anywhere in the world, especially in distant and largely ungoverned places like Afghanistan, where Al Qaeda had ample time to marshal resources and plan attacks. We would have to go over there, not just for revenge but specifically to preempt future plots against the West. “We’re going to smoke them out,” President Bush said a week after 9/11, adding, “The Taliban must take my statements seriously.” Two weeks later, American and British forces were bombing Taliban and Al Qaeda forces in northern Afghanistan.

Obama, elected partly on a promise to end America’s post-9/11 wars and bring troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan, effectively repudiated this doctrine. He withdrew U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011 and formally ended combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014. In both cases, Obama claimed the governments of those countries could, with minimal assistance from America, deal with the terrorist groups still operating in their countries. Of course, we still have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the numbers of U.S. soldiers deployed in combat roles have been quietly increasing as it becomes clear that those governments are not up to the task of fighting ISIS and a resurgent Taliban.

The Case For Wiping Out ISIS

There is, of course, a strong argument for deploying a substantial number of ground troops to Iraq and Syria and wiping out ISIS once and for all. The mere existence of the group emboldens radical Muslims and ISIS sympathizers across the globe, who don’t seem to care if ISIS fighters are losing ground in Syria and Iraq. The perception is that they are ascendant. After all, they have survived this long, defying the United States and other western powers that have called for their destruction but been unwilling to carry it out.

Arguably, destroying ISIS would show the Mateens of the world that ISIS is a lost cause. Like the San Bernardino shooters Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, Mateen was inspired by ISIS but likely had no direct contact with the group. He allegedly called 911 just before he launched his attack and pledged allegiance to ISIS, and indeed may have been thinking about something like this for years. The FBI investigated him twice, in 2013 and 2014, after he implied to co-workers that he had ties to terrorists.

For its part, ISIS has encouraged these kind of attacks against civilians, and will continue to do so. It might turn out that a man armed with guns and explosives, whom the FBI arrested Sunday and who admitted he was planning to attend a gay pride parade in Los Angeles, was also inspired by ISIS. It might turn out that we see much more of this in the coming weeks, since ISIS has encouraged its followers to carry out attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which goes until July 5.

But no matter how many Orlandos or San Bernardinos we have, it will not convince Obama that radical Islamic terrorism is enough of a threat to justify the cost of denying terrorist groups safe haven overseas. More to the point, returning to some version of the Bush doctrine doesn’t help Obama in his domestic political battles, which are the true objects of his foreign policy. But there is a cost to that, too, and we are likely to keep paying it in American lives lost—not overseas, but here at home.

13 Of The Stupidest Things Said About The Orlando Attack,"As the news broke about the terrorist attack in Orlando, the deadliest strike on U.S. soil since 9/11, a lot of people were quick to say some really stupid things on TV about what happened.

On MSNBC, Jim Cavanaugh suggested the attack was probably “domestic terror” from “white hate groups.”

In response to Hugh Hewitt’s assertion on “Meet The Press” that ISIS would kill 100 million Americans if they could, Joy Ann Reid declared, “But so would white nationalists!”

“We’re not getting to the core issue — which is how easy it is to get a gun,” Reid said later. “Florida happens to have the largest gun-owning population in the country and some of the most lax laws as to how you can get your hands on even an assault rifle.”

Federal law requires all gun dealers in the state of Florida, and everywhere else, to conduct background checks before selling firearms. The terrorist in Orlando purchased his weapons from a licensed gun dealer and Reid said. “Florida happens to have the largest gun-owning population in the country and some of the most lax laws as to how you can get your hands on even an assault rifle.”

“We don’t have any dialogue in America about all these mass shootings,” said Tom Brokaw, conflating an obvious terrorist attack by a radical Islamist jihadi with shootings perpetrated by individuals who have been adjudicated as being mentally ill. Brokaw also demanded that the federal government ban the “AR-14,” a gun that does not actually exist.

“In this country we should not be selling automatic weapons,” Bernie Sanders said, despite the fact that an automatic weapon was not used by the Orlando terrorist.

Perhaps Congress should consider banning high capacity hot takes from unlicensed individuals who haven’t passed a simple gun knowledge background check. After all, everyone knows the First Amendment only protects the right to disseminate information via the types of pens and printing presses that were available in 18th century America.

Don’t Take To Twitter To Respond To Terror,"Did you go on Twitter yesterday? I did. Here are some observations.

It would be bad enough if post-tragedy Twitter were merely a sanctuary for the sort of self-satisfied preening that is characteristic of the typical outrage tweet. But it’s worse than that: It’s also a repository of sloppy thinking. The result is an intolerable combination of misguided judgments dripping with unearned swagger.

The two are connected, of course. The angry tweet, for so many of us the purest expression of moral disapproval du jour, arrives via a psychological process whose origin is both emotional and partisan. With that sort of beginning point, what possibility remains for measured, objective analysis to break through? The result is a seemingly inexhaustible supply of social media interactions entirely unconcerned with observing the intellectual norms that should govern public discourse.

When tragedy strikes, many moderately engaged individuals — news and opinion commentators, celebrities, business leaders, etc. — find their capacity for objective analysis overwhelmed by their strong ideological priors. Why is this a problem? Because their failure to restrain their ideological commitments inhibits their ability to dispassionately weigh evidence and reach accurate conclusions. This is because their ideological profiles are largely made up of strongly held value judgments that, in turn, provoke a heavy measure of disgust for ideological opponents. Here we reach the origin of the outrage tweet: an emotional overburst of unrestrained partisan energy.

Shut Down Brain, Power Up Mouth

On early Sunday morning, Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old American-born private security officer, opened fire at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, killing 49 people and wounding dozens more. Within hours, we would come to know it as the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.

When a mass shooting like this one takes place, the ideological priors really kick into gear. Typically, liberals will find Second Amendment advocates, Christians who pass judgment on rival ideologies, and American nationalists revolting. Conservatives will find Islamic sympathizers and gun control advocates disgusting. The nature of the tragedy that the Twitterverse is responding to will determine whether it is liberals or conservatives who are reacting to the rhetorical excesses of their opponents. The result is a fruitless back-and-forth of escalating intensity.

The problem is not that each side is so passionate; the problem, rather, is that this process is structurally hostile to sound reasoning and sober judgment. It’s no surprise, then, that the final product — the outrage tweet — is often philosophically sloppy. The tremendous pressure to Show How Wrong They Are Right Now tends to be inimical to intellectual clarity. Giving free reign to our strong emotional priors disarms us of our critical faculties and short-circuits the reasoning process, producing judgments that have the appearance of intellectual vigor but not the substance.

Anything But Islam

The worst manifestation of this on post-tragedy Twitter is a phenomenon we can call “causal deflection.” In the immediate aftermath of the Orlando massacre, causal deflection was on full display. Within just a few hours, Twitter was teeming with examples of liberal commentators spectacularly downplaying the causal force of Mateen’s religious convictions.

Causal deflection — the tendency to minimize the causal role of certain ideologically distressing factors within explanations — tends to be a big problem for the Left in the aftermath of terrorist events. At one point during his rampage, Mateen called 911 to explicitly connect his act of terror to his embrace of ISIS.

What’s maddening is that, when confronted with the fact that the killer couched his attack as an act of service to the Islamic State, many commentators, without argument, treated this self-confessed motivation as causally insignificant. Even if it turns out that Mateen’s identification with ISIS was a diversionary tactic, that doesn’t absolve these commentators of willfully misattributing blame.

They weren’t downplaying the role his religious convictions played in motivating his act of terror out of an abundance of caution; it’s not as if the reason they were suppressing the causal importance of his extremist ideology was to make sure all the facts were uncovered before rushing to judgment. The idea is to point the finger at other factors — the ubiquity of guns, the religious opposition to transgender bathroom bills, whatever else — so long as Islam does not figure into the causal picture.

Good analysis, beyond involving a careful examination of facts, also requires the ability to detect causal connections among relevant factors to help explain why the event in question took place. When a factor, such as Mateen’s pledge of allegiance to ISIS, challenges an observer’s ideological commitments, it is sometimes downplayed in favor of other factors that accord better with the observer’s priors. Sometimes the offending factor is ignored altogether; other times the ideologically distressing factor is minimized by exaggerating an ideologically soothing, although objectively less significant, factor.

Real Religion Doesn’t Matter; Fake Religion Does

Recall that a liberal prerogative is to defend non-Western peoples against the acids of Western Christianity, whose colonialisms and imperialisms have so oppressed an unwilling world that making things right requires continuously redirecting blame toward ourselves. Here are some examples. There are a billion others.

When Emotion Takes Over, Stupid Thinking Happens

Take Winkler’s and Nyaosi’s tweets as an example. In response to Adam Winkler, who is a University of California at Los Angeles law professor, I tweeted this:

@adamwinkler Embarrassing that, as a law professor, you're unable to make an elementary distinction between violent & non-violent opposition



— Berny Belvedere (@bernybelvedere) June 13, 2016



For Winkler, the issue isn’t Islamic extremism but “religious opposition to homosexuality.” With this explanation, Winkler manages to downplay the causal significance of extreme Islamic theology by elevating the causal significance of Christian opposition to redefining marriage along homosexual lines. Does this explanation strike you as an honest grappling of what caused the Orlando massacre?

In response to the leftist writer Bugei Nyaosi, I said this:

@bnyaosi You've equated prioritizing biology over psychology in determining sexual identity with murdering 50 people. Ridiculous.



— Berny Belvedere (@bernybelvedere) June 13, 2016



Nyaosi doubled down:

@bernybelvedere and I'm here to tell you trans-phobia is on the same spectrum as homophobia & resultant hatreds are intertwined



— Bugei Nyaosi (@bnyaosi) June 13, 2016

Self-Identification Is Everything, Except When It’s Not

So Nyaosi has morally conflated the belief that one’s biology, not one’s psychology, should determine bathroom access (what some religious conservatives argue) with the belief that homosexuals are so offensive that they need to be slaughtered en masse (Mateen’s motivating belief). In this context, Nyaosi finds the conservative refusal to cede that psychological considerations determine one’s sex to be on the “same spectrum” as murdering dozens of homosexuals. But by downplaying Mateen’s psychological self-identification as a soldier of ISIS, isn’t Nyaosi guilty of the same sort of bigotry, as judged by his own yardstick?

It’s certainly striking that self-identification, in this context, isn’t given greater causal significance. Aren’t liberals the ones who tell us that how a person self-identifies, not what biology dictates, should determine how he is seen? This affects everything from what bathrooms transgender people should be allowed to use to what pronouns should be used to refer to them, to much else. Yet here we have a person pledging allegiance to ISIS and this self-identification is causally insignificant to his actions.

A tragedy has the power to take our pent-up partisan frustrations and harness them into terrifyingly mindless instances of moral scorn heaped on our opponents. It’s good that we care so much and that these events impact us as they do, but what we owe the victims most of all is clear thinking. That’s how we can honor them best.

Obama's Orlando Response Proves He's In Denial,"In a speech Tuesday, President Obama asked, in defensive tones, “That’s the key, they tell us. We cannot beat ISIL unless we call them radical Islamists. What exactly would using this label accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to try to kill Americans? …So someone seriously thinks that we don’t know who we are fighting?”

No, Mr. President, you don’t know whom you’re fighting. When you refuse to say the name, to call a thing what it is, you give it power. Just ask Lord Voldemort. Refusing to speak the name reeks of fear, denial, and distraction. When you call out someone for who he is and what he believes, you are exposing him. You’re saying, “I know you. I know where and how to find you. And I will destroy you.” It empowers us and weakens them.

Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in a gay nightclub, told us exactly who he was. He pledged allegiance to a foreign enemy who has been our adversary since before 9/11. They are radical Islamists, who are committed to violent jihad. Of course they leave off the modifier and simply call themselves Islamists or soldiers of Islam. Out of respect, maybe we should do the same. How a person identifies himself is what matters to the rest of us, and we can’t impose another identity on them against their will. So Islamist it is.

Identifying Them Is the First Step

Mateen was an Islamist who believed, like others of the same faith, that Allah’s command to kill unbelievers is their “code of ethics.” That means killing homosexuals, Christians, Jews, secularists—anyone who is not of Islam. The United States, being a powerful, hedonistic country, is at the top of the list.

If our counter-terrorism strategy allowed for radical Islam to be used and its adherents investigated, they would have known homosexuals were a target.

Obama asks what difference does it make what we call our enemy. I’ll give you one example as reported at PJ Media. Law enforcement in Orlando failed to detect this killer because they “never guessed” a gay club would be targeted by jihad. How blind can you be, given the fact that Islamists kill thousands of gays in the Middle East every year, throwing them from buildings and beheading them (along with Christians, Jews, and Muslims)?

Putting homosexuals to death is part of Islamic commands. This is known, as the Dothraki would say. The text Abu Dawud says regarding homosexual behavior, “kill the one who does it, and the one to whom it is done.” Another text by Muhammad says “stone the upper and the lower, stone them both.”

Yet law enforcement in Orlando were ignorant of this well-known fact. The East Orlando Post reported Sunday a statement by James Copenhaver, a veteran investigator and former Orlando law enforcement officer, that gay clubs were completely off the radar.

I have been in this business for 30 years, and we all in law enforcement have talked about one of the theme parks getting hit by these terrorist killers. Never in all my years of training, and being involved in several investigative units, to include the FBI Task Force, would we have ever guessed a LGBT club be a target of an terrorist attack.

If they had actually known who the enemy is, if our counter-terrorism strategy allowed for radical Islam to be used and its adherents investigated, they would have known for a fact that homosexuals were a target. What does that mean? It means they could have been looking for signs of an Islamist who seemed to have a particular interest in gay clubs, especially one who had already been on the FBI watch-list, who had bought guns, and who had tried to get body armor!

Willful Ignorance Gets People Killed

Yet, Obama petulantly says, “What difference does it matter anyway”! This willful ignorance will continue to get us killed if we don’t change. We need to stop calling these people “violent radicals with guns” and name them by their actual name. They are Islamists. Radical Islamists, if you will, but still Islamists.

We need to understand their teaching, their belief system, their motivations, and their goals. If we don’t, we will fail to properly identify them. The name itself is not some kind of magical designation, but using it is an indication that you understand it. If you refuse to use it, that means you have failed to really and truly understand your enemy. That is certainly the case with the United States, as we point our finger in every other direction except where it should be pointed.

As I said before, one of the most important reasons we should call out our enemy by the name they give themselves—the name they live by, kill by, and die by—is that it empowers America to say, “I know you!” It sends a message to our enemy that we are on the lookout for them, and we won’t be distracted by other issues that have nothing to do with their murderous rampages. It tells them, “We have your name, and we will wipe it from the face of the earth.”

5 Takeaways From Trump’s Response To Orlando,"I was having Mexican for lunch with friends on a beautiful sunny Silicon Valley afternoon. My enchiladas were excellent, as was the conversation. Then I happened to glance up at the TV, and CNN was on with breaking news. I couldn’t hear it, but the headline scrolling by at the bottom read “50 killed in Orlando shooting. Shooter born in New York, parents from Afghanistan. Shooter claimed allegiance to ISIS in 911 call.”

We’d been hit again. It sank in.

I already knew what the liberal response would be. They would blame Republicans and conservatives, Christians, and the National Rifle Association. No surprise there, even though it was not a Christian, but a Muslim and registered Democrat who carried out the attack. But why let little things like facts get in the way?

Yet I was most curious to see how Donald Trump would respond. Would he reiterate his call for a ban on Muslim immigration—which some have called racist, Islamophobic, and unbecoming of a presidential candidate? Or would he back down and embrace political correctness in order to placate his critics and seem more presidential?

Trump answered my curiosity with his national security speech the Monday following the attack. Let’s look at five key takeaways from his talk.

1. The Orlando Attacks Legitimized Trump’s Message

Trump’s simple solution of temporarily banning immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States already made sense to many Americans. Now, after the Orlando attack, his argument will seem even more like common sense and less like an extreme solution. You can bet the “ban” will be the topic of discussion at many dinner tables and coffee break rooms all around America this week, in a much more substantive way than before Orlando.

2. Trump Got Elegant

Trump chose not to capitulate, but to reiterate. He repeated his ban on immigration from Muslim countries, but this time stating it in a much more elegant fashion, replacing “Muslim countries” with “areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States.” This more-sophisticated phrasing sounds more measured and reasoned, will be palatable to more Americans, and will be harder to attack for being intolerant.

3. Trump Tied the Orlando Attack to Immigration

Trump successfully tied the terrorist attack to our immigration system, which allowed the killer’s father to enter the United States even though he supports the Taliban and is from a country with a proven history of terrorism. Trump showed that inviting the wrong people to our country can have disastrous impact, even in the second generation. Critically, he showed that the much-touted rigorous background screening done on immigrants simply cannot be relied upon, as evidenced by not only Orlando but also San Bernardino. All this will let Trump show that his immigration policies could have prevented this attack.

4. Trump Tied the Orlando Attack to Political Correctness

Trump argued that political correctness stifled the FBI’s response to the attack. Indeed, we know the FBI had investigated the Orlando terrorist on multiple occasions, yet no action was taken. This was ostensibly due to fears of being seen as anti-Islam, and due to FBI agents receiving ineffective, politically correct training on Islam. Thus, by tying political correctness to the government’s failure to stop a known terrorist suspect, Trump has strengthened his positioning as the only candidate who won’t let political correctness stand in the way of protecting Americans.

5. Trump Differentiated Himself

Trump argued that President Obama and Hillary Clinton support increased immigration from countries known to support terrorism; that they refuse to release the immigration history of known terrorists in the United States; that political correctness prevents them from taking action against Islamic terrorism; and that border control is better than gun control. This is the exact opposite of Hillary’s position. These policies clearly differentiate Trump from Hillary, and make him appear stronger on terrorism.

All in all, Trump skillfully responded to Orlando, articulating his core message in a more sophisticated way than before, yet without losing any of the sting and unorthodoxy that people love (and hate) so much. I can’t wait to see if upcoming poll numbers reflect a bump in support, as I’m expecting.

6 Things To Know About Tying Gun Sales To A Watch List,"Americans must resist calls from the Left and the Right to curtail individual freedoms in reaction to the atrocity at Orlando gay nightclub Pulse. Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton is urging us to “get back to the spirit of 9/12.” Democrats on Capitol Hill are reviving their defeated gun sales watch list, and they’ve got an enthusiastic ally in Republican Party candidate Donald Trump.

Here’s what you need to know to stand up to this attack on our civil liberties.

1. Neither the no-fly list nor the terrorist watch list were meant to adjudicate individual rights.

The no-fly list and the terrorist watch list are tools to evaluate and monitor security threats at the investigative stage. They are not good vehicles for adjudicating individual rights, as they utterly lack the procedural safeguards Americans are owed from their government.

In due process terms, these lists and their administration lack notice, an opportunity to respond, and finality. The government is not obligated to inform you that you’ve been put on these lists and consequently stripped of some of your rights. Your ability to challenge your inclusion—should you even find out, of course—is also limited. Further, there are no rules in place to prevent a nameless and unknowable government bureaucrat from putting you back on either list even if you do successfully challenge them.

2. The Democrats are still falsely conflating the no-fly list with the terrorist watch list.

We’ve been over this before. The no-fly list is not the same thing as the terrorist watch list. The no-fly has roughly 40,000 names on it and many of them are not the names of U.S. citizens. By contrast, the terrorist watch list has more than a million names on it (we can’t know the actual number). The legislation Democrats are pushing relies on a definition similar, but not identical, to the one used to create the terrorist watch list on a rolling basis. It has nothing to do with the no-fly list. That won’t stop Democrats from conflating the two intentionally (as an aide to Sen. Diane Feinstein admitted she does), nor will it stop ignorant journalists from confusing them accidentally (as several have conceded to me they have).

3. The Democrat’s proposed gun sales ban list has all of the infirmities of the no-fly and terrorist watch lists.

The Democrats are pushing legislation to create a secret anti-gun list run by bureaucrats whose job has nothing to do with looking out for your interests. The government does not have to tell you that you’re on the list, even if you are denied authorization to purchase a firearm. The opportunity to challenge inclusion is sharply limited. You can be added to the list at the whim of hundreds of faceless bureaucrats without judicial oversight. And the legislation intentionally avoids finality.

In the name of national security, naturally, these same bureaucrats may add or remove you from the list as they please. This is an obvious violation of due process as protected by the Fifth Amendment, something even the compromised American Civil Liberties Union admits.

4. Even if the Democrats’ proposed gun sales ban list had been made law, it would not have stopped the Orlando attack.

As frequently seems to be the case, political reaction to terrorism does not seem tailored to prevent terrorism. Pulse shooter Omar Mateen was placed on the terrorist watch list in 2013 and 2014. The FBI investigated him and, after determining that he did not have ties to terrorism, took him off the list. The terrorist watch list uses almost the same definition as the Democrats’ proposed gun sales ban list. So even if the Democrats’ proposed solution been enacted, it would not have stopped Mateen from purchasing the firearms that he used to kill at least 49 people and radically alter the lives of hundreds more.

5. Hillary Clinton’s ‘Spirit of 9/12’ is the specter of pervasive government surveillance.

It is true that in the shocked days after 9/11, the two major sides of American politics came together for a brief moment. But their response went too far. During this period of unity, Congress authorized an indefinite military action in Southwest Asia that almost 15 years later stretches across the Middle East and into Africa with no end in sight.

During this period of unity, Clinton and 97 other senators came together to pass the USA PATRIOT Act, which established a surveillance regime that took civil libertarians more than a decade to dismantle. In light of these previous terrorism overreactions, the burden is on the individuals demanding that we do something (anything!) to demonstrate that their proposals are reasonable and include responsible safeguards for constitutionally protected rights.

6. Democrats’ response to terrorism looks exactly like their last call for gun control.

It is no vice to want to respond forcefully to terrorist attacks. But in this case the response looks exactly like the Democrats’ last call for gun control. In the months since they last pushed this legislation, the Democrats have not granted even for a second that the due process concerns that defeated it last time are reasonable.

This strongly suggests that the Democrats do not have the due process rights of Americans in mind in this legislation. One can reasonably wonder why the Democrats’ response to terrorism seems to set its sights on something other than terrorism.

"By Rejecting ‘Radical Islam,’ Obama Rejects Reality","After a meeting with the National Security Council to discuss the Orlando massacre, the deadliest mass shooting in American history, Barack Obama was angry. He’s more impassioned than we’ve ever seen him. He was speaking from the heart. He’s lashing out! Because you know what really grinds his gears? Republicans.

“That’s the key, they say,” Obama said, eviscerating the GOP. “We can’t defeat them unless we call them radical Islamists. What exactly would using this label accomplish? What exactly would it change?”

A lot, actually.

As a matter of realpolitik, perhaps it makes sense to avoid the phrase “radical Islam.” We don’t want to offend the Mullahs, theocratic sheiks, oligarchic princes, Arab strongmen, and future junta leaders of the Middle East. We need to work with these people, after all. What should bother you, though, is that Obama constantly tries to chill speech by insinuating that anyone who does associate violence with radical Islam—which includes millions of adherents—is a bigot. This is a president who also intimates that anyone who is critical of everyday Islam’s widespread illiberalism—for example, all nations where homosexuality is punishable by death are Muslim—is also a bigot.

It’s not as if Obama shies away from lecturing people about faith. Saying the words “radical Islam” is a step too far, but bringing up events from the year 1095 to create a tortured moral equivalence is just fine. Not only has Obama implored us to avoid critical rhetoric about Islam, but he demands that Americans (secular apostates like myself included) act as if all faiths are equally tolerant of our lives. This is the president who tells the world that “the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.” Can you imagine Obama going to the United Nations General Assembly and declaring the same for Jesus Christ?

Exempting Islam from discourse is to place Muslims outside the norms of American debate.

Nor has Obama hesitated to lecture Christians, who supposedly use religious freedom as an “excuse” for “discrimination,” to evolve and abandon their antiquated ways. After years of propaganda equating evangelicals with Islamic fundamentalists (who aren’t the true adherents of Islam, according to pundits who’ve probably never read a single book about the faith), many liberals make no distinction between the two anymore. For them, supporting the idea sex-specific bathrooms is only a small step from massacring gay Americans. This is what denial of reality can do to a society. You can see it all manifesting in liberal punditry.

Obama isn’t a secret Muslim, and, regardless of what many people tell me, I’m sure his intentions are good. But abdication of the most obvious truths allows demagogues like Donald Trump to appear to be brave truth-tellers. Blaming all Muslims is as dumb as pretending this terror has nothing to do with Islam. One absurd position just reinforces the other.

“We have a proposal from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee to bar all Muslims from immigrating to America,” Obama explained, claiming that those kinds of ideas do the terrorists’ job for them. I’m sure that Trump’s rhetoric on this matter is highly counterproductive. But if you’re willing to murder scores of innocent people in the name of Islam because a blowhard U.S. presidential candidate has an immigration proposal you dislike, that’s a you problem and an Islam problem before it’s a Trump problem. Also, the idea that we have a president more willing to accuse the GOP nominee of instigating terrorism than he is willing to accuse radical Islam is a problem for all of us.

Don’t you wish Obama would get this worked up about the FBI, which allowed Omar Mateen to slip away from two investigations?

Exempting Islam from discourse is to place Muslims outside the norms of American debate. This is a luxury no other political philosophy or theology enjoys. Obviously, this helps us make events like this about gay marriage or guns or whatever liberal agenda item can be squeezed from tragedy. That would be fine if we weren’t also asked to ignore the actual problem.

Islamists use planes and bombs, and sometimes guns. You can believe all the things you want about the NRA, the availability of “weapons of war,” and Christian homophobia, and still believe that Islamic terrorism is a unique movement that threatens us in a way that the random madman opening fire in a theater does not. Liberals love to point out how rare Islamic-inspired violence is—let’s ban white men! But they fail to point out that we spend billions every year to stop terrorism. If we didn’t, we’d be in for yearly 9/11s.

By the way, don’t you wish Obama would get this worked up about the FBI, which allowed Omar Mateen to slip away from two investigations—one of those, reportedly, because he blamed his actions on Islamophobia? Law enforcement sources now say that Disney notified the FBI that Omar and his wife may have been casing the amusement park back in April. Maybe there was nothing actionable for FBI. So rather than suggesting we undermine the Fifth Amendment and Second Amendment, maybe it’s time to ask why the billions of dollars we spend fighting terrorism are failing.

Mostly, though, I’m not sure why a peaceful Muslim would not appreciate being set apart from Islamists by the president. “Radical Islam” distinguishes between extremists and moderates. Other than allowing liberals to accuse anyone who brings up theological problems of being Islamophobic, what other purpose does ignoring this distinction achieve? The president has yet to explain.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/15/by-rejecting-radical-islam-obama-substitutes-political-correctness-for-reality/,2016-06-15
Islamic Terrorists Are Not Motivated By Hate,"After an American Muslim who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State killed 50 people and injured 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, President Obama said it was an act of hate. This portrayal has led people across the country to focus on homophobia and gun control instead of exposing the real motivation so we can recognize the actual threat.

While any atrocity like this is certainly hateful, we would be remiss to simply leave it at that, because we’d fail to comprehend the complex motivations that set a man like Omar Mateen apart from other mass killers. That failure to comprehend only increases our vulnerability.

It is imperative for us to understand that the driving impulse of a man like Mateen is religious in nature. A lot is being said about how he beat his ex-wife and that he made homophobic comments to coworkers, but this behavior is part of his belief system, which allows men to beat their wives, to put homosexuals to death, and to slaughter unbelievers en masse.

Terrorists’ Main Motivation Is Religion

This last part is stated in Surah 9:14, “Fight them [unbelievers]; Allah will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the breasts of a believing people.” Also, “They shall be slaughtered, or crucified, or their hands and feet shall alternately be struck off; or they shall be banished from the land. That is a degradation for them in this world; and in the world to come awaits them a mighty chastisement.”

The jihadist’s act of killing, therefore, becomes less about hate and more about honor and righteousness. Those who obey Allah, who “cast into the hearts of the unbelievers terror,” who “fight them till there is no persecution and the religion is Allah’s,” will be richly rewarded for their righteous act. They fight—and they die—for the “gift of Paradise.”

“The person who participates in [Holy Battles] in Allah’s cause and nothing compels him do so except belief in Allah and His Apostle, will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward, or booty [if he survives] or will be admitted to Paradise [if he is killed]” (Al Bukhari vol 1:35).

Mohommed Bouyeri, who murdered Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh, explained his motivations when he said “what moved me to do what I did was purely my faith. I was motivated by the law that commands me to cut off the head of anyone who insults Allah and his Prophet.”

It is important to understand this core motivation of Islamic terrorists in order to identify and stop them. If we continue to characterize these mass killings as events disassociated from Islamic doctrine and faith, placing the blame totally on personal hateful impulses, we will fail to identify our enemy. If we can’t identify him—if we can’t name him—we won’t know him, which means we can’t defeat him.

These Are Acts of Religious War

We will also fail to recognize that this is an act of war by a group of people who have no wall of separation between the religious and the political. As terrorism expert Sebastian Gorka said, “stop calling the Orlando shooting a hate crime. Nobody should be shocked by the attack. This is what jihadists had been planning to do after Paris, after Brussels.” This isn’t a hate crime; it’s not a tragedy, like a train being derailed. “This is part of the Global Jihad strategy. It’s not an accident—it’s a war against America. . . . it is part of an ideological military assault on the United States of America.”

It is, in reality, a religious war, driven by religious doctrine (in this case radical Islam), and carried out with religious impulses. Continuing to call this a hate crime and failing to grasp what actually defines and motivates these people will blind us to their methods, practices, and plans.

It will also cause us to look inward at ourselves instead of outward at the enemy storming our gates. We will wrongly assume we have contributed to the hate in some way, that we have done something to make them lash out and attack us. We will then erroneously conclude that there is something we can do to make them not hate us anymore. This is what leads to political correctness and weakness when we need to be bold and courageous.

The fact is we can do nothing to appease radical Islamists. They are not motivated by our policies, words, and actions, no matter how much they reference them to manipulate us. They are motivated by who we are: We are unbelievers. We are, by our very nature an offense to them. That goes for all of us, whether we are straight, gay, male, female, black, or white. We are in this together, facing an enemy who wants to kill us equally. Our response, therefore, should be a unified one, standing together against a common foe.

That foe does not act alone. Because these individuals are motivated by a divine directive and act with a communal mindset, they don’t need orders from the leaders of the Islamic State to act. For one thing, those orders have already been issued. In 2014, the chief spokesman for the Islamic State called for all supporters to kill unbelievers “in any manner or way, however it may be.”

“Do not ask for anyone’s advice and do not seek anyone’s verdict,” said Abu Mohammed al Adnani. “Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military, for they have the same ruling.”

If they want to shoot up a Christmas party where Christians are gathered, ISIS sympathizers can do that, according to their faction’s leaders. If they want to target U.S. military members because that’s their particular bugaboo at the time, then they are free to do that. Or they can target a gay nightclub, killing homosexuals with the same hand of judgment as their brethren in the Middle East who execute homosexuals by the thousands.

To Them, War Is a Means of Peace

Whatever their target, these “soldiers of Islam” are motivated by the same impulse: honor, faith, and the glory of god. In 1998, Osama bin Laden made this clear, saying, “I am one of the servants of Allah. We do our duty of fighting for the sake of the religion of Allah.” The Taliban has stated that those who wage war on unbelievers are bound by the command “to restore to this world the light of divine justice…. For to die in the cause is to be sent immediately to paradise.”

Whatever their target, these ‘soldiers of Islam’ are motivated by the same impulse: honor, faith, and the glory of god.

Through pain, there will be healing. Out of violence, there will be peace. In death, there will be eternal life. In judgment, there will be salvation. This is what motivates the Islamic terrorist. This is what ties him to all the other radical Islamists throughout the world.

How these men and women feel about the infidels—whether they hate them or not—doesn’t really matter. Of course, if they think Allah considers unbelievers to be evildoers who need to be eradicated by any means necessary, then they probably will hate them—for “righteousness sake.” But it’s not a prerequisite. What they desire is to bring glory to Allah.

They don’t need marching orders or emails with instructions. They don’t need a green light from ISIS headquarters. All they need is the courage and the opportunity to do what Allah has commanded—because, according to their faith and doctrine, it is the right thing to do.

Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the militant Islamist from Jordan who ran a paramilitary training camp in Afghanistan, said Allah commanded them to strike unbelievers (the Kuffar), to “kill them and fight them by all means necessary to achieve the goal. The servants of Allah, who perform Jihad to elevate the word of Allah, are permitted to use any and all means necessary to strike the active unbeliever combatants for the purpose of killing them, snatch their souls from their body, cleanse the earth from the abomination, and lift their trial and persecution of the servants of Allah.

“The goal must be pursued even if the means to accomplish it affects both the intended active fighters and unintended passive ones such as women, children and any other passive category specified by our jurisprudence.”

These are the “defenders of Islam and its sanctity” who wear, as Hassan al-Smeik said, terrorism as “a badge of honor on our chests until Judgment Day.”

Assimilate, Fight, Or Be Slaughtered

The words of Mohammad Sidique Khan, who bombed a subway in London, should ring in the ears of every politician, law enforcement official, and American citizen: “Our driving motivation doesn’t come from tangible commodities that this world has to offer. Our religion is Islam—obedience to the one true God, Allah, and following the footsteps of the final prophet and messenger Muhammad… This is how our ethical stances are dictated.”

These are the ethical stances that drive true believers to shoot up a nightclub, killing dozens. These are the ethical stances that require either death or obedience, slaughter or conversion to Islam: “Repent, and perform the prayer, and pay the alms,” the holy text says to unbelievers. If we do this, we will be allowed to live.

In other words, assimilate or die. This is unacceptable to every liberty-loving American, and it’s why we must fight back with courage, solidarity, and strength, without appeasement or apology. We must be willing to look our enemy in the eye as a united free people and call him by the name he has given himself—the name of Islam.

New York Times Can't Figure Out Orlando Terrorist's Motive,"The radical Islamist terrorist responsible for the attack in an Orlando nightclub that killed at least 49 people called a local television station during his rampage with a chilling message.

“I’m the shooter. It’s me,” the terrorist told News 13 in Orlando. “I did it for ISIS. I did it for the Islamic State,” he said, according to a Washington Post account of the call.

Which brings us to today’s lead editorial in the New York Times. The NYT editorial board, you see, is having some real trouble figuring out who’s responsible for what happened in Orlando. And they cannot figure out what the heck the motive was. When Bruce Jenner tells the New York Times that he’s a girl, by golly he’s a girl. But when a gay Muslim registered Democrat terrorist in the midst of a killing spree declares to the news media that he “did it for the Islamic State,” it is just impossible for the New York Times and its ilk to figure out the true identity of this inscrutable killer. How do you solve a puzzle like sharia?

The New York Times has no clue. This was an actual phrase that an actual human deliberately wrote and published in the NYT today: “While the precise motivation for the rampage remains unclear[.]” Linger on that for a moment. Surround yourself with it. Drink it in:

While the precise motivation for the rampage remains unclear, it is evident that Mr. Mateen was driven by hatred toward gays and lesbians. Hate crimes don’t happen in a vacuum. They occur where bigotry is allowed to fester, where minorities are vilified and where people are scapegoated for political gain. Tragically, this is the state of American politics, driven too often by Republican politicians who see prejudice as something to exploit, not extinguish.

The terrorist called a news network and declared “I did it for ISIS/I did it for the Islamic State,” and the New York Times editorial board cannot identify the “precise motivation for the rampage.” But lest ye fear, the esteemed editors over there know exactly who the real villain is. No, it’s not the gay Muslim registered Democrat who murdered at least 49 people. It couldn’t possibly his fault.

Here’s who the New York Times blames, in order: Republican politicians, Republican-led state legislatures, Republican governors, Republican federal lawmakers, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, anyone who believes in traditional marriage, anyone who’s ever voted to preserve traditional marriage, and anyone who has ever voted for anyone who believes in or has voted to preserve traditional marriage.

Just as a mentally ill conspiracy theorist can watch video of the moon landing and see nothing but government lies and Hollywood movie sets, the New York Times looks at the pool of blood spilled by an Islamic terrorist who pledged allegiance to the Islamic state and see’s nothing but the outline of the GOP elephant. Where you and I see a plane flying through the sky, the New York Times sees deadly chemtrails laced with Republican rhetoric. While you may think fluoridated water is good for your teeth, the New York Times is pretty convinced it’s a GOP plot to get a radical Islamist terrorist to shoot up a gay nightclub.

In a 600-word editorial about the terrorist massacre in Orlando, the New York Times editorial board names seven Republican politicians. It doesn’t use the world Islam or any of its variants a single time. And it certainly doesn’t mention ISIS, the Islamic terrorist conglomerate which President Barack Obama once characterized as a “JV team” to justify his deliberate refusal to eradicate the group before it became a violent global force.

In the fantasyland of modern progressive politics, if a boy identifies as a girl, then he’s a girl. But if a gay Muslim registered Democrat identifies as a martyr for the Islamic State, he’s still a Republican.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/15/the-new-york-times-cant-figure-out-the-orlando-terrorists-motive/,2016-06-15
Anderson Cooper’s Orlando Ranting Is Bad For America,"Many members of the nation’s elite media and political institutions have not exactly covered themselves with glory in the days following the ISIS attack on Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Early on Sunday morning, a Florida man who repeatedly explained that his terrorism was in support of ISIS, an Islamist terrorist organization, murdered 49 of his fellow Americans and injured several dozen more at a gay nightclub.

This is the second extremely successful ISIS attack on American soil and the biggest U.S. terror attack since Al Qaeda bombed the United States with four airplanes in 2001. The December 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino was also done on behalf of ISIS, whose model encourages independent action against Western interests and people. Information and encouragement are provided generally over the Internet, and independent members pledge their support only upon commencement of their terrorism.

As The New York Times’ ISIS reporter Rukmini Callimachi has explained, the “lone wolf” strategy employed by the San Bernardino and Orlando terrorists was conceived at least six years ago by Al Qaeda but executed best by Islamic State, which is better at social media and inspiring mentally disturbed individuals such as Orlando terrorist Omar Mateen. Of course, Daveed Gartentstein-Ross notes that authorities can overdo “lone wolf” designations, thereby failing to see ISIS network connections that aren’t immediately obvious.

ISIS readily accepted Mateen’s pledge of support, and the group’s social media accounts have been pushing the Orlando shooting as a model for other lone wolf jihadists to follow. Far too many in the media have decided that the reality of what transpired and what it portends is too difficult to deal with and challenges too many of their strongly held assumptions and political positions. Instead, they chose to use this tragedy to target their own political enemies.

Far too many in the media have used this tragedy to target their own political enemies.

Based on information we have as of now, Mateen was a longtime supporter of terrorism, having cheered 9/11 — on 9/11! — according to his high school classmates who witnessed his response. He was married twice and had a son but also propositioned men on gay dating apps and in real life, according to some reporters. In fact, he was a longtime Pulse patron, witnesses say. He had cased Disneyland and other populated places before deciding on Pulse. He’s a radicalized Muslim who scared former colleagues with violent rhetoric and claims of terrorist ties. The FBI repeatedly investigated him, but nothing came of it. He was a domestic abuser, according to his ex-wife. He was a registered Democrat and son of an anti-American politician.

Despite all that, the media and others on the Left decided to cover this terrorist attack by going after people who support self-government and its Second Amendment; people who pray to God in times of tragedy; people who believe the definition of marriage is the union of one man and one woman; people who accept the biological reality and implications of distinct sexes; people who are Republican; people who are traditional Christians; and so on and so forth. The media followed up by cheerleading this incivility.

It is probably most charitable to view this process as a reflection of the media’s inability to deal with its own grief. This is a general societal problem, as the recent shooting of the gorilla Harambe showed. We don’t have the vocabulary for expressing sadness in the fallen world, resorting immediately to blame and politicization of tragedy to help us cope and feel more secure.

This Is the Media’s Religious Response

The religious ritual the media is most devoted to post-terrorism (or other shooting incident) is the liturgical plea to restrict the Second Amendment. Sometimes there are additional rituals. Insofar as victims are from the same side as the media in a culture clash, they use tragedy as a means to bludgeon people on the other side of the clash. So here, where the victims of the Islamist terrorist were at a gay club, we have seen the ritual denunciation of anyone who opposes the declared writ and doctrines of the sexual revolution. There’s a Muslim-sized loophole in this denunciation, by which I mean that Muslims are silently (if deafeningly!) excused from the media’s opprobrium. We’re learning post-Orlando that this is the case even when the sole perpetrator of the terrorism is himself Muslim.

This is not an exaggeration. The Daily Beast was quick out of the gate with a Paul Ryan-is-the-real-monster-of-Orlando approach. The New York Times ran a lengthy editorial pinning the blame for Orlando on Republicans for their views on marriage redefinition. Really. Stephen Hayes’ critique of the editorial, which did not mention Islam, is worth a read:

The entire editorial is an extended non-sequitur, a paroxysm of partisanship unworthy of publication in America’s paper of record — unworthy of publication, for that matter, in Salon or even the comments section of a left-wing website. It’s an utter embarrassment.

And yet even in this context of pious displacement of reality, CNN’s Anderson Cooper stands out. On Tuesday, he “absolutely grilled” Florida attorney general Pam Bondi. Her crime? She was helping victims of the terrorism, even though she had defended Florida voters in litigation against redefining marriage to include same-sex couples. Florida’s very constitution defined marriage as the union of man and woman, and she wrote court briefs explaining the harm caused by redefining marriage into something else.

Cooper believes very strongly that it’s hypocritical, in any way, to support the idea that marriage is ontologically the union of man and woman while also believing that gay people should not be murdered by Islamist terrorists. So he took issue with her advocacy of victims of the terrorism. Bondi repeatedly tried to return the interview to the subject of what was being done to help victims while Cooper said things like, “Well it is gay pride month; you’ve never tweeted about gay pride month.” (Really.) He further said that legal arguments about the “harm” of redefining marriage were actually claims that “gay people are harming” Florida. He said she’d “gone after” gays and sarcastically asked her if she really thought she was a champion of the gay community. Then he repeatedly suggested that this meant she had incited the terrorist in Orlando. He was belligerent and insulting and childish.

He ended by saying he’d gone ahead and checked on her Twitter history for a year (a real life version of Seinfeld’s Wear The Ribbon sketch) and had seen no indication that she had shown proper deference to gay rights. Cooper then suggested that, in the future, she better get into line and show proper fealty to gay rights. He spoke for most of the “interview,” turning it into a petulant lecture about the importance of conformity to media elites.

Instead of asking questions in search of truth, Cooper chose to bully and dominate. Instead of an exchange of ideas — even if journalists aren’t supposed to be advocating their personal views — he tried to impose his doctrines and shame the non-conformist.

Other Media Cheer

Other media outlets ate it up. The Washington Post had a piece detailing the exchange as did The Hill. An editor at The Daily Beast thought the line of questioning was “nice.” The Daily Beast was super jazzed about the story, running several pieces on the exchange, including one from Lloyd Grove who gushed that Cooper was “uncompromising.” Indeed he was, if by uncompromising we mean “showing an unwillingness to make concessions to others, especially by changing one’s ways or opinions.”

As part of his post-grilling tour of triumph, he told a thankful New York Times with a straight face that “I’m not trying to push an agenda. I’m not here to be an advocate, railing at the top of my lungs at injustices; that’s the role other people have.” Yes, arguing repeatedly that you can’t oppose jihadist murdering of gays if you do so much as acknowledge the definition of marriage on which all societies have been based isn’t advocacy at all. Are you freaking kidding me?

A person must share the sexual groupthink of media elites to express solidarity with victims of a jihadist murderer? You’re not allowed to mourn or offer sympathies for the dead and wounded unless you support redefining marriage? That’s idiotic.

Do CNN Reporters Wish Death on Their Political Opponents?

No member of the media asked anyone opposed to religious liberty if they were hypocritical for decrying Dylann Roof’s murder of Charleston churchgoers. There was no introspection about whether CNN and other media outlets’ constant denigration and mockery of religion and religious belief had played a role in spreading the view that religious people needed to be snuffed out. New York Times reporter Jeremy Peters took time off of running interference for Nancy Pelosi to complain that Republicans weren’t mentioning that Pulse was a gay nightclub as much as they should have been. He added:

If this happened at a church & liberals weren’t calling it an attack on Christians, the right wouldn’t be outraged? https://t.co/oDZjjMYcOd

Except that you might recall when the black Christians were shot inside a church in Charleston by a racist, the media moved right past the victims — their religious identification and their forgiving families — in order to spend weeks obsessing on … Confederate flags. In this terrorism aftermath, no member of the mainstream media has told a single Muslim leader he has no business speaking on the Orlando tragedy given his religion’s views on sexual ethics, much less berated him and told him he would be hypocritical to do so. That type of journalism would be unthinkable.

Destroying Civility

If you want to talk about harm to America, Anderson Cooper is harming America by politicizing our present tragedy in such a grotesque fashion. He’s saying that the country can’t come together and mourn the loss of life unless they share his sexual ethics and advocate for them.

Anderson Cooper is harming America by politicizing our present tragedy in such a grotesque fashion.

How shameful that Cooper would seek to elevate identity politics over shared values during a time of national loss. Longtime media guy Lloyd Grove giddily wrote that “Anderson Cooper Is the Anchor We Need Now” because he “pulverizes conservatives.”

That’s not what we need right now. How juvenile and stupid to say that this is needed ever, much less now. My brother and I were talking on Sunday about the horrific terrorism in Orlando. He recalled how some media had tried to say Christian victims might have been partly responsible for the San Bernardino terrorism. Making the point that it would be even crazier to pass blame in this attack, he said he’d just like to see them try to transition blame. I guess our media showed him! Beginning within hours, the Left and their media allies turned an Islamist attack on hundreds of gay Americans and their friends against conservatives and Christians. It’s appalling, but at this point it’s not surprising.

As some media figures have admitted, they’re too scared to critique Islam. It’s easier to pick fights with Christians and the those who support traditional values than discuss, much less confront, Islamist violence or even just Muslim intolerance of gays. Americans don’t need groupthink encomiums in praise of Cooper or totalitarian conformity of thought, word, and deed. Cooper’s journalism is boorish and beneath him. Cooper’s little performance, and his defensiveness of same, is typical mainstream media cowardice being presented as tough journalism.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/16/anderson-coopers-orlando-ranting-is-bad-for-america/,2016-06-16
"In Orlando, Obama Plays Dumb About The Terrorist's Motives","President Obama visited Orlando Thursday to pay his respects to the 49 people who were killed in the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.

In his remarks, Obama failed to mention the actual motivation for the terrorist attack: a radical Islamist terrorist who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State sought revenge against the United States for its foreign policy. In fact, Obama never once mentioned the words “Islam” or “jihad.” When the president did mention Islamist terror groups, such as ISIS and al-Qaeda, he described them not as adherents to a virulent ideology that demands genocide against non-Muslims, but as garden-variety groups that spread propaganda that sometimes influences mentally unstable people.

Here is how Obama described ISIS’s role in the Orlando terror attack (emphasis added):

So whatever the motivations of the killer, whatever influences led him down the path of violence and terror, whatever propaganda he was consuming from ISIL and Al Qaida, this was an act of terrorism, but it was also an act of hate. This was an attack on the LGBT community.

Notice how he skirts the killer’s self-described motivations: an allegiance to the Islamic State and a desire to kill on its behalf, which the killer made clear in a 911 call and another call to a news station during the attack. Instead, Obama describes the terrorist in almost victim-like terms, including passive-tense language, as if he were a vulnerable individual who was just walking around one day and became “radicalized” in the same way someone catches a cold.

Later in his speech, Obama blamed the attack on the terrorist’s ability to procure a gun. The president also blamed Republican lawmakers who refuse to pass Obama’s plan to eliminate due process protections provided by the Fifth Amendment. To Obama, the Second and Fifth Amendments–not violent, radical Islam or its practictioners–were the real perpetrators:

We can’t anticipate or catch every single deranged person that may wish to do harm to his neighbors or his friends or his coworkers or strangers. But we can do something about the amount of damage that they do. Unfortunately, our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual like those in Aurora and Newtown to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons, and they can do so legally.



[…]



The notion that the answer to this tragedy would be to make sure that more people in a nightclub are similarly armed to the killer defies common sense. Those who defend the easy accessibility of assault weapons should meet these families and explain why that makes sense.

When Obama did speak about the terrorist, Obama deliberately conflated him with the Newtown and Aurora shooters — neither of whom had any coherent ideology, connection to terror cells, or religious affiliations with Islam or any other religious belief system — while ignoring that the Orlando terrorist proactively declared his allegiance to ISIS and his desire to murder in the group’s name on behalf of the group’s stated goal of murdering infidels:

We can’t anticipate or catch every single deranged person that may wish to do harm to his neighbors or his friends or his coworkers or strangers. But we can do something about the amount of damage that they do. Unfortunately, our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual like those in Aurora and Newtown to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons, and they can do so legally.



[…]



Now, those who were killed and injured here were gunned down by a single killer with a powerful assault weapon. The motives of this killer may have been different than the mass shooters in Aurora or Newtown. But the instruments of death were so similar. And now another 49 innocent people are dead; another 53 are injured; some are still fighting for their lives; some will have wounds that will last a lifetime.

Obama is so eager to bury the killer’s allegiance to radical Islamism that he talks about the killer’s motivations as though they’re a mystery wrapped in an enigma, in spite of the fact that the terrorist repeatedly declared his motivations in clear English to anyone who would listen.

The president’s remarks in Orlando are only the latest instance of his deliberate refusal to say the words “radical Islam,” and that’s a problem. America needs a president who will accurately define the enemy, because you cannot defeat an enemy when you won’t even acknowledge its existence.

FBI: Censoring ‘ISIS’ From Transcripts Will Stop Terrorism,"In a press conference in Orlando on Monday, an FBI agent said that censoring the word “ISIS” from the Orlando terrorist’s 911 call will stop future attacks.

During his attack on a gay night club in Orlando, Omar Mateen placed three calls to 911, in which he claimed allegiance to ISIS and to the leader of the Islamic State several times, according to public statements made by FBI Director James Comey.

19. Here's transcript of FBI director Comey's on 6/13 where he states Mateen pledged to ISIS leader + named him: pic.twitter.com/TQmFzTXbH4 — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) June 20, 2016

But now, the FBI is attempting to hide that information so as to not “inflame other people,” Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ronald Hopper explained.

“Part of the redacting is meant it not give credence to individuals who have done terrorist acts in the past,” Hopper said. “We’re not going to propagate their violent rhetoric and we see no effort to putting those individuals names back out there. We are trying to prevent future action from happening. And for cowards like this one, people like that influence them so we’re not going to continue to put their names out front.”

When a reporter asked why the FBI doesn’t want to let the shooter speak for himself, Hopper responded that the agency is afraid that other “like-minded” people could get the wrong idea.

“We’re not going to propagate violent rhetoric that comes from other people whether they be here or overseas and to do that would only inflame other people here that might be like-minded,” he said. “There’s no purpose in doing that.”

Although Mateen called himself an Islamic fighter multiple times, the FBI is looking into other motivations Mateen might have had when he decided to murder people in a gay nightclub.

“We’re actually looking into any potential motive,” Hopper said. “We’re not limiting ourselves to coming up with just one motive. We’re looking at a myriad of things right now and that actually is ongoing as we speak, both through social media, friend contacts, people that have only met the individual for one time. That’s why we’re asking for anybody and everybody that’s had any contact with this individual to come forward so we can piece that information together for potential other motives as well.”

Even with the word “ISIS” redacted from the transcript, the shooter’s motivations are clear as day, as New York Times reporter Rukmini Callimachi pointed out.

In the beginning of the transcript of the 911 call, Mateen declares that his actions are to bring glory to Allah — which has been translated “God” in the transcript.

8. Despite FBI's redactions, we see that loud & clear in this transcript. Let's look at it step by step. He begins with ""In the name of God"" — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) June 20, 2016

Even the grammar indicates that Mateen was pledging allegiance to a male person, and eyewitness accounts and earlier FBI statements confirmed that this person was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS.

18. Grammar indicates he's pledging allegiance to a male person. I don't get why FBI is redacting Baghdadi's name when earlier FBI confirmed — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) June 20, 2016

During a crisis negotiation call with authorities, Mateen referred to himself as an Islamic soldier.

27. Other interesting tidbits: Mateen refers to self as ""Islamic soldier,"" calls for end to airstrikes pic.twitter.com/MkQr95uGGs — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) June 20, 2016

The FBI’s decision to retroactively censor the word “ISIS” from the transcript after the director of the FBI stated publicly that the terrorist claimed allegiance to the terror group and the leader of a radical Islamist movement makes no sense.

The shooter was motivated by a radical ideology and stated publicly multiple times that he was acting on behalf of a terror group. Redacting words to make some people feel good doesn’t change what Mateen did or why, it just makes us ill-equipped to counteract the threat such an enemy poses to the safety and freedom of Americans. It also insults Muslims the world over by acting as if they are so mentally fragile that hearing someone has murdered others in their religion’s name will cause them to do the same.

Obama Admin Deletes ISIS References From Orlando 911 Calls,"Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Sunday that the FBI will delete mentions of ISIS when they release transcripts of the 911 calls Omar Mateen made during his attack on an Orlando nightclub.

When Chuck Todd asked Lynch what was going to be left out of the transcript, she said, “What we’re not going to do is further proclaim this man’s pledges of allegiance to terrorist groups and further his propaganda.” Lynch told CNN’s Dana Bash that the whitewashing of the terrorist’s ISIS pledge was being done to “avoid revictimizing those who went through this horror.”

This is just the latest in a series of efforts by the Obama administration to downplay ISIS terrorism and other radical Islamist terrorism. Last week, President Obama angrily claimed that correctly identifying radical Islamist terror as radical Islamist terror was silly and wouldn’t improve the Obama administration’s strategy for combatting the threat it poses.

“What exactly would using this label accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to trying to kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is, none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction.”



The president added: “There’s no magic to the phrase, ‘radical Islam.’ It’s a political talking point; it’s not a strategy.”

And in April, the White House edited a video of French President discussing “Islamist terrorism,” later blaming it on a technical glitch when critics complained. Here are four problems with Obama’s approach.

1) If The White House Wants to Downplay ISIS, This Doesn’t Do That

For reasons they haven’t made even remotely clear, members of the Obama administration from the big guy on down have tried to pooh-pooh Islamist terrorism. Byron York catalogued some instances of this in January 2015.

In a January 2014 New Yorker interview, he said the analogy used around the White House to describe the ISIS threat was, “If a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant.” A May 2013 speech at National Defense University included the line, “Today, the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on a path to defeat. Their remaining operatives spend more time thinking about their own safety than plotting against us.” A 2010 New York Times article said White House officials “have made a point of disassociating Islam from terrorism in public comments, using the phrase ‘violent extremism’ in place of words like ‘jihad’ and ‘Islamic terrorism.'” York noted that the media cheered on such downplaying, saying that Obama could basically put up a “mission accomplished” banner and be done with it. Islamist terrorism was done.

The Obama administration has kept with this strategy not just in the face of Charlie Hebdo, Paris, Brussels, the Kenyan shopping mall, and hotels from Mali to Libya, but also Boston, San Bernardino, Fort Hood, and Orlando.

And as Obama angrily stated last week, refusing to name threats by their actual name is a major part of his counter-terror strategy. And only idiots would think that being truthful about threats would help combat them. Fine! But as Gabriel Malor pointed out, transcript deletion of ISIS is a good example of the Streisand effect. Wikipedia defines that as, “The phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet.”

I’m not down with the goal of downplaying ISIS but if that’s your goal, removing information that the public eventually has access to in Florida, and going on talk shows to announce that you’ve deleted countervailing information from the transcript is not a good way to accomplish that goal.

2) It Doesn’t Help Victims

Lynch said they are removing the pledges to ISIS to avoid “revictimizing those who went through this horror.” Oh, come on. The only people horrified by the mere mention of ISIS are in the White House. It’s not like the men and women who barely survived murder at the hands of an ISIS terrorist can handle listening to the entirety of the call they witnessed first hand except for the ISIS pledge. Why would that pose a significant problem? In point of fact, it has seemed to be a cathartic part of the recovery process for these survivors to recount how they have none of the doubt the mainstream media and Democratic politicians have about Mateen’s motivation.

I read one New York Times story where a survivor was quoted:

“He got mad and hung up,” Orlando said. He never heard Mr. Mateen mention gay people — he spoke only about the Islamic State and Syria, and about the damage he still intended to do.

Survivor Patience Carter said:

“But through that conversation with 911, he said that the reason why he was doing this is because he wanted America to stop bombing his country,” she said.



“So the motive is very clear to us who are laying [sic] in our own blood and other people’s blood, who were injured, who were shot — that we knew what his motive was and he wasn’t going to stop killing people until he was killed, until he felt like his message got out there.”

The victims aren’t “revictimized” by acknowledging the reality of the terrorist’s motive. They and their fellow Americans have a right to know what this terrorist said as he murdered 49 clubgoers and injured scores more.

3) Team Obama Treating Words as Magical

In his anti-Trump tirade, President Obama said, “There’s no magic to the phrase, ‘radical Islam.’ It’s a political talking point; it’s not a strategy.”

Which is a really weird thing to say about a phrase that he avoids as if it were a magical incantation. Being afraid to speak truthfully about radical Islam is ascribing a certain magic to words!

The Harry Potter series has a character who is so feared that the other characters won’t say his name and call him, “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.” The name is considered so powerful that, in one book, anyone who utters it can be traced.

Failure to identify radical Islamist terrorism as radical Islamist terrorism — or to acknowledge Islamist terror attacks as Islamist terror attacks — gives the term far more power than it needs to have, and it gives Islamist terrorists an almost magical power over foreign policy discussions in the Obama White House.

Removing these words from the transcript does nothing but fuel the claims that Obama is in denial about Islamist terror or otherwise ill-suited to handle security threats.

4) Telling People to Calm Down Never Works

The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg recently wrote, “Obama believes that the clash is taking place within a single civilization, and that Americans are sometimes collateral damage in this fight between Muslim modernizers and Muslim fundamentalists.” According to Goldberg, he’s well aware that Islam has a serious problem with violent elements. But he thinks that the fight against ISIS is not our battle and that if 49 partygoers are mowed down, that’s just “collateral damage.”

There are many problems with the implementation of the this-not-America’s-problem vision, including that our foreign policy seems designed to aggravate the problem rather than truly avoid it. But let’s set that aside.

Americans have just witnessed their second successful ISIS attack on American soil and the response of the White House is to pooh-pooh ISIS involvement, to change the conversation — again! — into Second Amendment limitations, and to suggest that it’s not as big a deal as people are making it out to be.

Whatever Obama’s actual strategy to counter terror is, the messaging sounds a lot like, “Calm down about ISIS.” And telling people to calm down about something is never a good idea. Telling people to calm down when they have 49 very legitimate reasons not to is even worse.

Dealing with the reality of ISIS and other radical Islamist terrorist organizations by acknowledging their reality and the role they play is not a full strategy for combating them, although it is good groundwork for same. But the Obama administration is doing a horrible job of demonstrating that denialism about same is an even remotely acceptable strategy.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/20/obama-admin-deletes-isis-references-from-orlando-911-calls/,2016-06-20
4 Major Problems With Gun Control Arguments,"Every mass shooting and act of terror is an opportunity for liberals to push gun control. Something must be done to stop gun violence, but there are four problems with the liberal argument for gun control. These are: (1) hypocrisy; (2) reality; (3) misapplication of blame; and (4) discrimination. In the end, there is a better, more reasonable solution.

1. Gun Control Hypocrisy

Gun control contains three types of hypocrisy. The first is the contradiction of protection (value of human life), the second is the contradiction of solution (terrorism and criminals), and the third is the contradiction of right-control.

The argument for gun control is, essentially: human life is valuable, killing humans is wrong, guns kill humans, so, limit access to guns to protect human life. Liberals’ wish to protect human life, however, does not apply to everyone, since under their policies some life is not valuable, like those of the preborn.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said whether a baby in the womb is human doesn’t have anything to do with policy. To win over pro-abortion women, Hillary Clinton said the Constitution does not protect the unborn. Liberal policy is to ignore the value of some life to advance a perceived “right” to attain votes.

When society arbitrarily dictates which life has value, it does two things: (1) fosters a culture where not all human life has value, so some humans can be discarded or treated less than others, to the point of killing them; and (2) says humans can arbitrarily decide which human life has value. So, aborting some (preborn) is warranted and morally acceptable because they do not have value, while aborting others (born) is unwarranted and immoral because they have value.

It’s contradictory to argue that access to an instrument (guns) should be limited because a class of people (born) have value, but simultaneously that access to other instruments (vacuum, uterine currette, syringe, embryotomy scissors, Dubois embryotomy decapitating scissors) should not be limited because a class of people (preborn) have no value.

The second problem is the contradiction of solutions. The liberal answer for defeating violent extremism (i.e., radical Islamic terrorism) is jobs and social programs. Vice President Joe Biden, at a three-day White House summit on terrorism, opened by stating societies must provide economic alternatives to terrorism. Marie Harf, a spokeswoman for the State Department, told Chris Mathews on “Hardball” that we must counter terrorism by providing job opportunities. In February 2015, President Obama’s framework for fighting violent extremism was education, jobs, and social programs. So if the root cause of violence and the solution to violent extremism overseas is job opportunities, education, and social programs, it should be the political solution to violence in America. Not gun control.

Third, liberals ensure Americans that government control of guns is not a restriction on Second-Amendment rights. This is a contradiction in right-control.

When Hillary spoke this year at the Hartford Connecticut YMCA, she said that as president she would change the “gun culture,” and could do this consistent with the Second Amendment. Liberals wouldn’t tolerate language like, “As president I would change the death culture, controlling abortion consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment,” or, “As president I would change discrimination toward women by limiting access to pornography.” When some states or organizations want to change the “death culture” or “porn culture” consistent with the Fourteenth or First Amendments, liberals accuse them of sending America back to the Stone Age, and Planned Parenthood or the ACLU sues.

2. Gun Control Doesn’t Respond to Reality

Some want to turn what’s illegal into a right (e.g., drugs, prostitution, or illegal immigration) or argue that decriminalizing certain things (e.g. drugs or prostitution) lessens crimes. About guns, however, the argument is the opposite. Either it’s viewed as a “right” not to protect or argued that criminalizing it would lessen crimes.

Making guns illegal or restricting access to them won’t end gun violence. By analogy, possession and use of many controlled substances is illegal, yet people possess and use them. Indeed, illegal drug overdose is the leading cause of death in America (a study released by the Drug Enforcement Agency found that overdose death is the leading cause of injury death in the United States, over vehicles and firearms).

Obama has used Australia and England as lofty examples of Western societies ending gun violence. However, depending on the study cited, there is no clear and convincing evidence that gun homicides in Australia have declined since the ban on certain weapons and their buyback plan (National Firearms Agreement). Studies do agree that suicide rates have declined.

The Associated Press, though, says criminologists agree the National Firearms Agreement has reduced gun homicides. Results following England’s self-proclaimed “toughest gun control laws in the world” are known and are not good; crimes using banned weapons have risen. At a glance, gun control in Australia (which doesn’t have a Bill of Rights), seems to have decreased gun violence; yet, it depends on the studies. In reality, however, prohibiting an act or an object does not necessarily reduce crime or violence.

3. Gun Control Misapplies Blame

Journalists and many politicians blame guns, mental illness, or some other thing when a shooting occurs. Although mental illness could be a contributing factor, it is not the cause. After Columbine, the media also blamed Marilyn Manson. Manson’s response was twofold: (1) times have not become more violent, just more televised and (2) the blame for the shootings is not music but us: “When it comes down to who’s to blame for the high school murders in Littleton, Colorado, throw a rock and you’ll hit someone who’s guilty.”

Violence is not something new to this world. Before guns there was violence and mass killings. What has changed is the mass production of violence and its glamorization. Movies and video games romanticize violence or make it grotesque, desensitizing the conscious and natural disdain towards it. When the heart becomes numb to violence and taught to act on passions, a violent reaction will occur when someone decides to act. As Jesus said, it is not what is put into the mouth that defiles a man, but what comes out of the heart. Blame falls not on the instrument, but on us as individuals for defiling our hearts.

4. Gun Control Is Discriminatory

The Contradiction of Protection above leads to discrimination. Advocating for laws to protect one group while disregarding the rights of another is discrimination. A country having gone through a Civil War that nearly ripped it apart once treated blacks as property and women as second-class citizens. It still treats babies and women as property and babies as second-class. It is discrimination to say Germans should live but not Jews, whites should live but not blacks, the born should live but not the preborn.

It’s a utilitarian worldview centered on the self to discriminately apply the Constitution or natural rights on only certain groups so the majority within a protected class can live in harmony. Selfishness of rights breeds violence. We think ourselves advanced, caring, and tolerant, but still foster discrimination and violence towards certain groups when advocating for laws that protect one class over another. Advocating for gun control while advocating for abortion and pornography is utilitarian selfishness, based on the premise that the preborn and women can be discriminated against while appearing altruistic.

What We Should Do Instead

First, foster a culture of respect for all human life, from conception to natural death. Also, in response to mass shootings, the response should be focused on the shooter’s depraved heart and the religion or philosophy that drives him, not on the instrument used to kill. Individuals must start to control what comes into the heart, and society must root itself in virtue, the Commandments, the Beatitudes, and spirituality.

School education needs to include moral and ethical principles founded on the natural law. Last, offering free classes on firearm safety will teach responsible use of firearms, decreasing its glamorization. Wars and crimes will never be eradicated, but violence can be substantially reduced.

"On Guns, Democrats Have Lost Their Minds","In an interview with The Washington Post, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-CT and star of Monday’s gun-control theater, explained: “We’ve got to make this clear, constant case that Republicans have decided to sell weapons to ISIS.”

Wow. That’s a pretty big deal, if true.

Progressive darling Elizabeth Warren also endorsed this tactic, alleging that Republicans — veterans, moms, dads — were willingly complicit in the murder of their neighbors on orders from the NRA. It’s common for the Left to direct absurd and histrionic accusations at the NRA, as if the organization printed its own money and derived awe-inspiring power from Mordor. It’s a lot easier than having to debate millions of American gun owners who cling to some reverence for the Second Amendment.

Although it may be lost in all the coverage, both Warren and Murphy actually voted against “common sense” gun control bills last night — twice. While Republicans wouldn’t support bills that empower bureaucrats to act as judge and jury, Democrats voted against bills that expanded background checks without undermining constitutional rights. You can’t accuse the GOP of sedition if you compromise.

We’ve come a long way since Hillary’s, “I’m sick and tired of people who say that if you debate and disagree with this administration, somehow you’re not patriotic.” The idea that the other side might be debating in good faith is no longer entertained. Appeals to emotion make no room for such subtleties.

With this, Warren is no better than Donald Trump. You will remember the media distress when Trump insinuated (and later denied) that Barack Obama was sympathetic to terrorists. You also might remember last week, when John McCain blamed the president for the rise of ISIS, and we discussed how terrible this was for an entire news cycle.

.@ChrisMurphyCT said it right: The @SenateGOP have decided to sell weapons to ISIS.



Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 20, 2016

Surely indicting a major political party — in Congress, this party represents the majority of the American people — of aiding Islamists should be an equally big deal? Surely someone will ask Clinton to denounce this incendiary rhetoric. Surely some melodramatic New York Times op-ed columnist will call out Warren for tossing “the truth around with the callous disdain of a spoiled child.” I can’t wait for the house editorials condemning attacks on decorum and cable news network break-out sessions lamenting the putrid state of civility in Washington.

Can anyone remember a Republican, even in the height of the Patriot Act debate, questioning a Democrats’ loyalty in this explicit a manner? In contrast, Ari Fleischer’s “watch what you say” comment is a mild rebuke. These days, Republicans who disagree with the president can be accused of “betting against America,” “making common cause” with hardliners who chant “Death to America,” and being guilty of conventional treason.

More consequentially, though, we’re also a long away from liberals opposing extra-judicial watchlists that adjudicate guilt without due process. On Monday, Democrats passionately argued that “potential” terrorists — a term used by more than one senator yesterday — should be denied constitutional rights. These days, Democrats refer to adherence of the Fifth Amendment as a way not to protect the innocent but as a “terror gap.”

All of which can get a little confusing. Because while Democrats in the Senate were accusing the GOP of conspiring with Salafi jihadists, the administration was still acting as if the Orlando massacre had nothing to do with ISIS — at all.

As counterproductive and absurd as the Obama administration’s initial ham-fisted release of Omar Mateen’s 911 call transcript was, it did offer us an illustration of how it wishes Americans would talk about Islamic terrorism. Which is to say, it wishes you were talking about the NRA.

By Monday afternoon, the FBI had relented and released the transcript of Mateen — sans laughable redactions — though still far from complete or accurate. And, as many of you suspected, the omitted words from the transcript were about ISIS, jihad, and other subjects Islamic terrorists tend to touch on before slaughtering innocent people. Nothing about Mitch McConnell, as of yet.

The Feds, according to NPR, were still claiming that Mateen didn’t “seem to have exhibited any of the warning signs often associated with radicalization,” and it’s possible that he was just saying the name ISIS “in hopes of getting more publicity for his attacks.”

Fact is, Mateen referred to himself as a “soldier” of the caliphate and pledged allegiance to ISIS — a group that congratulated him on his success and took credit for the attack. As Rukmini Callimachi at The New York Times has extensively detailed, Mateen was well-acquainted with the goals of ISIS and animated by its specific ideas and political aims. His act, unlike other random, lone-wolf shooters, was driven by ideas that are shared by people around the world. And though they might be geographically compartmentalized, they act in ideological concert to achieve clear goals. If they can’t use guns, they use pressure cookers or an airplane.

Rather than demanding the FBI explain its failure to protect the American people, Democrats used the attack to frame Republicans as terror sympathizers.

Rather than demanding the FBI explain its failure to protect the American people from a known terror sympathizer, Senate Democrats used the attack to frame Republicans as terror sympathizers. Rather than apologizing to the nation, the FBI spent the day offering tortured justifications for redacting Mateen’s own words, claiming that anything less would “only inflame other people here that might be like-minded.”

According to Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ronald Hopper, for example, censoring Mateen’s words would “prevent future action from happening” and “not give credence to individuals who have done terrorist acts in the past.”

Islamic Radical 1: Did you see that Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ronald Hopper refused to say the name of our organization?

Islamic Radical 2: I did! And, you know what, Omar? I hate America just a little bit less today. You know what I mean?

In their campaign to ban guns, Senate Democrats have no compunction bestowing ISIS with all the credit for the Orlando massacre. So according to the administration, this rhetoric has the potential to “inflame” prospective terrorists — unless, that is, jihadists are only irritated when Republicans talk about them. Maybe Obama will explain how this works in his next televised scolding.

In any event, if you don’t believe terrorism is an existential threat to our way of life, listen to Democrats insisting that we must circumvent constitutional protections to stay safe. Many Democrats who had previously refused to acknowledge “Islamic radicalism,” now exploit a massacre to accuse fellow Americans of abetting the worst mass shooting in American history. It’s debatable whether any of their proposals would stop terrorists, but this kind of emotional blackmail might seem like the most expedient way to pummel the opposition. It is, certainly, the most irrational.

Prepare Your Kids For The Next Terrorist Attack,"Like most Americans, I have been overwhelmed with sadness in the wake of the Orlando terrorist attacks. I wept for the loss of 49 people, and prayed for their families and the wounded still fighting for their lives. I shuddered when I learned that the terrorist who took these lives also scouted Downtown Disney for his attack, where my youngest daughter was on vacation the week he launched it. As I read about the fear and confusion that overtook the victims that Saturday night, I wondered how my own loved ones would react in the face of terror, especially my teenage daughters. The youngest victim in Orlando, Akyra Murray, was just 18 years old.

Fifteen years after 9/11, Americans have been shielded in many respects from this kind of tragic loss of life at the hands of radical Islam. While ISIS has killed thousands of innocents on its crusade through the Middle East, most Americans have stayed safe in their homes, living without regard for dangers half a world away. We have been blessed with more than a decade of peace at home, living in a free society without fear. But with the Boston bombing in 2013, the San Bernardino shootings in December, and now the Orlando attack, Islamist violence has come to our homeland.

Make no mistake: our enemies are here to stay. As long as we have leaders who refuse to call our enemies by name and recognize the role radical Islam plays in not just inspiring, but dictating violence; media who seeks to shift the blame; and a society that is unwilling to support once again taking the fight to the enemy overseas, these attacks will continue. Their leaders call for attacks against anyone who does not adhere to their religious views. We are at war, and that war is here at home.

So as parents, what can we do to protect and prepare our children for a world that is inherently less safe than when they were born we had hoped and prayed it would be?

Learn to Be Sheepdogs

In the film “American Sniper,” the biopic on the life of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, there’s a scene where Kyle’s father teaches him about the different types of people in the world—that we are all sheep, wolves, or sheepdogs. The scene (which you should watch) is based on an excerpt from a book by retired Lt. Col. Dave Grossman (which you should read). The best quote to describe the essay is:

If you have no capacity for violence then you are a healthy productive citizen: a sheep. If you have a capacity for violence and no empathy for your fellow citizens, then you have defined an aggressive sociopath–a wolf. But what if you have a capacity for violence, and a deep love for your fellow citizens? Then you are a sheepdog, a warrior, someone who is walking the hero’s path. Someone who can walk into the heart of darkness, into the universal human phobia, and walk out unscathed.

I was raised in an area where gun ownership was commonplace, and my family has owned and operated firearms for as long as I can remember. I have held a concealed-carry permit in the past, and we have several rifles locked in a safe in our garage. My husband and I have spent years traveling in dangerous parts of the world where religious violence and heightened security are a part of daily life.

But while I would love to think I would know how to react if I faced an active shooter or even a home invader or an attacker on the street, I have to be honest about my preparedness before I can teach my kids what to do. The truth is, I don’t put nearly enough rounds down a range to be prepared to defend my family if the time came. While my husband and I have talked to my teens about how to fight a rapist, I’ve also never had a frank conversation with them about what to do if they are ever caught up in a terrorist attack.

Especially when my kids are daily in a gun-free zone (where even Howard Stern recognizes they will be less safe), it is my responsibility as a parent to make sure they know there is evil in the world, and be prepared to face it as best they can if, God forbid, the time ever comes.

If it does, I hope my family and I can react like Imran Yousuf, the former U.S. Marine and Pulse bouncer who remained calm in the face of gunfire and led dozens of people to safety during the attack. I hope they will learn from groups like the Pink Pistols, an LGBT self-defense organization that recognizes the “legal, safe, and responsible use of firearms for self-defense” is necessary to protect all communities from evil.

So don’t teach your children to be afraid. Teach them to be ready. Teach them to train. Teach them to serve. Teach them to identify evil, stare it straight in the face, and defend those weaker than themselves. Teach them to be sheepdogs.

Neither Side’s Overreactions To Islam Are Helping Us,"The tragedy in Orlando, where a Muslim man professing allegiance to the Islamic State terror group gunned down 49 people and wounded 53 in a gay nightclub, has reignited the familiar debate about Islam, terrorism, and Islamophobia. The anti-Islam camp, mainly on the Right, insists Islam is uniquely, intrinsically violent and that distinctions between radical Islamism and Islam only obscure the problem. The anti-Islamophobia camp, mainly on the Left, insists that terrorism is a distortion of Islam, any religion can be perverted into violent extremism, and that blanket hostility to Islam will both victimize and radicalize ordinary Muslims.

This round of polemics has been particularly rancorous. Donald Trump has stepped into the fray, calling for surveillance of Muslims and curbs on Muslim immigration while assailing Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for their failure to denounce “radical Islam.” Others, notably journalist/provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, have gone farther to argue that the problem is all Islam—and mainstream Muslims. Meanwhile, Obama has decried Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric and Clinton has pointedly refused to “declare war on an entire religion” (although stating her willingness to name “radical Islamism” as the enemy). Writing in Foreign Policy, Julia Ioffe insisted Islam is no more and no less a “religion of violence” than Christianity or Judaism.

Who’s right? Actually, “Islam is the problem” and “Islam is not the problem” are equally true and equally false statements—and equally unhelpful for addressing the issues. As long as the debate remains polarized between these two crude extremes, it can only impede the search for real solutions.

Only One Major Religion Has a Major Terrorism Problem

For instance: Ioffe is entirely correct when she asserts “no religion is inherently peaceful or violent, nor is it inherently anything other than what its followers make it out to be.” Yet the fact remains that only one religion today has a non-negligible number of followers who are involved in international terrorism. There is no Christian, Hindu, or Jewish counterpart to ISIS, which has an ideology explicitly rooted in Koranic texts.

Of course the overwhelming majority of Muslims are not terrorists; a very small minority say they sympathize with ISIS, which has been condemned by numerous Muslim clerics and organizations. But Islam also has a larger extremism problem currently unmatched by any other major religion. A significant number of ostensibly mainstream Muslims who reject ISIS, al-Qaeda, and other terror groups nonetheless embrace fanatical and intolerant beliefs.

Just a few months ago, tens of thousands of Pakistanis publicly mourned former policeman Mumtaz Qadri, executed for the 2011 murder of a liberal governor who had advocated reforming the country’s draconian blasphemy laws. The assassin was lionized as a defender of Islam by politicians, lawyers, and clerics—including two popular British imams.

A 2013 Pew Research Center poll found that majorities of Muslims in many countries including Afghanistan, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Jordan endorse the death penalty for religious and moral offenses. In Egypt, three out of four Muslims believe sharia should be the law of the land; among those, more than 80 percent—or 60 percent of the total—favor execution for adultery and for leaving Islam. In Pakistan, nearly 90 percent of Muslims back sharia law; 76 percent of those support the death penalty for apostates and 89 percent for adulterers. While some invoke research showing that Christians are no less inclined to mix religion with politics and law, religion-infused laws may mean different things: To oppose same-sex marriage or abortion is not the same as to support hanging gays or stoning unchaste women.

Do other religions also have a violent history, from Judaism’s Roman-era zealots to the Christian Crusades? They clearly do. (While some argue that the Crusades were primarily a defense against Islamic expansion, they indisputably featured some horrific brutality—sometimes against Christian heretics such as the Cathars in thirteenth-century France.) But just as clearly, these religions have adapted to liberal values. The last execution for blasphemy in Europe happened in 1766—and even then, it was an anomalous case widely regarded as barbaric.

Yes, violence and intolerance in the name of Christianity and Judaism still exist. Ioffe mentions a Sacramento preacher who put up a sick video praising the Orlando attack and an ultra-Orthodox Jew who stabbed six marchers in last year’s gay pride parade in Jerusalem. There’s also Colorado-based pastor Kevin Swanson, who advocates executing homosexuals (and who made news last fall when he got then-Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, and Bobby Jindal to appear at his “National Religious Liberties Conference” in Des Moines, Iowa). One could also point to Vladimir Putin’s Russia, where Christian vigilantes have vandalized “sacrilegious” art and assaulted gays with impunity.

But those things are hardly comparable to a Saudi court’s sentence of 20 floggings and ten years in prison for a liberal blogger convicted of insulting Islam, or to sharia-based laws that make homosexuality a capital crime in nine majority-Muslim countries. Swanson is a fringe figure in the American evangelical community, despite some prominent Republicans’ willingness to participate in his sideshow. Meanwhile, one of today’s top Islamic scholars, Egyptian-born Yusuf Al-Qaradawi—who has been often praised as a moderate and heads a Qatar-based Center for Islamic Moderation and Renewal—not only endorses suicide bombings but justifies death for apostasy and homosexuality, vilifies Jews, and defends “light” beatings of disobedient wives.

Islamist Extremism and Anti-Muslim Bigotry Are Both Real

The good news is that the Islamic tradition is anything but monolithic, even in the treatment of issues like blasphemy and homosexuality. Historically, Islam incorporates a vast variety of sects, schools of theology, and cultures. Today, too, a great deal of diversity remains: thus, the 2013 Pew poll found very little support for sharia law, let alone capital punishment for moral and religious offenses, among Muslims in Lebanon, Turkey, Central Asia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Kosovo.

The bad news is that the past century has been marked by the ascendancy of radical Islamic fundamentalism and of political Islamism—fueled in recent decades by the oil-rich Saudi regime’s investment in international promotion of ultra-orthodox Wahhabi Islam around the world. Even Turkey, once the model of Muslim modernization, has been backsliding toward religious authoritarianism under the presidency of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

What about American Muslims? As a group, they are much better-integrated than in most of Europe and hold notably moderate views. (After the Orlando shooting, some have pointed out that Muslims in the United States favor same-sex marriage more than evangelical Protestants do, at 42 percent to 28 percent—though these numbers reflect Muslims’ higher levels of college education.) Still, the American Muslim community is obviously not insulated from the global influence of radical Islamism—particularly since, as a 2006 Freedom House study found, American mosques routinely carry Saudi-funded Wahhabi propaganda.

Liberal Muslim activists such as Arizona physician Zuhdi Jasser, founder of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, have long warned of the danger of extremism within mainstream Muslim organizations. Jasser’s detractors call him a shill for Islamophobes; yet he points to indisputable troubling facts, including the career of imam Anwar Al-Awlaki (killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011), who served a large congregation in Northern Virginia and preached at other mosques before going to Yemen in 2004 to fight for al-Qaeda.

There are other, less dramatic examples. In 2011, people were rightly appalled by a video that showed some protesters in Yorba Linda, California, shouting abuse at guests arriving for a charity event held by the local chapter of the Islamic Society of North America. What got far less attention was that the featured speakers at the fundraiser were two radical imams—one a preacher of anti-Semitic hate, the other an advocate of Islamist rule in America.

The Yorba Linda incident is a reminder that Islamist extremism and anti-Muslim bigotry are both real issues. Yes, charges of “Islamophobia” and “hate” often get hurled at critics of extremism, including reformist Muslims such as Jasser or lesbian feminist Irshad Manji. Yet critiques of Islam can and do cross the line into blanket Muslim-bashing—and not just in random Internet comments referring to Muslims as “scum” and “animals.”

“It’s time for America to choose,” Yiannopoulos tweeted after the Orlando massacre. “You can have female emancipation and gay rights, or you can have Muslims.” While he is a professional troll, a number of entirely serious “anti-jihadist” bloggers and activists routinely demonize Muslims as a group.

Robert Spencer’s site, Jihad Watch, has suggested that peaceful, non-violent, even secularized Muslims are a danger to the West as long as they have not renounced Islam because they or their children may revert to its more militant forms. Spencer and his ally Pamela Geller (Atlas Shrugs) have repeatedly attacked reformist, anti-Islamist Muslims such as Jasser, Manji, and Muslim convert Stephen Schwartz; Geller has also defended Serb perpetrators of Bosnian genocide as leaders of anti-jihadist resistance.

Some Indications Islam May Reform

These “anti-jihadists” not only offer a skewed, one-sided take on Islamic history and beliefs but relentlessly hype the “Muslim peril.” Any violent crime by someone of Muslim background can be spun as lone-wolf terrorism, right down to a meth addict’s violent rampage in a Wal-Mart; even car accidents get enlisted into “vehicular jihad.” When there is no Muslim connection, one can be fantasized: Geller has obsessively pursued the theory that 2007 Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho, a Korean national and a Christian, was a secret jihadi because of his enigmatic “Ismail Ax” arm tattoo.

Islamist radicalism cannot be disconnected from Islam itself.

The anti-Islam polemicists see Islam as fundamentally unreformable, with violent fanaticism and supremacism encoded in its scriptures and embedded in its history. Some mainstream conservatives agree. After the Charlie Hebdo massacre last year, Vanderbilt University political science professor Carol Swain published a column arguing that Islam itself—not just “radical Islam”—is not a part of the brotherhood of respectable religions but “a dangerous set of beliefs totally incompatible with Western beliefs” about liberty.

Is this simply grim realism? Serious scholars such as Princeton University’s Michael Cook have argued that Islam does have inherent traits, doctrinal and historical, that make it more predisposed to militarized fundamentalism than Christianity or Hinduism. Islamist radicalism cannot be disconnected from Islam itself.

But this does not mean Islam is impervious to reformation and enlightenment. Numerous Muslim scholars and thinkers, in the past and today, have advocated revising Islamic orthodoxy on everything from women’s rights to religious freedom, used Koranic text to argue against blasphemy laws, and challenged the traditional doctrine of the “abrogation” of the Koran’s earlier, more peaceful and tolerant verses by later militant ones.

But this does not mean Islam is impervious to reformation and enlightenment.

Some of Islam’s harshest critics have come around to support Islamic reformation—among them Ayaan Hirsi Ali in her 2015 book “Heretic” and Sam Harris in his dialogue with liberal Muslim Maajid Nawaz, “Islam and the Future of Tolerance.” Ali agrees that most believing Muslims follow the “religion of peace” Mohammed preached in Mecca, not the warlike, coercively imposed Islam of his later Medina years. She also argues that “Mecca Muslims” need religious reform to give their de facto rejection of “Medina Islam” a more solid foundation.

Other critics of political Islamism, such as historian and pundit Daniel Pipes, have always argued that reformed moderate Islam was the answer to radical Islam. Pipes, who has weathered his share of accusations of “Islamophobia,” warned in a 2013 article, “Those who make all Islam their enemy not only succumb to a simplistic and essentialist illusion but they lack any mechanism to defeat it.”

Indeed, it’s not clear what solutions the hardcore anti-Islam contingent proposes. A total ban on Muslim immigration to the United States and Europe? That would not affect the Muslims already here, except to radicalize some of them. It is worth noting that surveys of American Muslims show radicalism to be most common among converts, particularly African-Americans; converts to Islam are also dramatically overrepresented among jihadi recruits in the U.S. and Europe. The perception that the West is waging war on Muslims and Islam is part of what makes Islamic radicalism a magnet for alienated, disaffected people of all backgrounds; policies that seem to justify such perceptions can only increase that appeal.

The Vicious Cycle of Denial and Panic

This is not a call for “political correctness.” Concerns about large enclaves of minimally assimilated immigrants in Europe, or about the effects of a massive influx of migrants, are not bigoted. It is not bigoted to ask whether cultural accommodations for immigrants from countries with deeply patriarchal social norms and strong prohibitions on homosexuality can undermine women’s equality and gay rights in the West. It is certainly not bigoted to look into the connection between extremist beliefs and terrorism.

It is certainly not bigoted to look into the connection between extremist beliefs and terrorism.

In a way, Islamism denial and the Islamic panic form a vicious cycle. The more public officials and the media downplay facts related to Islamist radicalism (as in the Obama administration’s bumbling response to the Orlando shooting), the more some people will be open to conspiracy theories about jihadist attacks being swept under the rug. The more tensions between Islamic and Western norms are papered over, the more some will see “creeping sharia” in innocuous accommodations as ritual foot baths on college campuses, or fall for canards about British water parks requiring “Islamically appropriate” modest attire.

But it works the other way, too. The more “anti-jihadists” conflate Islamism with all Islam and bash ordinary Muslims, the more they boost fears of “Islamophobia”—giving an excuse to those who would soft-pedal criticism of radical Islam.

The conversation on Islamic reformation is happening—enough to make a skeptic like Ali sound hopeful in our interview last year. Supposed progressives who whitewash or make excuses for radical Islam stand in the way of this conversation. So do supposed anti-Islamists who insist violent militancy is the only real Islam.

Why Should Axing Due Process Stop With 2nd Amendment?,"First, it would be so nice to write about something — anything — unrelated to Donald Trump, but even the current House of Representatives scrap over gun rights reflects the debased and foolhardy political season in which we live. Stupid, flashy, and post-constitutional is the new hotness. I’m old enough to remember when Democrats would fight like wild dogs to protect even unenumerated and implied constitutional rights, but hey, it’s guns, right?

For the last 24 hours Democrats have been testing House Speaker Paul Ryan, garnering national media attention and generally trying through bluster to achieve what they can’t with votes. The sit-in ended not because of principle, but because Democrats knew the media would get bored in the next few hours, the weekend beckons, and Trump’s rage over not being the center of media attention would drag the cameras away. As camera-friendly and amusing as the protest was, there are broader and more important lessons to derive from this sudden ease in which Democrats propose to eliminate our rights.

My objection to the no-fly no-buy proposal, while certainly based on Second Amendment grounds, is more broadly one of opposition to any system that allows almost entirely unaccountable bureaucrats to restrict constitutional rights without notice, recourse, or accountability. No matter how meritorious you believe your cause to be, excising rights at the behest of a government executive or agency should terrify any right-thinking person. If you think the terror watch list is merely an affront to the Second Amendment, you’re not paying attention.

This Is a Real Slippery Slope

It doesn’t take a lot of effort to create a gedankenexpriment where the erosion of rights embodied in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments is the next stop on turning the Constitution into a Chinese menu where one party removes rights from Column A and the other from Column B. Just saying, “But guns…” doesn’t make it less dangerous.

The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches? Surely, these dangerous terror masterminds on the watch list should be monitored with warrantless wiretaps? Perhaps the FBI should install keyloggers on their computers, plant spyware on their phones, and monitor their private email and social-media messages? Why bother with a warrant or due process? They’re on the list. (As an aside, I’m old enough to remember when the Democrats viewed the National Security Agency’s programs to monitor potential terrorists as an impeachable offense and a profound affront to the Constitution.)

On Twitter today, I jokingly proposed removing the Third Amendment rights of those on the no-fly list so we can quarter soldiers in their homes. It’s a simple fix, and seems like a cost-savings for the government and a deterrent to terrorist shenanigans. Why not really go for the Constitution-shredding gold and suspend the Fourteenth Amendment rights of people on the no-fly list? At that point, they’re not even human. Problem solved!

“But but but…that’s impossible! We’re only talking about guns!” will be the inevitable response from Democrats. The problem here is American history, where even the rights of American citizens have been broken, suspended, and sacrificed by government in the edges of political and moral panics, or in time of war.

Unchecked Government Terrorizes People

On a hundred-year time scale you have more to fear from an unaccountable government than you do from radical Islam. A bureaucracy empowered to place you on a list where your rights can be excised or suspended will follow the inevitable path of all government agencies and programs: its scope will grow, it will become more opaque and resistant to oversight, and it will resist reform at every moment. Islamic terrorists have signifiers, tells, and structures we can attack with either our intelligence services or military options. Government agencies are nearly impervious to all forms of challenge.

The list that denies a potential terrorist the right to buy a gun today may expand to animal rights activists or Black Lives Matter protestors or anti-abortion campaigners tomorrow, all depending on the whim of the executive or even some a nameless bureaucrat. A list that stops you from boarding a plane today is a list that might deny you a license to drive, speak, or vote tomorrow.

The failure in Orlando wasn’t about guns; it was about law enforcement lacking the motivation and the tools to keep an eye on people sending every red-alert signal in the book. It was about failing to persistently target and track bad actors. It was about the FBI lacking either the will or the resources to monitor and follow Omar Mateen, despite feeling so strongly about him that they attempted to entrap him in the kind of terrorist act he later committed. He was an extremist well before he became a terrorist.

As a conservative and a constitutionalist, I embrace the essential friction our founding document imposes as a check on both the impulses of the state and of the people. A few steps back from the facile arguments about guns and terror is the terrain we should be looking to when we consider whether to place Americans on a list that denies them an enumerated constitutional right, even if Democrats don’t like it.

How Democrats Won The House Gun-Control Sit-In,"The Democrats’ House gun-control sit-in was a failure and was always destined to be a failure from the standpoint of actually moving any gun-control legislation. No bill, no break? Not really. Speaker Paul Ryan ended the current congressional session, and eventually everyone just filtered out.

But maybe it was a success after all, just at a different goal.

Partly it helped the Democrats invert the symbols and pageantry of the “liberal” mythology, as well as the very meaning of the civil rights movement, from “demanding freedom for yourself” to “taking freedom away from others.”

But that’s a long-term process of which this is just one small part. The sit-in also achieved a more concrete and immediate goal: We spent all last week talking about gun control, and its pros and cons, instead of talking about terrorism.

So the sit-in delivered something important for Democrats, after all.

The Justice Department initially tried to hide the Orlando shooter’s invocations of radical Islam by purging them from the transcripts of his call to police. In a textbook example of the Streisand Effect, this only brought more attention to the issue. But then the sit-in came to the rescue and diverted our attention again. It succeeded, at least for a little while, in getting us to take the Orlando shooting and re-file it in our minds under the heading of “mass shootings” and therefore under the wider file of “domestic gun-control debate.” And we have forgotten that the shooter, Omar Mateen, pledged loyalty to ISIS.

In fact, as time goes on, it becomes less clear that there ever was any other motive to muddy the issue. Several reports indicate the FBI investigation has failed to corroborate claims that Mateen committed the shooting because he was a self-loathing gay man. The two motives are not necessarily exclusive; martyrdom for Islam could have been his way of trying to cancel out his “sin.” But if the gay motive is evaporating, that leaves only radical Islam.

Yet we’ve already been diverted. Not only have we forgotten that the Orlando attack was Islamic terrorism, we’re not thinking about it enough to realize that this is precisely the form Islamic terrorism now takes. The Sydney Siege in 2014 was our warning, and the Paris attacks last year—both of them—along with Garland, San Bernardino, and others, confirms that these are the new ISIS rules for attacks on the West: many smaller attacks by ISIS-inspired loners with local citizenship, rather than one big attack by foreign plotters.

The thing that really makes this the perfect terrorist strategy is that our current leaders are dead-set on pretending it isn’t happening. They will always find some other excuse: an Internet video, provocative cartoons, “workplace violence,” or “homophobia.” Rather than fight back against the Islamists, they’ll respond by trying to take away our own freedoms.

You can see the incentive for this pretense. Acknowledging that the Orlando attack was about radical Islam and not just hatred of homosexuals would create pressure to think about more aggressive counter-terrorism measures and examine the failure of the FBI to realize Mateen was a threat despite more than one tip-off. And if this attack, like the others, was inspired by the successful example of ISIS, then the pressure should be on to actually do something to defeat ISIS—instead of our current policy, which is to act as if Syria is somebody else’s problem.

Ah, but politicians only want to see the problems that require their preordained solutions. For the current administration, that prepackaged agenda includes disarming the American people and cringing in apology for America once having asserted its interests somewhere in the world. So they try to get us to live inside their delusion and see “workplace violence” and “homophobia” where there is actually radical Islam.

That’s the delusion House Democrats acted out in last week’s sit-in, and their success was that they got so many people to agree to live with them in that alternative universe.

"Hearing: While Feds Redacted 'Islam,' Terrorists Slipped By","On Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz chaired an investigative hearing to determine whether law enforcement agencies are deemphasizing radical Islam while investigating terrorism in the United States. Its purpose, according to Cruz’s website, was to “investigate how the federal government has not only refused to appropriately identify the specific threat of radical Islam, but has sought to undermine the people and information who have sought to highlight the threat.”

Provocatively titled “Willful Blindness: Consequences of Agency Efforts to Deemphasize Radical Islam in Combating Terrorism,” the hearing comes just weeks after Omar Mateen shot and killed 49 people in an Orlando night club and injured dozens more. In his opening remarks, Cruz said, “the consequence of the willful blindness of a policy, that is a matter of administration policy, that refuses to acknowledge the threat, means over and over again this administration has allowed the threats to go forward.”

In the weeks following the ISIS-inspired terrorist attack, Democratic leaders and media elites once again tried to blame the attacks on everything under the sun other than Islamic radicalism. White Christians, Republicans, gun laws, and anti-gay bigotry are for liberals the worst culprits.

But it’s not just the mainstream media and the far-left selling this bill of goods. Incredibly, this rhetoric has been coming from our government. President Obama made a public statement in the days after the Orlando attack doubling down on his commitment not to speak about Islam when addressing any terrorist attacks, even when they are manifestly inspired or encouraged by ISIS or other Islamist ideology.

Denying Reality Gets People Killed

Last week, the FBI released a heavily redacted transcript of Mateen’s 911 call, in which he pledged his allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The FBI had scrubbed references to ISIS and changed his use of “Allah” to “God,” as though it were a translation rather than a transcript. Most damning of all, however, was the revelation that the FBI was aware of Mateen’s presence, had interviewed him three times in the past few years, and knew he belonged to the same mosque as Moner Mohammad Abusalha, the first American suicide bomber in Syria.

Of course, this latest foray into delusion vis-à-vis the relationship between terrorism and Salafist interpretations of Islam, or what Andrew McCarthy referred to in the hearing as “Sharia supremacism,” is preceded by a long history of the Obama administration’s systemic denial of this relationship. We saw similar reactions on the Left and in our government after the Charlie Hebdo shootings, a few weeks after which Obama held a summit on “violent extremism,” as though one can be violently extreme about nothing in particular. There were similar reactions after San Bernardino, Paris, and Brussels.

The hearing Tuesday was meant to shine a spotlight on what can only be described as a systematic and willful blindness to the reality that Islamist ideology is closely linked to terrorism and radicalization. This blindness is a natural consequence of the Obama administration’s reckless national-security policy of “countering violent extremism,” or CVE. McCarthy describes the CVE as “delusionally forbid[ing] the conclusion that radical Islamic ideology has any causative effect on terrorist plotting.”

Among those who testified was Philip Haney, a founding member of the Department of Homeland Security, now turned whistleblower. He described ongoing retaliation while working at DHS for investigations he ran that put the dots together for international Islamist groups that also worked within the United States. Haney was ordered by his superiors to redact the use of Islamic terms in 876 documents, something for which none of the Democrats at the hearing expressed even the slightest bit of concern. He surmises that had his work been allowed to continue, DHS very well could have been alerted to the San Bernardino shooters.

As Long As We Keep Saying It, It Will Be True

In the hearing, Cruz repeatedly brought up Nidal Hassan, the Fort Hood shooter, who was known to have visited radical Islamic websites and been in email contact with a radical cleric. This is important because Hassan’s terrorist attack was one of the earliest occurrences of the Obama administration’s insistence that there is no such thing as Islamic terrorism, because the White House fundamentally rejects the notion that Islam inspires violence. The military officially labeled the Fort Hood shooting “workplace violence,” despite what Hassan himself claims it was.

Another major point raised in Tuesday’s hearing was the scrubbing of terms like “Islam” and “jihad” in DHS training materials over the past several years. This was compared with the 9/11 Commission report, where Islam-related words showed up more than 100 times. Notably, one of the panelists, Farhana Khera, is president of Muslim Advocates, the organization that requested in writing that these training materials be “purged” of these “bigoted” terms.

Not surprisingly, Khera spent much of her time testifying in the exact kind of doublespeak that the hearing was there to discuss. She said dangerous political rhetoric regarding Islam is teaching Americans to fear and hate their Muslim neighbors, despite other panelists arguing that Islam is not a monolithic religion and that there are multiple interpretations, including violent ones, and that these, not the peaceful ones, ought to be condemned. But Khera wasn’t listening. She said she was disturbed by what the other panelists said, calling it “garbage.”

La La La, I’m Not Listening

Panelists like Chris Gaubitz, a national security consultant at Understanding the Threat Consulting Firm, pointed out that we could kill every member of ISIS and al-Qaeda, but without addressing the spread of sharia doctrine, Islamist terrorism won’t end. Dr. Zuhdi Jasser, founder and president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, urged an honest conversation about Islamist terrorism, arguing that by refusing to talk about it we are infantilizing Muslims by supposing they are too fragile to hear a frank discussion about Islam. According to him, “to say that Islam has no problems is just as problematic as saying Islam and Muslims are the problem”

Several Democratic senators tried to make analogies to the KKK and Christianity, arguing that just like we don’t call white-supremacist groups “radical Christians” neither should we call individuals and groups who perpetrate terrorist acts in the name of Islam “radical Muslims.” Meanwhile, Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, spent much of his time discussing how the focus on Islamic terrorism in the last 15 years has blinded us to the serious problems in our country with radical right-wing terrorists.

During the Senate hearing, Turkey’s Ataturk airport was attacked by suicide bombers, killing dozens, and al-Qaeda released a special edition of their English-language publication Inspire Guide urging lone-wolf attackers to target the “Anglo-Saxon community” so their acts won’t be misinterpreted as “hate crimes” but rather what they really are: religiously motivated terrorist attacks. How painfully ironic that Islamist terrorists are so flummoxed by the liberal West’s insistence on ignoring their motivations that they had to make an official statement to clarify things.

In the end, the hearing appeared an effort in futility. It seemed as though half the room lives in an alternate reality. But only one of those realities is real. And only one of them will win out in the end.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/06/29/senate-hearing-while-feds-scrubbed-references-to-islam-terrorists-escaped-notice/,2016-06-29
Let’s Debate The Iraq War. Let’s Not Rewrite History,"Believe it or not, you can simultaneously believe a number of things about the Iraq war and its aftermath.

You can believe Saddam Hussein wasn’t merely a “bad guy” but that he harbored terrorists and offered them safe haven and material support. You can believe that the Bush administration genuinely believed Hussein was in possession of weapons of mass destruction and also that the war turned out to be a massive strategic failure. You can believe that the administration believed the Iraqi people would embrace democratic institutions once the Baathist regime was overthrown and also that the project failed, leaving us with a bloody mess.

Not one of these things undermines the other.

You should not, however, believe that pundits and politicians are uniquely blessed with the capability of seeing alternative realities. Yet the way people talk about Iraq these days, they probably think they are.

It is completely rational to hold politicians who supported the Iraq War (and the ones who claim they would extricate us from it) accountable for their votes and policies. It’s an incredible mess. It’s irrational, though, to claim you know what the Middle East would look like had Hussein (or one of his depraved sons) remained in power. Yet nearly every contemporary counter-history of the Iraq War tells us hundreds of millions of people would be living quietly under stable tyrannies that counteract each other and suppress terrorism.

To accept this as a truth, you must also revise history. And Trump’s take on Saddam and Iraq is a complete falsehood. “He did that so good,” Trump told a crowd in North Carolina. “They didn’t read them the rights. They didn’t talk. They were terrorists. It was over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism. You want to be a terrorist, you go to Iraq. It’s like Harvard, okay? So sad.”*

Not everyone celebrates the ability of a government to kill its own people without any semblance of due process, but less-severe iterations of this sentiment are repeated often by anti-war proponents. We made everything worse.

Well, for starters, Saddam didn’t kill terrorists, he killed those who threatened his power, which sometimes happened to include those we might deem terrorists. Whether it was the Sunni or Kurds or Shia theocrats, his goal was to consolidate power. No, he didn’t read them their rights or talk, he gassed civilians (“a little,” according to Trump) and tortured and raped the families of his enemies in his Stalinist purges. At the time, there was an underlying moral argument for changing the lives of victims and with it the trajectory of the Middle East. It failed.

The Chilcot report into the UK’s involvement in the Iraq War was published this week, as well. It found that the war was based on flawed intelligence, launched before all diplomatic options were exhausted. This may be true. But as Brendan O’Neill notes, the motives of Western nations at the time were far more complicated than these revisionist reports would have us believe:

In short, the treatment of Iraq as special, and Blair as uniquely bad, and bloodthirsty, does a grave disservice to history — to understanding the causes of the Iraq War, the ideas behind it, the role played by vast swathes of the political and media elite in cultivating the climate in which it could happen and the notion that Britain had a new, neo-imperialist role to play in rescuing the repressed peoples of the world. It tears Iraq from this political and historical continuum, it elevates it above the elite’s consensual creation of a new kind of interventionism, and treats it as a one-off act of madness that sprung from Blair’s warped mind and black heart. It’s a whitewash of the worst order.

The American conversation is much the same. It’s one thing to argue that allowing Saddam to stay may have helped counterbalance Iran or save Christians or avert a Syrian civil war. It’s something else to perpetuate the fiction that Saddam did not export terrorism. If Iraq wasn’t Harvard for terrorists, it was a surely a safety school for top-notch extremists. Not only did Saddam aid and shelter the murderers of American citizens, the United States designated Iraq a terror state for providing bases to a number of violent organizations.

At the Weekly Standard, Stephen Hayes offers a long list of ways Saddam aided terrorists, including:

…a 2008 Pentagon study, based on 600,000 Iraqi regime documents captured in postwar Iraq, that concluded: ‘Evidence shows that Saddam’s use of terrorist tactics and his support for terrorist groups remained strong up until the collapse of the regime.’

Without any evidence to support his claim, Trump professes to have opposed this war before the invasion. Let’s concede that’s true. It’s worth pointing out that many anti-war progressives and paleo-conservatives — and because Trump most resembles Buchananites, I’ll lump him in with them — do not possess any prescience on Middle East matters because they happen to be partially correct about the Iraqi war’s aftermath. Even if weapons of mass destruction were found on day one and Iraq was a stable democracy today, they would have still have opposed it. They are in blanket opposition to any military action at any time for any reason against any terror state or regime that threatens American interests.

Some segments of this opposition perfunctorily rationalize and justify the actions of enemy regimes, including the Iranian state and Palestinian terrorism. Plenty of people deserve credit for warning Americans about the downsides of the invasion, but Trump-style paleos are not among them.

Nor should we fool ourselves. In a Reason-Rupe poll conducted a couple of years ago, 51 percent of Americans claimed they had opposed to the Iraq War back when it started in 2003. Only 39 percent say they supported the war, 6 percent claim they had no opinion, and 5 percent couldn’t remember.

This is highly unlikely. A year after the invasion, 72 percent of Americans interviewed in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll were still in favor. Only 25 percent were opposed. In the same poll, only 41 believed it necessary to find weapons of mass destruction to justify the conflict (as opposed to 38 percent who thought it would be necessary). Support for the Iraq War didn’t begin to crumble when it was obvious we wouldn’t find a large cache of weapons of mass destruction. It crumbled when Americans realized that creating a viable nation was futile.

I regret my support for the Iraq invasion, as well. But the decision was far more complex, both morally and politically, than today’s revisionism implies. Let’s debate the war. Let’s not change history.

*Trump has been using this line for a while now. It was particularly helpful as a distraction yesterday as Hillary, who voted for the Iraq War, was again caught blatantly lying to the American people.

U.S. Negligence Is Feeding ISIS’ Global Appeal,"It seems every couple of days we hear about another ISIS-linked terrorist attack. The global appeal of the radical Islamist group is on the ascendant as it is continually able to inspire young Muslim men to wreak havoc in its name, from Orlando to Istanbul. Rather than a sign of the success of the U.S.-led assault on ISIS’ territorial claims, the growing frequency of terrorist attacks are, in part, a product of our own negligence.

Last Tuesday, three gunmen wearing suicide vests attacked the international terminal at Turkey’s Atatürk airport in Istanbul, killing 45 and injuring more than 200. Although ISIS hasn’t yet claimed responsibility, Turkish officials told the United States the organizer of the attack was a former commander of an Islamic State battalion in Syria.

On Sunday, Iraq suffered its deadliest attack since 2003, when ISIS attacked a busy neighborhood of Baghdad with a truck bomb that caused a massive fire, killing more than 215 people. On Friday, five gunmen killed 22 hostages in an attack on a café in an affluent neighborhood in Dhaka, Bangladesh, for which ISIS claimed responsibility.

On Monday, three separate suicide bombings were carried out in different parts of Saudi Arabia—one near the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina, where hundreds were gathered to break the Ramadan fast, another in a Shiite mosque in the eastern city of Qatif, and yet another near a U.S. diplomatic site in Jeddah. Four people were killed in these attacks.

Failure Isn’t Success

Many have claimed that the surge of ISIS-led or -inspired terrorist attacks are the desperate moves of an organization back on its heels as a result of the U.S.-led coalition’s fight against the self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq. The surge in attacks, this argument goes, proves that the coalition’s efforts are working. But this is a perverted sort of logic: the proof that the fight against ISIS is working is supposedly the rise in terrorist attacks. In no other circumstance would we argue that failure equals success.

However, others, like the Brookings Institution’s Bruce Riedel, argue ISIS would be pursuing this strategy abroad even if the caliphate were thriving. After all, its goal is to fight the infidel, whether non-Muslims or apostates. This erodes the narrative that the coalition is weakening ISIS. Yes, ISIS lost control of Fallujah, and is suffering financially. But we shouldn’t underestimate its ability to adapt its mission and methods.

ISIS’ goal is to oppose the West and all those it sees as apostates, whether that means in the form of a territorial caliphate that adopts the harshest Sunni interpretation of sharia law and rejects all things Western, or by hitting Western and apostate targets in the West, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Both strategies advance the objective.

The rise in attacks, moreover, is further evidence that the global appeal of ISIS-inspired jihad is not dwindling. This is due, in part, to U.S. negligence, not just militarily, but rhetorically and diplomatically.

Censoring Reality Isn’t Going to Address It

We are all, by now, familiar with the Obama administration’s stubborn repudiation of identifying Islam when discussing terrorist attacks at home and abroad. Far beyond public statements, this philosophy has spread throughout our law enforcement and counter-terrorism efforts. All references to Islam, jihad, sharia, etc., were “purged” from training materials at the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at the behest of the group Muslim Advocates.

This is consistent with the Obama administration seeking advice from groups with Islamist ties, like the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). CAIR was found to be associated with Hamas, the terrorist group with roots in the Muslim Brotherhood, in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2008. By looking primarily to Islamists for cues on how to address Islamic terrorism and engage the Muslim community, the administration is crippling its own ability to view the threat with clarity.

The White House’s diplomatic gestures further indicate the administration’s dereliction of duty in the fight against Islamic extremism. Take President Obama’s absence from the Paris unity march after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January 2015. Dozens of world leaders were present, including British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But our president didn’t think it was worth his time and attention. Neither did Vice President Joe Biden or Secretary of State John Kerry.

In fact, the U.S. ambassador to France, Jane Hartley, was the only U.S. official present. In an embarrassing attempt at damage control, Kerry appeared in Paris a few days later with James Taylor to sing “You’ve Got a Friend.”

After the Paris nightclub attacks in November, Kerry vaguely described ISIS’ motives, arguing that while the Charlie Hebdo attacks “perhaps” had a “legitimacy” or “rationale that you could attach yourself to,” indicating that murder is an appropriate reaction to insulting Mohammed, the November attacks were “absolutely indiscriminate,” demonstrating for the hundredth time how little the administration seems to understand this very serious threat, not just to our national security but also to global stability.

Weakness Invites Aggression

Muslim extremists around the world see that the American government and much of American society do not take this threat seriously, and can’t or won’t admit its theological origins. Rather than feeling on the run, ISIS and the men it inspires to jihad must feel emboldened by this. Imagine the sense of being untouchable because the most powerful country in the world is practically giving your actions a pass—or acting as though they were random.

The United States not only won’t pursue a genuine fight against ISIS’ ideology, but the Obama administration is even lending an ear to Islamists at home. By censoring counter-terrorism training materials, our leaders are making it easier and easier for would-be terrorists to be radicalized at home and plan jihadist attacks under the radar of the FBI and DHS.

The Left continually insists, as Muslim Advocates President Farhana Khera did at last week’s Senate hearing, that by talking about Islam in any capacity when discussing terrorism, we are playing into ISIS’ hands. The argument is that groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda want nothing more than for the West and moderate Muslims to attack Islam. To what end isn’t clear.

Al-Qaeda may be frustrated it can’t get the West to believe its motives—last week it released a special edition of their magazine, Inspire, in which it called on jihadists to “avoid targeting places and crowds where minorities are generally found” so their religious motives will be believed. But this isn’t because al-Qaeda wants to instigate animosity between Muslims and the West. It’s doing that by inspiring jihad. It simply wants the West to believe al-Qaeda is fighting a holy war.

Groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, and all those who would be called on to perpetrate attacks, are taking advantage of America’s varied neglect in the fight against radical Islam. And it’s taking its toll around the globe.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/07/u-s-negligence-is-feeding-isis-global-appeal/,2016-07-07
"For Micah Johnson, Any Ideology Is An Excuse To Kill","Let’s take the Dallas shooter at his word: he hated white people. But is that all there is? Lots of blacks, whites, Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans hate each other. They don’t all open fire on each other with powerful weapons. Maybe there’s something else at work here.

The current narrative is that Micah Johnson, as a young African-American man, was enraged by police brutality against African-Americans. An Army veteran and a “quiet” young person—these shooters are never described as “loud”—he was finally pushed over the edge either by the police shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana (if you’re sympathetic to the most militant black nationalist line) or the irresponsible rhetoric of groups like Black Lives Matter (if you’re an adherent of the view that BLM is essentially a terrorist organization).

There’s another possibility, one largely ignored because it doesn’t fit either narrative: maybe Johnson, like Charleston murderer Dylann Roof and Orlando terrorist Omar Mateen, was a screwed-up weirdo with a ton of anger who went looking for a cause to support his desire to kill.

Always Something of a Misfit

Superficially, it looks like Johnson turned to violence after returning from Afghanistan, a fact that seamlessly plays into a perfect narrative of racial injustice: black veteran returns to Texas from a war zone—“he managed to bring his war back home,” as the New York Times put it—where he finds black men are in more danger in America than in Afghanistan, so picks up a rifle in defense of his community.

Except that’s not quite what happened. Johnson never saw combat, and he didn’t “return” so much as he was “sent home.” For stealing panties.

As the Daily Beast reported, Johnson was shipped back to his reserve unit just ahead of a restraining order and a less-than-honorable discharge from the Army.

As reported by one of his bunkmates in Afghanistan, Johnson suffered a particular shame.



‘We all knew he was a pervert cuz he got caught stealing girls’ panties,’ the bunkmate later said in a Facebook post.



Johnson’s military lawyer, Bradford Glendening, says that a female corporal mentioned Victoria’s Secret underthings when she filed a sexual harassment complaint against his client.



The lawyer further reports that the corporal was worried enough to seek an order of protection against Johnson and to recommend that he receive mental health treatment.

Somehow, Johnson escaped punishment: he got an honorable discharge, which surprised even his lawyer. “Someone really screwed up,” Glendening said. “But to my client’s benefit.”

Johnson, as it turns out, was always something of a misfit, much like his would-be White Power and ISIS counterparts Roof and Mateen. Like other “loners”—a word that popped up within a day of the shootings—he was fascinated by military hardware and macho endeavors, including enrolling at the “Academy of Combat Warrior Arts” near Dallas.

Not that there’s anything wrong with that. It’s perfectly normal for a young man with “anger issues” to enroll in an academy that trains young men in combat tactics, rather than wasting his time with boring things like jobs or girlfriends. (When he wasn’t honing his urban guerilla skills, he shot hoops literally for eight hours a day.)

A Victim Avenger

None of this is to deny that when Johnson finally opened fire on Dallas law enforcement officers, his head was full of racist poison. The outsider who was obsessed by military weapons as early as high school, whose stepmother was white, whose time in the Army came to an end with a handful of stolen panties, found an ideology that made him the victim of a race war and placed him in the role of a powerful avenger.

This is what Roof and Mateen did as well, like so many other “lost boy” killers. Roof, for his part, said he was sick of black men raping white women. Like Johnson, his friends said he made the occasional racist remark, but no one thought he was serious about violence. Mateen, likely a closeted gay man, lashed out at the gay community after a history as a difficult boy stretching back to third grade and more recent events in which his temper scared those who knew him.

In every case, we must study the professed motives of the shooters and hold those responsible who made the propaganda who inspired them: white nationalists, black nationalists, Islamic extremists. At the same time, we should not assume these young men are avatars of the ideologies they espouse. Rather, they are part of a new strain of violent losers, men driven by a combination of narcissism and insecurity and who latch on to heroic narratives in which they are the central figures in a morality play of justice and retribution.

Defending the white race, defending the black race, avenging Islam: all of them are the same story played out by the same type of man. In other cases (John Salvi attacking abortion clinics, Timothy McVeigh blowing up a federal building) the targets or the ideas may be different, but the actors and narrative are the same. The hero, spurned in his own community, takes matters into his own hands, and kills—usually in the most cowardly way possible.

Crazy Loners Shouldn’t Control Us

In every case, we zero in on the message, because normal human beings link actions with words. We also do this because the alternative is even more frightening than terrorism: we cannot seriously believe that an aimless life of too much weed, or a burning shame and anger about getting caught as a panty thief, can eventually produce the slaughter in Charleston and Dallas. It’s too random, too uncontrollable, and too close to home. Terrorism, in a way, is actually the more comforting explanation.

It’s true, of course, that hateful propaganda always targets the weakest and most insecure among us. It’s not meant to turn men and women of virtue into killing machines; it’s meant to sift through the lost and disturbed, and to instruct them in how to focus their vaporous fears and formless rage into a weapon.

They wanted a reason to commit murder. They found one. The next killer will just as surely find his own.

It’s also true that groups of people with the same ideology create cells of terror and violence. These groups make plans and sustain networks, and must be pursued and broken up wherever they’re found. But to conflate radicalized losers with actual terrorist organizations is to risk spreading law enforcement and intelligence too thin: the battle against terrorism and the firefight with a disturbed loser who was part of nothing and who spoke to no one are not part of the same war.

Johnson’s ramblings are no more and no less important than Roof’s racial theories or Mateen’s pledge of allegiance to ISIS. These men, in retrospect, seemed likely to kill at some point. White supremacy, black nationalism, and Islamic extremism lit the fuse, but in the twenty-first century, there is no way to empty the trough of toxic Internet sludge on which these damaged boy-men feed. They wanted a reason to commit murder. They found one. The next killer will just as surely find his own.

The more pressing question is whether we will allow ourselves to be dragged into social warfare by these pathetic failures. Racism and terrorism are real problems, but are we going to let panty thieves and chronic stoners set the terms of the debate?

Rather, if we’re going to have another dreaded “much-needed national conversation,” it should not be about guns or racism, but about the human time bombs our culture is creating and nurturing among us. Unfortunately, that’s not only a discussion for another day, but one so uncomfortable to think about that we’re likely never to have it at all.

"Targeting Police Isn’t A Hate Crime, It’s Terrorism","In the wake of recent deadly shootings, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has asked his state legislature to consider making violence targeted at police a hate crime. While increasing penalties against those who kill or injure cops can help protect the men and women who protect us, new hate crime laws are a poor way to achieve that goal. Specifically targeting law enforcement is not a hate crime; it is an act of terrorism.

Conservatives might well enjoy the rhetorical irony of using a hate crime label to describe and punish actions against the police. After all, the legal notion of hate crimes, which became popular in the late twentieth century, has generally been a tool of the civil rights movement. Just as many opponents of Black Lives Matter have appropriated that term and turned it into Blue Lives Matter, Abbott’s legislation seems to put the hate crime shoe on the other foot.

This may be part of growing trend among conservatives to reject programs that carve out special benefits or protections for Americans based on perceived oppression of a race or group identity. But in this case, adopting the use of “hate crime” is misguided—not because attacks on police cannot be motivated by hatred—they certainly can be—but because the very idea of a hate crime is a dubious proposition to begin with.

Criminalizing Hate Criminalizes Thought

Hate crime legislation became popular in the late 1970s as a way to enhance punishment for violent crimes committed with bias against a protected group. Such laws effectively state that punching people because they are gay or black, for example, should be more greatly punished than punching someone because you don’t like them individually. In most cases the hate crime is added to the underlying crime in prosecution.

The problem with the concept of hate crimes is that it very specifically allows the state to criminalize thought. It is not illegal to harbor hatred or animosity towards groups of people. It is irrational and stupid, but not illegal. Nor should it be. Asking judges and juries to punish people on the basis of their bigotry quite literally turns the government into the thought police.

One could argue that intent, a valid consideration in prosecuting crimes, also equals thought policing. But the traditional use of intent differs from the use of hate crime statutes in significant ways. Typically, intent is used to determine the extent to which an individual knowingly committed a crime and understood the gravity of its consequences. This is an old idea in law. In 1789, in his “An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation,” Jeremy Bentham addressed the issue:

Let us observe the connexion there is between intentionality and consciousness. When the act itself is intentional, and with respect to the existence of all the circumstances advised, as also with respect to the materiality of those circumstances, in relation to a given consequence, and there is no mis-supposal with regard to any preventive circumstance, that consequence must also be intentional: in other words; advisedness, with respect to the circumstances, if clear from the mis-supposal of any preventive circumstance, extends the intentionality from the act to the consequences. Those consequences may be either directly intentional, or only obliquely so: but at any rate they cannot but be intentional.

Bentham argues intention must be split in two. First, was the act intentional? Second, was the consequence of the act intentional? Motive plays a role in determining whether a criminal act was intentional, but not regarding the intent itself. Whether a criminal act of violence is committed out of jealousy, anger, fear, or hatred, the bottom line is still the physical intent. The proper role of government in most cases is to punish the act, not the motivation.

Once we go down the path of punishing motivation itself, we invite a legislative parade of horribles. In New York City it is now illegal to maliciously refer to a transsexual individual by a pronoun he or she does not prefer. This speech is not criminal because of the act of itself, it is criminal because the speaker is denying the moral orthodoxy of transexuality.

We should naturally expect the concept of a hate crime will lead to establishing hate speech as a criminal act. In most cases, one’s speech is used to prove the group bias that constitutes a hate crime. Someone who harbors animosity towards blacks and punches a black person is less likely to be charged with a hate crime than someone who uses a slur before throwing the punch. It is even possible that a perpetrator who uses a slur may not harbor bias, but may simply be attempting to insult his victim.

For all of these reasons is it ill-advised for Abbott and the Texas legislature to make crimes against police hate crimes. As satisfying as it may be to use progressive dogma in the furtherance of protecting police, it reinforces limitations on thought and speech that are very un-conservative.

Instead, Label Anti-Police Violence Terrorism

If we want to increase penalties on those who specifically target police in acts of violence—and we should—there is a better way to do it. Instead of considering such acts hate crimes, we should consider them acts of terrorism. By doing so we can punish the act, not the motivation, and potentially give law enforcement enhanced methods of preventing such acts.

Setting out to kill random police officers, as we recently saw in Dallas, Baton Rouge, and New York City, is an act of political violence. It is an attack on the rule of law and the systems of government. It is an attempt to undermine public confidence in police and to promote general fear. Importantly, undermining state authority is not merely the killer’s motivation, but also inherent to his act.

Some criminal acts specifically targeted at groups based on race, religion, or sexual orientation may also contain terroristic elements that can be used to enhance penalties. It would be best for us to replace the idea of hatred or bigotry with that of terrorism in policing and prosecuting such actions.

But for now, Abbot and the Texas legislature should resist the urge to use liberal thought policing to protect our cops. Not only is unlikely to be effective, it also codifies a legal argument that conservatives should reject. Even in our very justified anger and horror at police killings, we must proceed in measured ways, just as police should and do proceed in measured ways when they protect us.

The Full Text Of Donald Trump’s 2016 RNC Drafted Speech,"These are the remarks prepared for delivery according to a draft obtained by POLITICO.

Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.

Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.

Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.

Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.

I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.

The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.

It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.

I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.

So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.

But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.

These are the facts:

Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement.

Homicides last year increased by 17% in America’s fifty largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.

In the President’s hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And more than 3,600 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.

The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.

The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.

One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.

I’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders. What about our economy?

Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the President took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.

Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our manufacturing trade deficit has reached an all-time high – nearly $800 billion in a single year. The budget is no better.

President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.

Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.

Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.

This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant nothing.

In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames. America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America’s foreign policy.

I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused the disasters unfolding today. Let’s review the record. In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.

Libya was cooperating. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos.

Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.

This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and weakness.

But Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy. The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them. A change in leadership is required to change these outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.

The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. This will all change in 2017.

The American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.

A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation’s most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.

Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.

That is why Hillary Clinton’s message is that things will never change. My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.

I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.

I AM YOUR VOICE.

I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.

When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way.

And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can’t see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never before.

When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was “extremely careless” and “negligent,” in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes.

In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.

I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.

But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works for all Americans. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.

We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.

America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.

On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and four were badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order our country.

I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job done. In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate. The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone.

This Administration has failed America’s inner cities. It’s failed them on education. It’s failed them on jobs. It’s failed them on crime. It’s failed them at every level.

When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.

Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America?

To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside America: we are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS. Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism.

Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.

The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBT community. As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.

We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror.

This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel. Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.

My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.

Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be.

Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.

On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.

These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?

These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.

We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system.

By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.

Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very closely to the words I am about to say.

On January 21st of 2017, the day after I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.

But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief.

Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty.

I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat. It’s been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.

I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I’m going to make our country rich again. I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great ones. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.

Never again.

I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and to America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences.

My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes.

She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.

No longer will we enter into these massive deals, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations, including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.

This includes stopping China’s outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we’ll walk away if we don’t get the deal that we want. We are going to start building and making things again.

Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be simplified for everyone.

America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.

My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work – that will never happen when I am President. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.

This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.

My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports! We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.

We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread – one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I’m going to do it. We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.

The replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.

At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community who have been so good to me and so supportive. You have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.

An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views.

I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.

In this journey, I’m so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he’d say if he were here to see this tonight.

It’s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. Then there’s my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character.

To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.

But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you. It’s time to deliver a victory for the American people. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.

America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.

Remember: all of the people telling you that you can’t have the country you want, are the same people telling you that I wouldn’t be standing here tonight. No longer can we rely on those elites in media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.

Instead, we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now.

It’s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.

My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: “I’m With Her”. I choose to recite a different pledge.

My pledge reads: “I’M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.”

I am your voice.

So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I’m With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.

To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make America Proud Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

And We Will Make America Great Again.

THANK YOU.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/21/the-full-text-of-donald-trumps-2016-rnc-drafted-speech/,2016-07-21
Angela Merkel’s Migrant Crisis Hits Home With Terrorism,"In the last year and a half, Europe has been rocked by several terrorist attacks organized or inspired by the Islamic State. The attacks have focused on France and Belgium and left Germany untouched. Until now.

Germany has seen four violent attacks in the past week, three of which were perpetrated by refugees from the Middle East. This marks a new chapter in the violence occurring across Europe, as Germany becomes the latest target of the ISIS-inspired terrorist attacks plaguing the West.

It began last Monday when a 17-year-old refugee from Afghanistan, Riaz Khan Ahmadzai, attacked passengers with an axe and a knife on a train heading toward Würzburg. There were no casualties, other than the attacker himself, whom police shot. Four people were critically injured. Police found a hand-drawn Islamic State flag in the attacker’s room, and ISIS has claimed responsibility for the incident. This attack has caused German officials to assert that more attacks on trains may happen “at any time.”

On Friday, Ali David Sonboly killed nine people and wounded dozens more when he opened fire at a McDonald’s in a mall in Munich before taking his own life. Sonboly, a dual citizen of Germany and Iran, had done extensive research on mass shootings. As of Monday, officials insist there are no ties to Islamic terrorism or ISIS. This may prove true, but the German police have lost some of their credibility after their attempts to cover up the New Year’s Eve mass sexual assaults perpetrated by Middle Eastern and North African men.

Notably, Sonboly’s Afghan friend seems to have known of the attack in advance and failed to alert officials. He’s now being held as a suspect in the case. Not all crimes Muslims commit are necessarily acts of terrorism, but given the pattern of late in Europe and the United States, it shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand, as media and police have been so anxious to do.

Finally, on Sunday a Syrian refugee, Mohammed Daleel, set off a suicide bomb outside of a concert venue in Ansbach after being denied admission. He was the only person killed, but 15 others were injured. He left a video pledging his allegiance to ISIS. Daleel had received asylum in Bulgaria and came to Germany in 2015, but was denied asylum in 2015.

On the same day, another Syrian refugee attacked and killed a pregnant woman with a machete and wounded several others. There are currently no indications it was an act of terror, with police calling it a “crime of passion,” but little else is known.

These attacks all differ in strategy and tactics. The Ansbach bomber may have had some training or help, while the Würzburg train attacker could’ve done what he did with no support. But they indicate Germany is becoming the new focus of ISIS-inspired attacks, and that Germany’s refugee policy is in part to blame.

When Nobody Wants to Say ‘I Told You So’

Germany accepted more than 1 million refugees in 2015, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave an open invitation to Syrians to seek asylum there. Many were concerned at the time that this would seriously threaten European security, and that hostile actors would come in with the massive wave of migrants. Those who expressed these concerns were accused of bigotry and racism. But now their reservations seem prescient and justified.

German officials claim they’ve thwarted many terrorist plots in recent months, including a plot to attack a busy pedestrian area of Düsseldorf in June. But will they be able to overcome the difficulties of stopping attacks by individuals who are inspired by ISIS rather than directly linked with them? With the sheer number of migrants from countries where violent Islamic ideology is preached and practiced, it seems an impossible task.

German officials’ reactions to crises like these also raise concerns that the country may not be equipped to deal with the rising threat. It took Merkel 24 hours to respond to the Munich shootings, causing many to chastise her for avoiding responsibility for the attacks. People are using the hashtag #Merkelsommer, or “Merkel summer,” indicating the extent to which the public blames her.

Meanwhile, Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said violence “wasn’t typical for refugees in our country,” perhaps implying the German government is in denial about the threats to its national security.

Take Citizens’ Concerns Seriously

Merkel was wrong to dismiss the concerns of her people and of European Union member states. She didn’t take the public’s anxieties seriously. Not only did this heighten security risks, but it erodes people’s confidence in the German government and in the E.U., the latter of which dictates immigration quotas for member states. This was part of the motivation for last month’s vote among Britons to exit the E.U.

As this confidence wanes, far-right populist parties are gaining traction. Earlier this year, Merkel’s ruling party lost badly in local elections to the Alternative for Germany party, which takes a firm anti-immigrant stance and has been very critical of Merkel. France’s far-right National Front candidate, Marine Le Pen, has recently soared in polls, with twice as many voters saying they’d vote for her as for sitting Socialist President François Hollande.

Another worry is that far-right groups will begin wreaking havoc themselves as a reaction to Islamic terrorism refugees have committed. France’s chief of intelligence recently warned of this danger, saying that a “civil war” could arise if the country continues to see terrorist attacks, or if mass sexual assaults occur there.

So, what can Germany do? They already began tightening their asylum policies earlier this year and its parliament passed a new law stating that benefits and residency permits may be restricted for those who refuse to take German language and integration classes. The number of refugees has fallen this year, indicating this may be stemming the tide.

But what about the migrants who are already there, and who mean to do harm? This is the question all of Europe faces in this new age of global jihad. Germany’s interior minister Herrmann told the public to expect more attacks, echoing the French prime minister, who said France must “learn to live with the threat” of Islamic terrorism.

But it’s doubtful this will satisfy the people of Europe. As tensions rise and the attacks continue, the road seems to lead inevitably toward every country for itself, nationalism, and the breakdown of the European Union.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/07/26/angela-merkels-migrant-crisis-hits-home-with-terrorism/,2016-07-26
"Stop Making Excuses For Militant Islam, Pope Francis","On Sunday, Pope Francis responded to questions from reporters about why he won’t call out Islamic violence or reference Islamic terrorism when responding to terrorist attacks like the one that took the life of French priest Jacques Hamel last week. The pope denied any associations between Islam and violence and said “If I speak of Islamic violence, I should speak of Catholic violence.” By speaking this way, he does a disservice to his followers, and world leaders, who would look to him for the confidence and moral backing to call out Islamic terrorism and face it head-on.

According to Pope Francis, every religion has the potential for violence, including Catholicism. This, of course, is true, because every single human person has the potential to do wrong, as Catholicism itself teaches. So we’ve seen violence play out in the history of the Catholic Church. But that doesn’t mean that today some religions’ adherents don’t encourage it more than others, or have a greater potential for violence. Context and culture matters.

The Islamist ideology and doctrine terrorists follow today wasn’t created out of thin air in the past few years or decades. It has roots in an early interpretation of Islam dating from the first centuries after Mohammed’s revelations. In the world of Islamic jurisprudence, it’s just as legitimate as other interpretations of the faith. But as far as I know, there is no early church interpretation of Christianity still popular today that promotes violence like Wahhabism or Salafism does.

Islam Has Ties to Violence, Plain and Simple

The pope also described reading about murders Catholics have perpetrated. Therefore, in his convoluted reasoning, Francis surmises he couldn’t possibly draw a distinction between Catholic violence and Islamic violence. But what the pope misses, either intentionally or through naïveté, is the crucial difference between committing a crime and happening to belong to a given religion, and committing a crime in the name of that religion. No one is claiming that every murder, assault, and robbery a Muslim perpetrates is an example of Islamic radicalism. But, as Europe is discovering, a significant minority of Muslims commit violence explicitly in the name of Islam.

Pope Francis apparently can’t see the difference between crimes that share a single motivation and those that don’t. According to French officials, there are approximately 11,000 suspected Islamists in France who are on what they call their “Fiche S” list. This means there are thousands of people in France alone who might be willing to kill, not randomly, but in the name of Islam.

Islamic terrorism is more threatening than the unconnected crimes Christians might commit because it’s based on shared beliefs. This also makes it more preventable. We know what radical Islamists believe, and in many cases we know who teaches them, where they’re radicalized, and how they coordinate. It all revolves around a certain interpretation of their religion. But if we ignore those signs, as Pope Francis does, we will be at a loss to stop them.

The pontiff makes a similar mistake as President Obama, who loves to remind his staff that more people die in America from slipping in their tub every year than die from Islamic terrorists. But there isn’t an explicit sect of bathtubs plotting against bathers, hoping to extinguish them from the earth. Intentionality matters. It matters because it makes the violence more menacing—and more likely to spread.

Pope Francis told the media, “It’s not fair to identify Islam with violence. It’s not fair and it’s not true.” Perhaps it’s not fair to equate Islam with violence, but it’s deeply dishonest for him to say that Islam has nothing at all to do with violence, especially since we see weekly evidence to the contrary, not just in the West but in Muslim countries throughout the Middle East.

While moderate Muslims can ignore or interpret differently the sura of the Quran some use to support jihad, they can’t deny that these exist. Islam’s founding texts, unlike Christianity’s, do in fact encourage violence. Moreover, Islam was founded by a man who, in addition to being a religious leader, was also a political and military leader who in his lifetime conquered vast territories in the name of Islam. Naturally, some of his followers today want to take the same approach.

Pope Frances Weirdly Undercuts Religious Motivations

But rather than discuss Islamic terrorism, Pope Francis points to “the god of money” as the “first terrorism.” He thinks capitalism is the root of all the evils in the world. If that’s the case, should Western countries ignore the religious ideology that inspires Islamic terrorists? Should we ignore ISIS strongholds in Libya, or the cells of Islamist terrorists spread throughout Europe?

Money and greed certainly do cause problems, but to equate it to terrorism downplays the horrors of terrorist attacks that tear apart families and nations. It also suggests a materialist interpretation of sin that doesn’t square with Christian teaching, which locates the source of our sin in our broken souls, not in material goods around us.

The pope thinks the real problem is income inequality, that if these young men just had jobs they wouldn’t join ISIS. This denies the very words and confessed motivations of the terrorists themselves, and is a particularly odd position for a religious leader to take. One would think that the pope, of all people, would understand the power of religious convictions, however misguided. But by ignoring these things, he joins a chorus of liberals in the West who can’t believe anyone would be so moved by their faith that they would give their life for it.

He also denies the traditional power of religion to influence all people, including the poor, to restrain their passions by refusing to excuse or explain away evil choices. Stealing or murdering is wrong, no matter how little money you have. Francis’s church and faith have always taught this.

Pope Francis claims to “know how they think,” referring to Muslims—quite a feat for any man. But here, he makes the common mistake of looking at Islam as a monolithic religion. This logical fallacy forces a false choice between saying that Islam as a whole either is or isn’t violent. No one can make either claim, given that there are millions of Muslims in the world who neither practice violence nor endorse it. And of course there are millions who do.

The leader of the Catholic Church shouldn’t defame or insult other religions in general or without cause. However, we should expect Francis to defend his own religion where appropriate, and to distinguish it from a religion that has a chronic problem with violence.

Pope Francis’ comments about Islamic terrorism are harmful because, even in this modern age, he is supposed to be a voice of moral authority, even for non-Catholics. If he isn’t willing to call out Islamism, then what hope do we have of progressive leaders in the West doing so?",https://thefederalist.com/2016/08/05/stop-making-excuses-for-militant-islam-pope-francis/,2016-08-05
Why Muslim Terrorists Are Today’s Vikings,"Remember learning about Vikings in school? You know the ones. They had the hats with horns, the boats with dragons on the front, and they terrorized all of Europe for hundreds of years. They would descend upon a town, kill all the men, rape the women, and steal anything of value. There was even an acrynom for that: RPP, for rape, pillage, and plunder. That’s what they did. Eight hundred years ago, most Europeans were terrified of them.

Is there any comparably dangerous group in recent days? A group that commits horrible acts of violence, and targets women for sexual assault? Of course there is. I don’t even have to name it. Everyone knows the answer: Muslim extremists.

Of course I don’t mean all Muslims. Foolish people are always quick to protest supposed Islamophobia, painting speakers of the truth as racists. This only reveals their ignorance of history. While most Muslims are not violent, the same could be said of Germans in 1940 or the British in 1776. Not every German was a Nazi, and only a small percentage of Brits were redcoats.

Even during the worst of the Viking menace, do you think all Danes ran around slaughtering and raping? Of course not. Many were farmers. And someone had to make the boats, the shoes, and tend to the sick.

We’re Talking about Motivating Ideas

The point was that the Viking culture, specifically their religion, encouraged violence—just as today, many Muslims are wonderful people who are totally peaceful, but many Islamic clerics encourage violence to non-Muslims, as does the Quran itself. “Kill them (the infidels) wherever you find them,” says the Quran. It’s not exactly an ambiguous line, though many today tie themselves into mental pretzels pretending it means something else.

Again, the idea of killing all one’s enemies is not so different from the Viking worldview. The Odin and Thor worshippers really didn’t have a problem with killing or even rape. Their religion basically encouraged conquest, like many pagan religions did back in the day. Thor was the God of war. Men prayed to him before battle.

Sound familiar? Surely you’ve seen video of Islamic terrorists screaming allahu akbar (god is great) before opening fire on innocents or blowing themselves up. The Fort Hood army psychiatrist who shot 13 soldiers in 2009 yelled it. The terrorist who shot up the gay nightclub in Orlando Florida, killing 49 innocents, actually stopped shooting long enough to call 911 and praise his god before killing more people. They all seem to say it.

Have Muslim extremist groups attacked innocent women? Here, too, the list is endless. The jihadi group Boko Haram famously kidnapped 276 schoolgirls in Nigeria in 2014. ISIS has kidnapped countless girls in Syria and Iraq, and has turned them into sex slaves. Even in the West this has happened. There was the incident in Cologne, Germany of 1,200 women being sexually assaulted on New Year’s Eve by gangs of Arab immigrants.

Think about Their Heavens

Think I’m overstating the Viking/Islamist connection? Let’s examine the two ideas of heaven. To the Vikings, heaven was Valhalla, basically a hall with an endless feast, tons of liquor, fighting, and wenching. How did a Viking get to Valhalla? He had to die in battle with a sword in his hand. Old Viking men, often obsessed with this, were known to keep a sword by their beds so they could grasp it when the time came.

And the Muslim idea of heaven? Seventy-two virgins. In other words, a harem of nubile young hotties, eager to please, presumably for eternity. How does a Muslim get there? Once again, he must die fighting for Allah to get to this epic Shangri-La.

So there you have it. Both groups terrorize their enemies, killing as many as possible. Both condone killing and raping. Both die (literally) to get into a twisted vision of heaven that sounds like a frat party run amok.

So it’s official. Extremist Muslims are the new Vikings. Maybe we should get them some of those hats with the horns. That or defeat them.

Intel Confirms ISIS Hid Among Refugee Hordes Flooding Europe,"In Germany last week, the vice president of Bavaria’s intelligence-gathering agency, Manfred Hauser, announced ISIS “hit squads” had entered Europe with the flood of migrants that came across the borders over the last year and a half. According to Hauser, there are hundreds of reports that these kinds of terrorist cells have infiltrated European countries, and “irrefutable evidence that there is an IS command structure in place” that will “likely” launch a coordinated attack on Germany.

It appears ISIS took advantage of Europe’s generosity by concealing its fighters in the mass of people desperately seeking a new home. If this comes as a surprise, you haven’t been paying attention.

When the migrant crisis began in 2015, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was quick to inform all would-be refugees that Europe would take in anyone who crossed its borders. She famously said that anyone who could reach Germany would be welcome to stay. Merkel’s proclamation and the ensuing million-and-a-half migrants who came knocking on Europe’s door raised concerns that terrorists based in Syria and Iraq, or elsewhere, would blend in with the crush of refugees and wreak havoc in countries that ISIS considers apostate.

The Politically Correct Insisted This Wouldn’t Happen

National Review’s Ian Tuttle wrote in September 2015, “Given the sheer magnitude of the migration, it is a virtual certainty that terrorist organizations are taking advantage of the crisis to insinuate themselves into Europe.” Months later, after the Bataclan nightclub massacre in November, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who had erected a razor-wire fence on Hungary’s Serbian border, said migrants “present a security threat because we don’t know who they are. If you allow thousands or millions of unidentified persons into your house, the risk of…terrorism will significantly increase.” Frontex, which manages European Union borders, warned of this possibility in early 2015.

But these concerns met censure from European and American politicians and media elites for being xenophobic and bigoted against refugees. The Huffington Post listed terrorists embedded with refugees among their top five myths about the migrant crisis in September 2015. Another myth-buster at the Washington Post came to a similar conclusion in response to Tuttle: “Yes, in theory, terrorists could exploit the same porous borders exposed by human smugglers. But in practice, they are unlikely to use migration routes to infiltrate Europe — and checks are in place to catch them if they try.”

The Southern Poverty Law center reacted to the Paris attack with shock and horror that anyone would connect refugees to fears of Islamic terrorism, calling the mere mention of it Islamaphobic. Of course, no one was accusing refugees themselves of being terrorists. They were simply pointing out that it would be difficult to vet every migrant coming in, and therefore bad actors could easily slip in under the guise of being a refugee.

The deputy chairman of a parliamentary committee on immigration and security in Italy, Giorgio Brandolin, said last year, “Terror groups spend money on training militants; it makes no sense for them to send them over on death boats, risking them drowning on the way.” But Brandolin made the mistake of thinking that ISIS, which sends its men and women on suicide bombings, cares about putting its soldiers in harm’s way.

He further assumed he understood ISIS’ strategy. But the reality is that he, like many others, lacked the imagination to see what ISIS was capable of. They thought that because there was then no proof that terrorists were posing as refugees, it couldn’t have been happening and would never occur in the future. Of course, this is exactly what ISIS was doing.

Political Correctness Contributes to Mass Murder

Now, in the face of the recent attacks in Germany, Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière has proposed a number of new security measures, including expedited deportations for migrants who are denied asylum or pose a threat to public safety, and increased scrutiny for asylum applicants specifically targeted at detecting Islamist radicals. But will these measures be sufficient, or has Europe learned the lessons of its own folly too late?

What has happened with Europe’s migrant crisis is evidence of an ongoing pathology in the West, especially with regard to Islam. Anything perceived as offensive or xenophobic is off-limits for discussion, even if it affects national security. Looking clearly at issues of public safety, immigration, integration, and the threat of terrorist organizations takes second chair to keeping up the pretense of inclusivity that multiculturalism mandates. Political leaders and the media get to feel smugly compassionate and morally superior while accusing everyone of bigotry who express concern about mass immigration.

This pathology manifests itself when authorities and media insist an attacker doesn’t have any affiliation with Islamism or ISIS before much is known about the individual, often in face of contrary declarations from the attacker himself. This happened with Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hassan, the San Bernardino killers, the University of California-Merced student, the Orlando shooter, the so-called lone wolf attackers in France and Germany, and countless others.

Many world leaders and members of the media would rather swallow their own tongue than state the obvious. They’d much prefer to acknowledge a risk in retrospect than warn of an impending threat. But as I’ve argued before, Europe’s leaders, and our own, don’t have the luxury of being politically correct about national security. Their sworn duty is to look clearly at the world and spot the risks even if it makes them look cold, not to hold our hand and make us feel good about ourselves.

Yet Merkel remains defiant, repeating “We can still do this” in a speech delivered in the wake of the recent terrorist attacks in Germany, two of which were confirmed to be ISIS-related. She won’t back down. But Germany is quietly beginning to acknowledge the threats. So far this year, the country has let in far fewer refugees than in the same period last year, and increased deportations. Merkel’s rhetoric notwithstanding, her government sees the threat and acknowledges this new population is overwhelming their country. Merkel just won’t say so out loud because she wants to retain the role of compassionate leader.

So here we are. Exactly where so many said we’d be, facing unpredictable attacks by men who traveled to Europe pretending to be the most vulnerable people in the world. Instead they’re the most threatening, attacking indiscriminately and infusing fear into the continent.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/08/15/intel-confirms-isis-hid-among-refugee-hordes-flooding-europe/,2016-08-15
Why It’s So Hard To Prosecute Islamists And Keep Freedom,"The British Muslim “hate preacher” Anjem Choudary has finally been convicted after 20 years of preaching fundamentalist Islam aimed at radicalizing young Muslims and encouraging them to engage in terrorist activities. Last week, he, along with Mohammed Rahman, was found guilty of inviting support for ISIS in speeches and lessons posted online. Choudary’s case, and his long history of Salafist extremism, exemplifies the difficulties that we in the West face in dealing with homegrown Islamic radicalism.

Choudary, a British citizen born to Pakistani parents, has spent two decades working toward global Islamic domination. These are his words. He wants Islamic law to spread throughout the world, and told the Washington Post in 2014 “We believe there will be complete domination of the world by Islam.” He has also said that “Britain belongs to Allah.”

Choudary founded multiple Islamist and Wahhabist organizations in England, all of which were eventually banned. He has connections with numerous other Salafist and Islamist groups and is a known leader of “dark networks” that stretch across Europe and seek to radicalize young Muslims. He has praised terrorists, including the 9/11 attackers, and proclaimed they are in paradise. He has been friendly with a top ISIS figure and executioner, who at the time was part of the terrorist group Sharia4Belgium, and is connected to more than 100 British terrorists, and many terror plots.

Terrorism’s Victims Include Freedom of Speech

But somehow Choudary has managed to skirt the law all these years. A lawyer until 2002, he knew how to step up to the line of criminality without crossing it. Although his influence on European Muslims is well-known and -documented, he managed to skate by on technicalities of the law, because he hadn’t engaged in terrorist activities himself, nor was it proven he had directly sent people to Iraq and Syria to join ISIS.

What finally allowed authorities to arrest him last year and convict him this month was an oath he signed to ISIS’ leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in conjunction with speeches posted online that called on Muslims to join ISIS. As a prohibited organization, membership in ISIS is considered a criminal offence. British authorities convicted him of “inviting support for a proscribed organization,” under Terrorism Act 2000.

Choudary’s case raises questions of how far freedom of speech extends, and what ought to be done with terrorists once convicted. Although freedom of speech in Britain is a long-established common law right, in recent years it has suffered many setbacks. A Reason magazine article from last year highlighted the policing and punishment of Twitter users and journalists, as well as advertisers (a notable case was an ad banned in London for supposedly body-shaming women by depicting a fit woman in a bikini).

But what about here in the United States? People often ask what we should be doing at home to protect our country from Islamist terrorism. While presidential candidate Donald Trump would point solely to immigration, this misses the glaring fact that many Islamist terrorists were born in America or came as young children. This list includes Omar Mateen (Orlando), Faisal Mohammed (University of California-Merced), the Tsarnaev brothers (Boston Marathon), Syed Farook (San Bernardino), Nadir Soofi (Garland, Texas), and Nidal Hassan (Fort Hood).

Terrorists like these are drawn to Salafist Islam either in their communities and mosques or on the Internet. It isn’t always clear what the authorities can legally do beyond monitoring radical clerics and mosques and looking for connections between radicalized individuals and groups. How far can they go in policing what Islamists are preaching?

It Would Be Difficult to Prosecute Choudary in America

Freedom of speech is perhaps the most crucial right in a free society. There’s a reason it was the first right enshrined in the Bill of Rights: it’s meant to protect citizens from government attempts to silence dissent and regulate ideas and messages. In America, a country with arguably the most robust free speech protections, there are only a few exceptions to this First Amendment right. These include speech others own, child pornography, commercial speech, obscenity, and fighting words. None of these, however, are applicable to combatting Islamists, who are essentially supporting terrorism without providing terrorists with direct material support like guns, bombs, or money.

The one type of unprotected speech that would be applicable in a case like Choudary’s is incitement to violence. Speech that advocates force is unprotected, but only if its intention is to produce “imminent lawless action” and is likely to succeed. This could potentially apply to the sermons of Salafist imams, which, if encouraging people to fight with ISIS, are promoting lawless action. However, proving that they’re likely to lead to imminent action is more difficult.

Expressing even the most reprehensible views is protected by the First Amendment, including having a Ku Klux Klan parade or arguing for the overthrow of the government. So an Islamist imam could preach beliefs whose natural conclusion might be violence, but so long as he isn’t calling on a crowd to go out right away and commit terrorism, his speech is protected. This is why we may not have been able to prosecute a man like Choudary here in America.

Another way unprotected free speech comes into play is “true threats.” This recently made news when a Missouri woman was arrested for retweeting Twitter posts calling for the murder of U.S. law enforcement officials. The tweet contained names, addresses and phone numbers. Federal prosecutors argue that her retweets are tantamount to active support of ISIS, and charged the woman with conspiracy and transmitting a threat across state lines. Her defense, based on First Amendment grounds, argues the charges are unconstitutionally vague, once again illustrating the tension between free speech and national security.

Prisons Aren’t a Great Place for Islamists, Either

Once a conviction is made, as with Choudary, the problems don’t end there. Choudary faces up to ten years in prison. But what will he do once behind bars? Prison systems have become notorious in Europe and America for breeding radical Muslims, so a man like Choudary poses a threat inside as well as outside of prison.

Islamists in prison are treated like “aristocracy,” according to an audit of French prisons. When Salah Abdeslam, one of the Paris attackers, was arrested and sent to the Fleury-Mérogis prison he was “welcomed as the messiah,” according to one guard there. That same audit also found jihadi inmates can easily communicate with the outside world, including Syria.

So officials face a difficult decision between keeping Islamists like Choudary in the general population, where they can influence and indoctrinate other men, or concentrating Choudary and others like him in cell blocks so they don’t have access to non-radicalized inmates. This, of course, has its own dangers, namely that these men may plan future attacks and terrorist operations together. The third option, total isolation, is widely unpopular in places like Britain and France, where it is, perhaps correctly, seen as inhumane and cruel.

Choudary’s stay in prison will last a maximum of ten years. Then what? Does he get out in a few years after having been active in prison, and go on as he did before? Perhaps this time he’ll be more careful so as not to get caught. Some countries are working on de-radicalization programs, but their success has been dubious.

Choudary’s case typifies the difficulties the Western world faces in combatting radicalization. As a country that is fundamentally based on concepts of liberty and freedom of speech and of association, our principles and constitutionally protected rights sometimes run up against threats to national security. This is the great challenge we will face in the fight against Islamist ideology and homegrown radicalization in the years ahead. For a sense of the challenges to come, we need only look to Europe, where that fight is well underway.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/08/23/why-its-so-hard-to-prosecute-islamists-and-keep-a-free-society/,2016-08-23
Breitbart Is Wrong About Why Some Mormons Oppose Trump,"In November 1845, an Illinois man offered a challenge to his neighbors: the first person to kill a Mormon would be rewarded with a gallon of whiskey. Taking this man up on his offer, a group of ill-reputes sought out their prey. They chose Morley’s Settlement as their stalking ground, an area just south of the Mormon stronghold of Nauvoo, Illinois.

An angry mob had burned Morley’s Settlement to the ground earlier that year, but Mormons continued to tend the crops they had planted there during more hopeful days. My fourth great-grandfather, Edmund Durfee, was one of those farmers. On November 15, he went down to harvest one last bushel of grain before the winter set in.

As Durfee and his fellows worked the field, they noticed in the distance that a wagon full of hay had caught fire. They rushed to the scene to douse the flames—and with that, the gang of thugs had these Mormon farmers right where they wanted them. They emerged from their hiding spaces and opened fire on the unarmed men, killing Durfee and earning their gallon of whiskey.

There are hundreds of similar stories of persecution against early Mormons in America, many far more brutal and heinous than this one. This unique history of oppression has imbued modern-day Mormons with a deep conviction that individuals should be free to worship how, where, and what they may. This commitment to religious liberty is not feigned or imagined; it is ingrained in our DNA.

So it should come as little surprise that most Mormons were deeply troubled when Donald Trump proposed banning all Muslims from entering the United States. We know what it is like to be singled out by the government for “special treatment.” Once you give the government power to treat people differently based on their religion, it’s only a matter of time until that power is turned around and used on you. This is one of the many reasons Trump has had such difficulty attracting Mormon support, an issue The Donald himself acknowledges.

Stop Pretending Mormons Have a Hidden Agenda

But over the weekend, former representative Tom Tancredo and his friends at Breitbart claimed that Mormon concerns over religious liberty are all a smokescreen to hide the real reason many Mormons don’t like Trump. He wrote:

According to the mainstream media, Trump’s call for ‘extreme vetting’ of Muslim immigrants in his foreign policy speech kicked open a hornets’ nest of Mormon concerns about ‘religious tolerance.’



The truth is more simple, as is often the case in politics, and it has nothing to do with religious freedom as practiced by Americans under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.



It is an open secret in Washington, D.C. that the Mormon church supports open borders and lax enforcement of immigration laws. Many Mormon politicians have been supporting amnesty and open borders for decades.

Tancredo would have you believe that Never Trump Mormons aren’t concerned at all for religious liberty. Rather, our opposition to Trump stems from our secret marching orders from Salt Lake City to support open borders.

To make this point, Tancredo first went to work redefining Trump’s position on Muslim immigration. He repeatedly states Trump only wants to ban “likely terrorists” from entering the United States, not all Muslims. “No,” he declares, “barring jihadists is not religious persecution.”

By redefining Trump’s position on Muslim immigration, Tancredo seeks to show that Trump is not actually targeting an entire religious group; he’s only targeting terrorists. Since Trump is targeting people based on their support for terrorism and not their religion, the reasoning goes, Mormon opposition to Trump can’t possibly be about religious liberty.

Of course, no reasonable person would oppose preventing Muslim terrorists and extremists from entering our borders. But this misrepresents Trump’s actual position. Last December, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” This is far more expansive than simply targeting “likely terrorists” (unless Trump thinks all Muslims are likely terrorists). Trump insists his ban will be temporary—presumably until his “extreme vetting” can be implemented—although he has given no indication of how long it would be in place.

When a presidential candidate proposes using the power of the federal government to target an entire religious group for special treatment, First Amendment advocates everywhere and of every creed should be concerned. To dismiss these concerns as tacit support for jihadists is dishonest.

The Mormon Church Actually Respects the Law

But what of Tancredo’s claims that the Mormon Church supports open borders? Here, again, the Breitbart article gets it all wrong. Tancredo need only google “Mormon Church immigration” to find the church’s official position on illegal immigration. It begins:

Most Americans agree that the federal government of the United States should secure its borders and sharply reduce or eliminate the flow of undocumented immigrants. Unchecked and unregulated, such a flow may destabilize society and ultimately become unsustainable.



As a matter of policy, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints discourages its members from entering any country without legal documentation, and from deliberately overstaying legal travel visas.

This statement is difficult to square with Tancredo’s claims that the Mormon Church supports open borders. To be clear, most Mormons are not exactly hardliners on immigration. Polling shows Mormons are more likely than the general public to view immigration as a positive thing.

The church’s official position calls for a middle-ground approach that, in addition to securing the border, offers legal status for undocumented immigrants without necessarily offering them a pathway to citizenship. Mindful of our own past as refugees, the church has also recently increased its efforts to welcome and assist refugees from war-torn regions.

But while church leadership might not be as hardline on immigration as Tancredo is, it is incredibly disingenuous to claim they are advocating for open borders. Furthermore, if keeping the flow of illegal immigration going was such a big priority for Mormon voters, John Kasich would have won the Utah caucus earlier this year, not border hawk Ted Cruz.

I don’t blame Tancredo and his friends at Breitbart for misrepresenting the reasons many Mormons oppose Trump. It’s far easier for them to paint Mormons as amnesty-loving liberals than it is to honestly ask themselves why Trump is struggling with the most reliably Republican demographic in America. The truth is, there are dozens of legitimate reasons many Mormons are repulsed by Trump, and his threats towards religious tolerance are merely one.

Tancredo’s article shows that Trump supporters have little interest in winning over disaffected Mormon voters. Perhaps they know a lost cause when they see one.

German Government Recommends Stockpiling To Prepare For Terrorist Attacks,"This week, Germany’s Interior Ministry revealed an update of its civil defense plan, the first such revision since the end of the Cold War era. The 69-page document advises Germans to stockpile a 10-day supply of food and five-day supply of water to prepare for an unspecified event that could upset the über-orderly country. Many in Germany aren’t taking this advice seriously, which reminds us all of the precarious prosperity we enjoy.

The civil defense plan, which Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere presented to his cabinet Wednesday, recommends improving alarm systems, strengthening hospital capacity, and putting civilians to work directing traffic or providing the military with lodging, if a crisis arises. The report also hints at bringing back military conscription, which ended in 2011.

Why the sudden update? What kind of disaster is the government anticipating that would cause Germans to need to stockpile food? That’s not exactly clear.

According to the document, “an attack on German territory requiring conventional defence is unlikely,” but nevertheless Germany needs to be “sufficiently prepared in case of an existence-threatening development in the future that cannot be ruled out.” The document also indicates a need to be prepared for the possibility of a “hybrid” conflict, which could include cyber warfare. Maiziere said Germany must be ready for interrupted gas or oil supplies or food and water preserves being poisoned.

Obviously This Is about Terrorism

Deputy parliamentary leader of the Greens party Konstantin von Notz says it makes sense to update German’s civil defense plan, given that it hasn’t been updated since 1995. This is understandable, given that the international scene has changed a lot in the past 21 years. But he, too, doubts any attack on Germany would require this kind of stockpiling.

Of course the government doesn’t want to frighten the public by saying that the update of the civil defense plan is due to increasing threats to the country. But we can certainly read between the lines to see that this update is coming at a time when terrorism and international tensions are on the rise. Just recently, Germany’s defense minister said his country lies in the “crosshairs of terrorism.” It would be quite the coincidence if this updated plan just happened to co-occur with the rise of ISIS and the rash of attacks across Europe that recently added Germany to its list of casualties.

The civilian defense plan indicates the government sees real threats abroad, and doesn’t want its military or people caught unprepared. So it’s taking the appropriate steps and counseling Germans to take precautions.

But so far the German people aren’t taking it all that seriously. Since the news leaked earlier this week, social media and newspapers have lit up with jokes mocking the proposition. The term “Hamsterkaeufe” has become popular on social media, which has a double meaning of panic-buying, as well as hoarding like a hamster. Pictures of hamsters and jokes about stockpiling hamsters abound.

Are Citizens Really Prepared for an Emergency?

The plan is also stoking a debate about the necessity of such preparations, with some accusing the government of scaremongering. But Wolfgang Kast, a public health manager with the German Red Cross, worries this is an indication that the public isn’t really prepared for an emergency. An event that would require stockpiled food is so far off its radar that the mere suggestion seems silly and unnecessary.

This whole affair is a reminder of the incredible sense of security we all live with every day. For most of us who are under 40, that’s because life experience has taught us that catastrophes just don’t strike the Western world anymore. Other than the relatively small number of people affected by natural disasters each year, most people in the West haven’t experienced what it’s like not to have access to clean drinking water or food.

This has lulled us into an unrealistic idea of the world. Thinking that nothing could require us to stockpile food, house troops, or pitch in to direct traffic is akin to the idea that history ended with the Cold War, and with it all major international conflicts. In the 1990s, it was popular to argue that all the major disagreements and ideological conflicts had finally been put to rest, as though humanity itself had undergone a transformation with the fall of the Berlin Wall. All that remained was to work out some details about trade and the environment.

There was a similar mood in the period between World War I and World War II, when Europe thought it unthinkable ever to go to war again. So it sleep-walked right into the nightmare of the Second World War. So, too, were we stunned by the reality of Islamic terrorism in September 2001, despite years of escalating attacks by al-Qaeda against U.S. targets overseas.

Good Time to Take Stock of World Affairs

But it’s not just the proliferation of Islamic terrorism that threatens Germany’s, and our own, security. International tensions are on the rise, and old powers are rising again unchecked. Fighting is bubbling up again on the Ukrainian border between pro-Russian separatists (widely thought to be backed by Russian troops) and the Ukrainian armed forces. Strains with China are also on the rise, with China asserting itself in the South China Sea. Next month it plans to conduct naval exercises there—with Russia.

In the weeks after the attempted military coup in Turkey, President Recep Erdogan’s government has pivoted toward Russia (much like it did following WWI and the breakup of the Ottoman Empire) and away from the West. Iran has reasserted itself in the Middle East, showing its desire to be a regional power in places like Syria and Yemen. It, too, is allying with Russia, even letting Russian fighter jets to take off from Iran (until the media attention got too hot).

Is it really so far-fetched to think that something like a cyber attack by China that affects the electric grid could turn Germany upside-down for a short time?

None of this means the end is nigh, or that you need to be buying giant barrels of grain and digging your own well. But it does mean international realities cannot be ignored, and that our Western utopian peace may not last forever. To pretend otherwise would be to join the chorus of voices throughout history who saw the danger on the doorstep too late.

In Germany, the government is making a modest recommendation to mitigate the damage should something happen. This seems utterly reasonable—and utterly foolish to ignore.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/08/26/german-government-recommends-stockpiling-prepare-terrorist-attacks/,2016-08-26
Burkini Battle Shows Why Progressive Secularism Is So Darned Boring,"Sometimes two events will unfold concurrently to shed some light on the state of conflicting worldviews. In this case these events took place in Iraq and France. One story finds a group of first communicants heroically defying ISIS through witness to their faith. The other involves two police officers forcing a Muslim lady at the beach to remove her burkini.

In each case, we see reactions in terror-torn countries where each undoubtedly has the right to live in some state of fear. Still, one story is defined by the refusal to allow terror to dictate the terms of their way of life while the other is defined by its exact opposite. France may very well be the more rational actor of the two, but the incident there reveals an inherent truth about secularism. As it lacks the temerity of even a pious group of ten-year-olds, the truth is that secular epistemology is devastatingly boring.

Contrast These Two Governing Ideas

Consider the message of progressive secularism, our culture’s currently prevailing worldview. It claims the only reality is approached through our senses. Nothing is transcendent. The whole human experience is just a series of firing neurons and dopamine. The love of art, beauty, and all that is good are just traits we evolved for survival. We are nothing more than sophisticated animals.

The fruits of this parasitic philosophy are on full display in the way our illustrious leaders wish to govern behavior through such ideas like contracts for dating, food laws, and even free-speech zones. The very thought of self-government is a pie in the sky anachronism as coherent as a dead language.

An ideology of this sort will inevitably descend into a system of rules that would even make a puritan’s head spin, because it assumes we can participate in evolution by setting our own parameters for improving society. We don’t legislate to mirror a transcendent natural order, but to soothe the feelings of the majority — since feelings are all there is to this life anyway.

On the other hand, Christianity suggests we are intrinsically valuable just by being made in the image of our Creator. It differentiates good from evil through a natural order. In this way, goodness is much more complex than the dopamine it creates. Christianity teaches that life—and the beauty that flows forth—is almost always seasoned with loss, growth, and danger. It is cyclical.

As seasons come and go, they transport us through different stages of life. The growth of spring flowers after a long cold winter. Unveiling a sculpture after its artist has spent months of painstaking labor. Holding a newborn child after hours of delivery and three trimesters of sacrifice. Christianity affirms what we already intuitively know: It is not always easy and often requires toil and sacrifice, but life is always worth it. This is particularly true when facing adversity to the point of death.

Taking Away the Transcendent Eviscerates Meaning

What makes these conflicting worldviews so fascinating is the secular one attempts to accomplish what seems to come so naturally to Christians. Seeking to destigmatize all activity classically viewed as culturally corrosive leads to the public being less likely to find meaning and generally less-trusting of its institutions. The extreme end of these statistics find more suicides and early death from alcohol and drug abuse.

A recent study even shows millennials are having sex less than any generation before them. Yet they are not citing eternal judgement or nagging guilt, but that they have better things to do and are intensely focused on their careers. Interestingly, it seems the hedonistic heyday our forebears had imagined during the sexual revolution was thwarted by the abundant availability of forbidden fruits. Talk about progress!

Undoubtedly a group of children in war-torn Iraq receiving their first communion is exponentially more exciting and otherworldly than the French ban on conservative Muslim women’s swimwear. These children, by participating in this subversive act, are heroically acknowledging their humanity by rising above a basic animal response. They are paradoxically affirming the value of human life by sacrificially participating in act than can and has ended in death for many others. Their act says there is a higher law than the state.

France’s says the state is the ultimate authority. The secular French succumb to fear and dehumanize a whole group of people through authoritarian law. The Iraqis will, over time, methodically breathe new life into their culture, while the French will further erode a once-vibrant country. France’s use of law to coerce its citizens to abandon their beliefs will fail for the same reason that all secular progressive epistemology inevitably will.

Secularism Is Shallow

Secularism cannot take appropriate measures to highlight cultural diversity because it is shallow. It is an ideology bereft of meaning that hates to be reminded of this. It is wholly incapable of differentiating between the truly pious and a homicidal terrorist. It cannot understand the difference between a person who opposes an institution on philosophical grounds and a bigot. It sees any religious act as a direct threat to its civil sacraments.

So it forbids any piety. The French secular paradise is facing an existential threat, and all it knows to do is purge religious symbols from public view lest that trigger its citizens by reminding them that life is not all wine and the Louvre.

Now, more than ever, would be the time for the French government to consider taking the path of its Christian community. Among recent victims of ISIS was a French priest, Jacques Hamel, who was murdered on the altar during Mass. In the same way that terror has enveloped Iraq, leaving Christians to participate in worship at their own peril, French Catholics continue their ancient rite. Just as a group of young first communicants heroically engage in a subversive act that could spell death, French Catholics continue their celebration beneath the heavy specter of Hamel’s final sacrifice.

For the Christian, life is a cycle that carries with it celebration as well as the cross, and she eagerly embraces both. As secularism seeks to establish a material utopia by purging religion, it inadvertently deprives its citizens of a necessary dimension of true happiness. In stripping strictly held religious practices from public view in fear of future religiously motivated attacks, the French government is sacrificing color in a once-vibrant culture.

This will leave in its wake a boring, bland non-culture unable to recognize what is good, bad, or ugly. Maybe if the French truly believed in their way of life they would continue living it in spite of the fear of terror, but then again that might make them seem a little too Christian, and we wouldn’t want that.

Museum Trips Will Not Keep Italy's Teens From Islamism,"Italy has a new plan to push back against Islamic radicalization of European youth. It wants to give them European culture. This month, Italy will begin offering all 18-year-olds a voucher worth approximately $500 to use on concerts, movies, and museum visits. The premise is that cultural exposure can counter Islamic terrorism. Although this is perhaps a well-intentioned effort to wage an ideological war against Islamism, Italy’s program is unlikely to work.

Italy is correct to want Muslim youths to embrace Western culture as an alternative to turning to radical Islam; however, it’s mistaken in thinking this cultural shift can be forced or that mere exposure to Western culture will have the desired effect.

Italy’s new program, which will run through the end of 2017, will cost the country approximately $300 million. It was first announced soon after the attacks last November on the Bataclan theatre in Paris, where Islamic terrorists killed 130 people. Although its fundamental purpose is to counter radicalization, the vouchers will be available to all 18-year-olds, regardless of religion or ethnicity.

Italy is not the first European country to engage in an ideological battle in an attempt to dissuade youth from radicalizing. Britain has a program called “Prevent” that targets “at-risk youth”—those from Muslim families—and offers them counseling. This program has been criticized for stigmatizing and ostracizing Muslims, and for being a pathway for police surveillance of the Muslim community in Britain.

Germany has a number of counter- and de-radicalization programs, based on similar programs from the 1980s and ‘90s for neo-Nazis. These have had dubious outcomes. Earlier this year, a 16-year-old student threw a bomb into a Sikh temple. These types of programs have also been considered with skepticism because, as one former Salafist notes, “You can’t get anyone out unless he wants it.” So how do you make them want it?

Western Culture Isn’t that Effective, Either

Although Italy is trying to think outside of the box with its hybrid financial-cultural incentive, its plan is destined for failure. To begin with, most 18-year-olds are far more likely to use such a voucher to head to a movie or concert rather than a museum. In that case, how do movies and concerts, essentially vacuous pop culture, help influence young Muslim men not to radicalize? What values do they hold that would persuade a young man looking for a sense of identity not to take refuge in an extreme religious sect?

Many of the terrorists who’ve targeted Western countries in the last year were much engaged in Western pop culture—going to clubs and concerts, drinking, dancing—often just days before launching an attack. Salah Abdeslam, one of the Bataclan attackers, was co-owner of a night club. (Even the 9/11 attackers reportedly visited strippers in Las Vegas and Daytona Beach.)

Furthermore, are movies and concerts really at the heart of the culture that Italy wants its people to engage in? What about encouraging support for and engagement of principles like freedom of expression and democracy? These are certainly more crucial for preserving European culture than going to see an action movie.

Even if Muslim youth did choose to use their vouchers for museums, it’s not clear this would produce any positive effects, either. In Paris, all students have free admission to public museums, but this has hardly slowed North African youth from turning to Islamism and launching terrorist attacks in France.

The fact is, exposure to Western culture—not insulation from it—has a history of inspiring some Muslims to turn to Islamic extremism and terrorism. Sayyid Qutb, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950s and ‘60s, spent time as an exchange student in the United States, and partly this experience helped push him toward radical Islam and indicting the West.

Try Cutting the Welfare State that Funds Your Enemies

What’s more, financial assistance in whatever form is just as likely to hurt as help. Europe’s welfare state has been proven to subsidize terrorism, not counter it. Several of the terrorists involved in the Brussels and Paris attacks had been receiving various kinds of stipends and financial aid from the Belgium government. This money helped sustain them while they were planning their attacks.

Financial subsidies help make it possible for Islamic extremists to engage in terrorist activities. In fact, in its 2015 guide titled “How to Survive in the West,” ISIS encouraged followers in Europe to take advantage of any financial aid they can to help fund their plots or trips to Iraq and Syria.

Regardless of the drawbacks of the specific plan, Italy has succeeded in identifying a key problem involved in combatting Islamic radicalization: the Muslim population in Europe is largely not embracing Western culture. Unless they do, there will continue to be a gap between Muslim and non-Muslim Europeans, and Islamic extremism will continue to take hold. This is the central problem facing Europe.

The government official in charge of the voucher program, Tommaso Nannicini, says its purpose is to send a message and a reminder of “how crucial culture is, both for personal enrichment and for strengthening the social fabric of the country.” Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi called it a “cultural battle” that must be won. They are both right.

Yet Italy has still failed to see that no country can force a people to embrace one culture and abandon another. Nor can they be bribed into it. France has learned this lesson with its burkini ban experiment. Cities like Nice tried to forbid Muslim women from wearing the full-body covering to beaches, insisting the clothing violates the republican principle of equality of the sexes. Nice police went so far as to order women who were violating the order to strip in front of other beach-goers. Government actions like these will not only fail in assimilating Muslims, but further alienate them. (Thankfully, the burkini ordinance was overturned last week.)

The ultimate goal of encouraging engagement with European culture is to protect and preserve that culture. But, as I’ve written previously, this is precisely what Europe has been reticent to do for a variety of reasons. How can European countries possibly ask their Muslim citizens to assimilate to a culture that the countries themselves are too ashamed to defend? Italy’s recognition of what Europe must do is a good sign, even if its voucher program is fraught with problems.

The idea of encouraging appreciation of European culture is apt to offend some who don’t like the idea of asking immigrants to adjust or change. These people think immigrants should be able, and even ought, to live in cultural enclaves while taking advantage of the economic benefits of their new home. Italy’s new program is, therefore, bound to find resistance and criticism, and is unlikely to be replicated in whatever form. This is an unfortunate reality of our politically correct age.

Italy’s cash-for-culture program is likely to produce little fruit. But the fact that they understand the importance of culture and its role in the battle against Islamic extremism is a positive sign in these dark days for Europe.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/07/museum-trips-will-not-keep-european-teens-islamism/,2016-09-07
15 Things More Terrifying Than Trump Calling A Bomb A Bomb,"This weekend, individuals placed four sets of bombs in public places, two of them in New Jersey and two in New York City. By Monday morning, law enforcement officials had put out a request for sightings of Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalized American citizen from Afghanistan, in connection with the attacks.

A separate terrorist attack took place in a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, where a man reportedly asked shoppers if they were Muslim before lunging at them with a knife. Eight people were injured before he was shot and killed by an ex-cop who’s now an NRA-certified full-time concealed carry instructor. He happened to be at the mall.

All of these attacks took place on Saturday and Sunday. Shortly after the first New York City bomb exploded, injuring dozens, Donald Trump spoke at a campaign rally where he said, “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what’s going on.”

This was a true statement, but it greatly alarmed the media on account of local law enforcement officials not yet explicitly saying the explosion that injured dozens was a “bomb.” They did that later.

Here are three things more terrifying than Donald Trump calling a bomb a bomb before local law enforcement officials called it a bomb.

1) Our Media Obsessing More About Trump Calling A Bomb A Bomb Too Early

The first New Jersey bomb went off in a garbage bin while no runners were around. A Marine race was scheduled to pass by during that time but had been rescheduled. Thankfully, no one was hurt. Less than an hour after a second bomb exploded in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, Trump made his statement.

With little other information to go on, and a media that has more or less lost its collective mind as it relates to covering Trump, here’s a small sample of what followed:

Trump, without confirmation of anything, tells CO crowd that a bomb went off in New York.



Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 18, 2016

Imagine what would happen if a president said something was a bomb that turned out to be not a bomb.



Blake Hounshell (@blakehounshell) September 18, 2016

Then Trump announced to a crowd in Colorado that ""a bomb went off in New York"" Wildly wreckless and irresponsible. https://t.co/ShG3KuBsMt



Joshua Chavers (@JoshuaChavers) September 18, 2016

@KatyTurNBC NYPD official, high up, didn't know what it was. Trump doesn't. Maybe he got bad info…



Justin Miller (@justinjm1) September 18, 2016

Now imagine roughly 3,000 groupthinking journalists all tweeting that in unison. This turned into headline after headline about how the major problem about a bomb going off in Chelse was that someone called it one before some agreed-upon approved time:

.@realDonaldTrump tells crowd that a ""bomb went off"" in New York amid reports of ""explosion"" in #Chelsea https://t.co/SbPnOUsYkl



CBS News (@CBSNews) September 18, 2016

Esquire published a piece headlined “Last Night, Trump Casually Told Everyone That a Bomb Went Off in New York“:

Last night, in a hangar in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Trump took 13 minutes to go on stage to address his supporters. He then decided to construct his own reality, as he so often does, by telling his supporters that a bomb went off in New York—before it was even confirmed that the explosion in Chelsea was a bomb.

CNN made an entire story out of “Trump says ‘bomb went off in New York'”:

Trump made the statement before local officials had publicly confirmed details of the incident or what caused the explosion. Typically, national political figures use caution when describing unfolding situations and law enforcement actions.

Let’s first note that Trump specifically said “a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what’s going on.” And let’s go ahead and also note that Hillary Clinton used the word “bombings” shortly thereafter:

After flying to NY, Clinton tells reporters she has been briefed on the ""bombings in New York and New Jersey and the attack in Minnesota.""



Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) September 18, 2016

The media asked her, moments after she said that word, whether she thought Trump was wrong to say it was a bomb. Because that’s a good question.

Now I don’t know if Trump was speaking rashly, as is his wont. Maybe he learned about the bombing in the briefing he received before he got off his plane. Maybe he has better sources in the NYPD than most media outlets do.

And if he was speaking rashly, as he did with the still unexplained crash of an EgyptAir flight in May, it’s worth the media mentioning it.

But as I wrote last night:

Y’all realize that freaking out over Trump calling it a bomb is more alarming to many Americans than calling a bomb a bomb too early, right?



Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 19, 2016

These headlines about Trump calling it a bomb are blatant press attempts to delegitimize him but they really come off like ads for him.



Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 19, 2016

Trump’s appeal to his supporters is based partly in his willingness to say obvious things, such as that a bomb went off in Chelsea and we don’t know exactly what’s going on. We have a political and media class that downplays the motivation for domestic terror attacks unless they are unrelated to Islamism. We have a political and media class unwilling to host substantive or meaningful debates about how to mitigate or prevent these attacks beyond fever dreams regarding removing the natural right of self defense.

A media that keeps telling people to calm down, a media that obsesses over whether someone called a bomb a bomb too early, a media that would focus on the timing of such a claim rather than, oh I don’t know, an ISIS attack at a mall in Minnesota, is one that produces far more anxiety than a presidential candidate saying something too early.

Also, a media establishment that immediately carried so much water for an administration that immediately blamed a Coptic YouTube filmmaker for Islamist attacks in Libya, Egypt and elsewhere is in no position to say a word about someone calling a bomb a bomb before some unknown agreed-upon time. Grow up.

2) President Obama’s Lack Of Interest In Domestic Terror

Presumably President Obama will get around to discussing the coordinated series of attacks that hit the United States this weekend, even if those attacks didn’t result in the carnage they could have. (Update: He got around to a few brief, detached remarks early Monday afternoon.)

Perhaps he’ll get around to it on Monday, more than 48 hours after the first attack on the Marine Corps race. It will be after I had my first nightmare that Islamist terrorists bombed the street near my house, putting the lives of those I love at risk. It makes me feel weird that I’m seemingly more concerned about a terror campaign than people actually elected to deal with national defense.

3) The Obama Administration’s Belief That The Battle Against ISIS Is A War Of Words

During a Monday morning television appearance on CNN, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the United States is engaged in a “narrative fight” with ISIS. This matches terminology we’ve heard from President Obama.

It’s true that battles with enemies willing to blow people up in the streets of Boston, Paris, Nice, and New York aren’t just waged with bullets and bombs, but the Obama administration’s unwillingness to take a murderous ideology seriously is deeply alarming.

4) Team Obama’s Longtime Downplaying of Islamist Terrorism

A year and a half ago, Byron York astutely noted that the Obama administration’s avoidance of a unity rally following horrific attacks on Charlie Hebdo was not surprising:

The uproar over whether President Obama or another top administration official should have attended the massive unity rally in Paris has obscured an important point about the White House’s reaction to the latest terror attacks in Europe. The administration no-shows were not a failure of optics, or a diplomatic misstep, but were instead the logical result of the president’s years-long effort to downgrade the threat of terrorism and move on to other things.

Whatever Obama’s actual strategy to counter Islamist terror is, the messaging from his administration sounds a lot like, “Calm down about ISIS.” And telling people to calm down about something is almost never a good way to get them to do so. Next time someone is upset about a legitimate problem, try telling them to calm down and report back what happens.

The last eight years have seen a plethora of Islamist attacks in this and many other countries. This administration has pooh-poohed concerns about the growing problem, no matter how gruesome or gory it may be. Every attack is done by a lone wolf who we shouldn’t worry our pretty little heads about. Nevermind that they rarely are lone wolves or that the “calm down” demand is never applied to actual lone wolf nuts who go on shooting sprees.

It’s a not particularly elegant form of gaslighting, and it is one of the main reasons people are questioning political elites’ ability to comprehend, much less manage or confront, the actual threat of Islamist terrorism.

Here are a few other things more terrifying than Donald Trump calling a bomb a bomb earlier than newsrooms would prefer.

5) A Coordinated Series Of Terror Attacks

Like the ones that happened this weekend in New York and New Jersey, involving a group of, uh, “lone wolves” targeting public spaces including race routes, neighborhoods, and rail lines.

6) Getting Stabbed By Terrorists In A Mall

Like the one that took place this weekend in St. Cloud, where the attacker reportedly asked if people were Muslim before stabbing them.

7) Getting Shot By Terrorists At A Nightclub

Like what happened to dozens of Floridians out for a night of fun at a gay club before dying at the hands of a heavily armed ISIS fighter in … Orlando.

8) Getting Gunned Down by an Islamist Colleague

Like what happened to 36 injured and murdered people in a terrorist attack at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California.

9) Being Maimed and Murdered by Terrorists While Running a Marathon

Like what happened to hundreds of runners and observers at the Boston Marathon a couple of years ago when Islamist terrorists used pressure cookers to kill and maim as many people as possible. Six people died and 280 were injured, some extremely seriously.

10) Getting Run Down On Holiday By A Terrorist Driving A Truck

Like what happened to more than 500 people celebrating Bastille Day on the promenade in Nice. Some 86 people were murdered and another 434 were injured.

11) Being Killed For What You Publish

Like what happened to the cartoonists and other employees at Charlie Hebdo, when two Islamist terrorists forced their way into the heavily fortified offices of the satirical publication and used assault rifles to murder 11 and injure another 11.

12) Being Killed On A Terrorist-Hijacked Plane

Like what happened to passengers of four passenger aircraft that were used by Islamist terrorists to crash into the World Trade Center towers, the Pentagon, and what was supposed to be the U.S. Capitol.

13) Being Killed By Terrorists Using A Hijacked Plane

Like what happened to more than 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001.

14) Being Targeted By Terrorists In Foiled Plots

Like what has happened to Americans from Portland, Oregon, to the Bronx in the last couple of decades.

15) Being Told By Your President And His Secretary Of State That A YouTube Video Caused Widespread Violence

Like what happened just four years ago when this administration repeatedly threw the First Amendment and an American practitioner of it under the bus to excuse violence and mislead Americans about an orchestrated and well-planned terror attack that killed four Americans, including a U.S. ambassador.

We could go on and on.

Donald Trump speaking more quickly than the media would like is certainly worth noting. It speaks to how he would handle himself as president. But a media class unable to see real threats while histrionically responding to every word Trump utters is doing little but helping his campaign succeed.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/19/15-things-more-terrifying-than-trump-calling-a-bomb-a-bomb/,2016-09-19
Hillary Clinton Would Rather Blame Free Speech Than Islam For Terrorism,"It’s one thing to watch liberals euphemize “Islamic terrorism” into a vacuous, politically correct word salad. It’s quite another to hear them blame free expression for Islamists’ actions. And they do it often. When Hillary Clinton accuses Donald Trump of giving “aid and comfort” to ISIS and other extremists because of his crude rhetoric about Muslim immigration, that’s exactly what she’s doing.

For one thing, the idea that an average Muslim can be driven to purchase a pressure cooker and blow up Chelsea or massacre infidel children because a U.S. candidate says unkind things about Muslims inadvertently concedes to a terrible truth about the state of Islam today.

Moreover, this thinking dangerously underestimates the power of ideology and religion in the world. It’s hard to quantify the depth of self-importance it must take to believe that your patronizing words are more powerful than someone’s faith. This trivialization of the problem is reflected when the administration offers an idea as simplistic as, “When it comes to ISIL, we are in a fight — a narrative fight — with them, a narrative battle.”

Also, Islamists are fully capable of ferreting out propaganda whenever they want it, anyway. Anyone who’s paid five seconds of attention to the Israel-Arab conflict understands that the Islamic world is saturated with conspiracy theories and institutionalized hate that makes what we actually say largely irrelevant. The problem is that you’re an infidel, not that you’re a rude infidel. ISIS is no stronger because Trump got into an argument with a Gold Star dad. (Although supporting policy that made Libya an anarcho-state might be a different story.)

Yet intimating that Americans should watch what they say is now embedded into the Left’s response to every terror attack. I remember the repulsion liberals felt when Ari Fleischer (allegedly) told Americans they should mind their opinions. Chilling speech is awful, depending on the topic, I guess.

It’s also not new. You’ll remember when Obama and Hillary blamed a promotional trailer for that obscure anti-Islam “film,” rather than admitting extremists used our liberalism as a pretext to gin up mobs across the Islamic world and cover their coordinated attack on Americans.

The administration didn’t go onto Pakistani television and defend American values by saying: “Since our founding the United States has been a nation that respects free speech and, unlike illiberal regimes (some of which we support), America allow all viewpoints.” Instead Obama decided to, in essence, apologize for our obnoxious habit of allowing free expression: “Since our founding the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate religious beliefs of others.” This is not only debatable, it is completely irrelevant. The Founders were concerned about religious liberty (so not suing nuns, etc..) not about hurt feelings.

Then again, Democrats generally have been more likely to blame Republicans — or the Second or Fifth Amendments — for terrorism than they have Islam. Chris Murphy is far more disturbed by the NRA than he is Islamism. This allows him to accuse Republicans of “selling weapons to ISIS.” And this allows Hillary to praise his efforts.

This is just one way the Left uses terrorism to chill speech. Anyone who’s ever brought up the entrenched violence and illiberalism of Islam is to be scolded for his “Islamophobia,” immediately. If the terrorists use a firearm, blame the NRA. If the terrorists use an IED, blame Republicans for being mean.

Above all of that, Hillary has just accused the GOP nominee of treason because he says things she dislikes. Anyone who gives our enemies “aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere” is “guilty of treason.” Those guilty of treason may “suffer death.”

One ISIS expert claims the group “talks about Obama more” than Trump. Should we accuse the president of giving aid and comfort?

Hillary loves to say that “words do matter,” so surely, as well-versed as she is in law and as important as accountability is to her, she couldn’t have merely been throwing around this specific language, right?

Remember when Trump blamed Obama for the Florida shooting? You should. Understandably, every major news organization covered it. We were plunged into a national conversation about the irresponsibility of the Republican candidate. Do you remember how Republican National Convention attendees chanted “lock her up” when Hillary’s name was mentioned? You should. We had another very serious discussion about civility in politics. I wonder if we’ll be allowed to have another one.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/19/hillary-clinton-rather-blame-free-speech-islam-terrorism/,2016-09-19
"NY, NJ Bomber Rahami The Latest Terrorist To Pass FBI Investigation","“Ahmad Khan Rahami’s Father Told Police in 2014 His Son Was a Terrorist, Officials Say,” according to the New York Times.

The story says that when alleged New York and New Jersey bomber Rahami was captured, he was carrying a notebook in which he wrote of killing unbelievers. Investigators are looking into what, if any, assistance he had in carrying out his terror plot as well as his series of trips to Pakistan:

The father made the statement about his son being a terrorist to New Jersey police in 2014, when Mr. Rahami was arrested after a domestic dispute and accused of stabbing his brother.



The information was passed to the Joint Terrorism Task Force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Newark. Officers opened what is known as an assessment, the most basic of F.B.I. investigations, and interviewed the father, who then recanted.

This is the latest example of the FBI receiving tips about terrorists prior to their acts of terror. Here are a few others of recent vintage:

Orlando : The FBI was tipped off to Omar Mateen’s radical views in 2013. They put him under surveillance and used confidential informants, but dropped the investigation. A year later he was investigated for ties to the first American suicide bomber in Syria. They dropped that investigation as well. He went on to kill 49 clubgoers and injure another 53.

The ‘Draw Muhammad’ Shooter : The FBI allegedly egged on one of the men involved in the terror attack, after previously closing a case involving making false statements to federal officials. Here’s what The Daily Beast reported: “Days before an ISIS sympathizer attacked a cartoon contest in Garland, Texas, he received a text from an undercover FBI agent. ‘Tear up Texas,’ the agent messaged Elton Simpson days before he opened fire at the Draw Muhammad event, according to an affidavit (pdf) filed in federal court Thursday.” Shortly thereafter, he and his accomplice drove to the contest and shot at police officers.

Two years later, he and his brother wrought terror at the Boston marathon, using pressure cooker bombs.

Fort Hood Shooter: “The FBI was too concerned about political correctness and did not launch an investigation into a man who was later charged with killing 13 people in the 2009 attack in Fort Hood, Texas, despite significant warning signs that he was an Islamic extremist bent on killing civilians,” the Associated Press reported in 2012.

The FBI isn’t the only agency to have dropped the ball on investigating terrorism. Here are a few other examples.

San Bernardino Terrorists : Less than a day after a terrorist attack in which 14 people were killed and another 22 injured, the head of the San Bernardino U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office stonewalled Homeland Security agents attempting to investigate the man accused of supplying the guns and ammo in the attack. According to an Inspector General report, Irene Martin also gave inconsistent answers when speaking with the agents. The suspect was later apprehended.

Dallas Police Shooter: The Army failed to fully investigate charges of misconduct against Micah Johnson, who killed five police officers and injured another seven, and erroneously granted him an honorable discharge, CNN reported.

What are we actually getting for our homeland security spending? We spend more than $8 billion a year on the FBI, $41 billion on DHS, and $70 billion on intelligence. The bombs in New York City were found by random people on the street wanting free stuff, and curious neighbors. The New Jersey bombs were heroically discovered by homeless people rifling through garbage. The Minnesota ISIS terrorist was killed by an NRA-certified concealed carry instructor.

There are many wonderful federal employees toiling away in each of these agencies, and many committed bureaucrats and officers doing what they can to keep the country safe. At the same time, it’s worth asking if the administrative state’s handling of terror threats is worth the tremendous expense that goes with it. If not, it’s also worth asking what all needs to change.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/20/ny-nj-bomber-rahami-the-latest-terrorist-to-pass-fbi-investigation/,2016-09-20
It’s Deadly To Pretend ISIS Doesn’t Mean What It Says,"Over the weekend, America once again became the target of terrorism. This time it was several pipe bombs and homemade pressure cookers left in multiple locations in New York City and New Jersey. The prime suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, an Afghanistan-born American, was apprehended Monday morning after a shootout with police.

While Rahami’s motivations are still allegedly unknown, it appears he traveled to Afghanistan, after which friends say he appeared to have been radicalized. Just like after so many other recent Islamist terrorist attacks, there was a rush from the media and politicians to claim these attacks weren’t organized by the Islamic State (ISIS), and therefore were random events. This is not only disingenuous—it’s reckless.

On Sunday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was quick to assure people that although the blast did appear to be intentional, it was certainly not a case of “international terrorism” (Monday morning Cuomo changed his mind after Rahami was identified as the suspect). How the governor made his initial assessment so quickly isn’t clear. Why he did so is perhaps easier to grasp.

Liberal politicians and members of the media want to deny an “international” aspect because it gives them an excuse for inaction. If it’s not international, and instead just a domestic problem that’s (fingers crossed) “just random,” the government won’t have to address or change its foreign policy. It would mean ISIS isn’t actually powerful enough to reach out beyond Europe and the Middle East and strike America, and that the U.S.-led coalition fighting in Iraq and Syria is sufficient for combatting the threat.

It would also vindicate President Obama’s foreign policy of “leading from behind,” and suggest it hasn’t caused massive upheaval in the Middle East that may take decades to fix.

When Lone Wolves Become a Pack

People often employ the “lone wolf” claim to avoid acknowledging international terrorism. By Monday morning, when it became clear that several bombs had been intended to detonate and cause mass chaos, a terrorism analyst told CNN’s Carol Costello that it’s possible that “two or three lone wolves may have gotten together.” This linguistic maneuvering attempts to distract from the fact that coordination between individuals is what defines a network. As Dana Loesch noted on Twitter: “How many ‘lone wolves’ make a pack?” Multiple attacks imply an organized effort. (Later in the morning, Rahani became the primary suspect in all of the bombing attempts, and it’s not yet clear whether he had any accomplices.)

This line of argumentation has been used repeatedly after past terrorist attacks, even when there’s ample evidence that the attacker(s) pledged allegiance to ISIS (see the Orlando nightclub shooting, San Bernardino, etc.). It’s also the reason being given for a stabbing in a Minnesota mall over the weekend by a Somali-American man, Dahir Adan, who allegedly cried “allahu akbar” before attacking nine people and being shot dead by an off-duty police officer. Although ISIS claimed Adan as one of their “soldiers,” the St. Cloud, Minnesota police chief, Blair Anderson, said nothing suggests this was “anything but a lone attacker.”

The appeal of this approach is that if the attacker is just a lone wolf, not an ISIS operative, then it could simply be someone disaffected by poverty or social alienation. Rahami’s family had previously complained about discrimination in their New Jersey town, for example. Or perhaps it’s a mentally ill individual—a diagnosis that now covers all manner of sins, including religious zealotry—who just snapped.

These motivations can be attributed to political and social ills like lack of health care, gun control, or welfare, the blame for which falls conveniently on Republicans. This also makes it easier to avoid facing the threat of radical Islam, both as an international military matter and as a religious and political movement.

ISIS Explicitly Supports Attacks Like This

But whether or not an attacker has some personal issues or mental illness is ultimately immaterial to the question of whether the attack is carried out on behalf of an international terrorist organization. Even if it’s true that the person is unstable, or the victim of discrimination, the reality is that ISIS uses these people as their long arm to reach out and strike the West, which, as for all Islamists, is one of their primary strategic goals. It’s not just a reactionary move in the face of territorial defeat in the Middle East.

It’s also either naïve or deeply dishonest to say that because ISIS didn’t directly coordinate an attack, it wasn’t an ISIS attack. Inspiring adherents around the world to launch terrorist attacks on their own initiative is a vital part of ISIS’s strategy. It’s a more efficient use of time and resources if they don’t have to plan every single attack. Instead, they can rely on people devoted to ISIS and its fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. It also makes it more difficult for law enforcement to detect plots and potential terrorists.

ISIS has been explicit about this. The group has been calling on Muslims in Western countries to kill civilians by any means at least since September 2014. The group regularly publishes manuals on how to perpetrate these “homegrown” terrorist attacks, including information on building bombs, using knives, or simply running people over in a truck, like the attack in Nice, France that killed 86 people. All these methods have been successfully utilized in so-called “lone wolf” attacks in Europe and America. (It’s interesting to note that while ISIS itself uses the phrase “lone wolf,” they do so differently than Westerners, who use it to indicate an isolated event.)

To add some historical context, recall that at the end of the nineteenth century, Europe was suffering a rash of anarchist terrorist attacks. At the time, they were considered isolated and unrelated events. But in retrospect, historians like Barbara Tuckman have noted that these men and women were acting as part of a broader movement, one that worked almost like a virus spreading its radicalism to otherwise unconnected individuals. Their connection, of course, was their beliefs.

ISIS is much more overtly organized and blatant about its mission and strategy than nineteenth-century European anarchists, even if that strategy involves the illusion of disparate actors. Yet so many politicians and members of the media continue to act like the whole thing is a mystery, dots with no lines connecting them. They don’t take ISIS, or the attackers, at their word. That’s a dangerous game to play.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/20/pretending-isis-doesnt-mean-says-deadly/,2016-09-20
Watch Trevor Noah Accidentally Destroy The Case For Gun Control,"Trevor Noah, the host of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, accidentally destroyed the case for gun control during his show on Wednesday night.

Noah’s accidental broadside against gun-free zones came during a portion of his opening monologue in which he made fun of a Minnesota man fed up with Islamic terrorism. The target of Noah’s ire was an ice cream shop owner in a small town southeast of St. Cloud, Minnesota — the site of a mass stabbing at a mall last weekend — who put up a sign outside of his restaurant that read, “Muslims Get Out.”

Noah mocked the store owner for a little bit, but then he moved on to the meat of his opening bit by mocking the man’s rationale for his “Muslims Get Out” sign:

You know what’s also strange is this man genuinely thought people who go around blowing people up would be stopped by a sign? You realize you’re talking to terrorists, not vampires. They don’t need to be invited in, alright? Or maybe he’s onto something, because if you think about it, we’ve never tried that. We’ve never actually tried to repel terrorists with signs. Yeah, maybe that’s all the airports need is a sign that says “No Terrorists,” yes? Yeah, and then guys are going to be walking going, “Oh, I was going to blow up the airport, but the rules are rules and they said I can’t come in. They said I can’t. They said I can’t come in.”

Does that argument sound familiar?

Noah probably doesn’t know it, but he just accidentally made an airtight case against gun-free zones in particular and gun control in general. He is 100 percent correct: people hell-bent on murdering as many people as possible don’t really care about silly signs or laws that tell them not to murder people. A sign that says “No Guns” will no more keep a violent jihadi from gunning down a bunch of innocent people than will a sign that says “Muslims Get Out.” And how do we know that gun-free zones, nearly always marked with signs designating them as such, don’t deter murderous psychopaths? Because mass shootings, rather than happening at gun ranges or in gun stores, keep happening in gun-free zones.

Contrary to Trevor Noah’s snarky assertion that “we’ve never tried to repel terrorists with signs,” our country has fecklessly tried for years to “repel terrorists with signs.”

The Sandy Hook massacre? Gun-free zone. Columbine? Gun-free zone. The Aurora movie theater shooting? Gun-free zone. The shooting last year at an Oregon community college? Gun-free zone. The shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette? Gun-free zone. The attack on a military recruiting center in Chattanooga? Gun-free zone. The Ft. Hood shooting? You guessed it: gun-free zone. The San Bernardino attack? Gun-free zone. And the massacre perpetrated by an ISIS enthusiast at an Orlando night club? Gun-free zone.

While Noah clearly doesn’t grasp the logical implications of his argument, his particular insight — that evil people who want to do evil things will find ways to carry out their schemes regardless of what signs you post or laws you pass — forms the foundation of the entire argument against gun control.

Bad people who want to murder you don’t care about your stupid signs and stupid laws.

New York City, for example, is a pressure cooker bomb-free zone. That mall in Minnesota was most definitely a weaponized knife-free zone. And yet… Terrorists don’t care that terrorism is illegal. They care about killing you. And they’ll kill you with whatever they can, whether it’s a gun, a knife, a pressure cooker, or a box cutter.

“Yeah, but this just proves we need to have stricter gun laws to prevent terrorists from getting guns in the first place,” Trevor Noah might respond. “Gun control is about more than just signs telling people not to do stuff.”

Except it’s not. The entire premise of gun control is that words on a piece of paper somewhere will prevent a terrorist from killing people. What is a law if not a sign that says what you’re allowed and not allowed to do? Yet time and time and time and time again, strict gun control regimes have completely failed to prevent mass murderers from committing mass murder. Chicago and Washington, D.C., have some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation, yet those laws have done little to stem the tide of gun crime in those cities.

As Trevor Noah demonstrated via his mockery of the Minnesota man with the “Muslims Get Out” sign at his restaurant, the logic of gun control that says signs forbidding bad stuff stops bad stuff from happening is nonsensical. “Words stop bad things from happening” is just dumb. A sign that says “Muslims Get Out” will do absolutely nothing to prevent radical Islamists from wreaking havoc. Trevor Noah understands this. If only he would learn to apply his logic to the argument from gun controllers that all we need to end violence are a few more signs telling terrorists not to use guns.

Newly Released Transcript Proves Orlando Terrorist Was Avenging ISIS,"Orlando police released the full transcripts of terrorist Omar Mateen’s phone conversations with police the night he killed 49 people and injured 53 others on June 12 at a gay nightclub in Orlando.

Throughout multiple conversations with authorities, Mateen repeatedly states he sought to kill and terrorize Americans as payback for drone strikes in Iraq that killed a key ISIS leader, Abu Waheeb, in early May.

Mateen told the negotiator that Waheeb’s death is what “set him off.” Rukmini Callamachi of The New York Times explained his fixation with Waheeb reveals how intensely interested Mateen was in the terror group, as the leader is a lesser-known figure in ISIS.

8. So who is Abu Waheeb? That's exactly the point. Waheeb is an obscure figure in ISIS, one of the original members of al-Qaeda in Iraq — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) September 26, 2016

Mateen repeatedly told police he wanted to send a message to Americans and get them to stop aerial drone strikes against ISIS forces.

“You have to tell America to stop bombing Syria and Iraq,” Mateen said.

In another portion of the phone call, Mateen called Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev his “homeboy,” and when police asked the Orlando terrorist what his name was, he called himself an “Islamic soldier.”

Although the transcript of the initial phone call in which Mateen declared allegiance to the Islamic State was released shortly after the attack, the rest of the conversations between the terrorist and hostage negotiators on that tragic night were made public this last Friday evening. Orlando police were reportedly reticent to release the transcripts, but the FBI said the phone calls will not affect its case.

When the DOJ and FBI released the transcript for the initial 911 call in June, they censored references to Allah and the Islamic State — giving many the impression their investigation would be shaped by an apparent eagerness to memory-hole the terrorist’s true motivations.

In the days after the attack, President Obama and Attorney General Loretta Lynch tried to pretend they weren’t sure whether his Islamism motivated Mateen.

“I cannot tell you definitively that we will ever narrow it down to one motivation,” Lynch said in a press conference a few days after the attack. “People often act out of more than one motivation.”

Four days after the attack, Obama said the terrorist’s motivations were unclear.

“So whatever the motivations of the killer, whatever influences led him down the path of violence and terror, whatever propaganda he was consuming from ISIL and al Qaeda, this was an act of terrorism but it was also an act of hate,” he said.

Later in the same speech, Obama blamed the attack on the terrorist’s ability to procure a gun and Republican lawmakers who didn’t want to circumvent Americans’ Fifth Amendment right to due process. He also conflated Mateen’s actions with those of the Newton and Aurora shooters, who had no apparent or coherent ideology to speak of, and ignored the fact that Mateen repeatedly stated he was seeking to avenge ISIS in the last moments of his life.

Although the full transcript has been released, questions still remain, as portions of this call remain unclear — including a key part in which Mateen declares allegiance to ISIS.

“I pledge allegiance to (unidentifiable name) on behalf of the Islamic State,” Mateen said, according to the transcript.

Study: Left's' Narrative On ISIS Recruits Is Wrong -- It's Not The Economy,"One of the oft-heard tropes about ISIS recruits is that they’re poor, uneducated, and desperate. But like so many other liberal pieties about radical Islamic terrorism, it turns out this just isn’t true.

Last week, the World Bank released a study on the country of origin, marriage status, skills, and education level of foreign ISIS recruits who joined the jihadist group between early 2013 and late 2014. It found no correlation between education level or poverty and joining ISIS. While this may not come as a surprise to those who have been following the development of the Islamic State, it delivers a crushing blow to the left’s assertion that the root cause of “violent extremism” is economic.

ISIS Recruits Aren’t Who You Think They Are

The documents, which were smuggled out by a disaffected ISIS member, come from the vetting and interviewing process of 331 foreign recruits during the time period in question. The study not only didn’t find poverty to be a motivating factor in becoming an Islamist fighter, it showed that wealthier countries were more often a source for recruitment than poorer ones.

The documents also disprove the theory that Islamist fighters are largely uneducated. According to the study, 69 percent of recruits had received at least a high school education and many of those from the Middle East and North Africa went on to study at a university. The World Bank study also compared the education levels of the recruits to the average education levels of citizens in their country of origin, and found that the recruits were significantly more educated.

What is most shocking, however, is that those who expressed a desire to become suicide bombers in their entry-interview were found to be the most well-off. This shouldn’t be surprising, given the background of violent Islamists like Osama Bin-Laden, a millionaire who was educated in elite Saudi Arabian schools. But it might be a surprise to the Left’s pet theory that poverty is driving young Muslim men to desperation and into the arms of Islamist groups.

What Motivates Young People to Join ISIS?

But if it’s not poverty that’s inspiring young men to become suicide bombers, what is? This is the question that liberals in America and Europe have been avoiding for 15 years. Now, with a study featuring such a large “participant” size, the question should be harder to ignore.

The left cannot believe that people are still motivated by religion.

Progressives have insisted for years that the primary motivation for joining violent Islamist groups, whether ISIS or Al Qaeda or any other, is economic injustice. According to their playbook, if we could just resolve the economic woes of the world, people would have no reason to make what, in the mind of the Left, is a desperate move. Relatedly, if these recruits were able to get an education they would have no reason to want to blow themselves up.

Progressives can be myopic about the role of wealth and education as determiners of all things in a person’s life. For them, it’s difficult to see anything else that could come into play—except, perhaps, discrimination. This is partly due to their ongoing crusade against capitalism and wealth. But using poverty and inequality as scapegoats to explain the appeal of “violent extremism” has another purpose. By steering the conversation toward income inequality, progressives can avoid talking about that most uncomfortable of topics: religion.

We Can’t Ignore the ‘Islam’ in ‘Islamic Extremism’

Examining the religious motivations for joining explicitly religious groups, like ISIS or Al Qaeda, should seem like a given. Yet the left cannot believe that people are still motivated by religion. In progressive metaphysics, the world is moving ever forward, progressing toward a better state of existence. This means giving up silly beliefs about God, and instead looking toward scientific, social, and economic justice. If they are to be true to their own dogma, progressives must reject the idea that man can still be motivated by his faith to do anything—much less give up his own life. So they have to find an alternative narrative.

Acknowledging the role of religion in inspiring violent jihad would also distract from the core leftist principles they’d rather focus on. This centers on social justice and the perfection of society through government programs and education. Religious radicalism doesn’t fit into this picture.

What’s more, if Islamism does have to do with religion, then we’d have to talk about—and unavoidably criticize—some sects of Islam. This, above all else, is what the left wants to avoid. It violates their multicultural credo that all beliefs are equal and equally beneficial.

The World Bank study appears to soundly refute this. That’s not to say that poverty and disaffection don’t come into play. The path that leads a person to join ISIS is certainly more complicated and varied than we often acknowledge. But it appears that lack of income and education are not the primary motivating factors.

How Does This Help Us Fight ISIS?

Where this insight really matters is in our strategies for combatting homegrown terrorism. Up until now, progressives have mainly wanted to focus on income and education. This isn’t just an approach held by the media or academia—the Obama administration has adhered to it, as well. In 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry identified poverty as the culprit in recruiting ISIS members. Last year, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said this:

We need…to go after the root causes that lead people to join these groups, whether it’s lack of opportunity for jobs…We can work with countries around the world to help improve their governance. We can help them build their economies so they can have job opportunities for these people.

But this strategy just got blown out of the water, so now what? We need to reexamine our tactics and change our focus, by looking at the status of Islam in America. This means zeroing in on the ideological battle happening within Islam and playing out in American mosques and community centers.

Political Correctness Hinders Our Fight Against ISIS

The Muslim Brotherhood, with ample Saudi funding, influences Muslims via its network of mosques, imams, and Muslim organizations like the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) for decades. CAIR was also linked with the Holy Land Foundation, a “charity” that was found guilty in 2008 of financing terrorism. Instead of lending its ear to CAIR, and thereby legitimizing it, the U.S. government ought to foster credible and truly moderate voices within the Muslim-American community. It should also limit Saudi funding of mosques and sponsorship of Imams here in America.

We need to reexamine our tactics and change our focus, by looking at the status of Islam in America.

What’s more, the government should stop insisting on the censorship of the U.S .intelligence community, which has been instructed to use euphemisms like “violent extremism” in place of “Islamist” and has scrubbed Islamic terms from hundreds of Department of Homeland Security documents. Islamic terms like “Islam,” “jihad,” or “sharia,” have also been banished from DHS training materials, as well as from a new $100 million effort to reach out to Muslim millenials. This denial of the link between terrorism and Islamism needs to stop.

Of course, none of this can be done unless we first acknowledge the link between religion and terrorism. And this requires rejecting education and poverty as the primary motivators of Islamist terrorism. While the World Bank study should change plenty of Americans’ views on this, it will likely fall on deaf ears in the Obama administration—as it has for nearly eight years.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/10/11/study-shows-lefts-narrative-isis-recruits-wrong-not-economy-stupid/,2016-10-11
Brexit Voters And Trump Voters Are Fed Up With The Same Things,"If you want to understand both the Brexit and the Donald Trump vote, you need go no further than the recent demand by the European Union for Britain to censor reporting on Muslim terrorist attacks by eliminating any reference to the terrorist’s Muslim background.

This represents yet another painful example of the chasm that separates an elite concerned with political correctness from a public that cannot fathom the latest laceration of common sense. Across world news, we see innocent people murdered in the most brutal and sadistic fashion in the name of radical Islam. Yet we are told to believe neither our eyes nor ears but to trust members of the elite to tell us what we should have seen and heard.

Usurping our senses this way does not engender any greater tolerance of Muslims but makes us believe that the truth is what we are not being told. The truth is too threatening for the elites to let us access it, and when they cannot stop us from witnessing what is before our eyes, they must reinterpret it for us.

The unintended message of this lofty hubris is that if elites cannot trust us with the truth, we cannot trust them to protect us. The chasm between elites and the people grows, and with it the very political legitimacy that a society needs to remain stable.

Lying to People Makes Them Distrust You

The road to Brexit was not paved by those who stood in the street with signs and called for its passage but by mindless bureaucrats in Brussels who spurned national interests as they became a law unto themselves, issuing ukases like nineteenth-century Russian czars. Most offensive of these was the idea that Brussels and not Parliament would determine the number of immigrants and refugees Britain would have to accept.

In the words of Alexis de Tocqueville, revolutions are not made by those running through streets seeking to cause them but inadvertently by people who sit in positions of power and least want a revolution to occur.

Similarly, the Trump phenomenon is less a consequence of Trump’s campaign than of a growing alienation by vast segments of the population who have similarly been told that the violence of radical Islam is not what they see before their eyes but something else. For six years, the Fort Hood massacre was officially designated workplace violence, even as we assassinated Anwar al-Awlaki, the man who mobilized the shooter.

How About We Start Minding Our Own Business

The Obama administration works assiduously at redacting the words “Islam” and “terrorism” from government manuals, appearing, like the elites in Brussels, more concerned with salving the sensibilities of the Muslim community than protecting the lives of the innocent. Similarly, the administration asks what is in the interests of foreign migrants and refugees rather than what immigration policies serve the interests of our nation.

Perhaps the sharpest contrast between how common people see things and how elites would have them see things became evident with the recent New York bombings in Chelsea. Mayor Bill de Blasio bent over backwards not to utter the word “terrorism” to describe the obvious, while Gov. Andrew Cuomo was willing to say “terrorism,” while denying that it was international terrorism. To the average New Yorker, these semantic hair splits reveal an elite that doesn’t trust the public with the truth even when it’s staring the citizenry in the face.

How does a mass public react to such experiences? In Britain, it was to sever the ties to Brussels. In America, it’s to support an outlier whose voice does not conform to the normal rules of politics but whose narrative resonates with that mass of Americans who feel that their elites have deserted them.

Brexit and the rise of the Trump candidacy are two sides of the same coin. Whether Trump wins or loses, an alienated mass exists in America that is ripe for mobilization, and future power-seekers will not ignore that opportunity.

Rejoice! Baby Boomers’ Reign Of Electoral Terror Is Coming To An End,"Unless you are enjoying the blessed respite of living beneath a rock, you may have heard that 2016 is the most important presidential election ever. It isn’t, though, because it never is. It’s never really Beelzebub versus the guy who invented auto-play videos locked in a battle for supremacy over the populace.

Regardless, this year is pretty brutal. We’re stuck watching two old candidates hit each other with canes, and coming to grips with the fact that we’re going to hear speeches and other bloviations emanating from one of them for the next four years. But there is hope. In the wings, there’s a fresher and younger generation watching, and getting ready to take over.

First, though, we have to set the scene. It starts with the fact that we hear this same tale of impending apocalypse every four years. There is always the possibility that eventually the little boy will be correct and the wolf (which isn’t to say The Wolf) will show up.

More likely, after one of these parasitic Baby Boomers is elected president, there will be much rending of cloth and gnashing of teeth. Then life will continue pretty much apace. Sure, the present shakeups of our communities and other little platoons will continue, as is their wont, but the republic will hold, if tenuously, as is her wont.

That doesn’t mean we can’t despair between now and forever, as is our wont. Existence is nothing without threats, so we find ourselves here, awaiting our destructor, just like in 2012. Also 2008 and 2004 and 2000 and, well, you get the idea. The only question is always which destructor we will choose.

We could rage against it and fight. We could lie back and think of England, wonder if she ever misses us, pretend to be Adele and call her 1,000 times. Fortunately for us, there’s a better way. It’s the one that the current situation demands. It’s right there in front of us, as Jules Winfield explained way back in 1995—the last time there was a Clinton in the White House.

First, Though, We Need to Chill

Scene: a diner, robbery in process, a man known only as Pumpkin and a woman known only as Honey Bunny. Pumpkin approaches Jules Winfield and demands his briefcase. Jules pretends to offer it, but grabs Pumpkin’s wrist and draws his own gun. Honey Bunny panics and trains her weapon on Jules. He retorts. After a brief exchange, in which we learn that Honey Bunny’s name is actually Yolanda, Jules tells her how it’s going to be.

“Nobody’s gonna hurt anybody. We’re gonna be like three Fonzies. And what’s Fonzie like?”

Yolanda, feeling rather like us in 2016, is unsure and unable to reply, but Jules persists. “C’mon Yolanda, what’s Fonzie like?” After stammering for a moment, she answers, “He’s cool?” Calmness begins replacing the chaos. That’s when Jules says to Yolanda, “Correct-amundo! And that’s what we’re gonna be—we’re gonna be cool.”

Now, we may not collectively be involved in an armed robbery (at least not one we can readily appreciate), but our situation is not so different. In the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, we are all Yolanda, and we need to chill.

We need to move to stage five of the Kübler-Ross model of grief and get on with the acceptance. This is true regardless of whether your biggest fear is a Beelzebub victory or a victory for AutoPlay video guy. No matter who wins, it marks the beginning of the end of the Baby Boomers’ reign of terror. As Martha Stewart would say, it’s a good thing.

Most of us cannot remember a time in which Boomers weren’t in command, even if our benighted leaders were not from amongst their ranks. Their predilections and policy preferences were the one ring to rule us all. From excessive spending to Social Security—but I repeat myself—to wars on things to the desire to yell at younger generations about how lazy we are as they retired early and put it on our tab, Boomers have set the direction of the country.

The Rise of the Millennials

Now the generation they nurtured and molded most closely in their own image is going to come of age. That’s right, it’s time for the millennials. Whereas previous generations did the things that defined them and then went on to do normal adult shit like generations before them, millennials are frozen in time, permanently locked into whatever preferences they express as 20-year-olds.

Houses? They’re not going to need them, because they love urban things, particularly urban gardens. Plus urban living means they can skip owning a car because bicycles and walking are the way of the future, particularly for those who live in warmer climates and like to work up a good sweat before heading into an open office.

Children? Please. They’ll never have children, because life most definitely never finds a way. They will raise their own livestock on rooftop pastures and grow fruits and vegetables in window boxes, because authenticity and locality are the most important qualities to them. Then, they will imagineer rainbows from, well, you get the idea.

Who knows? Maybe the prognosticators are correct and all these things about millennials are true. Much like the possibility of flaming death descending from the sky or one of the presidential candidates ending the republic, if ever there were a year, this is it. But it this overlooks an obstacle to millennials’ own reign of terror: Generation X.

It is only befitting that we’d overlook a generation defined by angst and latchkeys, by parents who just wanted to eat, pray, love were it not for those pesky kids. But guess what, we’re here and we’ve been at it for a little longer than the millennials have. If we are curt, it’s because time is a factor and we think fast, talk fast, and need you to act fast if you want to get out of our current predicament.

Sure, they’ve got us beaten on authenticity, but we’ve got them beaten on selling out, which also means we tend to hold a little more sway over society. We may be flattening as a nation, or whatever Thomas Friedman is blathering on about these days, but we’re not flat. In the generational hierarchy, we in Gen X are looking down at you, millennials.

Nothing Is Over Until We Say It Is

Some will protest that the structures are too set and the world has been too remade to Boomers’ specifications, that universities and the government and business models molded to their specifications will protect and perpetuate the culture millennials were bequeathed. Yet Boomers’ reign of terror is coming to a close and, oh right, remember who is taking over before millennials begin their reign.

My generation is not so touchy-feely and romantic about things. Being an overlooked bunch of latchkey kids tends to take that out of you. We may not be pure, cold utilitarians, but we also know that the times have changed and we’re not going back to the post-World War II boom that arose when we were making bank helping the world rebuild everything we’d helped destroy.

Those factory jobs? Gone. Welcome to the service economy. Sorry you have to learn some new skills; not sorry you don’t get exposed to caustic chemicals on the regular. Only working for one-third of your life? Yeah, we’re going to work all of ours just to try to get the bill back down to the break-even point. As such, just go ahead and disabuse yourselves of any notions about spending the last 40 years of your life traveling the globe writing sustainable poetry.

The Suggestion Box Is Located to Your Right

We’re not unreasonable, though. You can locavore all you want. Just make it profitable and don’t expect taxpayers to subsidize it. We are subsidizing one set of locusts—the Boomers—already and don’t need to help you fight the more traditional variety.

We are subsidizing one set of locusts—the Boomers—already and don’t need to help you fight the more traditional variety.

You can certainly spend a period living in the city and getting trashed every Tuesday night, but let’s not pretend that at 50 going to the club will still be your primary concern. If it is, know that you’re now that guy, the one you remember from your younger days. Keeping that truth in mind, let’s not redesign the entire world into a cluster of dense, walkable urban centers based around single people with no children.

Passion? Again, do whatever, but make sure it’s profitable. We’re not letting you rack up the bills just so you can try to live the life your Boomer makers led. The same holds true for various things you think can be free, but really are paid for with taxes—taxes you’re now paying, because, surprise, you’re wealthy as far as the tax man is concerned. And you don’t even have any deductions since you have no house or kids.

Maybe, just maybe, we can find the will to smash those deductions into one million itemized pieces, just as we may be able to destroy the perverse tax and regulatory structure that confuses big business with free enterprise. You think you hate capitalism, which you don’t, so let’s use that hatred for good. No, we won’t be incorporating many of Bernie Sanders’ ideas, as they would only exacerbate the problems, but he isn’t always wrong about what ails us.

No, we won’t be incorporating many of Bernie Sanders’ ideas, as they would only exacerbate the problems, but he isn’t always wrong about what ails us.

As to university life, prepare to be triggered, discomfited, and generally discomforted. There are worse things than hurt feelings and ideas you disagree with, not to mention that advanced puppetry degrees are stupid. Maybe technical colleges can start offering puppetry programs or you could instead not try to turn an obscure hobby into a job. College is supposed to challenge and prepare you, break you down and give you an opportunity to pick yourself back up. You can cavort and take drugs without procuring tens of thousands and dollars in loans.

Then, once you have been broken down into one million pieces, we’ll build you back up. As raw material, you millennials have potential. You older ones aren’t even so bad, being closer in spirit to we Gen Xers. You younger ones, well, you’re alright, too. Even though we like to give you a hard time, it’s just because we enjoy giving people a hard time and you do make it somewhat easy.

Nevertheless, the world is now ours and if there’s one thing living through the past few decades has taught us, it’s that there are some lies that we’re not going to be able to continue living. No, we’re going to have to live our truth on spending, entitlements, foreign engagements, and education, and why we need government to stop pretending those things are free.

Don’t worry, we’ll gladly bring you along as we right-size things, even if it involves some kicking and screaming. You will get input, but you’re not getting full control just yet.

Leftist Group: Saying Islam Has Problems Makes You A Terrorist,"Last week, the Southern Poverty Law Center released a list of 15 anti-Muslim extremists, including writers, intellectuals, and activists. This “Field Guide” is meant to help journalists tell the “good guys” from the “bad guys” by providing them with ammunition against outspoken critics of Islam.

The people on this list are lambasted for talking about violence in Islam, unequal treatment of women, the increasing number of Islamist advisors to our government—including Muslim Brotherhood-backed groups like the Islamic Society of North America and the Center for American-Islamic Relations—and the growing treatment of Islam as a protected class, mostly at the behest of the aforementioned Islamist groups.

This guide called what these writers and thinkers produce “propaganda” that’s “baseless” and “exploitative” of terrorist attacks. It accuses them of “demoniz[ing] the entire Islamic faith” and “inspiring hate-based violence.” Importantly, the SPLC used the term “extremist” to describe the people on their list (that’s left-speak for “terrorist”).

One of the individuals they profiled is author and women’s rights activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who works to end the cruel practice of female genital mutilation in the Muslim world. She’s also known for co-producing a short film on women’s rights with Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh. He was brutally stabbed after an attempted beheading by a Dutch-Moroccan Muslim, who also threatened Hirsi Ali’s life.

People Who Talk Are Bad, People Who Shoot Misunderstood

But if Hirsi Ali, who has called for an Islamic reformation, is tantamount to a terrorist, then what does that make the Orlando shooter or the San Bernardino attackers? We’ve reached a point of absurdity in our national conversation on Islam, where religious terrorists are just misunderstood or mentally ill, but activists working against the persistent problem of violence in Islam are terrorists.

The Left shies away from terms like “Islamic terrorist,” and “Muslim extremist,” opting instead for the uber-sensitive and inchoate “violent extremism,” as though one could be an extremist about nothing in particular. That’s because they reject any association between Muslims and violence, no matter how many terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of Allah. Because groups like the SPLC refuse to acknowledge this relationship, even in its weakest form, they consequently view any mention of it as anti-Muslim.

This of course doesn’t mean that all Muslims are terrorists. (That should go without saying, but given the new standard for “extremism,” one can never be too careful.) Yet that’s the view the SPLC wants you to think these intellectuals are advocating. It’s in the best interest of Islamists, and those defending them, to pretend there’s one monolithic “Islam,” and people like Hirsi Ali are nothing but Islamophobes.

By doing this, they can make legitimate criticism of the practices of some, or even many, Muslims into a blanketed attack on the entire religion. From there, they can call those critics “anti-Muslim,” detracting from any meaningful conversation about the threat of a legitimate strain of Islam—namely Islamism.

The Real Bigotry Is Making Excuses for Muslims

The 15 people on the SPLC list are accused of inspiring violence, a vague but ominous crime. This same argument has often been used to defend censoring images of Mohammed, especially critical ones. Leftists, and many Muslims around the world, consider any criticism of Islam the same as inspiring violence, and they use this to shut down speech. But fear of violence, or fear of being called a provoker of such violence, shouldn’t deter what and whom we criticize. Especially not in America, where freedom of expression has been enshrined in our Constitution.

The SPLC holds a double standard for Muslims in America. What’s acceptable to criticize about Christianity is not acceptable to criticize about Islam. While a Christian woman who chooses to stay home with her children indicates the sexism inherent to the religion, pointing out the ubiquity of child brides, female genital mutilation, poor education for girls, and unequal treatment under the law in the Muslim world is considered “anti-Muslim extremism.” This double standard hurts Muslims, too, and Muslim women most of all.

Christians are rhetorically flogged routinely and publicly, and their beliefs called antiquated, bigoted, and sexist by a liberal mainstream media. But there’s no outcry from academics and intellectuals about the violation of these Christians’ rights. Christians themselves don’t claim these criticisms might provoke violence or amount to hate speech that ought to be banished. They accept that this is the price of freedom of conscience and expression. So why should Islam be any different?

The SPLC surely thinks it’s providing a valuable public service by distributing this “field guide” to the media. And it’s their constitutional right so to do. But that doesn’t mean we can’t call it out for the farce that it is.

If the standard for “extremism” is speaking out against a religion for its faults, real or perceived, then the word has lost whatever paltry meaning it had before. And if calling Hirsi Ali an anti-Muslim extremist is the new normal, then I suppose that east is west and up is down. Happy 2016, everybody.

This article has been updated to reflect that Theo Van Gogh’s beheading was not completed, as previously implied, so his murder was ultimately due to a stabbing directly after the beheading attempt.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/11/02/leftist-group-saying-islam-problems-makes-terrorist/,2016-11-02
"Since Berlin’s Terrorist Is At Large, Will We Finally Start To Tag Islamism?","It happened again. After a reprieve from the nearly weekly incidences of Islamist terror attacks in the West this year, there’s been another. Just six days before Christmas, a man drove a semi-truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin’s historic downtown. Twelve people died and dozens are injured. While Germany was victim to three smaller-scale terrorist attacks over the summer, this is the first large-scale attack that’s been successfully executed.

ISIS claimed responsibility, referring to the attacker(s) as a “soldier of the Islamic State,” as they often do when an ISIS sympathizer carries out an attack in the West. But this time something is different. Not only did the attacker not die in the aftermath, he’s nowhere to be found.

Germany officials initially arrested and held a Pakistani man who sought asylum in Germany earlier this year. But Tuesday evening he was released and authorities announced that the real culprit was still at large. They suggested there may be more than one man involved, as is often the case.

This leaves open the possibility that the unknown attacker will strike again, buoyed by his “success” in once again causing misery and fear in Europe. But this unique situation also allows for the attacker to speak out about his motivations, something previous perpetrators of Islamist terrorism have been unable to do. In fact, because attackers are often killed during the assault, Western media spends days, sometimes weeks, agonizing over possible motives other than religion.

Maybe with the attacker still alive, he can help convince the West that his was an act motivated by religious and political zealotry—not insanity, poverty, or a poor education.

We Hate the West and We Don’t Need Guns to Hit It

The Berlin attack echoed the devastating Nice terrorist attack back in July. Recall that a Tunisian man drove a truck onto the famous Nice promenade on Bastille Day during a fireworks display, killing 86 and injuring hundreds more. This week’s attack teaches us once again, and ever so sadly, that guns, bombs, or even extensive planning aren’t necessary for one man to wreak havoc on a city, country, and countless families. Where there’s a will, there’s a way. As the last two years have also shown us, there is certainly a resolve among certain Muslim sects to teach the West a violent lesson.

The symbolic selection of a Christmas market is particularly tragic, although not surprising. Christmas markets have topped the list of known potential targets in Germany since the recent ISIS-sponsored and -inspired attacks began hitting Europe early in 2015 with the Charlie Hebdo attack. In fact, it was only a few weeks ago that 12-year-old German-Iraqi tried and failed to detonate a nail bomb at a Christmas market elsewhere in Germany.

These Christmas markets are an attractive target not only because they tend to be bustling with innocent bystanders, but because Christmas is the West’s most cherished holiday and a religious occasion for its large Christian community. The Berlin attack, in other words, was meant to strike at the heart of Western culture.

The attack comes at a particularly bad time for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is up for reelection next year and has faced intense criticism over her “open arms” migrant policy during the refugee crisis that began last year. Merkel’s party, the Christian Democratic Union, is worried that the populist wave that has struck countries around the world, including the United States, is coming for Germany next.

The right-wing Alternative for Germany party, which runs on an anti-migrant platform, has already done well in regional elections this year, including in Merkel’s home district. The party’s leader, Frauke Petry, used this latest attack to illustrate the dangers of unregulated immigration, warning that Germany is “no longer safe.” She also said saying so ought to be the job of the chancellor.

Looking Away Can Be Deadly

One surprising thing about the first 24 hours after the Berlin attack was the relatively light media coverage, especially compared to when attacks like this were first starting to occur last year. Is this a new reality that Europe’s just willing to accept? Every few weeks or months a man or woman will kill randomly, sometimes on a small scale, sometimes on a large one, and we’ll just shake our heads and mumble “too bad?”

Are we done putting flag filters over our Facebook profile pictures as a symbol of solidarity, ineffectual as it might be? Or is it only in the United States that these attacks have lost their “excitement?” Are we just too distracted by Donald Trump’s latest cabinet appointment to bother ourselves with another act of terrorism across the pond?

But Europe doesn’t have the luxury of ignoring this. The problem can’t be kicked down the road. It’s lying at their feet and it isn’t going anywhere. Will they accept it as the new normal, or fight to change course?

Berlin is a reminder that the effects of the Islamic State and the refugee crisis stemming from the Syrian civil war will be felt in Europe for years to come. There are surely many more terrorist cells than we know about that infiltrated Europe disguising themselves as refugees. And then there’s the problem of European ISIS fighters who, once they are driven from Syria and Iraq, will come back home and start families and join mosques.

Both types will spread their fundamentalist version of Islam and all its attendant sanctioning of violence. Hopefully we won’t be too cynical or bored by then to care.",https://thefederalist.com/2016/12/21/since-berlins-terrorist-large-will-finally-start-believe-islamic-connection/,2016-12-21
The Trump Administration Should Treat Islamists Like The Mafia,"Thousands attend their rallies, claiming widespread discrimination. They wrap themselves in displays of “interfaith” cooperation. National, state, and local officials pay them heed. Words that “offend” them are removed from movies, newscasts, and even official government reports. All the while, the men who lead this organization have appeared extensively on FBI wiretaps and are known to federal law enforcement to be involved in a national criminal conspiracy.

You could be forgiven for thinking this describes the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) and its Muslim Brotherhood-linked leaders—a group the FBI, federal prosecutors and a federal judge have all affirmed supported the designated terrorist group, Hamas.

But no. The year is 1971, and the pressure group is the Italian American Civil Rights League (IACRL). Its founder, Joe Colombo, is known to federal law enforcement as the head of New York’s Colombo crime family, one of the infamous “Five Families” of the Cosa Nostra. Its most high-profile spokesman is his son, Anthony, who, for more than 30 years would deny the Mafia existed and rail against dark government conspiracies targeting Italian-Americans.

You Fight Crime, You Fight Italians?

It may seem like a punch line now but, in the 1970s, the effort by gangsters to don the mantle of activists and wrap themselves the flag of “civil rights” was taken semi-seriously. Many prominent Italian-American elites (prominenti in Italian) endorsed the call, throwing their influence behind the grievance-mongering. As scholar Joseph Sciorra of the Italian American Review describes,

A blurring occurred in which the mobbed-up League was conflated in the popular imagination with civic-minded spokespeople, thus diminishing the latter’s seemingly altruistic efforts (Kenna 2007, 193). But as historian Philip V. Cannistraro notes, “the prominenti’s constant preoccupation with the Mafia issue” (2005, 83), dating to the early 1930s when newspaper owner Generoso Pope launched an anti-defamation campaign against cinematic depictions of mafiosi, has historically been a self-serving agenda. ‘The dual focus of prominentismo has always been to promote the separate, self-aggrandizing interest of their own particular elite rather than the community as a whole, and to stress what Italian Americans are not’ (Cannistraro 2005, 84). It is no surprise, then, as Fred Gardaphé observes, that ‘more unified acts by Italian Americans have been launched against fictional portrayal of the mafia than ever were mounted against real mafiosi in the United States’ (2015, 365).

The obvious parallel is to the tens of thousands of Muslim-Americans CAIR enlists to bolster crowds condemning “Islamophobia” and any discussion of Islamic terrorism, but offer at best anemic support for pro forma denunciations of terrorism. As The Federalist’s Sean Davis has noted, the analogue between the Council on American Islamic Relations and the Italian American Civil Rights League is so close that, reading the latter’s public statements from the early 1970s and replacing “Italian” with “Muslim,” you’d be hard-pressed to spot the incongruence.

The way Sciorra described “the mobbed-up League” and its efforts could be an apt descriptor for CAIR, a group founded and run by ex-Islamic Association for Palestine staffers that has had more than one of its employees convicted of terror-related criminal activity. As Sciorra explained, while the crowd at the league’s rallies wore pins discussing their Italian pride, the leadership had more strategic concerns. They focused on attacking federal law enforcement and purposefully conflating all investigation of Mafia criminal activities with discrimination against the large Italian-American community.

The only way to end this perceived “discrimination,” the league insisted, was for the government and media to change its ways; not only must it stop using the word “Mafia,” it must deny that any such criminal conspiracy existed. And they did. The Department of Justice adhered to federal regulations, which prohibited use of the word. “There is nothing to be gained by using these terms,” U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell wrote, “except to give gratuitous offense” to “many good Americans of Italian-American descent.” The New York State Police had a similar rule. The word “Mafia” was deleted from the script of “The Godfather” at the behest of Colombo’s league.

Once, the Media Reported These Connections

Not everyone fell for it, including among the Italian-American community. New York state Sen. John Marchi warned that Italian-Americans had “been had” by their endorsement of Colombo’s Italian American Civil Rights League, only to be denounced as a “self-loathing Italian.” One wonders if Marchi didn’t feel then much the way Zhudi Jasser of American Islamic Forum for Democracy must feel now as he warns the American people about the machinations of Islamist groups, only to be denounced as an “Islamophobe” by known terror conspirators.

In the early 1970s, the media was a lot more skeptical of these obvious propaganda efforts, as well. At the end of a syndicated 1971 article about the League’s alliance with the Jewish Defense League, the Jewish Telegraph Agency slips in the following inconvenient information for context, complete with parentheses:

(Joseph Colombo, president of the League, faces a Federal hearing on April 21st on charges of conducting a gambling business. He has also just been convicted in the Manhattan State Court on a perjury charge and was recently arrested for allegedly receiving stolen goods from a robbery of the Long Island Jewelry Exchange in Mineola.)

The JTA obviously thought it was important to describe for its readers the provenance of the league’s complaint, as well as its unsavory record. Of course, one would wait in vain today for a mainstream media outlet to describe CAIR’s troublesome history with the same forthrightness.

In fact, despite U.S. District Court Judge Jorge Solis ruling that, “The government has produced ample evidence to establish the associations of CAIR [and other Islamist groups] with Hamas,” none of the nearly 700 articles the New York Times has run about the group has mentioned it. Even more egregiously, the Times covered CAIR’s 2007 efforts to break free of its designation as an unindicted coconspirator in the largest terror finance trial in American history, yet neglected to cover the 2009 rejection of the Islamist group’s appeal.

What It Takes to Fight International Leagues of Terror

The parallels between the League’s censorship efforts in the ‘70s and CAIR’s efforts today aren’t lost on Rudy Giuliani, and for good reason. In 1983, when he was U.S. attorney, Giuliani launched his successful prosecutions against the New York crime families. One of his first acts was to violate the prior decade’s DOJ regulations and say the forbidden word “Mafia.” In a piece for the Wall Street Journal last year, Giuliani made an apt comparison between the battle for accurate vocabulary in both the fight with the mob and with Islamic terrorists.

I had a different view of using the term Mafia. It reflected the truth. The Mafia existed, and denying what people oppressed by those criminals knew to be true only gave the Mafia more power. This hesitancy to identify the enemy accurately and honestly—“Mafia” was how members described themselves and kept its identity Italian or Italian-American—created the impression that the government was incapable of combating them because it was unable even to describe the enemy correctly.

As Giuliani argued, the similarities go beyond mere forbidden words and get at the heart of what it takes to prevail against both the Cosa Nostra and Islamic jihadists. In a recent piece for the Claremont Review of Books, we argued for a new law enforcement approach to dealing with Islamist movements, of which the Muslim Brotherhood is the most consequential, that draws explicitly on efforts to defeat the Mafia:

Instead of approaching Brotherhood members and organizations as respected community leaders for outreach purposes either at home or abroad, the primary goal should be to acquire the intelligence needed to disrupt terror finance or prevent indoctrination. If necessary, officials can use the possibility of prosecution under the Muslim Brotherhood designation to secure cooperation, which would be similar to the way informants are treated when approaching other conspirators, such as crime organizations.

Since Giuliani crippled the New York mob in the 1980s, Colombo’s League and its campaign to ban the word “Mafia” seems more like a quaint throwback to the 1970s than a threat to the integrity of organized crime investigations. Perhaps the Trump administration will be able to accomplish the same for groups like CAIR, when the inappropriate deference, and White House meetings, become a thing of the past.

Of course, some of the league’s bitter holdouts will always remain. Anthony Colombo continues to write on his mob boss father, insisting the FBI had him killed to halt his civic accomplishments. Even more colorfully, Father Louis Gigante—brother to famed Genovese Mafia Boss Vincent “the Chin” Gigante and a well-known Bronx community organizer—holds up mobsters as exemplars for civic minded Americans, in just the way Islamist groups sing the praises of convicted terror financiers.

For most Americans of all ethnic groups, though, government efforts to act against the Mafia are considered appropriate rather than discriminatory. No serious person insists that admitting Mafiosi were largely Italian-Americans is the same as saying all Italian-Americans are mobsters. The same can and must be done for Islamic terrorism.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/02/trump-administration-treat-islamists-like-mafia/,2017-01-02
Shut Down America’s Refugees Programs Before They Replicate Germany,"On the first day of the new year, Islamic terrorists claimed another 39 victims, including Americans, in an attack at a popular nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey. The Christmas truck attack in Berlin recalls the similar July attack in Nice, France. The suspect, Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri, was killed in a shootout with Italian police on December 23.

Amri had been denied asylum in Germany due to his terror risk, but was not deported because Tunisia would not accept him since he lacked a passport. Amri carried six different aliases from three nations and had been monitored by German authorities. He was not a “lone jihadist” but part of an ISIS cell, and traveled covertly, like some of the Paris killers, with the refugee flow from the Mediterranean.

On the same day as the Berlin attack, there was a knife attack at a Virginia Metro station by an African Muslim, Ali Ahmed Mohamound. A similar knife attack occurred in New York City the day before, with the suspect still at large.

All this followed on the heels of November’s Ohio State knife attack by Somali Muslim refugee Abdul Artan. These attacks typify the kinds recommended in ISIS literature, and ISIS claims credit for most of them. With Berlin, Brussels, Orlando, and so many other horrific attacks this year, San Bernardino and Paris almost seem like old news.

Although we view these events with horror and growing alarm, the outgoing Obama administration is literally importing terrorists through our nation’s refugee programs. Because private contractors are paid by the head to resettle refugees and other needy populations, the resettlement program has built-in incentives for uncontrolled growth. This harmonizes with the Left’s open borders agenda, which seeks to swell the rolls of new Democrat voters while weakening the influence of traditional (read conservative) America.

Big business shares this agenda in seeking cheap, subsidized labor. The resulting bipartisan alliance has long subsidized a resettlement industry that is expensive, secretive, duplicitous, and unconcerned about the Americans who pay for it with hard-earned tax dollars. The refugee resettlement program must be abolished in its current form before it puts us on the path toward today’s turbulent France and Germany.

The Real Risk of Increasing Terrorism

The most important risk the current refugee program creates is terrorism. Since 9/11 there have been 580 convictions for terrorism in the United States. At least 40 of these were refugees. Just this year, in addition to the knife attacks by Abdul Artan and Ali Mohamound, four other refugees have committed or attempted to commit acts of terrorism.

Since March 2014 there have been 111 ISIS-related arrests and 60 convictions. There have been nine indictments and six convictions of ISIS supporters in the metropolitan DC area alone. ISIS openly encourages “lone jihadi” attacks, and the State Department now admits ISIS is trying to penetrate the U.S. refugee flow. Some 250 U.S. Muslims from 19 states have either joined or attempted to join ISIS overseas. Many have since returned with little or no oversight.

Let’s be clear: these are not Mennonite terrorists. They are not Episcopalian suicide bombers. Virtually all 580 convictions since 9/11 were Muslim immigrants or American Muslim converts, and the Somali community consistently supplies such malefactors. Yet the Department of Homeland Security has provided tours of airport facilities to groups of Somalis, including explanations of airport inner workings, security protocols, and databases. DHS redacted some of this information as too sensitive to share with the public.

The Refugee Program Is Home to Major Fraud

Virginia knife attacker Ali Mohamound was carrying multiple identities when arrested. The Ohio State terrorist and his family lived in Pakistan for seven years before being resettled to the United States. Why were they not simply resettled in Pakistan? Afghani refugee Ahmad Rahami, the terrorist bomber of New York and New Jersey, originally entered the United States through the asylum program, but then traveled back to Afghanistan, where he apparently became radicalized. How can someone who is supposedly fleeing his home country for his life go back for a visit?

Virtually all U.S. Somalis originally arrived as refugees or asylum seekers or are their children. Many now take months-long trips back to Somalia, contradicting their purported reason for seeking asylum: fleeing Somalia for their lives. Minneapolis actually grants rent relief because Somalis complained about the cost of overdue rent upon their return. The home country visits so many “refugees” make undercut the program’s integrity.

The entire refugee resettlement program has systematic fraud, creating both national security risks and undue fiscal burdens. Refugee advocates claim the vetting process for Syrians is airtight, but U.S. security officials say exactly the opposite. An internal Immigrations, Customs, and Enforcement memo states, “[The] refugee program is particularly vulnerable to fraud due to loose evidentiary requirements where at times the testimony of an applicant alone is sufficient for approval.” The memo goes on to say that “the immigration system is a constant target for exploitation” by terrorists. An Immigration and Naturalization Services assistant commissioner said 95 percent of refugee and asylee applications are fraudulent.

The Obama administration has knowingly and routinely allowed illegal aliens falsely claiming asylum to remain in the United States. A September 2016 DHS Inspector General report found that 1,982 aliens from countries known for immigration fraud or terror-links who were scheduled for deportation were instead granted citizenship using false identities because fingerprint records were missing.

The United Nations selects almost all refugees, and the United States takes more refugees than all other resettlement nations combined. Yet many of the tens of thousands of unvettable Syrians who are accepted don’t meet the refugee definition.

Syrian Christians are facing genocide, and certainly do meet the definition, but represent less than 1 percent of those Syrians resettled so far. Syrian Muslims are more than 98 percent of the total. In the interest of diplomacy we are also resettling populations other countries refuse to take. Most recently, the Obama administration offered to accept 2,465 asylum seekers now being detained by Australia which that country refuses to accept because of their possible ties to terrorism. In response to congressional inquiries, the administration has declared information about this agreement classified.

Heavy Costs for Taxpayers Besides Terrorism Risks

Refugee resettlement is administered by three agencies: the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM), the Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), and the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). It has grown and metastasized over the years.

In fiscal year 2016, the program cost $2.4 billion, an increase of 205.4 percent since FY 2009. At the last minute Obama boosted ORR’s request to $3.9 billion for FY 2017 to handle the unprecedented flow of minors now being apprehended at the Southwest border. That’s 14,128 in the past two months alone and a 106 percent increase for the year.

Congress provided a pro-rata share of $500 million of this request in the short-term continuing resolution passed on December 9. It cannot be expended until the new Health and Human Services secretary has been installed. He can withhold some or all of those funds, if he chooses.

The table above shows the numbers resettled by category, a total of 195,231 individuals in FY 2015. This represents 20 percent of all immigrants allowed into the United States annually. The numbers will be significantly higher this year if nothing is done.

Since FY 2009, approximately 1 million migrants have arrived through these programs. Program costs average about $10,000 per head in the first year, and refugee welfare use is off the charts, even after five years (see table below). In fact, refugees resettled in the 1980s still receive welfare at rates well in excess of Americans and other immigrants.

The Center for Immigration Studies has estimated the annual cost of resettling Muslim refugees during the first five years at $12,874 per head. Muslim refugees use welfare at higher rates than average. I have estimated a somewhat lower average of $11,574 per head for the entire group. Cumulatively for the years 2009 through 2015, this cohort alone has cost U.S. taxpayers a staggering $48 billion. Since 1980, 3 million have been resettled.

Migrants Create a Heavy Toll on Communities

State and local costs are significant. When the Refugee Act was first passed, the federal government promised to cover 36 months of states’ share of food stamps, Medicaid, Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA), and Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) for refugees—a huge subsidy. Today it covers no state costs. Refugees rely heavily on local assistance, and school budgets, costs for translation, and other services have exploded. Following is a sampling of problems in many U.S. communities:

Major Conflicts of Interest Among Refugee Resettlers

Nine private contractors, called “Voluntary Agencies” or VOLAGs, resettle refugees with the assistance of 320 “affiliates.” VOLAGs are supposed to consult communities before resettling refugees, but almost never do. They secretly resettle refugees and leave communities to deal with the resulting problems. They regularly withhold information from community leaders and concerned citizens and ignore local complaints.

Refugee resettlement has big effects for small communities throughout the United States, which is a major reason for growing resistance to the program. In one example, a federal agent contacted me in November to describe numerous problems in northern Michigan. He said citizens and public officials from Traverse City and elsewhere expressed concerns over the indiscriminate “dumping” of refugees and illegal aliens in small towns, including the Upper Peninsula, under cover of darkness, without any prior coordination with appropriate public officials (i.e. mayors, town councils, etc.).

Refugees are often employed in the resettlement industry, giving refugees a stake its growth. Many VOLAG leaders who receive federal resettlement grants are former directors of the agencies that administer those grants, and vice versa. Like a revolving door, they cycle in and out of government. For example, Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration Assistant Secretary Ann Richard is a former vice president for one of the nine VOLAGs. She helped found the International Crisis Group, a leftist organization funded by George Soros.

VOLAGs receive a total of about $1 billion per year from taxpayers and are paid by the head, receiving anywhere from $2,025 to more than $5,000 per refugee. The Government Accountability Office has noted that this creates a strong incentive for VOLAGs to constantly resettle more refugees, regardless of whether it is in the interest of the refugee or the target community.

David M. Robinson, who would later lead PRM, said of the refugee industry: “The solution its members offer to every refugee crisis is simplistic and the same: increase the number of admissions to the United States without regard to budgets or competing foreign policy considerations. On the other hand, it is politically well connected, includes major party donors at the local and national levels, and owns the moral high ground on an extremely emotional issue.”

VOLAGs have not faced any kind of meaningful oversight since the program was established in 1980. None have ever faced a public financial audit despite many calls to do so. The program is biased toward continual growth, and security concerns must be addressed.

Prioritizing Refugees Above American Citizens

The Refugee Act of 1980 dictates benefits that refugees must receive. They go to the front of the line for welfare and public housing, jumping ahead of all Americans, including veterans and the disabled. VOLAGs provide:

Housing

Essential furnishings

Food, food allowance

Seasonal clothing

Pocket money

Assistance in applying for public benefits, Social Security cards, language translation, employment services, non-employment services, Medicaid

Assistance with health screenings and medical care

Assistance with registering children in school

Transportation to job interviews and job training

Home visits

Additionally, ORR and other agencies provide numerous special grants available only to refugees. This is supposedly to enable refugees to rapidly become economically self-sufficient. However, ORR’s definition of “economic self-sufficiency” allows refugees to continue to receive every kind of welfare except cash assistance from food stamps or RCA. Refugees thus have a strong incentive to seek U.S. resettlement to obtain benefits.

Maine Gov. Paul LePage told me that elderly autistic residents of Portland, Maine are swelling the rolls of the homeless as their primary caretakers, usually their parents, die, or become unable to care for them, because public housing is taken by refugees.

What Americans and Our Leaders Should Do

The resettlement program is dangerous, expensive, and unfair to Americans. Its structure encourages endless growth, systemic corruption, cronyism, secrecy, and duplicity. The refugee program must be put on hold. Members of Congress have called for a moratorium, and such legislation is circulating. H.R. 3314, the Resettlement Accountability National Security Act, has 86 co-sponsors.

On his first day in office, Trump can pause the entire program by simply resetting the annual refugee targets.

But legislation isn’t needed. On his first day in office, Trump can pause the entire program by simply resetting the annual refugee targets to whatever number has already been reached this fiscal year. The 1980 Refugee Act gives him authority to do this, and subsequent court decisions have declared Congress’s refugee resettlement oversight authority as advisory only.

Trump has stated his desire to halt resettlement from nations of terrorism concern. It would be wiser to pause the entire program.

It costs 12 times as much to resettle refugees as to assist them in place. Almost all refugeeswould prefer to return home than be resettled to a third country. President-Elect Trump’s idea to create “safe zones” in or near countries of conflict is a much more compassionate and cost-effective method of dealing with the refugee crisis. Trump’s State Department should encourage the Gulf States to participate in resettlement, since they currently offer little help.

The VOLAG system needs to be abolished. Asylum and other alternative forms of resettlement should operate case-by-case. Resettlement should be returned to the private act of charity it was before 1980. That structure would be naturally self-limiting, and those financing resettlement would have a much stronger incentive to see that their charitable dollars were not wasted on frauds or potential terrorists. Refugees should be required to become truly economically self-sufficient.

With such restrictions, other nations would have to confront and resolve conflicts they now offload onto America. The U.S. government role should be limited to security: helping create safe zones, identifying other countries that might help more, designating those populations suitable for resettlement, setting numerical limits, and vetting all refugees, asylum seekers, and others seeking U.S. entry. With new leadership, policies and management, Trump’s administration can reinvent the resettlement program to serve America’s interests again.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/04/shut-americas-refugee-programs-turn-us-germany/,2017-01-04
How Political Correctness About Islam Made Britain Vulnerable To Chemical Terrorism,"In an interview with The Sunday Times, Britain’s minister for national security, Ben Wallace, had an ominous warning for Britons. Echoing a Europol report that came out last month, Wallace told The Times that ISIS is plotting to deploy chemical weapons on the island nation.

Although no specific plots are underway, the threat is serious enough that British security forces have carried out exercises to prepare for such a disaster, including chemical decontamination drills. So, how does Wallace suggest foiling such plots? A vigilant populace.

Unfortunately for Britain, their oversized sense of political correctness and so-called religious sensitivity toward Islam make vigilance virtually impossible. Recall that ISIS has used mustard gas in the past, both on civilians and on Kurdish soldiers fighting the Islamist group in Syria. The Islamic State is now producing its own chemical weapons, specifically mustard gas, but the group is also thought to have access to Syrian chemical weapons that were never disposed of in the disarmament deal in 2014. Now the fear is that this know-how will be used to inflict mass casualties in the United Kingdom.

The Terrorist Threat Britain Imported

Wallace is concerned, as he should be, that the attack will come from within, from British citizens, not foreign agents. “The insider threat, as we would call it, is real and it can be exploited and there are people trying to do that as we speak. If it’s hard to get in the front door, then what you try and do is get someone on the inside.”

Around 800 Britons have gone to fight with ISIS over the past three years. In November, it was revealed that British special forces were trying to track down 200 of these fighters who had gone off-grid, possibly returning to the United Kingdom to launch attacks there. As ISIS loses territory as a result of allied offensives in Mosul and Raqqa, there is increasing concern about foreign fighters coming home and either plotting attacks or radicalizing others.

There are also several hundred men and women in Britain who were prevented from going to Iraq and Syria, and many more who hold sympathetic views toward ISIS, making the possibility of a chemical weapons, or other mass-casualty attacks, from the inside a real possibility.

In response to this impending threat, Wallace wants the British people to help by reporting anything that seems suspicious. He needs people on the street and in their jobs to keep their eyes open for the “enemy within.” But unfortunately for Wallace, and for the UK’s security, there’s not much hope of this ever happening.

PC-Mongers Make Way for Mass Rape

Wallace’s call for public vigilance is both ironic and impossible given a pervasive culture in Britain that demands absolute tolerance for all things Muslim. It has been ingrained in the British people that any criticism of a person who happens also to be Muslim is an act of intolerance and aggression against the Islamic faith. So, to avoid being labeled an Islamaphobe, people just keep their mouths shut.

This fear of being seen as Islamaphobic was most disgustingly on display in the Rotherham child sex ring scandal. The case involved the sexual exploitation of more than 1,400 young British girls over the course of 16 years. Even though the ongoing sex-trafficking, rape, abduction, and abuse of minors was well-known to city officials and police, they did nothing. Why? Because the perpetrators were Pakistani and no one wanted to be accused of racism.

The Rotherham story originally broke in 2013, much to the horror and outcry of people around the world. But this past summer, three years later, it was revealed that little had been done to eradicate the sex-ring and that it was still happening on an “industrial scale.” It seems fear of accusations of Islamaphobia may still be the reason.

Rotherham isn’t the only example of political correctness at the cost of human suffering. At the end of December, a British woman came out with her own story of being held prisoner for 13 years by a Pakistani man named Malik, beginning at the age of 15. She was raped almost nightly, by him or other men who paid to have sex with her. During this time, she had four children, all of whom were taken from her and sold.

After particularly brutal beatings, Malik would take her to the hospital, and dress her in Muslim clothing, including a hijab, beforehand. She believes that because she was dressed as a Muslim, no health-care workers would report her obvious signs of physical abuse or ask to speak to her alone. According to her, they didn’t want to appear prejudiced against Muslims by assuming that the woman’s bruises were from her husband.

Perhaps most relevant to Wallace’s call for public action was the case of the British counterterrorism agent, herself a Muslim, who reported the extremist views of some of her fellow Muslim co-workers. Thinking this would interest her superiors, she was surprised when they told her that pursuing these complaints would damage her career and reputation. So much for “if you see something, say something.”

Multiculturalism Means Death

How can anyone expect a populace this worried about cultural sensitivity to call authorities if they see a Muslim man or woman doing something suspicious in the workplace or on a public transit line? The tragedy in this, of course, is that it’s a problem of Britain’s own making.

Britain, like most of Europe, has nourished ultra-sensitivity toward its Muslim population as an outgrowth of multiculturalism, one of the pillars of progressivism. This has worked in in perfect harmony with Islamist groups that understand that if they can stop all criticism of Muslims, both legitimate and illegitimate, they can avoid scrutiny when engaging in subversive acts.

Europe is ahead of the United States in this respect, but we are moving in the same direction. Every time a terrorist attack here is perpetrated by a Muslim, there is an outcry from both the mainstream media and Islamist groups like the Council on American-Islamic Relations, that insists talking about the attacker’s religion will lead to Islamaphobic attacks. To convince us further of what bad Islamaphobes we are, there have been numerous incidences of faked hate crimes against Muslims in recent months.

Of course, there are legitimate cases of Islamaphobia and hate crimes in America, and these are disgusting and unacceptable. But we are cultivating an atmosphere where, like Britain, people are afraid that anything they say or do regarding a Muslim will be interpreted as racist.

Consider the couple Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, who shot and killed 14 coworkers at a Christmas party in San Bernardino in 2015. After the attack, a neighbor of Malik’s mother said she thought something suspicious was happening at the house but didn’t say anything because of fear that people would think she was a bigot.

The threat of Islamist terrorism isn’t going away anytime soon. And we’ve created the perfect storm by going beyond polite and reasonable cultural sensitivity toward our Muslim compatriots by carving out a special class that we’re terrified to criticize. This is going to have security repercussions in Britain, the rest of Europe, and here in the United States. In fact, it already has.

With apologies to Wallace, British law enforcement and intelligence agencies shouldn’t expect ordinary Britons to be vigilant about terrorism. They’ve gotten the message loud and clear: if you suspect a Muslim of wrongdoing, you must be a bigot.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/10/political-correctness-islam-made-britain-vulnerable-chemical-terrorism/,2017-01-10
Domenech: Oscar Lopez Rivera Is Nothing More Than A Terrorist,"Wednesday on Fox News’s “First 100 Days,” The Federalist publisher Ben Domenech decried President Obama’s decision to commute terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera’s prison sentence.

Domenech was joined by talk radio host Richard Fowler, who compared Rivera to founding fathers John Adams and Benjamin Franklin.

“Oscar Lopez Rivera is nothing more than a terrorist, but worse, he is an unrepentant terrorist,” Domenech said. “…It is unconscionable that President Obama should exit enabling someone who is an unrepentant terrorist, who has never apologized for his actions to the victims he enabled to help kill.”

“What was the Boston Tea Party?” Fowler asked, intimating that Rivera’s actions were like those of the American Founding Fathers.

“You compare the heroes of the Boston Tea Party to Oscar Lopez Rivera, a socialist who was working on behalf of a communist plot to try to spread socialism throughout the Caribbean?” Domenech responded. “…The fact is that John Adams and Benjamin Franklin have nothing in common with Oscar Lopez Rivera.”

“They are revolutionary fighters,” Fowler said. “People would argue that Castro was a revolutionary fighter, Nelson Mandela was a revolutionary fighter.

“Oscar Lopez Rivera has nothing in common with Nelson Mandela,” Domenech said. “He is only free because of his celebrity friends who have the president’s ear. . . That is an insult to the memory of Nelson Mandela.”",https://thefederalist.com/2017/01/19/domenech-oscar-lopez-rivera-is-nothing-more-than-a-terrorist/,2017-01-19
Obama’s Pardon For Oscar Lopez Rivera Trades A Terrorist For Votes,"In 1999, a year before Hillary Clinton was elected to the Senate from New York and a decade and a half before emails helped destroy her presidential ambitions, an adviser to her husband’s administration sent an email about proposed pardons of imprisoned Puerto Rican terrorists.

The pardons would be “fairly easy to accomplish and will have a positive impact among strategic communities in the U.S. (read, voters),” wrote Mayra Martinez-Fernandez, an adviser to the White House Working Group for Puerto Rico, according Debra Burlingame in The Wall Street Journal. Get that? Voters. Clinton, to be sure, issued the pardons.

Communists celebrated the pardons then, just as they did yesterday from Canada to Colombia to Cuba when President Obama commuted yet another convicted Puerto Rican terrorist’s sentence. But Martinez-Fernandez’s email still holds the clue. The president’s action carries the same unavoidable whiff of playing identity politics with a key voting bloc of the Democratic Party. In fact, you have to go back to Lyndon Johnson to find the last Democratic president who, in his waning days in office, didn’t spring from prison a Puerto Rican convicted of terrorist acts.

The beneficiary of Obama’s commutation this time is Oscar Lopez Rivera. He’s no angel, but he’s being lionized as one—and not just by too many Puerto Ricans, but also by celebrities.

Terrorists Are So Awesome, You Guys

Typical is Lin-Manuel Miranda of “Hamilton” fame, who tweeted from London Tuesday that he was “sobbing with gratitude” after hearing the news. He promised he would reprise his signature role in a performance of the musical to be attended in Chicago by Lopez.

Also characteristic of Lopez hagiography is this article in the Daily Beast, which called Lopez “a political prisoner” and referred to his “anti-colonialist mission.” For the record, Puerto Rico has held no fewer than four referendums on its status. In the last one in 2012, more than 61 percent voted to ask to become a state, and less than 5.5 percent voted for independence.

Obama’s one-time friend Bill Ayers, himself a terrorist in the 1970s, tweeted out a celebratory “Oscar Lopez freed!” In the same tweet he asked for a posthumous pardon for executed Soviet spy Ethel Rosenberg.

Miranda, at least, ought to know better. His support for Lopez sadly puts into stark relief the “Hamilton” cast’s dress-down of Vice President-elect Mike Pence and his daughters and niece when they attended “Hamilton” in December. Actor Brandon Victor-Dixon pompously lectured to Pence: “We, sir — we — are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights.”

Real alarm and anxiety is what Lopez’s group, the Armed Forces of National Liberation, or FALN, sowed through its nine-year campaign of terror through the United States. In one bomb attack in the busy Fraunces Tavern, in New York’s financial district in January 1975, it killed four people and injured 60, many maimed.

Votes Matter More than Justice

What was the FALN’s reason for creating all that suffering? It wanted to establish in Puerto Rico a Marxist republic, against, as we have seen through the referendums, the stated desire of the overwhelming majority of Puerto Ricans. Lopez, a community organizer in Chicago decades before our 44th president plied that trade in the same city, joined the FALN in 1974. He was a fugitive for five years before his arrest in 1981. Police discovered six pounds of dynamite in his Chicago apartment.

The editor of The Federalist, Ben Domenech, himself the scion of a well-known Puerto Rican political family, wrote Tuesday in The Transom that Lopez “recruited and trained a small army of terrorists to murder his fellow Americans. He built bomb factories. He taught the young and impressionable how to make devices that would kill and maim … When he was put on trial, he admitted to doing all he had been accused of – he showed no remorse.”

So why would Obama, with one foot out the door, pause to free this guy? We begin to get an inkling in Miranda’s gushing tweet, “Thank you, @POTUS.” Obama is but the third Democratic president to pardon Puerto Rican terrorists with the clock ticking.

In 1979, Jimmy Carter released from prison three Puerto Rican terrorists who shot at members of Congress from the House gallery in 1954, wounding five. In 1999 Bill Clinton pardoned 12 members of the FALN. In the words of The New York Times, they were serving long sentences for “sedition, possession of unregistered firearms, interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, interference with interstate commerce by violence and interstate transportation of firearms with intent to commit a crime.”

Lopez was actually offered a pardon, too, but he refused it after President Clinton “demanded as one of the conditions of their release that the jailed Puerto Ricans renounce the use of terrorism to achieve their aim of independence for the Caribbean commonwealth.”

The news is that Lopez will go back to community organizing. But after almost four decades of playing politics with national security, this is one Democratic Party tradition America can do without.

Here Are Foreign-Born Terrorists Reporters Can’t Believe Exist,"When arguing with the Left about matters of national security and terrorism, one becomes accustomed to their habitual moving of goal posts and artificial construction of sample sizes that deliberately exclude relevant cases.

The most notorious example, of course, is the beloved “since 9/11…” canard, such as the oft-repeated although false claim that since 9/11 right-wing terrorists have killed more Americans than Islamic terrorists.

The recent executive order by the Trump administration on immigration led to an urgent desire to proclaim that there is no terrorism threat from immigrants. The most egregious example: A tweet from The New York Times’ White House correspondent Maggie Haberman, who is also a CNN analyst. She posed the question, “Other than San Bernardino shootings, has there been a terrorist attack involving a non-US-born attacker since 9/11?”

Of course, there is no sensible reason for excluding San Bernardino shooter Tasheen Malik, who was born in Pakistan, from a list of terror attacks. The attack killed 14 and took place only last year.

But even within the confines of such a ludicrously constructed sample, the question surprised more up-to-speed denizens of Twitter, who quickly bombarded Haberman with lists of successful and unsuccessful attacks carried out by non-U.S.-born individuals, including some of the most notorious recent terror attacks.

Yes, Foreign-Born Immigrants Have Committed Terrorism

Among such individuals: the Tsarnaev brothers of the Boston Marathon bombing, who were both born abroad. Tamerlan was born in Kyrgyzstan in 1986, and Dzhokhar was reportedly born in Dagestan.

The 2015 Chattanooga Recruiting Center shooter, Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, was born in Kuwait and lived in Jordan before migrating to the United States at the age of six. He killed five people.

Ohio State University attacker Abdul Razak Artan, who ran over several fellow students with a car before attacking them with a butcher knife, was a refugee born in Somalia who had only been in the United States for two years.

Ahmad Khan Rahimi, born in Afghanistan, detonated a bomb near a 5K run event, then another in downtown Manhattan in October of last year.

Dahir Adan, a Somali born in Kenya who immigrated to the United States as a child, launched a mass stabbing attack at a St. Cloud Minnesota mall in 2016. And these are only a few recent examples.

Let’s Just Define Away Counterexamples

While it might be amusing to imagine that a mainstream media figure of some note is totally oblivious to any of the details of recent terror attacks, it’s almost beside the point. Had Haberman known better, perhaps she’d have simply constructed a question that did meet what appears to be her preformed opinion that foreign-born individuals are nearly incapable of representing a threat.

That was the position CNN took in its piece on the Trump administration’s executive order. The piece moved the goal posts yet again, insisting that no refugee had carried out a fatal terror attack in the United States. That’s surely cold comfort to the families of those killed by Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, two Iraqi refugees settled in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

After their fingerprints were discovered on Iraqi IEDs, the two Iraqi refugees were caught in an FBI counterterrorism investigation, where Alwan bragged about using a sniper rifle to kill American troops abroad. The two plotted to kill returning U.S. troops as well. An IED constructed by Alwan is believed to have killed four Pennsylvania National Guardsmen in 2005.

That case resulted in a six-month freeze on Iraqi refugee resettlement in 2011 as U.S. authorities attempted to clamp down on serious screening problems. But, according to CNN’s twisted logic, these Iraqi refugees were never a threat. Ironically, the more attacks American law enforcement successfully prevent or mitigate, the less of a threat there is, according to the CNN model.

If one were truly interested in whether there is a terror threat from individuals born abroad, one would examine the totality of activity, not a narrowly constructed definition aimed to minimize it. That’s what senators Ted Cruz and Jeff Sessions did last June when they examined 580 individuals successfully prosecuted on terrorism offenses from September 2001 until 2014. According to the senators, 380 were foreign-born and at least 40 were refugees. While not all of those cases involved successful or attempted terror attacks, all involved cases that were terrorism-related.

Haberman’s offhand tweet is a snapshot of the willingness of the mainstream media to engage in reflective self-censoring, a kind of doublethink, where reporters seem to remain proudly unaware of key evidence that would contradict their pre-established conclusions. Unfortunately for The New York Times correspondent, not everyone on social media was inclined to play along.

Here’s What Trump’s Immigration Order Says And How It Needs To Be Fixed,"There are many strong feelings on many sides about President Trump’s executive order that adjusts U.S. policy towards refugees and visa processing from select countries. Sadly, very little of this commentary is informed by facts about either the EO itself, or about crisis migration policy in the United States generally.

Because of the administration’s excessive haste to act and media personalities’ haste to judge, reasonable discussion of American crisis migration policy has been all but snuffed out. Understanding U.S. policy towards crisis migrants is hard.

If you want sound-bites and one-liners, this article won’t be of much use to you, because it’s an effort to take a serious look and figure out what’s really going on in this EO. If you actually want to understand U.S. immigration policy, you’ve got to use some critical thinking, a practice all-too-rare when “the narrative” needs to be advanced on TV.

So, if you have the patience to understand what the EO actually means and the effects it may have, read on. I will go through all the major provisions of the EO one by one. We’ll skip the fluff in the first two sections, and start with the meaty bit, Section 3.

Section 3: The Visa Ban

The media has focused on the blanket ban on all visas for all people (except diplomats) with citizenship from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen. This means no tourists, no students, no immigrants, no refugees, no nothing. The EO does include permission for Customs to give “case-by-case” exceptions, but there do not appear to have been many exceptions yet (I could find only one documented case), and no guidance was given to Customs about what rules to use for making such exceptions.

The ban is not permanent, lasting only 90 days, but, as with the refugee ban, can be renewed or extended. Indeed, Section 3(e) of the EO actually orders the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to come up with a list of countries for a more permanent ban. So this EO is teeing up for a more permanent ban in the future.

Some critics have claimed this EO is a “Muslim ban.” That’s debatable. The countries selected were based on a list provided by the Obama administration, and the Obama administration had already imposed stricter visa screening requirements on those countries.

However, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has claimed that President Trump did explicitly say he wanted to ban Muslims. Yet most Muslims will be unaffected. The vast majority of Muslims and Muslim countries are in Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, or Central Asia. Within the Middle East, large countries like Egypt, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia were not restricted.

Some EO supporters have claimed the seven banned nations were selected due to a unique terrorist threat. This is not quite true. The Obama administration did identify them as places of concern, and most do have active sectarian conflicts and terrorist activity, but, the truth is, they have no common thread. Many unstable or violent places were not included (Chad, Central African Republic, Mali, Egypt, Ukraine, Nigeria, etc). Several of these even involve similar large-scale jihadist insurgencies similar to those observed in the banned countries. Iran, meanwhile, has no violent insurgency at all.

Furthermore, not a single American has died as a result of terrorist attacks committed by any citizen of the seven banned countries in this millennium.* Of course, this doesn’t mean, in the absence of a ban, no attack would occur in the future, but these countries have not posed a unique risk in the past. Additionally, countries whose citizens have perpetrated attacks, like Pakistan or Saudi Arabia, were not banned.

EO critics have claimed these countries were selected to avoid Trump’s properties, implicitly rewarding countries for doing business with the Trump Organization. This view is likewise hard to support with facts. Many countries with no presence of the Trump organization but with violent insurgencies were not banned, like Chad or South Sudan. Many Muslim countries with no Trump properties were not banned, like Afghanistan or Oman.

The truth is, there is no single rational factor that correlates with the seven banned countries. They do not share close religious similarities (Iran, Yemen, and Iraq have large Shi’a populations; Syria is largely Alawi and Sunni; Libya and Somalia are heavily Sunni). They do not all have insurgencies. Their governments are not all enemies of the United States; some, like Iraq, are even our close wartime allies!

Section 3(g): Rules for Exceptions

Aside from arbitrary countries, the EO was poorly administered. It became effective almost immediately upon issuance, giving Customs no time to develop rules and practices or train personnel. It impacted even people who boarded planes before the president declared it.

Plus, it was unclear who should be banned. What if a person served as a U.S. military translator in Iraq? Is he or she banned? Thus far, the answer is yes. What if they have dual citizenship between the United Kingdom and Syria? Banned too! What about foreigners who are lawful permanent residents of the United States? They were initially banned as well, but DHS has since announced they will be allowed in. It is unclear if the White House supports this change.

It is reasonable for the administration to restrict admission of people from countries of unique concern. The president has the power to do this. Both President Bush and President Obama used this power in moments of crisis to ensure national security. But that power must be exercised wisely: government agencies need clear guidance, not “case-by-case” exceptions with no rules about who gets in and who doesn’t. They need time to prepare implementation, and we need a consistent policy, not one that waffles every few hours as the protests and judicial orders ebb and flow.

Section 4: Vetting

Much has been made of the need for more vetting, and I agree with that need. However, few commentators have taken the time to review the proposed vetting changes. The central change proposed is the creation of a national identity database for immigrants that tracks documents, helps identify document fraud or forgeries, and that allows diverse federal agencies to collaborate.

Such an individual level identity-verification database would indeed be highly useful, and is certainly legal. It might not find many terrorists, but it probably will find lots of visa fraud, which is a serious problem worth fixing. However, some immigrants do go on to become citizens. Large national databases of personal information about citizens should raise red flags for conservatives. Thus we will need rules about how this database is to be used and developed.

Section 5: Large Changes to U.S. Refugee Policy

The executive order makes many major changes to refugee policy. Section A halts all new refugee arrivals for 120 days, pending implementation of improved vetting procedures. Section B orders the State Department to prioritize religious minorities when refugee admissions begin again. Section C indefinitely excludes all Syrian refugees, even after the 120-day pause ends. Section D reduces the total, maximum refugee arrivals from 110,000 to 50,00. For reference, the typical cap has between 60,000 and 80,000, but President Obama raised it to 110,000. Section E creates another “case-by-case” exemption, that State and DHS may admit unique individuals, or those already in transit to the United States. This is a lot to unpack, but I’ll try to do it quickly.

What Is a Refugee?

But before we can discuss this order, we should make sure we know what a refugee is.

I have extensively discussed that here in the past. Currently, European states are inundated with crisis migrants from Africa and the Middle East who have arrived by foot, car, boat, and plane, demanding the recognition of rights assigned to them by international treaties to which all developed nations are party.

These un-vetted crisis migrants arrive without warning, in disorganized fashion, and claim a right called “asylum,” or “asylee status.” To put it bluntly, asylum is a kind of illegal immigration with special human rights claims.

Asylum-seekers housed outside of refugee camps in large numbers can overwhelm administrative bureaucracies and may prove nearly impossible for security services to police.

The United States traditionally does not accept a large number of asylees. Indeed, the most we ever accepted was 39,000 in 2001, while refugee admissions have usually been around 60,000 to 100,000 per year, except right after 9/11.

There’s a reason the U.S. has always preferred refugee resettlement over asylum-seekers: as Europe is discovering, asylum-seekers housed outside of refugee camps in large numbers can overwhelm administrative bureaucracies and may prove nearly impossible for security services to police. Europe’s problems with millions of asylees are serious, difficult to solve, and, thankfully, are distinctly European problems. The United States does not face even remotely similar challenges with crisis migrants.

“Refugees” such as those the EO discusses are crisis migrants who flee to a designated UN-monitored refugee camp. They remain in that camp or its environs, and do not proceed to a third country and seek long-term residence. They receive UN-provided aid, and generally must prove they are innocent people disrupted by war rather than combatants.

After a refugee has been in a camp, registered with the United Nations, and proved basic identity, they can try to prove that returning home is impossible, and express a desire to be permanently resettled abroad.

Most crisis-migrant-associated attacks have been carried out by asylees, not resettled refugees.

To be clear, asylees do not forswear their former homes: refugees essentially do. They are announcing to friends and family alike that their old life is done, a new one must begin. After clearing a round of UN-vetting, they are “submitted” for resettlement. Partner countries, mostly the United States, can then receive them for resettlement, after further rounds of vetting. This process can take anywhere from 6 months to 10 years, with one to three years being fairly normal.

The vetting process is thorough, but imperfect. While rates of crime and terrorism are lower for refugees than for asylees, and lower than rates for native-born U.S. citizens, they are not strictly zero if we include the second generation. However, the most successful crisis-migrant-associated terrorist attacks in the United States, like the Boston bombing, were carried out by individuals who arrived via asylum, or whose parents arrived that way, not, apparently, true refugee status.

The same rule holds for European terrorism: most crisis-migrant-associated attacks have been carried out by asylees, not resettled refugees! This is not surprising given that refugees are extensively vetted, while asylees are not. Again, the European experience is unlike the issue we face in the United States.

Section 5(a) and 5(d): How Cap-and-Pause Works

Now that we know what a refugee is, we can explore the changes made. Let’s start with the cap-and-pause issue. Administrative barriers, lack of suitable applicants, or policy factors mean that the United States usually undershoots its refugee cap. As a result, a 50,000 refugee cap means there will be fewer than 50,000 refugees admitted; 50,000 is the maximum legal amount, not an actual target. Regarding the 120-day halt to admissions that applies to all refugees, it is unclear why the Trump administration chose to block all countries, instead of just those from the specified visa-ban countries.

Additionally, that’s 50,000 admissions for Fiscal Year 2017, which ends in September 2017. From October to January 2017, 32,000 refugees have already been admitted in FY2017. All interviews and admissions are paused until late May. It is unlikely the State Department can vet 18,000 refugees and get them moved between late May and late September, especially if the new vetting process is made more intensive.

As such, this cap-and-pause strategy is a subtle way of ensuring that probably substantially less than 50,000 refugees will be resettled in FY 2017. This is especially likely if the 120-day pause is extended. For reference, the only time the United States has had such low refugee admissions is the period immediately after 9/11.

Section5(b): The Religious Minority Preference

President Trump has stated that the goal of prioritizing persecuted minorities is to implicitly prioritize Christians facing persecution in the Middle East. However, while that may be the intention, that is not what the text says. It says minority religions experiencing persecution shall be prioritized; Christianity is not mentioned.

Legal or not, this prioritization will fail in its stated goal of protecting vulnerable minorities.

This matters, because U.S. and international law already establishes religious persecution as a valid consideration in granting refugee status. Persecutors are to be denied refugee status, while their victims are categorically eligible. The president’s order to prioritize minority religions is not out of line with, say, President Obama prioritizing refugees from Syria.

Many presidents have opted to prioritize certain specific concerns at specific times. Admitting only Christians could create legal problems, but if the rule includes Muslims when they are a minority, as in Burma, or Yazidis in Iraq, then it is likely compliant with existing law. Legal or not, however, this prioritization will fail in its stated goal of protecting vulnerable minorities.

Most refugees do not come from Syria, Iraq, or the other countries the Trump administration has specified. In 2016, 43,000 refugees were admitted from the seven Muslim-majority countries for which additional visa restrictions were announced. Fifty-four thousand came from other countries. In other words, the majority of refugees being denied entry aren’t even from high-risk countries.

Of the 43,000 from the visa-ban countries in 2016, 7,000 were non-Muslims who could face serious difficulties if they remain in Muslim-dominated refugee camps. In other words, Muslims coming from these high-risk countries amounted to about 36,000 people.

But keep in mind that the United States admitted a total of 52,000 non-Muslim refugees in 2016. This means that even if the administration did manage to hit their 50,000 refugee cap (unlikely), and even if there were not a single Muslim in that crowd, there would still be 2,000 fewer non-Muslim refugees! No matter how you cut the numbers, the religious minorities this EO purports to help come out worse off.

We have no explanation for why a Seventh Day Adventist from the Congo or a Pentecostal from Ukraine is viewed as a security threat. There is no rationale whatsoever for denying these people entry. I’ve been to a Ukrainian Pentecostal church. Although I’m a Lutheran and thus tend to be on the stodgy side of things, I assure you, they’re swell folks!

Section 5(c) and 5(e): Little Protection For Syrian Religious Minorities

Section 5(c) states that, even after the 120-day halt to refugee admissions, we still won’t accept Syrian refugees. Consider that for a moment. If the goal is to protect religious minorities subject to persecution, then why would the EO create an enduring ban on all refugees from the country with the most active persecutions?

Some have suggested that section 5(e) offers an outlet. This section does give case-by-case discretion to State and DHS. However, section 5(e) also empowered State and DHS to grant exemptions for refugees we have already admitted who are in transit to the United States: in fact, exemptions have not been granted for those refugees!

Refugees have been stopped at airports, despite explicit orders here saying that in-transit refugees do not have to be stopped. In sum, there is little reason to believe this unexplained case-by-case exemption authority will actually be used to allow in religious minorities. In practice, Section 5(c) is an abandonment of Syrian religious minorities.

Section 7: Biometric Tracking

Again, most media coverage has ignored this provision. The United States has been trying to implement full biometric entry-exit tracking for all people for years now, and the project has taken a while to complete. This EO is ordering DHS to double down and get the job done, which could indeed help improve the security at airports. Getting this system finished would be a real benefit for all Americans and for the world.

Section 8 and 9: Making Travel Harder for Everyone

Before this EO, people who visit the United States on a temporary visa could drop their passport off at a U.S. consular office (think something like a Customs office) and have it renewed more-or-less automatically, as long as there were no red flags picked up by State or DHS. Section 8 ends that program, and requires all visa renewals to go in for another interview.

This will add tons of work for U.S. Consular officers abroad, and inconvenience many travelers to the United States. This affects every country in the world except the 38 with visa-free travel to the United States, so it is surprising it has gotten so little media attention. In order to handle this workload, the EO authorizes a hiring binge of visa interviewers. Yes, that’s right: amidst a hiring freeze, the federal government can now hire lots more embassy workers for the menial task of asking tourists what they plan to see in the United States.

Section 9 is related, and is aimed at punishing countries that charge excessive fees on U.S. travelers. This might help lower visa fees for Americans, so could do some real good! However, it could also lead to many countries simply refusing to cooperate, and everyone facing higher travel costs on all fronts, making it costlier to do business, and harder for foreign tourists to visit the United States and buy our products. It is unclear right now what the effect will be.

Section 10: The Public Terrorist List

Section 10 is kind of like a sex offender registry, but for terrorism by foreigners. It requires DHS, every 180 days, to announce a list of foreign nationals who have even been charged with terrorism or gender-based violence.

Now, on its face, this is not unreasonable: most of this is public record anyways, it’s just now being collected in one place. However, many critics have noted that listing only foreign nationals could make it look like only foreign nationals commit acts of terror. However, most terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by American citizens like one of the San Bernardino attackers, or Omar Mateen at the Pulse nightclub. It is unclear why only foreign nationals are viewed as posing a terror threat worthy of public notice.

Fix It, and Fast

The current EO was rolled out in a haphazard way that damages any effort to have a serious conversation about refugee admittance and the security concerns of many Americans. It poisons the well of debate. Reasonable people can disagree about how many refugees we should have, but using a 120-day halt to game the numbers and make hitting your own publicly announced cap nearly impossible seems underhanded.

Using a 120-day halt to game the numbers and make hitting your own publicly announced cap nearly impossible seems underhanded.

Most reasonable people would agree that banning people who have never been associated with any terrorist attack in our country (say, Bhutanese Hindus) doesn’t make much sense. Reasonable people can disagree about the right security precautions for Syrians, but most people would agree that at least the persecuted religious minorities should be given a categorical exception to any ban, not just an unused “case-by-case” exemption.

Reasonable people can disagree about how much vetting we should be doing (probably more!), but surely nobody thinks the solution is to force the State Department to stop all vetting for 120 days. Reasonable people can disagree about how to handle travel from dangerous, war-torn countries, but a blanket ban that hits U.S. permanent residents, students at American universities, and that separates mothers and their children seems over the top.

This EO can be fixed. DHS’s decision to admit U.S. permanent residents is an important first step. We need more fixes, and fast: an end to any halt on refugees from countries with no visa ban, a categorical exemption for religious minorities in Syria, a more historically normal refugee cap like 70,000, maybe even a special additional cap dedicated to religious minorities, if the Trump administration is sincere about helping these people suffering for their faith.

Keeping Americans safe must always be the first priority for any president. But while that desire for safety is understandable, it does not excuse an executive order that is simply not well thought out. We need our leaders to be wise, not just aggressive, in tackling our national challenges. This EO can be fixed, it should be fixed, it is not even that hard to fix, if the administration truly wants to keep Americans safe and display to the world the strength of the American way.

Correction: This sentence — “Furthermore, not a single American has died as a result of terrorist attacks committed by any citizen of the seven banned countries in this millennium”– has been changed to reflect that no fatalities have occurred, and the following clarification added below.

*However, somewhere between 2 and 41 Somalian refugees have been charged with terror-related offenses. Of those up to 41 potential refugee criminals, no more than 3 involved attacks on American soil; the rest were all related to support of radical Islamist groups abroad. The exact number is uncertain as a charged person’s immigration status is not always publicly announced.

These attacks should not be generalized to all refugees, however: Somalian refugees have vastly lower levels of education than other groups: 3% higher education attendance versus 43% for Iraqis, 29% for Iranians, 14% for Syrians, and 13% for Sudanese (Libya and Yemen have sent negligible numbers of refugees). Somalian refugees are also more likely to be Muslim (99.7%, versus about 60% for Iraq and just 5% for Iran) and fighting-age males (27.4%, versus 25.4% for Iraq, 27.2% for Iran, 18% for Syria). Somalia is a far less modernized and urban country than Syria, Iraq, or Iran, and so the transition to life in America is more jarring.Somalian refugees have also seemed to form tighter-knit ethnic communities than many other groups, creating Somalian neighborhoods. These are all risk factors for terrorism.

That said, it remains the case that better than 99.99% of Somalian refugees have never undertaken any hostile action against the United States government, and no Somalian refugee has killed an American in a terrorist attack. It should also be noted, many Somali refugees are active participants with the FBI and DHS in rooting out violent Islamic jihad at home and abroad; indeed it is likely there are more Somalian refugees working for or with American security agencies than with terror organizations.

"No, Trump’s Immigration Order Isn’t Racist Or Reminiscent Of WWII","As promised in his campaign, President Donald Trump has issued an executive order temporarily banning immigrants and refugees from seven countries that are hotbeds of terrorism until the prospective immigrants can be further vetted and protocol put in place that will better serve U.S. national interests and protect the lives of the American people.

Some have responded with panic and condemnation. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote, “As the Statue of Liberty holds her torch of welcome high, there are tears in her eyes as she sees how low this Administration has stooped in its callousness toward mothers and children escaping war-torn Syria. This Administration has mistaken cruelty for strength and prejudice for strategy.”

Dara Lind of Vox compares Trump’s action to immigration policies of World War II, when “America didn’t feel strongly enough about the mistreatment of Jews to allow them to find a safe harbor in the US.”

America has spent 70 years atoning for its sin by becoming the most welcoming country in the world for refugees. Half of all refugees who are permanently resettled in new countries are resettled in the United States. That is a legacy that Americans are proud of, and should be. It’s the closest America has come, in the 20th century, to honoring the inscription on the Statue of Liberty.

Jewish WWII Refugees Didn’t Support Terrorism

Some on the Right agree. Here’s a tweet from former NeverTrump presidential candidate Evan McMullin:

The reference to the Holocaust has been repeated ad nauseam on social media, as if these two situations are identical. But they’re not. First, war on another continent and concern about enemy spies infiltrating the ranks of refugees are not the same as the risks of importing terrorism and jihadists from the unvetted regions of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, who are intent on killing us here at home.

Jews fleeing Germany didn’t want to kill Americans and didn’t support Nazism. Yet 13 percent of Syrian refugees say they support ISIS, and a survey of Syrians from every region of the country found something that should give every person comparing them to Jewish refugees pause.

A fifth of those interviewed said the Islamic State—the brutal Islamist group known for its beheadings, and that rules over large swaths of Syria and Iraq—is a positive influence on the country. Eighty-two percent said they believe the Islamic State was created by the United States and its allies.

Europe also stands as a testimony of what’s different about this refugee crisis and what Trump is trying to prevent. In England and Wales last year, police arrested 900 Syrians for crimes that include rape and child abuse, although most were for immigration violations.

In Germany, migrants were linked to 69,000 crimes in the first quarter of 2016, and another report shows that refugees committed 92,000 more crimes in 2015 than they had the year before, showing an increase of criminal activity with the influx of immigrants and refugees into the country. Comparing the refugee situation in 2017 to WWII fails to take into consideration the real differences between the Jews in World War II and refugees coming from the Middle East and Africa.

This Is a Temporary Pause to Assess the Situation

Another difference that’s significant is that Trump’s order is not permanent, but temporary, lasting three to four months. It also allows for exceptions. According to the order,

[T]o ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas). . . . [T]he Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.

Regarding Syria,

Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest. [T]he Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest — including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship — and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States.

Where’s the racism? Where’s the cruelty? It’s not there. But if you read protests about Trump’s order, you’d think he was committing genocide himself. The Huffington Post accused the president of targeting Muslims, yet nowhere does the order mention any ethnic group. These countries include a variety of religions, cultures, and ethnicities.

The Government’s Duty Is to Look Out for Americans

Religious groups that work with refugees are calling the order “disgusting” and “vile,” citing the biblical book of Leviticus as a directive for U.S. policy: “The alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself.

“It is deeply ingrained in our faith and our understanding of the Bible that we’re called to welcome the stranger and love and serve our neighbors,” says Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service President Linda Hartke. “Not the neighbors that we choose, but the neighbors that God gives to us.”

What Hartke and others like her are missing is that the U.S. government is not the church. It doesn’t form policy around biblical teaching regarding ancient Israel or the New Testament church. The job of the U.S. government is to protect the interests and safety of Americans, not abide by biblical doctrine regarding the treatment of aliens in the ancient nation of Israel.

When you consider the order in light of the government’s efforts to balance national security with its commitment to accept refugees for asylum, it’s hardly the horror everyone is making it out to be. It’s also not out of step with trends in immigration policy since President Bush.

As David French writes at National Review, “Before 2016, when Obama dramatically ramped up refugee admissions, Trump’s 50,000 stands roughly in-between a typical year of refugee admissions in George W. Bush’s two terms and a typical year in Obama’s two terms.”

In 2002, the United States admitted only 27,131 refugees. It admitted fewer than 50,000 in 2003, 2006, and 2007. As for President Obama, he was slightly more generous than President Bush, but his refugee cap from 2013 to 2015 was a mere 70,000, and in 2011 and 2012 he admitted barely more than 50,000 refugees himself. The bottom line is that Trump is improving security screening and intends to admit refugees at close to the average rate of the 15 years before Obama’s dramatic expansion in 2016. Obama’s expansion was a departure from recent norms, not Trump’s contraction.

Yet, despite the facts, there’s panic that Trump has banned all Muslims, that he’s instituting racism (even though Muslim isn’t a race), and that he’s turning his back on the helpless of the world in the most heartless of ways.

This Order Is Designed to Reduce Bigotry

Contrary to what many people think, the order is actually straightforward and reasonable, designed “to protect Americans” and to “ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles.”

The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including “honor” killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.

This is in keeping with U.S. policy: “to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.” The goal is clear and unprejudiced: to develop “a uniform screening standard and procedure,” including,

[I]n-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicant’s likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicant’s ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States.

There’s not even a hint of bigotry here. Yet, conservatives like McMullin who are still sore from losing to Trump are warning other Republicans that if they support this order, they’re soiled by racism.

How are Republicans in league with racists, exactly? Just because a racist is skeptical of refugees from terrorism-exporting countries for his own twisted reasons doesn’t mean all Republicans who support the policy are racist. This is simply logically incoherent. If all McMullin is doing to telling Republicans to condemn such comments, okay. They’re condemned.

Crying ‘Racism’ Is an Attempt to Avoid the Issues

But McMullin is doing more than that. He’s purposely trying to use far-Right/Left racism to stain Trump Republicans and Trump policies. In this way, he and others like him are using the tactics of Left by labeling Republicans racists in order to stigmatize and delegitimize them.

Just cry “Racism!!” instead of dealing with the facts and debating the issues on their merits. It’s pure manipulation, and those who believe it have been sucked into the vortex of groupthink. This has been the modis operandi of the Left for decades. And now the NeverTrump Right has adopted it for political opportunism.

Wanting to protect our citizens from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals coming into the country isn’t racist or callous.

Republicans who support Trump’s order are not in “league” with racists. Their “silence” in refusing to give racists the time of day does not “define” who they are. Their commitment to protecting Americans doesn’t make them a bunch of callous bigots. Just because the Left thinks the policy is racist doesn’t make it so.

Wanting to protect our citizens from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals coming into the country isn’t racist or callous. It shows compassion and concern for Americans, for our families, our children, our way of life. Does this mean we don’t care about people who are suffering in war-torn regions? We do. This order recognizes that suffering, which is why it allows for exceptions and why the order is temporary.

Yet those who aim to take political advantage want you to believe racism is driving it. But that’s a lie—a convenient one. Narratives like these began during the primary when NeverTrumpers warned Republicans that if you elect Trump, you will ruin the GOP because it will be branded racist. Funny thing is, it’s people like McMullin and the NeverTrump Right who are doing this branding, along with the Left. How very convenient for people who would like to delegitimize Trump in order to see him defeated in 2020.

This false narrative will backfire. For the conservative Right engaging in these leftist tactics, it will either merely help Democrats get re-elected in 2018 and 2020. Or it will so enrage Republicans who support Trump that they will war against conservatism, turning them from the principles of liberty NeverTrump Republicans say they champion. I hope this won’t happen, but it’s a risk.

That’s why this racism smear needs to be challenged at every turn. The focus should be on shutting down the lie, not worrying about whom we’re passively associating with, how our actions are perceived, or trying to prove we’re not racists.

The fact is Trump is not a racist. His administration is not racist. Trump supporters are not defined by fringe racists any more than Democrats are defined by the bigots in their ranks. Trump policies are not racist. Republicans are not in league with racists. That’s the truth, and we need to take confidence in it even as the Left and malcontents on the Right try to drag us through the mud.

Sean Spicer Is Right. Women And Children Could Be Terrorists,"At Monday’s White House press conference a reporter asked spokesman Sean Spicer about a report that a five-year-old boy was detained at Virginia’s Dulles Airport because of the president’s temporary travel ban, calling into question Spicer’s statement that the ban is necessary to protect American citizens from threats.

Spicer’s response is sure to ruffle feathers: Everyone needs to be vetted from seven countries President Obama had earlier targeted with travel restrictions “to make sure, if there is a five-year-old, that they’re with their parents and that they don’t pose a threat. But to assume that just because of someone’s age or gender, or whatever, that they don’t pose a threat would be misguided and wrong.”

He’s exactly right, despite those who say advocates of the ban are afraid of widows and orphans, as Obama said about GOP politicians who supported such measures back in 2015. Instead of banning women and children, some suggest we let them in and ban only the men—because they’re the real threat, right? Wrong. We know from a great deal of evidence that women and children are involved in terrorist attacks. Even babies are used as cover for terror.

‘Even Women Must Fight’

Just last week, Nigerian officials warned that “babies are terrorists’ newest weapon.”

Female suicide bombers carrying infants set off explosive devices in Madagali on Jan. 13 after they were let through a security checkpoint where they were mistaken for civilians, the BBC reported. The women killed themselves, two babies and four others. The women — believed to be from the homegrown Islamic extremist group Boko Haram — could signal a horrifying trend of terrorists using infants in order to avoid detection prior to attacks.

That incident “came just two weeks after two teenage girls blew themselves up and injured three civilians at a checkpoint outside Madagali.” As I wrote back in 2015, female suicide bombers and the use of children aren’t freak occurrences.

Since the 1980s, women have accounted for nearly a quarter of attacks in several countries, including Iraq, Egypt, and Israel. Some research indicates that since 2002 women have carried out 50 percent of suicide attacks in Sri Lanka, Turkey, and Chechnya. According to an article in the Los Angeles Times that calls these attackers “Terror’s ‘invisible women,’” “a younger generation of female jihadists has come to believe that acts of violence can be just as liberating politically and spiritually for women as for men. A religious woman can deflect her parents’ or husband’s objections by invoking the name of religion, which trumps all. The new mantra is ‘even women must fight.’”

The Center for American Progress has written that America’s ability to deal with this radicalization is woefully inadequate, making for a gaping hole in U.S. counterterrorism strategy: “terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and the Taliban continue to exploit uniquely female motivations as a tool to recruit female suicide bombers to attack U.S. soldiers and international aid workers.”

‘The Role of Women Within ISIS Is Increasingly Important’

The fact is, female suicide terrorists are on the rise, and it’s becoming “increasingly important to acknowledge and address this threat to American lives and interests.” In September last year, French police arrested three women planning a terror attack on a Paris train station. Another incident that same month also involved a woman, who was charged in a plot to blow up Paris’s Notre Dame Cathedral.

In Nigeria last year, three female bombers entered a safe haven camp “disguised as displaced persons” and killed 58 people. Two of the young women set off their explosives, but the third didn’t when she realized her parents and siblings were among the intended victims.

Jihad experts in Europe issued a warning last summer that “nearly 300 ‘highly educated and tough,’ radicalized French women are currently in Syria with the Islamic State, plotting attacks on their return to Europe.” “Out of the 700 French nationals currently fighting alongside ISIS in Syria, 275 are women. Jihad experts have warned that these women are often better educated than the men, and are more knowledgeable about Islam.”

According to sociologist and Islam expert Farhad Khosrokhavar, “A teenager can become radicalized in less than 10 days.” “Many young women are ‘naïve’ and truly believe that joining an insurgent group like ISIS is ‘exotic’ and in support of a ‘humanitarian cause’, said Mr Khosrokhavar.”

Islamologist Mathieu Guidère agreed, saying “the role of women within ISIS is becoming ‘increasingly important.’” They are also becoming more common the West as ISIS has issued new directives to enlist women. We saw this with the San Bernardino terrorist, Tashfeen Malik, a woman from Saudi Arabia who was following ISIS rules that allowed women to participate in jihad.

Women Are Very Successful Bombers

Terrorist organizations relish using women because they are extremely successful bombers.

Mia Bloom from the International Center for the Study of Terrorism attributes their success to several factors, most notably the fact that many people still do not expect women to be involved in violence. The common social assumption that women are inherently weaker, gentler, and more peaceful than men discounts their ability to engage in such lethal activity. That assumption allows female suicide terrorists to be overlooked by and escape through security inspections in many conflict zones, despite recent attempts to correct this security lapse.

Their attacks are also more lethal. They’re able to more easily reach high-profile targets and carry out more assassinations because of the lack of security focus. For example, “Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s 1991 assassination by a Tamil Tiger female suicide bomber, who was close enough to touch his feet when the bomb went off, shows how much closer women can get to their targets in many scenarios.”

These unique capabilities are probably why women are responsible for 65 percent of all assassinations among groups that use female suicide terrorists, even though they only make up 15 percent of total suicide bombers in these same groups, according to Lindsey O’Rourke.

According to The New York Times, many woman want to join the ranks of ISIS: “Roughly 10 percent of its Western recruits are female, often lured by their peers through social media and instant messaging.”

Indeed, despite stereotypes about their domesticity and passivity — the idea that they must always be under men’s influence or tricked into joining — women are drawn to groups like the Islamic State by many of the same forces as men: adventure, inequality, alienation and the pull of the cause. Once there, they commit violence against other women, including as part of all-female brigades enforcing female morality codes requiring modest dress and sex segregation. They operate checkpoints and go on home raids; they are also reportedly recruiters, trainers of female suicide bombers, wives and homemakers, fund-raisers and propagandists. They also help sanitize the group’s image by posting photos of themselves drinking milkshakes on Instagram and writing chatty, lighthearted tweets.

The article makes the point that we need to shift our gender stereotypes about the threats of women from terrorist regions. “Terrorists are strategic about using women, in increasingly chilling ways. To fight them, we have to move past simplistic assumptions about gender and terror and get serious about helping women and girls who are on this deadly path, as well as their would-be victims.”

This Extends to Children, Too

Sadly, even children are being radicalized. As I wrote previously, “In Nigeria, four women blew themselves up and a ten-year-old girl with an explosive belt was taken into police custody. CBS News has reported that ‘It is difficult to know how many children have been trained in Iraq and Syria, but there have been reports the number in recent months is in the hundreds.’”

It’s a tactic the Taliban and other terrorist networks have perfected, recruiting children to kill as they yell, ‘Allahu Akbar.’ PBS has reported as recently as this week that children and teens are being trained as ISIS suicide bombers. ‘It’s also a record of one particularly disturbing way the group is trying to expand its influence: training children and teenagers to become the next generation of jihadis,’ PBS writes. The children who are being trained are sometimes as young as five years old. This ISIS video is a disturbing picture of what we’re facing on the terrorist front. It shows lines of young children participating in drills and chanting verses from the Quran.

As reported in the Huffington Post, child suicide bombings are on the rise.

A study in February for Combating Terrorism Center at West Point military academy that examined Islamic State propaganda on child and youth ‘martyrs’ between January 2015 and 2016, found three times as many suicide operations involving children over the year. ‘They represent an effective form of psychological warfare—to project strength, pierce defenses, and strike fear into enemy soldiers’ hearts,’ the study said. ‘Islamic State is mobilizing children and youth at an alarming rate.’

The Daily Mail reported in 2015 that ISIS has been kidnapping children to brainwash them into becoming suicide bombers. They are taken to bases in Iraq and Syria for training. A 12-year-old boy was caught before blowing himself up in Iraq, terrified but determined to carry out his task. Here are pictures of him bursting into tears when police removed his explosive belt.

The unsettling truth, though, is far more unpalatable. For there is no denying that these children know they are wearing an explosive vest and have been given clear instructions and training regarding who to target and how to cause as many casualties as possible.

In Germany, a 12-year-old local German-Iraqi boy had been radicalized to set off a bomb in his hometown. “The stalkers of the so-called Islamic State have been searching out, grooming and inciting young terrorists in France and Germany for more than a year now,” the report said. “According to the German broadcaster WDR, the boy received instructions for building the bomb via the messenger app Telegram.”

Terrorists Will Exploit Known Loopholes

The effort to use women and children is insidious. Certainly, most are not a threat. That is not the point. The same is true of all immigrants and refugees. Most are peaceful. However, when it comes to bringing unknown refugees and immigrants into the United States from hostile regions that are now training young children and women to be terrorists—and using babies as cover—would it not be wise to vet them as thoroughly as we can?

We simply can’t discern the good from the bad without more information, especially regarding women and children. We must do what we can to determine if they are who they say they are. Is this lacking compassion? Is this not wise? Is a temporary ban that offers exceptions in extreme cases so inhuman?

While many Americans want to show compassion by opening our borders and often cite religious reasons for it, it is not the job of our government to be the savior of the world. President Trump’s first duty and priority is the safety and security of the American people. When we don’t know who the enemy is, it is our government’s duty to do everything it can to find out. This includes vetting anyone who could possibly be a threat.

A temporary ban for these purposes is not evil. It is not bigoted. It is not cruel. It is prudent and considerate as we seek to protect the lives of our loved ones while still doing everything we can to help others in genuine need. Our empathy extends to those seeking refuge, but it also extends to our fellow citizens, our family, our friends, and our neighbors here at home. They deserve a safe haven, too.

"Trump's Immigration Order Might Be Constitutional, But Will Hurt Him","This past weekend saw a legal storm unlike any I’ve ever witnessed. An executive order on immigration dropped without preparation—but with immediate effect—on Friday. In a moment of action usually unseen in any sort of bureaucracy, U.S. immigration policy enforcement turned on a dime. It went from lax enforcement of U.S. immigration law per previous executive decrees from former President Obama (in contravention to his oath of office, but that is now historical footnote) to vigorous enforcement.

Detainees started collecting in U.S. airports. Media swooped in. Lawyers sprang into action. Within 24 hours, multiple courts had enjoined the government from enforcing the Executive Order pending various points of review. Within hours of the first two judicial stays, the Department of Homeland Security issued a press release about still enforcing the EO. Now, three days later, legal scholars, policy wonks and media are still trying to figure out exactly who can go where.

The editorial suggestion for this analysis was The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of the immigration EO mess. But problematically, I do not see any good.

Is Trump’s Executive Order Constitutional?

Yes, I do agree with the assessments of lawyers around the web that the EO is probably constitutional. (Most have linked to David French on this point, but I prefer Dan McLaughlin.) At root, non-citizens don’t have rights against our government. The habeas corpus actions by non-citizens upon arrival stem from the limitations the Constitution places on our government.

As a practical matter, the distinction is hardly noticeable. But as legal reasoning, it is significant and means that the federal government can limit immigration more than most people understand. So the Trump Administration is probably in-bounds on the policy.

But technical compliance is not in itself good, and current arguments about the EO’s constitutionality miss its real-world effects. It is easy for professors, judges, appellate lawyers, and legal policy wonks to get into theory and forget to notice what the jury sees—much less what effect the verdict will have upon their client.

Today’s news is not just full of that kind of blindness, but also media ignorance. This is not new, of course. But no matter how much we brace for media ignorance, it still has an effect. And there is nothing good about effects here.

Does the EO ‘Protect’ Us From Foreign Terrorist Entry?

The reason the Administration has given for these restrictions: protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry. For the sake of argument, let us assume that the Administration believes the current state of immigration increases our terror risk. It is hardly an unreasonable assumption, but for the purposes of examining effectiveness, I want to strip away all the hysteria and hypocrisy about baser motives.

First, if they wanted to reduce the terrorism risk, they should have tailored the list of effected countries to those with high terror risks. Instead, they tied it to previous laws enacted during the Obama Administration. Those lists were highly political and sheltered high terrorism counties, such as Saudi Arabia, from the restrictions because of various political and economic ties with the huge oil producer.

Whether using the previous list was lazy, or some weak attempt at countering anticipated resistance—“Obama did it first!”— I can only guess. But imposing immigration restrictions on countries that don’t send terrorists abroad and leaving off countries that have is nonsensical, especially for the man who promised to end D.C. nonsense. If the goal is reducing the chances terrorists make it into the U.S., then the list is missing a few countries.

Why Would The EO Exclude Interpreters And Informants?

Second, if the Administration wanted to reduce terrorism, then they should have excluded people who had served as interpreters or informants against our enemies. Those persons had put their lives at risk to help out military and defeat or enemies, not exactly a hallmark of potential terrorists.

The skewed country list is an example “under-inclusiveness,” and the informants are an example of “over-inclusiveness.” The latter category also includes green card holders (which has now been walked back), children, and university scholarship students, who are not only unlikely terrorists, but also very sympathetic detainees, which prompted the media frenzy in waiting.

This over- and under- inclusiveness not only made it easy for the media to spin up the public about a “Muslim ban” with sympathetic tales—it also meant lawyers had their pick of potential plaintiffs. The over- and under- inclusiveness problem also enabled judges to issue sweeping injunctions against the government. It was a spectacular unforced error. (For any readers curious about classification issues and the scope of the injunctions, Prof. Josh Blackman has the first comprehensive explainer.)

The EO’s Implementation Has Met With Error And Confusion

Then came another unforced error. In response to those injunctions, the Department of Homeland Security issued a press release, and if it said what it sounds like it says, we’d be in radical territory. It opened:

The Department of Homeland Security will continue to enforce all of President Trump’s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. President Trump’s Executive Orders remain in place—prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. President Trump’s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America’s borders and national security.

It reads like defiance, that the executive branch will continue to enforce the EO regardless of what the judicial branch says. That’s how sites left and right took it. The Washington Post’s reaction story carried the headline, “Trump gives no sign of lifting travel ban: Homeland Security: ‘Prohibited travel will remain prohibited.’” Twitchy ran with “Sorry, not sorry, Snowflakes! Travel ‘ban’ remains in place despite court ruling” and a nanny-nanny-boo-boo lede: “The ban that’s not really a ban is still in place. Suck it up, lefties.”

Let us be kind and simply note that the press release aggravated an already angry situation.

This Is How We Reached Peak Frenzy

But, oh the irony, the press release only sounded like defiance. It had tried to say that the stay doesn’t stop enforcement of the entire EO, and that DHS would follow the court orders but continue to enforce the rest of the EO. DHS even tried to calm things down by issuing a clarifying press release a few hours later, one that opened, “Upon issuance of the court orders yesterday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) immediately began taking steps to comply with the orders.” but the media and public were already at peek frenzy with no inclination to listen.

Furthermore, one of the defensive points bouncing around to calm reaction down was that the injunctions only effect a small number of people. The reasoning goes that the injunctions only apply to people in transit or already here, because the U.S. government can still revoke travel visas per the EO. If one does not have a travel visa, one can’t get here to face the threat of detainment or deportation and thus cannot fall under either the EO or one of the stays. This is true.

But revoking visas is not a mitigating event, it is an escalating one.

Just Because Government Can Doesn’t Mean It Should

Again, I’m not arguing that the government cannot do this, but that doing it will not calm the situation down. From a public relations standpoint and an international commerce standpoint, whether someone is refused a visa abroad or sent back from whence they came is a detail. As far as the commercial public is concerned, it’s the stopping that offends.

Saturday night, my husband got an exasperated call from a colleague with dual citizenship from Canada and Iran. He cancelled his business trip here because he didn’t want to risk the hassle. When CATO’s analysis of terrorism risk from immigration vs. economic consequences found the far greater risk in economic consequences, it was the mood that cancels these thousands of business trips per day that CATO had in mind.

We can limit immigration, yes. But that the government can do something is not an argument for doing it.

What Trump’s EO Could Have Done Instead

The EO could have been much simpler to implement and much harder to resist if it had simply stated that due to terrorism concerns, U.S. immigration officials would give extra scrutiny to anyone traveling from certain named countries.

Then, the Department of Homeland Security could have spent the next few weeks formulating the details of that heightened scrutiny and training immigration officers on executing those details. The buildup at airports and the flight refusals around the world would not have created an instant flashpoint. For those detained, lawyers would have still filed actions on their behalf, but the similarly affected persons would not have been so many or so easy to group. Thus, the stays would likely have been limited to the named individual, or smaller classes of similarly situated individuals.

The Administration, however, was so determined to get broad protection rules on the books to satiate President Trump’s base (and send a big middle finger to his detractors), they have severely limited their ability to enforce such rules, perhaps for a while. Stays are aptly named, and the emotional nature of “the airport cases” makes it likely that at least some of the lower courts will find against the Administration, regardless of what the legal commentators publishing at National Review think about the constitutionality of the EO.

What Trump Has Managed In His First 10 Days

For any who believe that national security requires tighter borders, the government just risked a lingering injunction, which would prevent tighter border enforcement for years while the appeals work out. (Ask Texas whether that happens.)

Back in ’09 it took a couple of months for the opposition’s mass protests to start and the fans’ disappointment to settle in. By the summer of Obama’s first term, many had realized that while he was an excellent candidate, he was at best a mediocre politician. President Trump has managed that feat in 10 days.

Why It’s Wrong To Compare Terrorist Attacks To Generic Gun Violence,"On Friday, an Egyptian man armed with two machetes attacked a group of security guards patrolling the Louvre Museum in Paris. The man, who yelled “allahu akbar” during the attack, was shot and taken to the hospital. Thankfully, no one was killed. The attack still terrified Parisians and many across the West. Why? Because of the attacker’s intent and our own vulnerability in our day to day lives.

Since President Trump signed his executive order on immigration two weeks ago, social media has been flooded with memes and graphs showing how few people have died at the hands of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries who’ve committed acts of terrorism. The Left uses this narrative to argue that we don’t need to worry about Middle Eastern terrorism or refugees coming into the country.

But this misunderstands, on a deep level, the psychology of terrorism and the importance of intention.

Terrorism Aims to Destabilize Society

Statistics about terrorism are often accompanied by the number of gun deaths that occur every year. This is a typical tactic of the Left. Whenever Islamist terrorism comes up, they change the conversation to guns and gun control.

There’s no doubt that gun violence in America is out of control. But comparing terrorism to gun violence misses the importance of intention, and how strongly it affects peoples’ sense of security. This is at the root of why terrorism frightens people so much.

It matters whether your potential attacker is trying to steal money from you, or is trying to kill you in the name of religion. The result might be the same tragic end, but the American public senses that there’s something infinitely more sinister about being the victim of a plot versus being the victim of a crime. And that’s what these ISIS-inspired attacks are: a plot.

The New York Times recently reported that many of the so-called lone wolf attacks that we’ve seen over the past few years were really coordinated by operatives in Syria. They aren’t just random, unrelated acts of violence by isolated, mentally ill individuals, as the mainstream media would have us believe. They are part of a broader strategy that is rooted in the religio-political ideology of Islamism.

That’s why we treat terrorism differently from a law enforcement point of view. Because it’s directed not just at murdering our citizens, but also at destabilizing our country. Gun violence is a terrible problem. But its perpetrators aren’t trying to destroy our way of life. And they aren’t working in a coordinated effort. That is what scares people.

Terrorism Makes People Feel Helpless

And people are afraid. In 2016, a survey on what Americans fear most found that terrorism filled the number two and number four slots, even though the chances of being the victim of terrorism is miniscule. But that’s not why people are afraid. They’re scared because there’s a sense that it could happen anywhere, anytime.

For the most part, a person can avoid going into a bad neighborhood, or dealings with criminals. This might help decrease their chance of being the victim of gun violence or a knife attack or a mugging.

But there’s nothing they can do to mitigate their likelihood of being the victim of a terror attack. Terrorist attacks feel random. For most people, that is scarier than almost anything else.

A study in the 1980s examined what influences peoples’ sense of how much danger they’re in. It found that a lack of control over a situation will inflate a person’s perception of risk. The study similarly found that uncertainty had the same effect. Being unsure about what’s going to happen and knowing we’re helpless to prevent it increases how afraid we are.

What the D.C. Sniper Showed Us About Random Violence

I was in Washington, D.C. visiting my brother and sister when the D.C. sniper was on the loose. People were terrified. The sniper could strike anywhere. There didn’t seem to be a pattern to whom or where he struck. There was nothing you could do to improve your odds. (Although my sister and I may have run in zig-zags leaving a metro station in Arlington to improve our chances.)

This is the same mentality behind the fear of terrorism—even though, statistically, it’s virtually impossible that you will be the next victim. Their fear is compounded because they know that we live in a society that’s too politically correct to do much about it. They’re reminded of this every time the media rushes to blame anything but religious ideology whenever a terrorist attack occurs.

So, even though the Louvre attacker didn’t have a gun or a bomb, and could only have done so much damage before being stopped by police, it still shakes our sense of security. It reminds us how vulnerable we are as we go about our daily lives, and how easy it is for someone to take advantage of that.

It’s also a reminder that there is a cadre of people around the world who would kill us as soon as look at us. That’s a pretty scary prospect.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/02/07/wrong-compare-terrorist-attacks-generic-gun-violence/,2017-02-07
It’s Legal To Designate The Muslim Brotherhood A Terrorist Organization,"As President Trump moves towards designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization, we’re hearing all the reasons he can’t or shouldn’t.

The latest tactic has been to assert that designating the Muslim Brotherhood is not possible, or simply illegal, because it does not conform with the letter of the law regarding Foreign Terrorist Designations. This is a specious claim, but made with such confidence that it requires a serious examination to debunk.

Yes, the Muslim Brotherhood Exists

One of the chief arguments that designating the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization would be illegal is there is no such thing as the Muslim Brotherhood. A textbook example of this claim comes from Benjamin Wittes in the Lawfare Blog:

The short answer is that the Brotherhood is not in a meaningful sense a single organization at all; elements of it can be designated and have been designated, and other elements certainly cannot be. As a whole, it is simply too diffuse and diverse to characterize. And it certainly cannot be said as a whole to engage in terrorism that threatens the United States.

While Wittes admits that there does exist a single body known as the International Muslim Brotherhood, he claims “it is difficult to assess the strength of the ties between the international organization and the various Brotherhood chapters, because of the organization’s penchant for secrecy.”

Indeed, the International Muslim Brotherhood is so secretive that it published its bylaws on the Muslim Brotherhood’s website in 2010. These bylaws make clear that the leadership of national branches answer to the overall Muslim Brotherhood leadership. The bylaws state that branch “secretary generals must abide by the higher leadership’s decisions,” are obliged to “get approval of the general guidance office prior to making any important political decision,” must file “annual reports” with the higher leadership, and must “pay an annual subscription” to the higher leadership.

The claimed ability to approve policy, enforce common decisions, and closely scrutinize activity, and the transfer of funds from lower members to higher leadership would all seemingly meet the requirement of a single organization. No doubt plenty of district attorneys would long for such an overt statement of hierarchy and cooperation when attempting a racketeering prosecution.

But the argument about the level of the Brotherhood’s cohesiveness is ultimately a distraction. The law governing Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designation defines a terrorist organization by citing a separate section of law , 8 U.S. Code § 1182, which reads in part:

(vi) “Terrorist organization” defined As used in this section, the term “terrorist organization” means an organization— (I) designated under section 1189 of this title; (II) otherwise designated, upon publication in the Federal Register, by the Secretary of State in consultation with or upon the request of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as a terrorist organization, after finding that the organization engages in the activities described in subclauses (I) through (VI) of clause (iv); or (III) that is a group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described in subclauses (I) through (VI) of clause (iv).

The key section here is (III), “a group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described in subclauses (I) through (VI) of clause (iv).” So while Wittes cites pro-Islamist experts to argue that the International Muslim Brotherhood lacks demonstrable cohesion or the ability to enforce common policy, ultimately the total level of organization is irrelevant. The only question is whether the organization has engaged, or possesses a subgroup that engaged, in terrorist activities. Here the answer is an obvious yes, given that Hamas is a self-acknowledged subgroup of the International Muslim Brotherhood, and is already a legally designated FTO.

Yes, Muslim Brotherhood Affiliates Engage in Terrorism

Even aside from the role of Hamas as a subgroup of the International Muslim Brotherhood, there is strong evidence that the Muslim Brotherhood engages in “the activities described in subclauses (I) through (VI) of clause (iv).” Those read as follows:

(iv) “Engage in terrorist activity” defined As used in this chapter, the term “engage in terrorist activity” means, in an individual capacity or as a member of an organization— (I) to commit or to incite to commit, under circumstances indicating an intention to cause death or serious bodily injury, a terrorist activity; (II) to prepare or plan a terrorist activity; (III) to gather information on potential targets for terrorist activity; (IV) to solicit funds or other things of value for— (aa) a terrorist activity; (bb) a terrorist organization described in clause (vi)(I) or (vi)(II); or (cc) a terrorist organization described in clause (vi)(III), unless the solicitor can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he did not know, and should not reasonably have known, that the organization was a terrorist organization…

The key factor here is (IV), “to solicit funds or other things of value” for “a terrorist organization.” The U.S. government has already successfully argued in court that the Muslim Brotherhood founded Hamas, and that the Muslim Brotherhood created and maintained an international infrastructure to finance and support the Hamas subgroup. Specifically, the Muslim Brotherhood established a “Palestine Section,” which in turn oversaw “Palestine Committees” in each of the Muslim Brotherhood’s branches, in order to raise funds and engage in propaganda (obviously a thing of value) on behalf of Hamas.

Muslim Brotherhood apologists know that designating the Muslim Brotherhood would be a serious impediment to continuing the bipartisan, but failed, policy of cooperating with Islamists in the Middle East.

Whether U.S. engagement with Islamists is useful is a policy question that can be debated, but it should be done openly. The recent invocation of claims it is “illegal” to designate the Muslim Brotherhood is an attempt to hide behind dubious legal claims, in order to avoid a policy argument on the merits. Such tactics perhaps suggest how weak the apologists’ policy position is.

How Pope Francis Helped An Unrepentant Terrorist Get A Pardon,"On January 13, Robert González Nieves, archbishop of San Juan, revealed Pope Francis’ role in Barack Obama’s pardon of terrorist mastermind Oscar Lopez-Rivera. Speaking from the Cathedral of San Juan, Nieves announced that although the Holy Father made no public statement of his involvement, he had indeed worked behind the curtain on behalf of the unrepentant, bloody-handed Lopez-Rivera.

The archbishop was pleased to say: “I know that there have been efforts made through diplomatic channels. The pope is very aware. We are grateful to the Holy Father for his support.” Papal complicity in this politically charged act received little notice in the English-language press. It deserved more.

What matters here is the pope’s part in an ideologically motivated pardon that was opposed by law enforcement and families scarred by Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional (FALN) bombs. But first, a brief recap of the Marxist-Leninist zealots whose boss earned sympathetic attention from Rome.

This Guy Is an Unrepentant Bomber

Lopez-River’s command of FALN was never in doubt, never denied. Instead, he boasted: “I am an enemy of the United States’ government.” During the 1970s and ‘80s, FALN claimed credit for more than 100 bombings in New York, Washington, Chicago, and other cities. The lethal Fraunces Tavern bombing in 1975 is the best known and deadliest of them. The historic tavern, close to Wall Street, was a popular lunch spot in the financial district. FALN thugs took credit for having blown it up “with reactionary corporate executives inside.”

Prior to forensic use of DNA in court, no definitive physical evidence was available to support the overwhelming circumstantial case against Lopez-Rivera. (See Matthew Hennessey’s essay “A Terrorist’s Fan Base” in City Journal for a sterling synopsis of his arrest and conviction.) Guilty of six murders, scores of maimings, and millions of dollars in property damage, he was convicted for felony conspiracy and sentenced to 55 years in federal prison in 1981. (He earned an additional 15 years for attempting to escape Leavenworth in 1988.)

The penitentiary provided a stage for his crafted role as a prisoner of conscience. The Left rallied to him as an anti-colonial freedom fighter, an independence activist, and political prisoner—Puerto Rico’s Nelson Mandela.

Lopez-Rivera’s co-conspirator, explosives expert William Morales, operated a FALN bomb factory in Queens and was implicated in the Fraunces Tavern bombing. He escaped to Mexico, then fled to Cuba where he still lives, and where the movement to free Lopez-Rivera has been kept alive by Fidelistas as a symbolic slap at the United States. (Note the “Free Lopez-Rivera Now” sign next to the pope’s motorcade in Havana.)

Pope Francis Brokers Pro-Communist Political Deals

Enter Pope Francis. Readers will recall that Francis facilitated the normalization of U.S. relations with Cuba. Colluding secretly with Obama in defiance of a constitutional demand that two-thirds of Congress approve treaty terms, Francis enlisted Sean O’Malley, archbishop of Boston, and Theodore McCarrick, retired archbishop of Washington DC to help broker a kiss-off to the rule of law. Both prelates flew to Cuba with Francis in 2015 and attended Mass in Revolution Square, under a massive image of Che Guevara.

In his 40-minute heart-to-heart with Castro after Mass (“very familiar, fraternal and friendly,” said Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi), did the subject of Lopez-Rivera come up? All we know is that the American-born Morales still remains on the FBI’s list of most-wanted domestic terrorists. Apparently, then, he was not included in the prisoner exchange that was central to Obama removing Cuba from the list of terror-sponsoring states. (The exchange contradicted the public claim of Cuban cardinal Jaime Ortega, archbishop of Havana, that no political prisoners exist in Havana.)

From Cuba, Francis flew to the United States, where he was greeted in East Harlem by Melissa Mark-Viverito, the speaker of New York’s ultra-left City Council and a devoted fan of the terrorist. A native of Puerto Rico, she dedicated the 2014 Puerto Rican Day parade to “the jailed nationalist,” and has regularly visited him in prison over several years. The speaker admitted to having visited him three times in the nine months prior to Francis’ 2015 visit.

From one of those visits she brought back a gift from the convict intended for Francis—a painting of the pope by Lopez-Rivera himself. Art therapy has its uses. She broadcast the stunt in a flurry of self-ennobling tweets picked up by Politico: “Oscar has told me he is encouraged by @Pontifex message of reconciliation, building bridges, & dialogue as a way overcoming hostilities,” Mark-Vivarito tweeted. “It was discussed and I agreed that I would attempt to present the painting as a gift to @Pontifex during his visit.”

Reconciliation. Dialogue. These are media-conscious words from a violent extremist who preferred dynamite to dialogue. And this is my favorite tweet: “@Pontifex more than gracious w/his time, his interest piqued when I shared that gift was from a prisoner I visited in jail.”

A prisoner. None in particular. Just one of the many anonymous, marginalized people whom a righteous woman meets visiting the imprisoned, a corporal work of mercy. In short, papal connivance with the commutation of Lopez-Rivera’s sentence was not spontaneous. Francis’ mercy-mongering on his behalf had been in the works more than a year.

Our Kind of Power Transcends Your Petty Boundaries

Yes, New York is a sanctuary city controlled by Democrats. Yes, the larger the Latino population, the tighter liberal Democrat control, and the more powerful Latino politicians. But the rationale goes deeper than political maneuvering and ethnic power plays. There is a kind of gnosticism at work in this pontificate that binds it to the cynical, tribal rationalizations of power traffickers like Mark-Vivarito.

She and Pope Francis view American immigration law—insofar as it concerns a chosen demographic—as invalid. In February, 2016, the City Council agenda included legislation that would give illegal aliens the right to vote in New York City’s 2017 elections for mayor, comptroller, public advocate, borough president, and City Council. In other words, for the city’s total system of governance and financial accounting.

Doubtless, the Holy Father smiles on the initiative. Letting non-citizens vote grants power to an abstraction that enchants Francis: “the excluded,” or “the discards of society.” On the way home from Mexico a year ago, Francis said: “The word people is not a logical category, it is a mystical category.” He later tuned that remark this way: “In the sense that everything the people does is good,” it is better to say “mythical.”

Francis is not bound by rational structures: “It takes a myth to understand the people.” More antinomian than Catholic, Francis answers to a vision that, in his words, “transcends the logical proceedings of formal democracy.” The rule of law—a rational thing with its impoverished categories and dogmatic judgments—must bend for The People. It is a romance gone gray, but Francis would rejuvenate it.

For Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo—influential among European leftists for his triple status as Communist, Catholic, and gay—Francis is the leader of a global revolution, a new “communist and papal” International. In an interview that appeared in Argentina’s La Nacion on November 23, 2014, Vattimo argued that the Catholic Church itself could be understood as the last Socialist International and that Francisco, the voice of the voiceless and marginalized, is the spear carrier for “an alternative world to that of the capitalisms of the developed countries.”

That is the vision that Oscar Lopez-Rivera and kindred executioners kill for.

Terrorism Is Not The Only Reason To Be Skeptical Of Muslim Immigration,"When we debate Muslim immigration—as we are again, as President Trump prepares to re-instate a revised travel ban—we mostly think about terrorism. This is a mistake, in part because it can border on fearmongering. Very few Muslims are terrorists, and the proposed restrictions are not well-tailored to stopping terrorists.

But fundamentally, it is a mistake because of what it ignores. Focusing only on terrorism—rather than on the beliefs, habits, and mores of potential immigrants—creates a false dichotomy, in which the opposite of “terrorist” is “moderate.”

This is a fuzzy category. “Moderate” in relation to what? We apply the term to vast numbers of people who have no commitment to political liberalism, the bedrock of Western democracy. As we move beyond a short-term debate about travel bans and refugees, and begin to think about the long-term effects of mass immigration, we must confront its most salient challenge: namely, how to form people into citizens.

Chasms Between the Muslim World and West

Both right and left acknowledge that terrorism cannot be ignored. They also acknowledge that very few Muslim immigrants will be jihadists. What remains is a feverish debate about just how small that small number is, and what sacrifices we should make to get it to zero.

But “not a terrorist” cannot be our standard for potential immigrants. That one has refrained from donning a suicide vest is a paltry indicator of character. The overwhelming majority of Muslims are not terrorists, but we know from survey data that many do sympathize with Jihadists. More importantly, an even larger number hold beliefs that many Americans, on both right and left, would consider incompatible with a free society.

A more serious immigration debate would consider some sobering findings from public opinion surveys in the Muslim world. For example, in 2013, Pew released a comprehensive report entitled “The World’s Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society.” Though the report has its bright spots—for example, wide majorities of Muslims express support for democracy—it also reveals chasms between the Muslim world and the West.

Muslim Views On Homosexuality and Honor Killings

Take, for example, Muslim opinion on whether homosexuality is morally acceptable. Remember, this is not a question about gay marriage. Here, Uganda emerges as a relative bastion of progressivism, with 12 percent saying “yes.” In the Middle East and Southeast Asia, the highest figure is 2 percent.

Maybe this isn’t a big a deal. After all, there was a time in the not so distant past when most Americans disapproved of homosexuality. More important than beliefs on sexual morality is whether, and how, they will be acted upon. That is why the responses to another question—whether honor killings are ever justified as punishment for pre- or extra-marital sex—are disconcerting.

Central Asian and Eastern European Islam tends to be more moderate—in large part because of the secularist legacy of the USSR—but even in those regions, between 15 percent and 50 percent of Muslims believe it is sometimes acceptable to execute girls for sexual impropriety. In all but two countries in the Middle East and South Asia, a majority believe honor killings are sometimes or often acceptable.

How Mass Muslim Migration Affects Gender Relations

We might also ask what mass Muslim immigration might portend for gender relations in the West. The chart below shows the number of people—both men and women—who agreed that a wife must always

obey her husband.

The concerns these numbers raise about the prospect for seamless integration into Western society are heightened by the widespread opposition to intermarriage across the Muslim world. The number who would approve of their daughter marrying a Christian range from just 21 percent in Lebanon down to 0 percent in Egypt and Jordan.

As we move from moral beliefs to political beliefs, the picture does not get much brighter. In most countries outside of the old Communist bloc, overwhelming majorities support making Sharia law—that is, Islamic religious law—the law of the state.

We Must Be Aware Of the Threat Sharia Poses

“Creeping sharia”—the fear that Sharia law is already powerful in the U.S.—has become a leitmotif for paranoid right-wing conspiracy theorists. But, in the context of immigration policy, there is nothing paranoid or conspiratorial about paying attention to support for political sharia. As our political idol du jour, Alexander Hamilton, noted in 1802, “foreigners will generally be apt to bring with them attachments to the persons they have left behind; to the country of their nativity, and to its particular customs and manners. They will also entertain opinions on government congenial with those under which they have lived.” This does not mean that we must never admit any foreigners from countries unlike our own. But we cannot be stubbornly naïve about their politics.

But what, exactly, is sharia? Is it fear-mongering to even talk about it? That seems to be the view of many pundits, such as The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, who rebuked Newt Gingrich for even raising the issue. Goldberg explains that “sharia, in many ways, is analogous to Jewish law, or ‘halacha.’ (Both words mean, more or less, ‘the way,’ or ‘the pathway.’)” True enough, and the etymology lesson is a nice touch, but not many Jews want to replace the US Criminal Code with the 613 Mitzvot. He continues, “There are several schools of sharia thought, that range from fundamentalist to liberal in approach. The conservative, Hanbali, interpretation . . . is very harsh by Western standards.”

Ah, diversity! Presumably we are to be heartened by this, despite having no idea how many people subscribe to which school. And what exactly does “harsh by Western standards” mean? Do only half of the kids on the soccer team receive a trophy?

Sharia Law Supports Executions And Stoning

Where pundits equivocate, the data provide clarity about what sharia means to the people who believe it should be the supreme civil law. As the charts below show, for very large numbers of sharia-supporting Muslims, including 86 percent in Egypt, it means executing apostates (those who renounce Islam). As punishment for adultery, execution—actually, not just execution, but stoning—is even more popular.

Consider, moreover, how these questions tend to warp our notion of the word “moderate.” In Indonesia, only 48 percent support stoning adulterers. Does this mean the slim majority opposed are “moderates”? Maybe, but we have no indication how many instead favor the Qua’ranically mandated punishment of 100 lashes.

What to make of all this vis-a-vis immigration? First of all, we must make something of it. We cannot accept the lazy assumption, asserted without any evidence, that selection effects will render all of this null, because only people drawn to Western culture will come to the West. Some immigrants will be dissenters, like the brilliant Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Others will come only for economic reasons. And still others will be like Muslim Brotherhood leader Sayyid Qutb, whose repulsion to lasciviousness in Greeley, Colorado (of all places) spurred his radicalism.

Mass Immigration Will Shape Our Culture

Rather, we must take seriously the possibility that, over the long term, mass immigration will have serious effects on our politics and culture. The birth rate for Muslim immigrants—typically far above the rate for Westerners—makes this possibility even more likely. And even if Muslims remain a small minority, social change will be unavoidable.

Even those who oppose mass immigration tend to shy away from discussing the facts above. Many probably fear being tarred as Islamophobic if they suggest that we should be concerned with Muslims’ inclination toward theocracy. But fear of giving offense means relinquishing the only argument that reveals the paradoxes at the heart of our current immigration politics. Progressive causes will not fare very well if mass immigration has political ramifications, given nearly-uniform views in the Muslim world about sexuality, gay rights, abortion, and the subjugation of women to their husbands. For this reason, it’s not surprising that gays in France are increasingly drawn to Marine Le Pen.

A serious reckoning with public opinion does not mean painting the Muslim world as a monolithically bad. It means precisely the opposite. Opinions vary widely by region and even by country. Clearly, some places have done a better job than other at cultivating a moderate form of Islam. We need to pay attention to this when designing our immigration policy.

We Must Focus On Mores, Beliefs, and Practices

Most significantly, a focus on mores, beliefs, and practices would transform our immigration debate by placing assimilation—once considered essential for successful immigration—back at the fore. The data above does not imply that Muslim immigration should be banned, or even reduced. But it must force us to reevaluate two increasingly common—yet potentially contradictory—attitudes towards assimilation. First, that assimilation is oppressive; and, second, that assimilation—or at least acceptance of tolerance and diversity—will happen inevitably.

The first, opposition to assimilation, presumes either that Western societies are fundamentally flawed in some way—indelibly marked by racism, sexism, colonialism, etc.—or at least that they are no better than any other society. But the second—faith in inevitable assimilation—presumes that Western ways of life are so self-evidently good that any person in the right circumstances would prefer them. At once, Western society is understood as so flawed that it would be wrong to impose our culture, but simultaneously as so good that it doesn’t need to be imposed.

What Does A Healthy Immigration Standard Look Like?

These contradictions help to explain why the progressive position on immigration is weak. Progressives are always eager to identify our shortcomings, the ways in which we fail to live up to our proclaimed values. At its best, this eagerness manifests in a reforming spirit. But at its worst, it leads progressives to take liberal society itself for granted. By contrast, conservatives have always been suspicious about the liberal foundations of modern society. At its worst, this suspicion manifests in outright hostility toward, or rejection of, the liberal order. But at its best, this suspicion has given rise to a deep prescience about the fragility of the liberal order.

Our immigration debate stands to benefit from more of that skepticism, and hopefully more of that prescience. Terrorism essentially presents us with a technical question: how do we keep our citizens safe? That’s important, but ultimately subordinate to deeper political questions about what it means to be a citizen in the first place, and about the capacity of our society to fully integrate immigrants. Unless we move beyond the specter of terrorism, we will not be able to ask, or answer, those questions.

Trump Will Be Tested By Terrorists And Tyrants Sooner Rather Than Later,"Since the tragic attacks against the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, domestic acts of terrorism by foreign nationals, or on behalf of foreign terrorist organizations, have been relatively small in terms of casualties. That is, unless you lost a loved one to the radical Islamist movement.

If history is prologue, the new president will be tested by “saber rattling” foreign powers, including terrorists, and typically sooner rather than later. It is all about re-evaluating their calculus with a new suit in the White House.

Meanwhile, angry Democrats in their soiled electoral diapers are doing everything they can to encumber a functional Trump government, including obstructing sound national security policy related to terrorism. That our politicians are so naive about the reality of terrorists being embedded in refugee groups strains credibility. The threat is real, and they know it.

Their actions are baffling if not ludicrous. Is it lost on the national press and public that the Democratic Party’s vetting of Trump’s cabinet is more stringent than vetting on alleged foreign refugees from a terrorist zone? When the domestic terrorism again raises its ugly head, as it most certainly will, Democrats will be the first to attribute it to Trump immigration policy.

In the meantime, Democratic Party financiers fund, exacerbate, and encourage domestic turmoil inspired by race baiting, identity politics, and advancing the cause of Marxism. We are witnessing a feeding frenzy among disaffected and immature young people in search of a reason to act out their anger and ignorance. All of this domestic turmoil comes at a time China and Russia are posturing and flexing their military might. These are dangerous times and miscalculations can bring tragic consequences.

Despite Our Might, Weakness Emboldens Enemies

Bill Clinton’s weakness in the face of radical Islam eventually emboldened al-Qaeda to undertake the hideously inhumane event of 9/11. In 1993, the World Trade Center was attacked by radical Islamist Ramzi Yousef employing a 1,300-pound truck bomb in the parking structure. Miraculously, only six people died, although more than a thousand were injured. Clinton feigned outrage and promised the guilty would be brought to justice.

In1996, the Khobar Towers barracks were bombed in Saudi Arabia. The result was 19 dead soldiers and hundreds injured. In 1998, our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed and, two months later, the USS Cole was bombed. Each attack was followed by a serious-sounding Clinton pledging the attackers would be brought to justice.

In fact, he did little or nothing beyond posturing and authorizing the midnight launch of cruise missiles into an empty pharmaceutical factory in Sudan. Well, he actually did do something. He directed his aide, Dick Morris, to conduct polls on how best to respond to terrorism.

George W. Bush responded to 9/11 with overwhelming military force that drove al-Qaeda into the mountains of Afghanistan and ultimately to sanctuary in the northern territories of a supposed ally, Pakistan. Once in Pakistan, our resolve to seek and destroy al-Qaeda leadership withered. Rather than risk strained relations with Pakistan by pursuing Osama bin Laden with our military, we turned to a “denial of sanctuary” strategy in Afghanistan. The CIA and other intelligence arms continued the search for Bin Laden.

Next, the Bush administration became fully invested in the mythical belief that by nation-building we could reverse centuries of tribal mores, including a warrior mentality, and bring the ancient society into the modern world. By golly, with some new values, education, and a democratic form of government, the third world could become like us. We all know how nation-building turned out in both Afghanistan and Iraq after first invading their countries.

Next came the Obama administration with a pledge to get us out of Iraq, leaving a vacuum of leadership and spurring civil war and eventually the Islamic State from what remained of al-Qaeda in Iraq. Emboldened by Obama’s weakness, ISIS metastasized from a localized terror group in 2011 to proclaim a new caliphate. By 2016, it was an international terrorist organization in 18 countries. Its reach, through small cells and so-called lone wolves, has reached into Germany, France, Belgium, and the United States. According to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism, ISIS was responsible for over 33,000 deaths through 2015. Clearly that number has grown.

In 2014, President Obama referred to the group as inconsequential, a “junior varsity” terror group. However, history has demonstrated that the JV team was actually the Obama administration. Again, weakness breeds boldness in terrorists, and we have been demonstrably weak in our responses for decades.

America’s Five Deadly Shortcomings Terrorists Exploit

“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles,” said Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese warrior. As it turns out, the Islamists have known our frailties far better than we have. They rightly concluded, and have demonstrated, that Americans have five deadly shortcomings, and they exploit them:

We are adverse to casualties, so be bold and inhumane.

We lack stamina for protracted conflict, we quit when quick victory eludes us, so make it long, painful, and tiring.

We steadfastly cling to “we all want the same thing,” when they despise us and tell the world we are “the great Satan,” and “death to America.” Iran was doing it before the ink was dry on the nuclear treaty fiasco.

Despite Islamists’ declaration of war with the West, we ignore them and act like we are dealing with a few malcontents bent on violence.

They actively pursue civilization jihad in America by claiming to be “just another religion” and we ignore the irrefutable fact that they are a theocracy.

Fifteen-plus years after 9/11, we continue to “dither about” in the absence of a comprehensive, lasting, and effective strategic terrorism policy. The resilience of the Taliban and emergence of ISIS is clear evidence of failed policy.

The Nexus Between Terrorism and Civil Disorder

On the home front, we have seen civil unrest, lawless looting, and destruction of innocent people’s properties by malcontents acting out in the spotlight of televised anarchy. We are led to believe these occurrences are spontaneous events brought about largely by a racist and phobic society. We are allegedly getting what we deserve. In fact, these demonstrations are increasingly being fueled, organized, and funded to advance the “progressive” agenda espoused by Democrats and their allied media.

True, there is an undercurrent of anger in America, as in most societies. However, the gutter politics of the Democrats have intentionally stoked the fires of hatred while putting blame on Christians, Jews, and others who hold to traditional moral values.

These political arsonists are lighting fires of hatred, fear, and violence with little regard for public safety, and condoning their actions as justified—in effect, breeding insurrectionists ripe for recruitment by terrorists. Jails, prisons, gangs, and militant groups are ideal recruiting opportunities for radical Islamists. When the seeds of anarchy being deliberately sown reach the tipping point, authorities will respond in ways that will exacerbate tension points.

Peaceful demonstrations to voice disagreement with government policy is as American as our flag. We have the right to gather and voice our opinions in public, albeit with consideration of laws and not to the detriment of innocents. The voice of reason is silenced when passions ignite the mob mentality. Since when is looting, physical assault, and destruction of others’ property a given right of society? When discontent turns to mindless and lawless rage, it becomes domestic terrorism. It cannot be tolerated by a civilized society.

Trump made two cabinet appointments that will prove to be exceptionally astute: James Mattis as secretary of Defense and John Kelly as director of Homeland Security. Both of these positions have historically been staffed by civilians with mixed results. We are facing a new conflict paradigm career politicians, military, and law enforcement public are not accustomed to dealing with. The lines of responsibility are blurred like never before.

Facing warfare by determined traditional enemies like nation states (Russia, China, etc.) is pretty well understood after centuries of conflict. The advent of terrorism changed the battlefield landscape. Loosely networked terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda and others who practice asymmetric warfare demanded new skill sets and strategies. Unfortunately, our response policy to such mixed threats has been wanting.

Is it a military or domestic insurrectionist policy that will drive strategy? Both. These two generals grasp the implications of both threats in a way that civilians do not. They share common experience with both forms of antagonists as well as shared doctrine experiences that bode well for an integrated and effective response.

With the triad of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and these two former Marines, marshaling military and domestic resources has a much greater chance of being effective without treading on one another’s turf. The terrorism of 9/11 blurred the lines between war and law enforcement, and exposed numerous cultural disconnects between law enforcement agencies themselves.

Mattis and Kelly are well suited to harnessing all of our security resources into a larger and better integrated terrorism strategy that balances resources while leveraging strengths and bolstering our weaknesses.

The Citizen’s Role in an Age of Anarchy and Terrorism

There is little the average citizen can do for personal safety beyond recognizing the threat environment and staying clear of demonstrations. The anarchy will escalate until authorities enforce limits and the response becomes further justification for the miscreants. You can rest assured that domestic terrorists will infiltrate the mobs and take the violence to new heights.

If domestic terrorism metastasizes, it is prudent to be aware of some common-sense guidelines I learned from Israeli terrorism officials and others:

Have enough food, fuel, water, and medications on hand for 7-10 days.

Have hand-held radios to communicate with family in case you get separated. In a significant national emergency, normal cell phone traffic will likely be disabled to facilitate emergency communications by authorities

Train yourself to be more alert about people and vehicles in your immediate area.

Learn to scan your area for objects out of the ordinary or people whose dress is unusual for the climate (a coat on a hot day—suicide bombers rarely wear their bomb vests outside).

Train yourself and your children not to approach abandoned packages, travel baggage, or anything else that is out of the ordinary. (Palestinians have planted bombs on bus benches, in toys, musical instruments and candy and food.)

Report people who make threats of violence, outwardly endorse terrorist acts, or otherwise advocate civil violence.

Be aware of your neighbors and their normal routines. Strangers coming and going at odd hours or transporting packages, odd smells from kitchens or garages, etc., are worth passing on to authorities.

Leave the area ASAP if there has been a bombing. Terrorists often have a second bomb intended for first responders or gathering crowds.

Stay clear of abandoned cars and trucks in unusual places, especially if a terrorism incident has occurred.

Do not enter damaged structures that have been bombed. Leave it to first responders.

If a terrorism event has happened, listen to your radio for emergency instructions.

In short, be more security conscious. Intelligence is an inexact science, and the smaller the plot or target the easier it is to stay under the radar.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/03/03/trump-will-tested-terrorists-tyrants-sooner-rather-later/,2017-03-03
Everything You Need To Know About Trump's New Executive Order,"The administration’s immigration policy is in the news again, this time with a revised immigration and refugee executive order, and mainstream media outlets are making sure everybody knows that the new order is pure evil.

However, as with the last iteration of this executive order, very little of the commentary seems based on its actual facts, which you can read here. Is it just the same old ban recycled? Did the administration completely walk back its entire policy? What actually happened?

In this article, I’ll walk you through the new order piece by piece, explaining how it’s different from the last one, which I also explained at The Federalist.

But before we get to the order’s text, we should take a second to consider how telling it is that a whole new order was released. Revoking the old order and issuing a new one, instead of fighting out the lawsuits for the old order, suggests that the administration expected to lose at least some of those lawsuits. It also suggests they listened to critics (like me) who suggested that revoke, revise, and replace was better than trying to stick to the old order.

This new executive order makes some important fixes that improve the administration’s refugee and immigration policy in notable ways. However, in at least one respect, it continues to betray the priorities of conservatives, perhaps even more than the initial order.

Administration Is Defensive About Country Selection

Evidently, my line of criticism suggesting that there was no rational tie between the countries selected struck a nerve somewhere in the administration. In this new order, they have provided 10 paragraphs of details about why they chose those seven initial countries.

However, methinks the administration doth protest too much. The new list of countries is cut to just six, and no longer specially restricts Iraq. It does still specially restrict Iran, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and Libya. Three reasons are given: “Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones.”

Syria, Iran, and Sudan fall under the “state sponsors of terror” heading, according to the state department. So a ban on those three as a group certainly has some rational ties if the administration believes state sponsors are likely to export terror, which seems perfectly reasonable to believe.

Next comes the “armed conflict” rationale. According to Wikipedia, four countries have ongoing armed conflicts with at least 10,000 fatalities in 2016: Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Mexico (the drug war). Of those, only Syria remains specially restricted. I’ll discuss Iraq more below.

Meanwhile, another 10 armed conflicts have had at least 1,000 casualties in 2016: Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, Cameroon, Niger, Chad, Libya, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, South Sudan, and Ethiopia. Again, of those, just Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen are targeted. So on the armed conflict front, we do get several of the banned countries… but lots of other countries too, many with far more severe conflicts.

Finally, we come to countries “significantly compromised by terrorist organizations.” No detail is given about what this means, and no country is specifically identified in the new order under that designation. However, the document the order cites does include a section about terrorist safe-havens. The State Department identifies Mali as being a terrorist safe haven, as well as the Philippines, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Colombia, and Venezuela. Again, several of these countries are on the list of restricted countries, but many more are not.

Thus, the exhaustive explanation given ultimately explains nothing. The executive order could be read to imply that banned countries meet these criteria and provide poor documentation on citizens: but that’s not the case for Iran, which is on the list, while poor-documenters like Mali, South Sudan, Chad, or Niger are not on the list.

In other words, while quite verbose, the reasoning provided does not explain why the six countries still under special restrictive status remain so. There may indeed be good reason for caution from these countries, but, if so, then undoubtedly the same holds for numerous other countries as well. If the administration has selected these six for mere expediency, triaging the most dangerous countries, then they should clarify their reasoning on why these countries are the most dangerous, when they are not demonstrably different from many other countries in terms of terrorism and active conflict.

The list is shorter now, which I’ll show below represents an improvement. But ultimately, on the “why were these countries chosen” front, the new order gives no additional clarity.

Iraqis Allowed Back In: 1(g) and 1(h)

Of course, one major change did occur: Iraq was dropped from the list. Here, the administration can count a success amid the general failure of the initial order. According to the new order, Iraq has made credible pledges to improve their domestic screening and to support stricter vetting. This is ultimately the end goal of the administration for every country on this list, so in Iraq we can see an example of what the administration hopes will happen everywhere: we’ll play rough with another country for a few weeks or months, then they’ll blink first and agree to support the implementation of stricter screening for visas, and help provide resources to do it. The mainstream media isn’t going to report the case of Iraq as a success. But if the new EO’s claims about Iraqi compliance are true, then it vindicates at least a small part of the original EO’s political strategy.

However, there is a concerning statement in this same section. Namely, “The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.” This is quite jarring. Not because refugees are perfect; they aren’t. Some refugees have indeed become terrorists, though the number is fairly small.

Rather, what’s jarring here is the presumption of guilt: if the FBI is doing its job correctly, then of course the number of investigations will be large. And the vast majority should be innocent. We don’t want the FBI only opening investigations after they’re sure of guilt! Claiming that this “300 investigations” number is meaningful would be deeply misguided, especially since over 1 million people admitted as refugees reside in the United States today.

It seems obvious, of course, why the number of investigations was cited rather than the number of convictions: the number of convictions is an unimpressively small number over the last decade (somewhere between 10 and 60 convictions; exact data is hard to come by).

Visa Control Better Managed This Time: 2(a) through 3(c)

The visa ban last time came suddenly, with no rules for exceptions, and its application was haphazard. First dual citizens were banned, then allowed. Permanent residents were banned, then allowed. The rules kept changing and hadn’t been properly thought out, and people with legally valid visas were denied entry. The new order is vastly better organized.

The new order delays implementation until later this month, allowing time for travel plans to be made by visa-holders, and for government agencies to make implementation plans. It also provides categorical exceptions, in addition to case-by-case powers granted to DHS. This is vital, and was one of my core criticisms of the initial order. The lack of categorical exceptions made the policy far too draconian and, ultimately, unenforceable. Now, categorical exceptions are made for refugees, diplomats, dual nationals, permanent residents, and existing visa-holders. It also allows back in anybody booted out under the old order, and explicitly acknowledges the right to asylum claims. It also provides illustrative examples of why case-by-case waivers might be granted: for students, for legitimate business activities, if a person resides with a U.S. citizen family member, for an infant or adopted child, or U.S. government employees, etc.

These changes are crucial. Essentially, instead of a total travel ban, the administration is saying they will only issue new visas to the six restricted countries under exceptional conditions. That is a monumental change in emphasis, and is well within the powers of the President. Basically, instead of the “default setting” for Iran being “we’ll issue a travel visa if we don’t find anything bad,” now it’s “we’ll only issue a travel visa if you have a specific reason to travel.” You can disagree with this policy or agree with it, but it’s light-years more reasonable, enforceable, and in keeping with American values than the former policy—and it’s far more reasonable than most media outlets are probably going to admit.

Priorities of Religious People Abandoned: 6(a) to 6(d)

However, while improvements were made to many sections related to visas and immigration, the new order’s section on refugees remains deeply saddening. The old executive order prioritized religious minorities while also banning all Syrian refugees forever, and banning all refugees from all countries for 120 days. The new order does not prioritize religious minorities, doesn’t ban Syrian refugees at all, but does still pause refugee admissions for 120 days.

First, let’s talk about improvements. The new order creates explicit permission for refugees already in transit or scheduled for admission to enter the country. That’s good, because otherwise you just get refugees who we’ve already promised to care for trapped in airports as we suddenly renege on our promise. If we’re a nation that keeps its promises, we can’t behave like that. So this administrative change is a real improvement.

Likewise, removing the blanket ban on Syrian refugees is a good thing even, if you support extreme vetting of Syrians. Some Syrians are deserving refugees who we want to allow in! Maybe not all, and certainly we want to be cautious, but nobody thinks “zero” is the right number of deserving Syrian refugees. With appropriately strict vetting, surely at least a few Syrians are legitimate refugees we want to accept.

Next, we can look at a change that probably doesn’t matter on its own: the religious preference is gone. The reality is that current U.S. law already prioritizes persecuted religions and religious minorities, as I’ve shown extensively elsewhere. Adding the religious preference in the old order really didn’t change U.S. law at all, so dropping it in the new one is no change either. It just doesn’t matter either way.

That is, on its own the religious preference didn’t matter. Combined with the rest of the order it may matter. In the old executive order, the religious preference appeared to be a special way that persecuted minorities could be let into the country despite the 120-day pause, maybe despite the 50,000 refugee cap. The case-by-case religious waiver was written fairly broadly, so its exact extent wasn’t clear, but it basically served as a tool to make the whole cap-and-pause system a bit more in keeping with American, and Christian, values.

But now? Now we’ve paused admissions for 120 days from March 16 (so until mid-June) with an option for further extension. We’ve still capped at 50,000 refugees total, and we’ve removed the one hint of a tool we had to aid our suffering brethren around the world. We have simply closed our doors to religious minorities, especially Christians, fleeing persecution. To reach just 50,000 admissions in this fiscal year, we will have to have one of the slowest paces of refugee admissions for the remaining months that we’ve ever had.

As I said in my discussion of the old executive order: reducing refugee admissions from Obama-era highs of around 110,000 may be reasonable. But cutting them to historically ungenerous levels adds nothing to American safety, while tarnishing our image.

What’s the Same In This New EO?

The rest of the order is essentially unchanged. The visa interview waiver program is suspended, creating hassle for repeat foreign travelers. Biometric exit tracking is expedited, which may improve security, but will create extra hassle for Americans leaving the country too. Countries with visa reciprocity are pressured to ensure they honor their agreements. None of these provisions are very controversial, and none changed substantively.

Some media outlets have raised concern about a section 5(g), which says “to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role…” in managing the refugee program. But concerns on that front seem misplaced, as this section is essentially unchanged from the original order, it explicitly recognizes the goal is to be achieved within existing law, and refugee programs as they exist today already include the buy-in of numerous state and local institutions.

The New EO Is Better, But Still Needs Fixing

The new executive order is better than the old one. First of all, it shows actual thought and competence. Important waivers, exceptions, delays, and administrative measures are included to ensure it runs smoothly and doesn’t break the law. The most draconian measures were removed, focusing attention on more clearly legal, achievable goals. Some initial objectives have already been achieved, like getting Iraq on board with tougher vetting. The blanket ban on Syrian immigrants was removed. These are all good changes that show the administration is listening to critics and incorporating feedback, a welcome trend that all Americans should want from their government.

However, key problems remain. We still have no real clarity, despite an exhausting wall-of-words, about why those specific countries were targeted. We still have a pause in refugee admissions without any good reason for it. We still have no clarity on how vetting procedures are going to be improved. We still have an incredibly low refugee admission cap out of line with traditional American values.

The administration has made real progress improving one of their flagship policy initiatives. They should keep making progress by raising the refugee cap to a more reasonable figure (maybe 70,000 or 80,000—still 30,000 below President Obama), explaining more clearly why they chose the countries they did and not other countries, and by continuing active refugee processing efforts even while they improve vetting. These changes won’t meaningfully endanger Americans. They will make programmatic goals easier to implement, will shield the administration from some ongoing criticism, and will show their continued commitment to aggressively promoting America’s traditional role as leader of the free world: first in war and, as the millions of refugees we have housed will acknowledge, first in peace.

Why It's Dumb To Let Americans Sue Foreign Governments For Terrorism,"Whenever a private American citizen talks to someone in a foreign government—as Gen. Michael Flynn was accused of doing before his resignation as national security advisor—political adversaries start tossing around the accusation that the conversation violated the Logan Act. That makes for good headlines, but the real danger in foreign policy is not people playing diplomat, but plaintiffs dragging the courts into their personal issues with foreign governments.

The Logan Act, enacted in 1799 and never enforced, purports to make it a crime for an American citizen to attempt to influence a foreign government without our government approving of it. It was passed because Congress was annoyed at George Logan, a pacifist who was trying to better relations with Revolutionary France, and it is generally considered unconstitutional. But that will not stop politicians and pundits from throwing it around in the continuing and bipartisan effort to make political opposition criminal.

It may be petty and vindictive to want to jail people for visiting foreign leaders, as Nancy Pelosi famously did when she met with Bashar al-Assad in 2007, but it hints at an understandable policy: that only the executive branch should conduct the foreign policy of the United States. The Constitution grants the executive those powers. As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Curtiss-Wright in 1936, “In this vast external realm, with its important, complicated, delicate and manifold problems, the President alone has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation.”

Commandeering Courts Into Personal Politics

The larger problem today is not congressmen or pacifists conducting foreign policy on their own hook, it is private citizens using the court system to make their own private diplomatic statements. The problem began in the 1980s when activists unearthed another obscure eighteenth-century statute, the Alien Tort Claims Act (ACTA,) and used it to sue foreign governments for offenses committed in foreign countries against their own citizens because the acts were deemed to be against international law.

International crimes when ACTA was written were essentially restricted to piracy and mistreatment of ambassadors, but after World War II the list grew to include many other things deemed offenses against all mankind (in the first modern ATCA case, Filártiga v. Peña-Irala, the crime alleged was torture by the government of Paraguay).

In the 2004 case of Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, the Supreme Court reigned in the scope of ATCA, but many people (and their lawyers) still wanted to use the courts to mete out justice when they thought the federal government’s diplomatic arm was not acting quickly or strongly enough. Congress agreed, and in 2016 helped to more thoroughly mangle this already twisted area of law by passing the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA).

Congress acquiesced in the idea, held by many populists on both the Left and the Right, that our government is treating Saudi Arabia too well, and they have not been properly punished for their role in the September 11 terrorist attacks. What that role is, exactly, is a matter of debate depending on how many conspiracy theories you believe.

We know for a fact that the majority of the hijackers in that attack were Saudi citizens, but lack certainty about any greater nexus between that government and its terrorist sons. It is generally held in certain corners of the Internet fever swamps, however, that the Saudi kingdom’s involvement goes much deeper, despite the 9/11 Commission’s findings to the contrary.

Victims’ lawsuits against the Saudi government had failed in the past, because the law at the time held that Americans could only sue a foreign government for damages caused by terror attacks if the State Department listed that government as a state sponsor of terrorism. That list currently includes just three nations: Iran, Sudan, and Syria; Saudi Arabia has never been on it.

The State Department, whether run by Republicans or Democrats, has found no evidence that would require such a designation, but the absence of evidence only fuels belief in a conspiracy theory, and the demand for a lawsuit—helped, not incidentally, by Saudis’ vast wealth that makes them a juicy target—continued unabated. Election years often make for bad legislation, and 2016 was no exception.

Deserved Pity Shouldn’t Bestow Special Legal Privileges

As the American Lawyer reported in December, senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain proposed an amendment to the pending bill that would have confined liability to governments that “knowingly” engage with a terrorist organization, but their fellow senators rejected it. Congress feared being on the wrong side of 9/11 victims and their relatives, a group that has (and deserves) the public’s sympathy, so it caved and passed JASTA by voice votes in both houses. After President Obama wisely vetoed it, Congress overrode the veto by overwhelming margins, because voting against 9/11 widows is the stuff negative campaign ads are made of, and this ill-considered bill became a law.

The unintended consequences began almost immediately. As Britain Eakin reported for Courthouse News earlier this month, anti-Israel activists are using JASTA to sue that government, claiming that Israel has committed war crimes, genocide, and ethnic cleansing against Arabs in the West Bank (the case is Peled et al. v. Netanyahu, filed in federal district court in DC). The complaint strings together the usual anti-Israel conspiracy theories to form a legal theory with far too weak a connection to permit American courts to adjudicate it. Or, that would have been the case until JASTA. Now, any radical’s claims against foreign enemies real or imagined are serious enough to get into court, if not to win the case.

Interactions between governments should be conducted carefully and in ways those governments have approved. With JASTA, Congress has allowed any citizen who can afford the filing fees to bring the weight of the judicial branch into his arguments with foreign sovereigns. That this would be misused was entirely predictable. Congress should work to fix its mistake before it is too late.

Political Islam Is Today’s ‘Long March Through The Institutions’,"The following is an excerpt of the Hoover Institution publication “The Challenge of Dawa: Political Islam as Ideology and Movement and How to Counter It,” by Ayaan Hirsi Ali. You may read the full report here. ​ This excerpt was originally published in Defining Ideas. ​Copyright © 2017 by the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University.

It is refreshing and heartening that President Trump acknowledges the need for an ideological campaign against “radical Islam.” This deserves to be called a paradigm shift.

President Bush often referred to a “war on terror,” but terror is a tactic that can be used for a variety of ideological objectives. President Obama stated that he was opposed to “violent extremism” and even organized an international summit around this subject. Yet at times he made it seem as if he worried more about “Islamophobia” than about radical Islam.

In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in 2012, Obama declared: “The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.” In what follows, however, I shall refer to “political Islam” rather than radical Islam.

Political Islam is not just a religion as most Western citizens recognize the term “religion,” a faith; it is also a political ideology, a legal order, and in many ways also a military doctrine associated with the campaigns of the Prophet Muhammad. Political Islam rejects any kind of distinction between religion and politics, mosque and state. Political Islam even rejects the modern state in favor of a caliphate. My central argument is that political Islam implies a constitutional order fundamentally incompatible with the U.S. Constitution and with the “constitution of liberty” that is the foundation of the American way of life.

Yes, Islamists Have Everything to Do with Islam

There is no point in denying that political Islam as an ideology has its foundation in Islamic doctrine. However, “Islam,” “Islamism,” and “Muslims” are distinct concepts. Not all Muslims are Islamists, let alone violent, but all Islamists—including those who use violence—are Muslims. I believe the religion of Islam itself is indeed capable of reformation, if only to distinguish it more clearly from the political ideology of Islamism. But that task of reform can only be carried out by Muslims.

Insisting that radical Islamists have “nothing to do with Islam” has led U.S. policy makers to commit numerous strategic errors since 9/11. One is to distinguish between a “tiny” group of extremists and an “overwhelming” majority of “moderate” Muslims. I prefer to differentiate among Medina Muslims, who embrace the militant political ideology adopted by Muhammad in Medina; Mecca Muslims, who prefer the religion originally promoted by Muhammad in Mecca; and reformers, who are open to some kind of Muslim Reformation.

These distinctions have their origins in history. The formative period of Islam can be divided roughly into two phases: the spiritual phase, associated with Mecca, and the political phase that followed Muhammad’s move to Medina. There is a substantial difference between Qur’anic verses revealed in Mecca (largely spiritual in nature) and Qur’anic verses revealed in Medina (more political and even militaristic). There is also a difference in the behavior of the Prophet Muhammad: in Mecca, he was a spiritual preacher, but in Medina he became a political and military figure.

It cannot be said often enough that the United States is not at war with Islam or with Muslims. It is, however, bound to resist the political aspirations of Medina Muslims where those pose a direct threat to our civil and political liberties. It is also bound to ensure that Mecca Muslims and reforming Muslims enjoy the same protections as members of other religious communities who accept the fundamental principles of a free society. That includes protection from the tactics of intimidation that are so central to the ideology and practice of political Islam.

Background on Today’s State of Affairs

The conflict between the United States and political Islam in modern times dates back to at least 1979, when the U.S. embassy in Tehran was seized by Islamic revolutionaries and 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days. In the decades that followed, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania reminded Americans of the threat posed by political Islam.

But it was not until the 9/11 attacks that political Islam as an ideology attracted sustained public attention. The September 11, 2001, attacks were inspired by a political ideology that has its foundation in Islam, specifically its formative period in Medina.

Since 9/11, at least $1.7 trillion has been spent on combat and reconstruction costs in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The total budgetary cost of the wars and homeland security from 2001 through 2016 is more than $3.6 trillion. Yet in spite of the sacrifices of more than 5,000 armed service personnel who have lost their lives since 9/11 and the tens of thousands of American soldiers who have been wounded, today political Islam is on the rise around the world.

Violence is the most obvious—but not the only—manifestation of this trend. Jihadist groups have proliferated all over the Middle East and North Africa, especially where states are weak and civil wars rage (Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and Syria, not forgetting northern Nigeria). Islam-inspired terrorists also have a global reach. France is in a permanent state of emergency, while the United States has been profoundly shaken by terror attacks in Boston (the Marathon bombers); Fort Hood, Texas; San Bernardino, California; Orlando, Florida; and Ohio State University, to name but a few.

Of the last 16 years, the worst year for terrorism was 2014, with 93 countries experiencing attacks and 32,765 people killed. The second worst was 2015, with 29,376 deaths. Last year, four radical Islamic groups were responsible for 74 percent of all deaths from terrorism: the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), Boko Haram, the Taliban, and al-Qaeda. Although the Muslim world itself bears the heaviest burden of jihadist violence, the West is increasingly under attack.

How large is the jihadist movement in the world? In Pakistan alone, where the population is almost entirely Muslim, 13 percent of Muslims surveyed—more than 20 million people—said that bombings and other forms of violence against civilian targets are often or sometimes justified in order to defend Islam from its enemies.

Disturbingly, the number of Western-born Muslim jihadists is sharply increasing. The United Nations estimated in November 2014 that some 15,000 foreign fighters from at least 80 nations have traveled to Syria to join the radical jihadists. Roughly a quarter of them come from Western Europe.

Yet the advance of political Islam manifests itself not only in acts of violence. Even as billions are spent on military intervention and drone strikes, the ideological infrastructure of political Islam in the United States continues to grow because officials are concerned only with criminal conspiracies to commit acts of violence, not with the ideology that inspires such acts.

According to one estimate, 10−15 percent of the world’s Muslims are Islamists. Out of well more than 1.6 billion, or 23 percent of the globe’s population, that implies more than 160 million individuals. Based on survey data on attitudes toward sharia in Muslim countries, total support for Islamist activities in the world is likely significantly higher than that estimate.

What Scholarship on Political Islam Says

There are two sets of academic literature aimed at helping policy makers grapple with the threat of radical Islam. In the first set, Islamic religious ideas form a marginal factor at best. Authors such as John Esposito, Marc Sageman, Hatem Bazian, and Karen Armstrong argue that a combination of variables such as poverty and corrupt political governance lies at the root of Islamic violence. They urge the U.S. government and its allies to tackle these “root causes.”

The ideology underlying Islamist violence must be tackled if our efforts are to be successful.

For these authors, devoting attention to religious motives is at best irrelevant, and at worst a harmful distraction. They are not concerned about political Islam as an ideology, only about individual acts of violence committed in its name.

A second set of scholars—which is growing in importance—sees a radical ideology derived from Islamic theology, principles, and concepts as the driving force of our current predicament. Scholars such as Michael Cook, Daniel Pipes, Jeffrey Bale, and David Cook, and authors such as Paul Berman and Graeme Wood, acknowledge that factors such as poverty and bad governance are relevant, but argue that U.S. policy makers should take seriously the religious ideology that underlies Islamist violence.

The failed polices since 9/11 (and even before) in the struggle against radical Islam were built on false premises derived from the first set of literature, which absolves Islam wholly of the atrocities that it inspires. As the failure of American strategy since 2001 has become increasingly clear, however, the view has gained ground that the ideology underlying Islamist violence must be tackled if our efforts are to be successful.

This view is not only held by a few Western scholars. All over the world, there are now Muslims who are engaged in a long-overdue process of reassessing Islamic thought, scripture, and laws with a view to reforming them. These Muslim reformers can be found in positions of leadership in some governments, in universities, in the press, and elsewhere. They are our natural allies. An important part of our future policies in the war on Islamic extremism should be to encourage and empower them.

It’s Time to Understand Dawa

From 9/11 until now, the dominant Western response to political Islam has been to focus only on “terror” and “violent extremism.” This approach has failed. In focusing only on acts of violence, we have ignored the ideology that justifies, promotes, celebrates, and encourages those acts. By not fighting a war of ideas against political Islam (or “Islamism”) as an ideology and against those who spread that ideology, we have made a grave error.

In focusing only on acts of violence, we have ignored the ideology that justifies, promotes, celebrates, and encourages those acts.

If Islamism is the ideology, then dawa encompasses all the methods by which it is spread. The term “dawa” refers to activities carried out by Islamists to win adherents and enlist them in a campaign to impose sharia law on all societies. Dawa is not the Islamic equivalent of religious proselytizing, although it is often disguised as such by blending humanitarian activities with subversive political activities.

Dawa as practiced by Islamists employs a wide range of mechanisms to advance the goal of imposing Islamic law (sharia) on society. This includes proselytization, but extends beyond that. In Western countries, dawa aims both to convert non-Muslims to political Islam and to bring about more extreme views among existing Muslims. The ultimate goal of dawa is to destroy the political institutions of a free society and replace them with strict sharia. Islamists rely on both violent and nonviolent means to achieve their objectives.

Dawa is to the Islamists of today what the “long march through the institutions” was to twentieth-century Marxists. It is subversion from within, the use of religious freedom in order to undermine that very freedom. After Islamists gain power, dawa is to them what Gleichschaltung (synchronization) of all aspects of German state, civil, and social institutions was to the National Socialists.

There are of course differences. The biggest difference is that dawa is rooted in the Islamic practice of attempting to convert non-Muslims to accept the message of Islam. As it is an ostensibly religious missionary activity, proponents of dawa enjoy a much greater protection by the law in free societies than Marxists or fascists did in the past.

Worse, Islamist groups have enjoyed not just protection but at times official sponsorship from government agencies duped into regarding them as representatives of “moderate Muslims” simply because they do not engage in violence. Islamist groups that have been treated in this way include:

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)

The Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC)

The Islamic Society of North America (ISNA)

The International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT)

The Islamic Society of Boston

For organizations engaging in dawa, the main elements of the strategy are:

to have well-organized Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood claim to speak on behalf of all Muslims, while marginalizing Muslim reformers and dissidents.

to take ownership of immigration trends to encourage the “Islamization” of Western societies by invoking hijra, the emigration of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina.

to reduce women to the status of reproductive machines for the purpose of demographic transformation.

to take advantage of the focus on “inclusion” by progressive political parties in democratic societies, then to force these parties to accept Islamist demands in the name of peaceful coexistence.

to take advantage of self-consciously progressive movements, effectively co-opting them.

to increase Islamists’ hold over the educational system, including some charter schools, “faith” schools, and home schooling.

Typically, Islamists study target societies to identify points of vulnerability. In the United States, Islamists focus on vulnerable African-American men within prison populations, as well as Hispanic and Native American communities. Recent targets of Islamist infiltration include the Women’s March and Black Lives Matter.

Agents of dawa also systematically lobby private-sector organizations, governments, and international bodies:

They seek to pressure governments to accede to Islamist demands on the grounds of freedom of religion or status as a religious minority.

They urge the United Nations and the European Council to combat “Islamophobia” by devising what amounts to censorship guidelines for politicians and journalists and by punishing those who dissent.

They press institutions such as the Associated Press to distort the language they use to suit Islamist objectives.

They wage sustained campaigns to discredit critics of radical Islam.

The Sinews of Dawa

The global infrastructure of dawa is well funded, persistent, and resilient. From 1973 through 2002, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia spent an estimated $87 billion to promote dawa efforts abroad. Josh Martin estimates that, since the early 1970s, Middle Eastern charities have distributed $110 billion, $40 billion of which found its way to sub-Saharan Africa and contributed heavily to Islamist ideological indoctrination there.

Nongovernmental organizations in Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia continue to distribute large sums overseas to finance ideological indoctrination and activities. Powerful foundations such as the Qatar Foundation continue to grant financial support and legitimacy to radical Islamic ideology around the world.

Many Islamic charitable foundations use zakat (mandatory charity) funds to mix humanitarian outreach with ideological indoctrination, laying the ground for future intolerance, misogyny, and jihad, even if no violence is used in the short term. When informal funding mechanisms are included, the zakat funds available could reach “hundreds of billions of dollars” worldwide each year.

The Key Problem Is Using Our Freedoms to End Them

Let it be said explicitly: The Islamists’ program is fundamentally incompatible with the U.S. Constitution, religious tolerance, the equality of men and women, the tolerance of different sexual orientations, and other fundamental human rights.

The biggest challenge the United States faces in combating political Islam, however, is the extent to which agents of dawa can exploit the constitutional and legal protections that guarantee American citizens freedom of religion and freedom of speech—freedoms that would of course be swept away if the Islamists achieved their goals.

We ignore at our peril the ideological infrastructure that supports political Islam in both its violent and its nonviolent forms.

In 2010, one senior American intelligence analyst summed up our predicament: “In the US there are First Amendment issues we’re cognizant of. It’s not a crime to radicalize, only when it turns to violence . . . America is thus vulnerable to a threat that is not only diversifying, but arguably intensifying.”

To give just one example: A cleric in Maryland, Imam Suleiman Bengharsa, has openly endorsed the Islamic State, posted gruesome videos, and praised terrorist attacks overseas. As of February 2017, however, he remains a free man and U.S. authorities insist nothing can be done against him because he has not yet plotted to commit a specific act of violence. One expert has said that Imam Bengharsa “can take his supporters right up to the line. It’s like making a cake and not putting in the final ingredient. It’s winks and nods all the way.” This is what we are up against.

The global constitution of political Islam is formidable. The Muslim Brotherhood, with its numerous American affiliates, is an important component, but not the only one. Even if one were able to eliminate the Brotherhood overnight, the ideological infrastructure of dawa would remain powerful. The network of radical Islamist preachers, “charities,” and organizations that perpetuate political Islam is already well established inside and outside the United States.

To resist the insidious advance of political Islam, we need to develop a strategy to counter not only those who use violence to advance their politico-religious objectives—the jihadists—but also the great and complex ideological infrastructure known as dawa, just as we countered both the Red Army and the ideology of communism in the Cold War. Focusing only on “terror” as a tactic is insufficient. We ignore at our peril the ideological infrastructure that supports political Islam in both its violent and its nonviolent forms.

It is not just that jihad is an extension of dawa; according to some observers, it is dawa by other means. Put differently, nonviolent and violent Islamists differ only on tactics; they share the same goal, which is to establish an unfree society ruled by strict sharia law. Institutionally, nonviolent Islamists have benefited from terror attacks committed by jihadists because such attacks make nonviolent Islamists appear moderate in the eyes of Western governments, even when their goals and values are not. This is known as the “positive radical flank effect. Ian Johnson, a writer for the Wall Street Journal, observed:

Al Qaeda was the best thing to happen to these [Islamist] groups. Nowadays, our bar is so low that if groups aren’t Al Qaeda, we’re happy. If they’re not overtly supporting terrorism, we think they’re okay. We don’t stop to think where the terrorism comes from, where the fish swim.

Dawa must therefore be countered as much as jihad.

Yet, as things stand, dawa cannot be countered. Its agents hide behind constitutional protections they would dismantle unhesitatingly were they in power. In 2017, Congress must therefore give the president the tools he needs to dismantle the infrastructure of dawa in the United States and to counter the spread of political Islam at home and abroad.

Its agents hide behind constitutional protections they would dismantle unhesitatingly were they in power.

While recognizing that our freedoms are sacrosanct, we must also remember the wise words of Karl Popper, who memorably identified what he called “the paradox of tolerance,” namely that “unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance.”

If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise.

But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.

We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.

'Homeland' Actor: The Real 'Guilty Ones' This Season Are White Men,"“Homeland’s” season six finale will air on Sunday night. If you’re like me, at this point you couldn’t care less. That’s because the show has taken such a sudden turn toward political preaching and progressive tut-tutting that its story and characters barely resemble those of the previous five seasons. If you’ve been wondering what on earth happened, wonder no more.

On Thursday, the actor who plays Saul Berenson, Mandy Patinkin, explained everything on NPR. In an interview with “Here & Now’s” Jeremy Hobson, Patinkin discusses past accusations that the show is Islamophobic. He says that although the “Homeland” crew never meant to be Islamophobic, and certainly didn’t expect that kind of criticism, it is nevertheless true. According to him, the show became “part of the problem of the Islamophobia.”

He goes on to explain that the whole point of this season was to stop being the problem and start “trying to be part of the cure,” something Patinkin feels they were “tremendously successful” in doing. Patinkin, who is active in assisting with the Syrian refugee crisis in Greece, added that the “guilty ones” are “certainly not the Muslim community, certainly not the refugees or the immigrants that have come here, but the white male membership of, even members of the intelligence community and other parts of our government.”

So, there it is. “Homeland’s” monumental shift in narrative and tone this season wasn’t an accident. It was a 100 percent intentional effort to atone for the show’s previous sins. But the self-flagellation is so heavy handed, and such a departure from previous seasons, that it’s jarring for the viewer. It’s also boring.

Political Correctness Is Boring

Part of what made the first five seasons of “Homeland” so entertaining is that they were unconstrained by political correctness. They were at liberty to craft the most compelling terrorism-espionage story they could dream up. The main characters, Carrie Mathison (played by Clare Danes) and Saul, were realists about the dangers of the world, about who’s an enemy and who’s a friend—even if they weren’t always right. But season six is an exercise in pure political correctness.

Carrie has become a civil rights activist. She has renounced her previous views about terrorism, most notably that Muslims are ever terrorists. The show implies that prior to this season, she had been a racist and is now trying to right those wrongs to atone for her past sins. (By the way, this suggests that you’re a racist, too, for enjoying those seasons.)

Not only is the young Muslim-American in the show, Sekou Bah, not a terrorist, the real conspiracy is run by the white male CIA agent, Dar Adal, who is trying to make it look like Sekou blew up a truck in New York City. With the help of Mossad, Dar is also trying to convince the new president-elect that Iran is breaking the nuclear deal, which of course they’re not. Oh, and in case you weren’t getting the message, one episode features Saul visiting his sister in a West Bank settlement, which affords him a pulpit from which to preach on the evils of Israeli settlements.

Politicization Destroys Art And Entertainment

Political propaganda makes for terrible entertainment. High-quality television of the sort we’ve come to expect from Showtime is supposed to present its viewers with a compelling narrative, not scold them over their supposed beliefs and concerns. That is not why most people watch television. They watch it to be entertained.

Actors want to believe they are somehow the heroes of our culture. Patinkin said in his NPR interview that the “system of false information and truth that has seemed to take over the focus of the show is so horrifyingly important to bear witness to.” Actors tend to think they are the only ones with the knowledge and power to speak the truth about the injustices in our country and the world at large, that they are our last great hope.

But they aren’t. They are entertainers and, much more rarely, artists. An entertainer’s job is to entertain, not to preach. An artist’s job is to tell us something compelling about what it means to be human, not spew political propaganda. I’m not arguing the previous seasons of “Homeland” rose to the level of art. But for the most part they were supremely entertaining. On occasion they brought to life certain struggles of being human, mostly in depicting Carrie’s battle with mental illness and the constant strain of being in the intelligence business.

That doesn’t mean you can’t create art that also draws attention to tragic events in history or the present day. But when your first priority is politics, it will inevitably lead neither to entertainment nor art.

If ‘Homeland’ Wanted to Criticize, It Had Better Options

One could argue that the past five seasons of “Homeland” have to some extent reflected events that were happening in real life and this season is doing no different. One episode even shows crowds of protestors chanting, “Not my president!”

But the writers could just as easily have centered the show on the coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq, or the complicated intersection between combatting ISIS in Syria and navigating the Syrian civil war with all its factions. They could have concentrated on Bashar Assad and chemical weapons. They could have focused on Russian meddling.

If they really wanted the Iran deal in there, the season could have been about how Iran has been breaking the nuclear deal rather than weaving a fantastical conspiracy between Mossad and the U.S. intelligence community to make the president-elect think Iran has been breaking the deal to push the incoming president to be more hawkish. But they didn’t. They consistently and intentionally drove the narrative toward a progressive political agenda, and it made the show almost unwatchable.

To be sure, there’s plenty to criticize about the U.S. government and the intelligence community. Previous seasons of “Homeland” have been peppered with censure of both, and it flowed with the show’s story and the world it created for viewers. But to take a show like “Homeland,” which is supposed to be about terrorism and espionage, and have it conform almost entirely to progressive talking points is awkward and jarring.

Go ahead and make a series that’s entirely about criticizing the white patriarchy in government. I’m sure it will do really well. But leave it out of a show that has been, up until this dismal season six, almost entirely about Islamist terrorism.

And let’s be clear: the argument against “Homeland” season six isn’t that Muslim-Americans are all terrorists and that’s what the show should be focusing on. Not at all. But by trying to right what the show’s producers see as a grave social sin, they’re asking viewers to recant ever having thought there was a connection between global terrorism and Islam, and to regret ever having watched their show in the first place. On the second count, I think they’re succeeding.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/04/07/homeland-actor-real-guilty-ones-season-white-men-not-islamic-terrorists/,2017-04-07
How The Champs-Élysées Attack Affects The French Presidential Election,"Last night in Paris, at least one gunman got out of a car at the Champs-Élysées and opened fire on police with an AK-47 assault rifle, killing one officer and injuring two others. The gunman was shot dead at the scene and police have issued a warrant for a second man who reportedly arrived in Paris from Belgium. ISIS claimed responsibility in record time—two and a half hours.

These kinds of small-scale terror attacks are, sadly, becoming commonplace in Europe, and to some extent also here in the United States. But what makes this one extraordinary is that it occurred just three days before France’s highly competitive presidential election—and just two days after a terror plot was broken up in Marseilles, with police seizing guns and bomb-making materials, and arresting two radicalized French nationals.

The top four presidential candidates are all within a stone’s throw of one another, and it’s anyone’s guess which two will make it to the second round of voting. But one thing is fairly certain: the Thursday night terrorist attack will benefit only one candidate—Marine Le Pen.

Nobody Wants This to Be the New Normal

The shooting took place while the 11 presidential candidates were on a French television special, giving them the opportunity to make statements on the spot. Independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, who leads Le Pen and her National Front party in the most recent polls by a razor-thin margin, sent his condolences and said the job of a president is to protect the country. But he also said, somewhat incredibly, that these kinds of attacks will be a regular occurrence in the coming years.

Macron might be right about that, and it’s probably the most realistic response, but it won’t play well with French voters. What voter wants to hear his potential president essentially respond to a terrorist attack with “Get used to it”?

Le Pen, on the other hand, said the “nightmare is beginning once again” but that she doesn’t “want to tell our children to get used to living with terrorism.” According to Le Pen, “permissiveness and naiveté are finished.”

Compared to Macron’s defeatist-realist statement, Le Pen could come out looking like the strong national leader France needs, even if voters find many of her views disagreeable. After all, fear for one’s safety or the safety of one’s country can have a strong influence on voters.

In addition, the attack fits nicely into Le Pen’s campaign narrative. She has been openly critical about Muslims in France, and claims to promote “true” French values and patrimony. She rails against the lack of assimilation in the Muslim community (not without reason), and much of her campaign platform is focused on immigration and national security.

Is Doubling Down on French Identity Helpful?

This attack might therefore give her the extra bump she’s been hoping for to ensure her a spot in round two of voting. Yet there is little to suggest that Le Pen’s policies would ameliorate the country’s Islamist problem. And have no doubt, France does have a problem on its hands.

But Le Pen’s approach will almost definitely alienate the French-Muslim community further. She will widen the divide by promoting the culture of the “Français de souche,” a contentious term for French citizens whose family lines goes back generations, and denigrating the nouveau français, or immigrants.

Of course, Le Pen’s plan to shut down immigration will not improve French security, given that the overwhelming majority of terrorist attacks in Europe (and the United States) are perpetrated by the children of immigrants, not immigrants themselves.

Why Islamists Might Want Le Pen In Power

There’s good reason to believe ISIS was involved in planning, not just inspiring, Thursday’s attack, considering the swiftness with which it claimed responsibility, and the fact that the terror group knew the attacker’s name. But given Le Pen’s strong rhetoric against ISIS and Islam in France, why would the Islamic State plan two attacks in one week, knowing full well that it would benefit Le Pen alone among the candidates?

One possibility, as elaborate as it may sound, is that if Islamists want to keep French Muslims from integrating into French society and encourage them to resist through violence, it would be in their best interest to have Le Pen in power. A Le Pen presidency would give the Islamic State the narrative they need to radicalize a very susceptible French Muslim community.

As we know, ISIS is incredibly media-savvy. It strains credulity that two attacks were planned for the week before the election with just enough time for the media to really dig into them but not enough time for them to fade from voters’ memories. The timing doesn’t seem like coincidence.

It’s hard not to think that the men arrested in Marseilles, or whoever helped them plan, knew full well the result a terror attack could produce in Sunday’s elections. When police prevented the well-planned plot, the terror cell, with or without direction from ISIS, went to Plan B—a man with a machine gun on the Champs-Élysées.

Regardless of how Thursday’s attack came to pass, it will almost certainly help Le Pen in Sunday’s election. But it will hurt future prospects of quelling the tensions between France and its Muslim community, or of stifling Islamist influence in those communities—something that was never going to be easy in the first place.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/04/21/champs-elysees-attack-affects-french-presidential-election/,2017-04-21
"No, Efforts To Designate The Muslim Brotherhood Aren’t Abandoned","If we are to believe media reports, the Trump administration has all but abandoned efforts to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. While Brookings scholar Shadi Hamid trumpeted that “American experts who study the Muslim Brotherhood unanimously oppose their designation,” a wide range of opinion on the Islamist group remains, both inside and outside the Beltway.

In fact, a diverse range of voices favors Washington puting the squeeze on the Muslim Brotherhood, even if there are debates about to how to move forward in the most effective manner. Former Ambassador Dennis Ross, co-author of a leading work on the Brotherhood’s Palestinian branch, the terrorist group Hamas, recently wrote a stinging article targeting the tiny gulf state of Qatar for its role in financing the group. Ross notes,

Few countries have done more to promote the Muslim Brotherhood, including its Palestinian offshoot Hamas, than Qatar. The actions of the Muslim Brotherhood may vary from country to country, but it rationalizes attacks against American forces and interests, rejects the very concept of peace with Israel, and promotes religious intolerance.

Just so. While Ross doesn’t explicitly call for designating the group as a terrorist organization, he does poke holes in the view—prevalent during the Obama administration—that the Brotherhood represents a bulwark against Islamic terrorism rather than a network of support for it. That flawed approach has been the basis for much of the immense bureaucratic opposition from both the Central Intelligence Agency and State Department to designating the Brotherhood.

We’re Already Halfway There

Soon after Trump’s victory late last year, State Department and CIA memos opposing designation were leaked to sympathetic media, and fed into a fierce public relations campaign the Brotherhood funded abroad. An echo chamber of validators amplified these efforts, using self-proclaimed Islamist and counterterror experts whose think tanks receive lavish funding from Gulf States like Qatar.

Yet designating the Brotherhood enjoys a base of broad support among Republicans, from conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz to traditional centrists likes Utah’s Sen. Orrin Hatch, and even a handful of Democrats. Some foreign governments have also supported a designation, including the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.

Indeed, elements of the Muslim Brotherhood have already been designated. The effort began in 1993, when President Bill Clinton designated its Palestinian branch—better known as Hamas—as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Then, almost immediately following 9/11, U.S. counterterrorism efforts against the Muslim Brotherhood began in earnest. By the end of President Bush’s second term, numerous Brotherhood charities and organizations, both foreign and domestic, had been designated, and others criminally prosecuted for terrorism activity.

Additionally, a number of Brotherhood leaders were personally designated, including Yemeni Brotherhood leader Abdul Majeed Al-Zindani and one of the leaders of the International Muslim Brotherhood organization, Youssef Nada. Most of these designations took place without invoking the Brotherhood’s name, but they were still intentional blows to the group’s terror support network. While the Obama administration reversed some of these designations, others remain.

What the Trump Administration Should Do

Any effective policy to combat the Muslim Brotherhood would involve freeing the Treasury Department to once against begin designating and sanctioning the Muslim Brothers and their various front organizations and branches for terrorism finance and their other illegal activities.

This step can be taken as soon as key nominees are confirmed, a process that Democratic Senators have unfortunately slowed to a crawl. Just this week, Sen. Ron Wyden announced he would block the nomination of Sigal Mandelker to be undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence.

In addition to Treasury enforcement action, knowledgeable federal law enforcement officers within the government recognize the nature and threat of the Muslim Brotherhood. These officers investigated Muslim Brotherhood-related cases during the Bush administration, and they understand the role the Muslim Brotherhood plays in terrorism and terror finance.

This includes agents who have dedicated nearly a lifetime of federal service to investigating the Brotherhood’s terror connections. Unfortunately, the Obama administration broke up the taskforce that won key counterterrorism convictions against Brotherhood leaders, meaning some of America’s best experts on the Muslim Brotherhood have been relegated to other tasks. Restoring this taskforce for federal law enforcement is a necessary step, and could be accomplished by the Trump Department of Justice with a modicum of effort.

Perhaps most importantly, the public debate around designating the Muslim Brotherhood deserves transparency. A tranche of Brotherhood documents federal law enforcement captured, while reportedly not classified, have not been made available to the general public. They should be released immediately.

Additionally, the nature of the U.S. government’s policy towards Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood over the past decade deserves clarification. Presidential Study Directive-11, which reportedly deals with U.S. policy towards Islamist movements in the Middle East, and its associated documents should be declassified and made available for examination. Former House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Pete Hokstra made this argument at a hearing in September last year.

As with the documents taken during the raid on Abbottabad when Osama bin Laden was killed, and the so-called “side deals” of the Iran deal, these documents also deserve to see light of day so a reasoned debate can begin over how the U.S. government should best respond to the threat the Muslim Brotherhood poses. These are all actions the Trump administration can begin immediately.

Finally, a role for Congress remains in this debate. Thanks to the leadership of Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and Cruz, legislation on designation remains before both the House and Senate. Hearings on the Muslim Brotherhood, its role in supporting terrorism, and U.S. policy towards the group are all not only appropriate, but well overdue as a companion to White House efforts.

It’s inaccurate to say no support exists for designating the Muslim Brotherhood, but it is fair to say the window for a successful effort is closing fast. If the Trump administration intends to keep this important part of their broader platform to make America safe again, they need to move swiftly.

Trump Tells Muslim World To Stop Enabling Terrorism,"President Trump kicked off his first presidential trip abroad by visiting Saudi Arabia, where he gave a speech Sunday to leaders from 50 Muslim countries about his vision for U.S.-Muslim relations. Trump is the only U.S. president to visit the Middle East on his first official trip overseas, and he used the occasion to talk about the great civilizational achievements of the Muslim world and the ways terrorism and Islamic radicalism have obstructed economic growth and prosperity in the region.

Then, he confronted these leaders with strong words about the unacceptability of coexisting with the violence radicalism brings: “There can be no tolerating it, no accepting it, no excusing it, and no ignoring it. Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith. Terrorists do not worship God, they worship death.”

While Trump emphasized America’s commitment to fighting terrorism around the globe and with working with its allies, he also made it clear to the Muslim leaders gathered Sunday that America will only achieve limited success if these countries don’t take the initiative in the fight against radical Islam:

Terrorism has spread across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land. America is prepared to stand with you—in pursuit of shared interests and common security. But the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them. The nations of the Middle East will have to decide what kind of future they want for themselves, for their countries, and for their children. It is a choice between two futures —and it is a choice America cannot make for you. A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive. Them. Out. Drive them out of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy land, and drive them out of this earth.

Trump wants to make it clear that it’s the Muslim world, not the United States, that must lead the way in pushing back against Islamism. Part and parcel of that message is the fact that the United States isn’t going to bring democracy to the world as part of its counter-terrorism strategy—a significant departure from the Bush administration’s strategic efforts to establish democratic regimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump repeatedly emphasized that the United States isn’t “here to lecture” or “tell people how to live.”

Our Job Isn’t to Colonize Your Politics or Minds

This echoes Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s speech to the staff of the State Department earlier this month, during which he said the United States would not require countries to adopt American values before being willing to work with them. His remarks drew heavy criticism from the media and some former state department officials, who said the Trump administration is leaving American values on the ground.

Trump wants to make it clear that America is not in the business of making the world look like America. Although democracy might be within the grasp of some countries, and indeed beneficial to them, it cannot be forced from the outside. While reiterating America’s commitment to its allies in the region and to fighting Islamic terrorism, Trump said the United States will “seek gradual reforms—not sudden intervention.”

Trump’s comments are also quite a departure from President Obama’s 2009 Cairo speech, to which he invited members of the Muslim Brotherhood leadership against the wishes of the Egyptian government. Obama’s speech, panned by some as the kickoff of an “apology tour,” highlighted inclusivity and sent a message to the Muslim world that it was America, not Islamic extremism, that was at fault for terrorism. He drew comparisons between women’s rights in the Muslim world and America and compared the persecution of Jews over the millennia to the plight of the Palestinians today.

Trump, on the other hand, argued Sunday for the need for Muslim countries to ostracize and utterly reject the ideology that fuels Islamic extremism. He put the responsibility on them, not America, and, for the most part, called the problem by its name, although he did occasionally slip into using the Obama administration’s euphemistic language of “extremism.”

Many Foreign Leaders Find Terrorists Useful

Although there’s plenty in Trump’s speech to criticize—like his Bush-esque statement that we’re in a battle between “good and evil”—Trump is right that any lasting change must come from within the global Muslim community. That message must be repeated and reinforced. We cannot fight ISIS or the Taliban or prevent groups like them from rising up without the full cooperation of foreign governments or a real and significant change from within Islam’s various manifestations around the world.

But Trump might come to find that many of the leaders present at his speech in Saudi Arabia have more complicated relationships with terrorist groups and Islamist clerics than he realizes. Terrorists are sometimes used by leaders as helpful counterweights to other groups that threaten the ruling regime.

Syrian President Bashar al Assad, for example, is alleged to have released from prison many of the radicals who formed the leadership of the Islamic State in Syria in 2011. That gave Bashar cover to claim the protests that were quickly developing into a civil war were in fact part of a terrorist insurgency, not an expression of the Syrian people’s desire for democracy.

Syria is an extreme example, but other countries have been known to do the same thing. One group of researchers recently published a study that found U.S. overseas missions to advise, train, equip, and assist foreign militaries often fail because “local leaders are typically more concerned with threats to their own rule from other elites within their state, especially a coup d’état from dissatisfied officers of militia leaders” than they are with external threats like ISIS.

Similarly, the support of powerful clerics, radical or not, is needed to retain power in many Muslim-majority countries. Whether we want to acknowledge it or not, clerics who promote what the West would consider fundamentalist or extremist Islamic views have large followings, and courting them is an imperative for some Middle East leaders.

In the end, many of the Muslim leaders Trump was exhorting in Saudi Arabia may be unwilling to take any significant action against the radicals in their countries, and even if they do, driving out terrorists and radicals could dangerously destabilize these regimes. Trump—and the American people—should be prepared for either scenario.

"Politicians May Be Afraid To Name Islamic Terror, But Morrissey Isn’t","In the wake of the horrific terror attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, United Kingdom, an unlikely famous Mancunian offered perhaps the most sober analysis of the situation. It was Morrissey, the mopey symbol of a wallflower generation, who let loose on Facebook to confront his country’s abysmal record on and response to radical Islamic terror. Here’s what the former Smiths front man had to say:

Celebrating my birthday in Manchester as news of the Manchester Arena bomb broke. The anger is monumental.

For what reason will this ever stop? Theresa May says such attacks ‘will not break us’, but her own life is lived in a bullet-proof bubble, and she evidently does not need to identify any young people today in Manchester morgues. Also, ‘will not break us’ means that the tragedy will not break her, or her policies on immigration. The young people of Manchester are already broken – thanks all the same, Theresa. Sadiq Khan says ‘London is united with Manchester’, but he does not condemn Islamic State – who have claimed responsibility for the bomb. The Queen receives absurd praise for her ‘strong words’ against the attack, yet she does not cancel today’s garden party at Buckingham Palace – for which no criticism is allowed in the Britain of free press. Manchester mayor Andy Burnham says the attack is the work of an ‘extremist’. An extreme what? An extreme rabbit?

In modern Britain everyone seems petrified to officially say what we all say in private. Politicians tell us they are unafraid, but they are never the victims. How easy to be unafraid when one is protected from the line of fire. The people have no such protections. Morrissey

23 May 2017.

There is a lot to unpack here. First and foremost is his frustration at a British government whose policies do not put its own citizens’ safety first. It isn’t clear if Morrissey’s criticism of Prime Minister Theresa May’s immigration policies is rooted in her promise to reduce immigration, or her failure to deliver on that promise. What is clear is his belief that May is not willing to name the victims. She is not willing to fully accept the consequences of a vastly changing United Kingdom, and the dangers that are becoming increasingly apparent.

His criticism of the mayors of London and Manchester is much clearer. They will not name the evil that killed 22 people, including children as young as eight years old. They will not call it radical Islamic terrorism. They call it extremism, but as Morrissey points out, “an extreme what? An extreme rabbit?” It’s a damning line, quick and cutting, as is his style.

Morrissey says we all know who is committing these attacks and why, but politicians are too fearful to say it. Although he does not use the term “political correctness,” the implication is obvious. The lyricist who has never been afraid to speak unpopular truths is calling out the British government for coddling the terrorists who kill kids.

No Excuses for Religion Gone Rabid

Morrissey’s politics have always been hazy. He is a fervent anti-monarchist who wrote the lyrics for an album called “The Queen Is Dead.” He also penned a song about Tory Prime Minister Maggie Thatcher called “Margaret on the Guillotine.” On the other hand, his song “National Front Disco” calls for “England for the English,” and nothing in the song mocks that position.

Predictably, the progressive music zines have been quick to attack Morrissey. Here’s Spin Magazine: “[R]ather than simply extending sympathies to the families of the concert attendees who died and were injured, the singer-songwriter’s comments focused on his own ‘anger’ at the situation, and what he deemed an insufficient response on the part of British leaders, including Prime Minister Theresa May and Queen Elizabeth.” Well, God forbid he criticize the government. We can’t have that.

His statement in the wake of the concert attack is clearer than his song lyrics, and it’s not the first time. In the wake of the Orlando massacre at a gay nightclub, Morrissey had this to say:

Although the gunman who massacred 49 people at an Orlando gay club is said to have been ‘repulsed’ by homosexuality, he nonetheless left behind a slew of self-adoring ‘selfies’; a handsome man gazing enchantedly at his own face. It is therefore acceptable for him to lovingly admire his own maleness, but it is not OK for other men to like other men. Does Islamic scripture say it is fitting for a man to sit alone taking adoring photographs of himself? I doubt it.

The finest lyricist of his generation has just about had it with Islamic terrorism and its apologists. These constant attacks do not “happen to be committed by Muslims,” they are committed by Muslims because a perverse version of that religion has spread far and wide. As he is quick to condemn the sins of the Catholic faith he was born into, he is equally quick to condemn Islam’s faults.

This is a lesson we would all be wise to learn. We don’t need to treat the people of Mohammed with kid gloves any more than we treat the people of Abraham or Christ that way. When in the pursuit of religious goals we repress, oppress, or kill, we are at odds with the nature of our faiths. Morrissey’s demand that Islamic extremism be called Islamic extremism is of a piece with his many criticisms of Catholicism. That criticism of his own people’s faith puts him in an excellent position to criticize the excesses of other faiths.

The Poet’s Truth

Poets put into succinct and meaningful words those things we struggle to express. They play in nuance and moments, allowing us some clarity. Throughout his remarkable career, Morrissey has always done so. “Everyday Is Like Sunday” can be viewed as a song against nuclear proliferation, just as “Reel Around The Fountain” can be heard as a pro-life anthem.

Morrissey’s statement on the Manchester attack is as clear as anything he has ever written. And we should heed it. We are vulnerable. People want to kill us, and while politicians live safe and sound the people live under the threat of terror. This terror has a name, whether we are willing to say it or not.

When I heard of the attack on Manchester, even before reading Morrissey’s statement, my thoughts turned first to his words. In his song, “Suffer Little Children,” from the Smiths’ first album, he writes: “Oh Manchester, so much to answer for / Edward, see those alluring lights? Tonight will be your very last night. / A woman said, I know my son is dead, I’ll never rest my hands on his sacred head.”

The song is about the Moors Murders of the mid-1960s, in which five children were murdered by a disturbed couple. The atrocity happened during Morrissey’s greenest youth in Manchester and left a mark on the man. Now, in his twilight, Morrissey has once again seen innocent children massacred. He will not be shy about placing blame where it belongs—on Islamic terror—and we shouldn’t be shy about it either.

Let’s Give The Platitudes Surrounding Terrorism A Rest,"Following the terrorist attack in Manchester that left at least 22 people dead and dozens injured, most of them children, President Donald Trump referred to terrorists as “evil losers in life.” As expected, a number of liberal pundits mocked the president’s unrefined language. So jejune, you know?

Inadvertently or not, Trump landed on a plain-spoken, stinging moniker that happens to also be true. No matter how many girls the next Salman Abedi ends up killing, theocratic dead-enders are, in every societal, ideological, and historical sense, losers. Perhaps some blunt language will lead to some clearer thinking on the issue.

Now, it’s debatable whether it matters very much to would-be terrorists what unpleasant names Trump has in store for them. How we talk about terrorism, on the other hand, is important. Over the past eight years (at least) the topic has been obscured by clinical euphemisms and feel-good platitudes for the sake of winning hearts and minds. How’s that going, by the way?

If unkind words about Islam — Trump’s rhetoric on immigration, for instance — offers “aid and comfort” to ISIS or compels more Muslims to blow up pressure cookers filled with nails to kill infidel children, that acknowledges what might be a terrible truth about the state of Islam, not American society.

Leaders in Western nations have gone out of their way to craft rhetoric that circumvents Islam completely when speaking about terrorism. We’re hooked on platitudes, such as “man-caused disaster” and so on, treating terrorism as some kind of spontaneous criminal event, rather than a tactic used predominately by one ideology. At the same time, the Left has been transforming “tolerance” into a creed that means accepting illiberalism. Their overcompensation to imagined backlashes has given real-life excuses to ignore the pervasive violence, misogyny, homophobia, child abuse, tyranny, anti-Semitism, bigotry against Christians, etc. that exists in large parts of Islamic society. “The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam” makes every critic a hater.

After every Manchester or Paris or Nice, we are immediately instructed to watch our language and tone. Because love is love. You might remember former Attorney General Loretta Lynch telling a LGBT group, on the heels of an Islamist mass killing at a gay club in Orlando, that the “most effective” weapon Americans had to fight terrorism was “love.”

“After the terror, the platitudes. And the hashtags. And the candlelit vigils,” Brendan O’Neill wrote in a powerful post-Manchester piece. “And they always have the same message: ‘Be unified. Feel love. Don’t give in to hate.’ The banalities roll off the national tongue. Vapidity abounds. A shallow fetishisation of ‘togetherness’ takes the place of any articulation of what we should be together for – and against.”

After every terror act, Europeans and Americans are asked not to change anything. Not to overreact. Not to fear immigration. Never to fear Islam. “There’s only one way Britain should respond to attacks such as Manchester,” read a headline in The Independent, “That is by carrying on exactly as before.” Seriously, exactly the same? Because on Tuesday, British authorities raised the country’s terror threat level to “critical,” which means “an attack is expected imminently.”

Morrissey had some stinging words for the cliché-driven reaction of British politicians who seem paralyzed by political correctness:

In modern Britain everyone seems petrified to officially say what we all say in private. Politicians tell us they are unafraid, but they are never the victims. How easy to be unafraid when one is protected from the line of fire. The people have no such protections.

Spin Magazine reported the comments by noting that “Morrissey Says Something Predictably Dumb About the Manchester Bombing.” That’s because the perfunctory reaction of left-leaning writers is to condemn the person pointing out the uncomfortable truth. Yet “Keep calm and carry on” was meant to raise morale among the British, not call for surrender

Of course, the chances of dying in a terrorist act are slim. Yet the randomness and wantonness of terrorism threatens everyday existence for millions. Western elites are starting to act as if this is a byproduct of modern life we’re just going to have to live with, like car accidents.

So as imperfect a messenger as President Trump is, and as clueless as he might be in other ways, it is refreshing to veer away from vacousness of the previous eight years. In his Saudi Arabian speech the president implored nations to “honestly” confront the problem of “Islamic extremism” rather than using the phrase “Islamist extremism.” CNN argued that this “subtle change — or slip, as the White House called it — could mean the difference between offending Middle Eastern allies” and not.

Now, I understand why we don’t want to offend the mullahs, theocratic sheiks, oligarchic princes, Arab strongmen, and future junta leaders of the Middle East and Asia. They often help fight terrorism. Nor do we want a president to gratuitously attack an entire religion. But Barack Obama supposedly avoided terms like “radical Islamic terrorism” in an attempt to deny ISIS religious authority — as if this were his bailiwick. It’s not up to Western leaders to define what Islam is or isn’t. It is up to them to stand for liberalization (which is the only way to change attitudes with Islamic world) and to talk about what’s happening honestly.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/05/24/time-end-platitudes-surrounding-terrorism/,2017-05-24
‘Alien: Covenant’ Breathes New Life Into Choking Alien Franchise,"Mild spoilers.

There’s life in the old xenomorph yet: “Alien: Covenant” is the sixth (or eighth, depending on how you’re counting) entry in the franchise that exported systematic elimination, haunted houses, and body horror into deep space.

The series has a long if mixed pedigree. The wordless trailer of the original “Alien” (1979) remains a lesson for today’s studios about the value of not oversharing. It doesn’t even show the big creature, while the movie itself cannily shows it at angles and in shadow, never all at once, to better preserve the terror. These days the original may seem a little slow starting, but when it clamps down, it’s nerve-wracking to the end and a thrill-ride for both horror and science fiction fans.

Director James Cameron is easy to dislike, but the rambunctious fighting sequel “Aliens” (1986) was pretty close to perfect, and the alien queen was excellent nightmare fuel. Those first two movies featuring Sigourney Weaver as the female action hero were tough acts to follow. Both have near-perfect ratings on the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes.

Let’s Put This Film in Context

Among the dozens of people who liked “Alien 3” (1992), the longer unofficial cut is well-regarded, actually making the religious references in the official release seem less half-baked. But “Alien Resurrection” (1997) was a failed experiment from a French director, featuring a mic-cast Winona Ryder and too much Scooby-Dooing down hallways. The less said about the pair of “Alien vs. Predator” movies of the early 2000s, the better.

Scott’s 2012 return to the Alien universe via the big-themed “Prometheus” (2012) was confident—perhaps overconfident, with confounding mumbo-jumbo interspersed with some striking scenes and cinematography. It even found a nasty if ultimately dead-end groove for a (literally) riveting 15 minutes’ worth of shock value. But the movie couldn’t bring the built-in audience along, which demanded fewer bull sessions and more chest-bursting, or back-bursting, as the case may be. Instead we got an occult, Erich Von Daniken tale of visitations to Earth by a race known as The Engineers, who left invitations to follow them into the stars via pictographs.

“Prometheus’s” failure is hard to pin down, but real: The windy philosophizing, the lack of “proper” xenomorphs, Guy Pearce in awful old-man makeup, and most notorious, the shot of that familiar horseshoe-shaped spaceship slowly toppling and eventually splatting a major character who doesn’t bother to get out of the narrow path of danger. Perhaps by that time the movie had already sapped the audience’s suspension of disbelief.

Worse, it felt like a dismissal of the “Alien” gestalt, from “Who’s there?” to “Where did we come from?” And I won’t pretend to understand the genetic consequences of the “black goo”—the stuff humans unwittingly ingest that can lead to fatal backaches. The lifecycles of the differing xenomorphs (given nicknames like the Deacon and the Trilobite by fans) also wash over me. So, let’s stick to basics.

That All Brings Us to ‘Covenant’

“Covenant” is set in the year 2104, 10 years after “Prometheus.” Covenant is a colony ship carrying more than a dozen crew and a couple thousand citizens and embryos in hypersleep, bound for a promising-looking planet for terraforming, Origae-6.

After a philosophical beginning with David playing the piano for his human creator, the familiar franchise drumbeats begin to sound. A colony ship intercepts an ambivalent signal and goes down to investigate a strange, quite habitable planet. Only crewmate Daniels (Katherine Waterston) thinks it’s too good to be true, and tries to convince newly installed captain Oram (Billy Crudup). Needless to say, she fails and is proven correct.

The crew is paired off into married couples, which provides some poignancy to the inevitable line of fatalities to follow. Still, it’s a challenge to retain emotional involvement in a constant cast of characters who wander away from the group and promptly get themselves killed.

Scott acceded to the critics of “Prometheus,” and all the old favorites are back. There’s the tall one with the elongated noggin and extra set of teeth, the famous chest-burster, and the one who started the life-cycle, the face-hugger. Pro tip: if someone asks you to peer down into a blooming alien egg, it’s a trap!

About 15 minutes in, you’ll pretty much know who will be the ones still running in the final reel, and even when Scott delivers a twist or two, you will see them coming. Still, Scott’s craftmanship and experience will engage you. “Covenant” ties up some loose ends from “Prometheus” in grimly satisfying fashion, while putting off the big questions, presumably for the sequels to these prequels.

“Covenant” wisely indulges in the original biomechanical visions of creature designer H.R. Giger, the late Swiss artist, and Scott gets plenty out of the typical underlit palette, heightening the psychological terror. When your only tool is a flamethrower, everything looks like an alien head.

Oddly, the subject of the alien itself rarely comes up in the dialogue, with few references to or curiosity about the creature’s origin. This version of the classic monster, while suitably scary, also comes off a touch mindless and ruthless, not the crafty killing machine stalking the poor crew of the Nostromo ship of the original movie.

Trapped In a Dead End

Danny McBride is a corny pleasure as a country-fried space jockey, but Michael Fassbender is “Covenant’s” star acting attraction in a duel role, as the enigmatic droid David, who barely survived “Prometheus,” and Walter, an updated version of the droid. Fassbender somehow makes riveting a rather long scene of David teaching Walter to play the recorder.

Unraveling the origins of the fascinating title creature, to make it comprehensible, risks making the xenomorph less primal and scary.

But it’s unclear where the franchise can go from here. Judging by the so-so box office and ho-hum reviews of “Covenant” (and “Prometheus” before it) there are diminishing returns of humans being chased through dark interstellar halls. Set it on Earth and lay out the alien mythology via Giger-esque iconography? Those two unloved “Aliens vs. Predator” movies kind of did that already.

Director Scott is unflagging at 79 and planning two more prequels. Let’s hope he’s around to make them both. Scott insisted of his 1979 film: “It has absolutely no message. It works on a very visceral level and its only point is terror, and more terror.” Perhaps age and experience has made the director more philosophical, but this wonderfully scary monster franchise is a strange container to fill with ruminations on human existence.

Unraveling the origins of the fascinating title creature, to make it comprehensible, risks making the xenomorph less primal and scary—less, shall we say, Alien—much like the Hulk movies drained the drama by explaining in scientific detail just why The Hulk got green and angry. It risks reducing the elemental, horrific strangeness of the xenomorphs to a series of science projects gone awry. Horror fans enjoy the thrill of scary things they don’t understand. It’s always a little disappointing when you learn how the trick is done.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/01/alien-covenant-temporarily-breathes-new-life-choking-alien-franchise/,2017-06-01
"After London Bridge, World Is Sick Of Politicians Downplaying Terrorism","As if on cue, in the wake of Saturday’s terrorist attack in London political leaders are trotting out the usual treacly lines that have become so rote. But the words they pretend will provide comfort to anyone but the most naïve are borderline worthless. Worse, they’re an insult to the families who have had to experience the shocking pain of the sudden loss of a family member or friend at the hands of a terrorist.

Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, called Saturday’s attack “deliberate and cowardly,” and asked “all Londoners to remain calm and vigilant today and in the days ahead.” Most notably, he said: “You will see an increased police presence today, including armed officers and uniformed officers. There is no reason to be alarmed by this. We are the safest global city in the world.”

What a thing to say at a time like this. Shouldn’t Britons be alarmed? Isn’t Saturday’s attack in London, coming as it did on the heels of the Manchester bombing, deeply disturbing? Why isn’t Khan more concerned about the threats that are so obviously at the doorstep, or better put, in Britain’s streets? Does anyone really take comfort from being told about swift police response times after yet another terrorist attack?

Our Politicians Can’t Handle the Truth

The sad truth, and getting sadder with every attack, is that the political class has little interest in doing what would really be necessary to combat Islamist terrorism, let alone talk about it. They don’t want to talk about how Britain’s lax immigration policies over decades led to hundreds of thousands of immigrants entering the country with varying degrees of willingness to assimilate and adopt Western values. They don’t want to openly criticize the blatant problems with the multiculturalism the UK has pursued for years and the obvious impact it has had on the immigrant population.

Oh no. This would cost them too much. It would shatter the façade of political correctness that’s been constructed over our “civilized” western world, and destroy the illusion, so vital to the political class, that Western values are universal.

The politicians are only willing to give speeches about how united we are and how terrorists cannot tear us apart. But the truth—so clear and obvious—is that with every attack the West becomes more and more divided. We are not united, not by a long shot. Before the bodies of the poor souls who were killed Saturday by radical Islamists were even identified, the Left and Right were at one another’s throats. On that score, the terrorists emerge victorious every time.

Yes, there are beautiful and touching scenes of strangers helping one another, opening their homes, offering free rides. This is a reminder of the goodness that still exists as part of our shared humanity. But such gestures don’t, ultimately, unite us. Neither do candlelight vigils and marches through the streets of Paris—or tearful pop concerts in Manchester.

The Intellectually Weak Attack Anyone More Courageous

There’s little to no tolerance in polite society for the kind of honesty for which many in the West are hungry. The Washington Post ran a headline Sunday that read, “World Leaders Call For Unity After London Attack. Trump tweets the complete opposite.” The article chastises President Trump for not joining in the fake condolences and platitudes of the political elite, and praises those elites for their messages of hope. But what, exactly, are they saying we should be hopeful for?

Trump, who is often wrong, was correct in tweeting Sunday that, “We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people.” A growing number of those people are scared, and sick of turning on the news to hear of yet another heartbreaking attack then hearing the same meaningless bromides from their leaders.

They want a leader who doesn’t just try to inure them to this kind of random violence but stands up and says that we’re not going to take it, that this isn’t an acceptable status quo. Whether Trump is that leader is highly debatable, but at least he’s making a nod toward it.

But whenever political leaders do dare to talk candidly about some of these problems, there’s intense pushback and outrage. Take Trump’s travel ban. Like it or hate it, the ban was aimed at curbing immigration from countries that are de facto failed states. These are places where a terrorist could easily go unnoticed by whatever remnant of a security service remains and fly to the United States undetected. When Trump unveiled his travel ban earlier this year, America practically devoured itself with protests at airports, counter-protests, and a wave of lawsuits. The reaction robbed us of any real chance of having a conversation about the ways in which we might need to reconsider our immigration policies for the sake of national security.

The Real Message: Get Used to It

British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday that “enough is enough” and that Britain can’t “pretend that things can remain the same.” Is she just campaigning? Parliamentary elections are, after all, next week. Or is she finally saying what needs to be said? If things cannot remain the same, will May come out and say what exactly needs to change?

Even if she does mean it, and even if she does spell out what must change, she won’t be able to do anything significant in Parliament because most of the political class will remain opposed to any drastic policy changes.

Our political leaders are basically telling us that this kind of terrorism, random and deadly, is the price we have to pay for their policies of multiculturalism and political correctness. They know that their weak platitudes can’t stop terrorism, and so do the people. They might as well come out and say what they mean: get used to the new normal.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/05/london-bridge-world-sick-politicians-downplaying-terrorism/,2017-06-05
You Know What’s Worse Than Overreacting To Terror? Normalizing It,"The day after Islamic terrorists struck England for the second time in a month, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman offered the prevailing liberal talking point of the day. Stop panicking. “I’m going to London later this week,” he mocked on Twitter, “OMG! I might be stabbed! Or I might get hit by a drunk driver tonight, or run over by a cab tomorrow.”

He might. And if he did, although tragic and sad, it would have little effect on the population of England, for a good reason. We are resigned to a certain level of random criminality and misfortune in Western society. In free societies, we do our best to mitigate the damage without trampling on civil rights, but it’s part of modern life.

Certainly, for the victims of violence—their friends and family, as well—there’s little difference. The consequences for the rest of society, though, can vastly differ. If an unarmed man were shot down by a police officer, would Krugman tell his three million followers: “Relax, you have a better chance of being run over by a taxi?” Of course not. Terrorism is about more than just risk assessment. There are broader societal implications to take into account.

Those who kill in the name of Islam are part of a unique worldwide political movement that includes, to various degrees, radicalized men and women from both great factions of the faith. They are on every continent, and they give no quarter. There is no dialoguing. There is no realistic political solution that might appease them. There is no legislative fix. Terrorism—as well as the recruitment and propaganda tools by which they survive—is funded by Islamic regimes and the radicals in them, and applauded by adherents around the world. Every attack is about all of this.

Remember, as well, the magnitude of the violence is alleviated only by the vigilance of the people fighting it. Comprehending the depravity of the jihadist makes people nervous in the way random criminal violence should not. Those who peddle Krugmanesque risk assessments also fail to take into consideration the number of terror plots that have been thwarted. The West spends hundreds of billions of dollars every year trying to avert another 9/11, although we obviously struggle to stop these low-tech attacks. The Mi5 reportedly have “500 current terrorism investigations, involving 3,000 current subjects of interest.” One of the London Bridge terrorists appeared in a documentary called “The Jihadi Next Door.” This seems alarming.

Krugman went on to tweet: “I mean, seriously. Terrorism = bad. But panicking about this stuff — or worse, inciting panic — is unforgivable. Especially for POTUS.” So, wait, terrorism is merely “bad,” but “panicking “is unforgivable?” (Juxtapose this comment with the hysterical reaction to the United States’s exit from the toothless Paris Agreement.)

I’m not sure the president was “inciting panic,” but let’s concede his tweets were foolish. No one is panicking now. No one has panicked in the past. By “panic,” liberals typically mean you’ve failed to discuss Islamic radicalism within the politically correct strictures they’ve prescribed. “That’s exactly what the terrorists want!” goes the platitude. Don’t get too mad. Don’t be too blunt, or you might create new terrorists. Definitely don’t overreact.

Shouldn’t we, and the Brits, and everyone else, react to terror in the most appropriate way, rather than contemplating how jihadists want, or don’t want, us to react? After all, this wouldn’t be the first time we fought in a war others had decided to start.

Perhaps the only worse thing than overreacting is under-reacting. It seems to me that one of the underlying reasons folks conflate terror and criminality is political. To admit that the Islamic world has a singular struggle with extremism, violence, and illiberalism is a unwelcome intrusion into debates regarding immigration and multiculturalism, especially in Europe.

In the United States, it’s a bit different: Let’s not overreact because we also have an extremist problem. We also hate. We’re also violent. Every time some deranged (genuine) lone wolf kills, the usual voices demand to know why we haven’t treated the attack as we would an Islamic strike. Well, after the murderous Portland train attacker is subdued, there is no terror cell to dismantle, no funding to root out, and no worldwide death cult to liberalize. It doesn’t diminish the odiousness of the crime, but it necessitates a different response.

Needless to say, while it would be tragic if a Nobel Laureate were accidentally run down by a lorry driver, girls who are blown up attending an Ariana Grande concert — or, for that matter, people who are forced to choose between jumping off a Twin Tower or burning in it — are victims in a war that pits liberalism against despotism. No, it’s not World War II, but it’s dangerous enough. Treating its casualties as we would those who die in accidents will only normalize it.

Wednesday Terror Attack On Tehran A Peek Into Internal Fault Lines,"In an exceedingly rare occurrence, Iran was the target of a coordinated terror attack on Wednesday morning that left at least 12 dead and many more injured. ISIS was quick to claim responsibility for the dual bombings of two symbolic locations in the heart of Tehran, making it the first Islamic State attack in the majority-Shiite Islamic Republic since the group emerged in 2014. Iran subsequently announced that the attackers were Iranian nationals who had joined ISIS.

Iran is looking to place the blame anywhere but on domestic unrest among its Sunni minority. But Iranian Sunnis should expect a harsh crackdown in the weeks and months to come, whether they were involved or not.

The first attack happened at Iran’s parliament, where it appears four men entered the building dressed as women, opened fire, took hostages, and detonated at least one suicide bomb. All four attackers are believed to have been killed. The other attack, involving a female suicide bomber, was launched at the Ayatollah Khomeini mausoleum, a de facto shrine to the founder of the Islamic Republic. Iranian security services say they foiled a third attack, although few details are known.

The locations were carefully selected to strike at the heart of the country. The first, a symbol of Iran’s government, reveals its vulnerability. The second targeted the soul of the country’s revolutionary past. Iran is exceedingly proud that it was able to overthrow the shah in its 1979 revolution and thereby shrug off American influence. In other words, Wednesday’s attacks seem not to have been randomly or spontaneously inspired by ISIS, but carefully planned to hit a nerve and grab international attention.

ISIS’s Increasing Interest in Iran

Surrounding countries have been the targets of Islamic State terror attacks over the last several years but no plot had yet been successfully carried out in Iran, although Iranian officials claim to have foiled several ISIS schemes.

But in recent months, ISIS has ramped up its propaganda in Iran, including publishing, for the first time, four issues of its magazine, Rumiyah, in Persian, and putting out a Persian-language video calling on Iranian Sunnis to rise up against the Shiite government. These aren’t the first instances of Persian-language ISIS propaganda, but they represent a significant increase after years of failing to inspire Iran’s Sunni population to join the Islamic State’s movement.

Some experts have speculated that recruitment efforts were unsuccessful because of Iran’s relative stability, while conflicting reports indicate that Iran has prevented as many as 1,500 Iranians from joining ISIS, likely through Tehran’s notoriously heavy-handed police measures.

So far, nothing is known about the attackers, and Iranian authorities are being characteristically tight-lipped. So it remains unclear whether the recent propaganda push was successful in recruiting Iranian Sunnis to launch the attacks or whether they are the work of ISIS members from Syria or Iraq who infiltrated the country.

Regardless, it represents a significant setback for the Iranian government, which has boasted about how safe Tehran is compared to major cities in neighboring countries (the last major attack in Iran was in 2010 and involved a Sunni extremist group) and has downplayed the threat from ISIS. When the Persian-language ISIS video first came out in March, Iranian officials said it was a sign of Islamic State’s desperation and increasing impotency.

But the group’s ability to coordinate this attack, along with its success in planning and inspiring two attacks in Britain in the past two weeks, shows just how complex the matter is. Losing its territorial holdings—its “caliphate”—does not, it would seem, translate to a decrease in the threat posed by the group in the Middle East or in Europe.

What This Terror Attack Says About What Happens Next

Now that ISIS has proven its capability to strike at the symbolic heart of Iran, expect to see a simultaneous downplaying of the attacks alongside a crackdown on the Sunni population. Iran’s speaker of the parliament has already called Wednesday’s attack a “minor issue.” Above all, Tehran doesn’t want to appear weak or let on that it has domestic problems like other countries in the region that have experienced disastrous instability during and after the Arab Spring.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guard lashed out at the Saudis on Wednesday, claiming they were somehow responsible for the attack, which they also tried to tie to President Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia last month: “World public opinion, especially in Iran, sees the fact that this terrorist act was perpetrated soon after the meeting of the US president with the heads of one of the reactionary regional states that has always supported … terrorists as to be very meaningful.”

This, too, is part of a strategy to deflect the idea that ISIS, or Iran’s Sunni minority population, pose a threat to the regime or the country’s stability. It’s easier for Iran to blame its traditional enemy in the region, the Saudis, and its international nemesis, the Great Satan (America).

But at the same time it downplays the significance of the attacks, expect Iran to crack down on Sunnis within its borders. Sunnis, who make up just 9 percent of Iran’s predominantly Shiite population, already experience persecution in Iran: they are harassed and have been imprisoned, Sunni teachings are reportedly banned in public schools, and Sunni mosques and schools are not allowed to be built.

Their treatment makes them an obvious target for ISIS recruitment, and Iranian officials know it, despite what they say publicly. Whether Wednesday’s attacks turn out to have been perpetrated by Sunni Iranians or ISIS members from outside the country, things are about to get a lot worse for Iran’s Sunni population. Also, the tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, already elevated by the break in diplomatic ties between the Arab Gulf states and Qatar, an Iranian ally, just escalated even more.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/08/wednesday-terror-attack-tehran-surprise-peek-internal-fault-lines/,2017-06-08
Why Censoring The Internet Would Make It Harder To Fight Terrorism,"U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May has called for greater regulation of the Internet to combat the growing threat of Islamist extremism. Addressing the public after the latest attack on London—the third act of Islamist terrorism in the U.K. this year—May rightly placed blame for the string of recent attacks on “the evil ideology of Islamist extremism.”

“Defeating this ideology is one of the great challenges of our time,” she said. “But it cannot be defeated by military intervention alone. It will only be defeated when we turn people’s minds away from this violence and make them understand that our values—pluralistic British values—are superior to anything offered by the preachers and supporters of hate.”

To combat this evil ideology, May has proposed greater regulation of the internet, imposed through international agreements, in order to “prevent the spread of extremist and terrorism planning.”

“We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed,” May said. “Yet that is precisely what the internet, and the big companies that provide Internet-based services provide.”

Internet Censorship Will Help, Not Hurt, Terrorism

May is yet to outline the details of her proposal. But if initial reports are anything to go by, it is likely to include laws forcing companies to weaken their encryption standards—making all online data less secure—as well as a push for new international agreements that require internet companies to deny a platform to extremist propaganda. In other words, it will be nothing short of a China-style regime of internet censorship—a comparison May has declined to refute.

This proposal has already gained the support of Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, after Australia suffered its own small attack on Monday, when a lone gunman claimed as a “soldier of ISIS” killed one man and took a women hostage. The idea is also likely to gain support from President Trump, who called for “closing that Internet up in some way,” during his campaign.

It is good to see a western political leader facing up to the challenge posed by Islamist ideology. But increased internet censorship is not the solution to this problem. It will only make the problem harder to combat by infringing on legitimate speech, pushing the problem further underground, and leaving the real-life “safe spaces” untouched.

The Internet Isn’t The Real Problem

The internet “safe space” argument is compelling. It’s undeniable that groups like ISIS devote considerable resources to online propaganda, and have motivated people in the west to both join them and to carry out attacks in their homelands. People are right to worry about lone wolves being radicalized on the internet.

But this doesn’t describe the perpetrators of the last three attacks in the U.K., most of whom were already known to the police. Nor does it describe the Australian terrorist, who not only had a history of violence and connections to terrorism, but was out on bail at the time of the attack.

More importantly, it ignores the far greater problem of the safe spaces Islamist extremism benefits from in the real world. For too long terrorist attacks have been met with little more than stoic sympathy and willful blindness, as leaders deny that repeated attacks are anything more than the actions of a few maniacs, with no discernible connection to the religion of Islam.

On the one hand, it’s understandable for political leaders not to want to ascribe blame to the wider Muslim community, the vast majority of whom have nothing whatsoever to do with the barbarism carried out in the name of their religion.

On the other hand, this approach has only exacerbated the problem by insulating the Muslim community—and therefore Islamism—from the sort of criticism that all other groups in western societies are subjected to. In many European countries, this bigotry of low expectations has led to the development of entire suburbs that are de-facto no-go zones—areas of a city that are completely disconnected from wider society, where it’s dangerous for any non-Muslims to enter.

What We Can Learn From Molenbeek

A prime example is the area of Molenbeek, in Belgium, where an alleged participant in the November 13 Paris attacks (which left 130 people dead and 368 wounded) was able to hide out for nearly four months, despite being the most wanted man in Europe. There’s nowhere as bad as Molenbeek in the U.K., but the British Muslim community has nevertheless been afforded the kind of protection from criticism that no other community enjoys.

The harm caused by this insidious political correctness was highlighted in 2014, when an independent inquiry found that police, community leaders, and local politicians had systematically failed to prevent the sexual exploitation of 1,400 children between 1997 and 2013—a figure described as a “conservative estimate”—in the north-England town of Rotherham (population 257,000).

The reason blamed for this failure was the fear of being accused of racism, since these so-called “grooming gangs” were mostly made up of Muslims of Pakistani origin. Even when the crimes were eventually reported, the perpetrators were described as mostly “Asian men,” rather than as Muslims.

Illiberal Ideas Persist In Britain’s Muslim Community

It obviously goes without saying that these appalling crimes are not the fault of all British Muslims, most of whom would be horrified by such behavior. Nevertheless, it highlights the failure of British society to hold the Muslim community to the same standards as everyone else.

It’s undeniable that appallingly illiberal views have been allowed to persist in the British Muslim community. In a 2015 poll of 1,000 British Muslim, 27 percent said they have some sympathy for the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. An additional 2016 poll found that two out of three British Muslims would not report someone they knew to the police, if they became involved with terrorist sympathizers. These sentiments aren’t new. A 2006 poll found that 20 percent of British Muslism had sympathy for the motivations of the London bombings of July 7, 2005 (which left 52 people dead and 784 injured).

It’s unlikely that these attitudes, which are alarmingly out of step with the rest of British society, would still exist if not for their “safe spaces,” created by the taboo on criticism of Islam. The first step to combating Islamist extremism is to remove this taboo.

Internet Censorship Will Make Things Worse

Not only will increasing internet censorship do nothing to remove the safe-spaces that exist in the real world, it may even make the problem worse.

There is simply no way to completely censor anything in the internet age. All states can do is push ideas and discussions further underground, where the ideas are harder to combat and where it is harder for intelligence services to keep track of them—a point stressed by the U.K.’s leading digital advocacy organization, the Open Rights Group.

There is also a long track record of anti-free speech laws—designed to protect the public from harmful speech—being used suppress discussion of important issues, simply because they are controversial and may offend some people. In 2016, Dutch politician Geert Wilders was found guilty of violating Hate Speech laws for comments he made in 2014 that were “demeaning and thereby insulting towards the Moroccan population.” Wilders had asked a roomful of his supporter if they wanted to have “more or fewer Moroccans” in the country. When the crowd shouted back “Fewer!” he replied, “Well, we’ll take care of that.”

In the recent March 15 election, Wilders’ party got over 1.3 million votes (13.6 percent), so he clearly represents a significant proportion of the Dutch population. He would not have this support if the issues he talks about didn’t resonate with the public. Ironically, these are the same issues that May’s proposal is attempting to address—namely, the spread of radical Islamism.

This Could Be An Excuse to Suppress More Than Terrorism

People might disagree with the solutions Wilders proposes, but this is not the way to combat unwanted ideas. No one is served when we collectively decide to stick our heads in the sand. The problem will not magically disappear.

There is every reason to expect that May’s internet censorship proposal will also be used to suppress more than just Islamist propaganda. Perhaps the best evidence of this is a private conversation between German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, which was picked up by a hot mic in 2015. Merkel was overheard asking Zuckerberg what he was doing about anti-immigrant posts on Facebook. Zuckerberg’s response was, “We need to do some work.” Make no mistake, this was nothing short of an attempt to reduce opposition to Merkel’s unprecedented decision to open Germany’s borders to a seemingly unlimited number of refugees and migrants from the Middle East and North Africa.

May’s internet censorship proposal will create the infrastructure for politicians like Merkel to not just ask internet companies to act, but demand it.

Free Speech Is The Best Way To Combat Extremism

Several European countries introduced Hate Speech laws in order to prevent the sort of anti-Semitism that led to the Holocaust. However, not only have these laws failed to eradicate anti-Semitism, it is now widely reported to be on the rise throughout Europe. The situation has gotten so bad, some people are now discussing whether it’s time for the Jews to leave Europe, for good.

The situation could not be more different in the United States, which has become arguably the safest country for Jews on earth. The U.S. is also significantly better than Europe at integrating its immigrant population, including its Muslim population. This is because of the First Amendment, which helps ensure the existence of a vibrant and robust marketplace of ideas in which extremist propaganda can be combatted. This is an important lesson for western societies to learn: Free speech is the best way to combat unwanted ideas.

The western world needs to combat the ideology of radical Islamism. But this is only possible if we can openly discuss issues, free from the kind of politically correct taboos that have insulated the Muslim community. May’s internet censorship proposal will only make this more difficult.

The Normal Person’s Guide To The Qatari Cold War,"That escalated quickly. In a region where inter-Arab politics is frequently described as a zero-sum game, Qatar suddenly finds itself on the outside looking in. Recent analysis has tended to overfocus on the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back, but a closer look reveals that the camel has suffered from chronic illness for years. It was only a matter of time before its health became critical.

Although many countries have joined in isolating the oil-rich monarchy, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Egypt have spearheaded the effort. The question is: What is it about Qatar’s pursuit of its own interests that makes it different from any of its neighbors? Are those singling out Qatar for its poor behavior guilty of being hypocrites?

In the Middle East, no nation has clean hands. Most utilize proxies to meddle in others’ internal affairs. What’s unique about Qatar is that it has fanned the flames of unrest on all sides of the inter-Sunni and inter-Arab conflicts while promoting warmer relations with their primary nemesis: Iran. In other words, not only does Qatar have dirty hands, they’re simultaneously sticking them in all regional pies. It was only a matter of time before their neighbors caught on.

It’s Been Like This for a While

The change in foreign policy direction dates back to 1995, when the former emir was overthrown by his son. Since then, Qatar has grown far more adventurous and duplicitous.

One example from outside the Arab state system is Qatar’s approach to Israel. On one hand they’ve appeared to court closer relations with the Jewish state, while on the other they provide more support for Hamas than does any other nation.

They savagely attacked the 2002 Saudi peace plan over its state-funded Al Jazeera news network. It came in the midst of the Palestinian-Israeli war of attrition launched by Yasser Arafat in the fall of 2000, when most of the Arab world hoped to find a way to deescalate the situation. Enraged by Qatar’s vocal opposition, Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador that September.

This isn’t to say that the other regional powers are in love with Israel and Qatar stands as the primary roadblock to peace. The issue is that at key moments when the Arab world sought to lessen the destructive heat emanating from the smoldering Palestinian-Israeli fire, Qatar has been there to fan the flames instead. Being out of step with the rest of the region has since become a signature of Qatar’s foreign policy.

The Arab-Persian Dimension

When it comes to the Sunni-Shia or Arab-Persian dimension of the conflict, Qatar would argue that it makes sense to play middle. By sashaying up to Iran, they are hedging their bets in the belief that the Arab world will fail to stand up to the Shia power as it expands its regional influence and pursues nuclear weapons. They figure it’s better to be Iran’s conduit acting as their Arab ambassador to the Sunni world rather than a frontline enemy state staring at them from across the narrow Gulf.

In 2008, Doha served as the destination for talks aimed at avoiding more bloodshed in Lebanon. The crisis came when Hezbollah turned its weapons against the Lebanese after having promised that their arms were solely for confronting Israel. When the Iranian proxy went to war with Israel in the summer of 2006, many in the Gulf hoped Israel would crush the Iranian-created terrorist proxy in Lebanon.

Not Qatar. Washington foolishly supported the deal worked out at Doha that prevented further domestic bloodshed in Lebanon in the short term by boosting Hezbollah’s domestic position, but also essentially granted them political veto power. It paved the path towards their eventual takeover of Lebanon. Today, the distinction between Hezbollah and the Lebanese state has grown evermore meaningless.

Then there’s the case of a $1 billion hostage payment Qatar made in April for the release of royal family members kidnapped in Iraq while on a hunting trip. The money not only secured the release of 26 members of a Qatari falconry party but also 50 Islamist militants belonging to an al-Qaeda affiliate captured in Syria.

Although the move was choreographed to appear innocuous, the Gulf States could smell something fishy. The Financial Times reported, “Around $700m was paid both to Iranian figures and the regional Shia militias they support, according to regional government officials. They added that $200m to $300m went to Islamist groups in Syria, most of that to Tahir al-Sham, a group with links to al-Qaeda.” It all looked like a set-up by Qatar, sparking the most recent war of words over competing Arab news networks.

The Inter-Sunni Conflict

If crossing religious lines wasn’t enough to inspire the ire of their neighbors, Qatar’s subversive behavior against fellow Arab and Sunni majority countries was. After Muammar Gaddafi was removed from power in Libya in 2011, official documents revealed that Qatar’s emir supported Saudi opposition members and hoped to overthrow the Saudi royal family. Although Saudi Arabia didn’t react at the time, memories—both real and imagined—are long-lasting in the Middle East.

The Arab awakening in 2011 only served to intensify Qatar’s duplicitous actions. While most of the leaders in the Arab world grew to fear the so-called “Arab spring” sweeping through the region—especially what it meant for the security of their rule—Qatar cheered against the regimes, and intensified its love affair with the Muslim Brotherhood, eventually bringing relations with Egypt to a head.

Backing Mohamed Morsi, a Brotherhood member, in Egypt didn’t earn Qatar many friends. Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the UAE pulled their ambassadors in March 2014. Diplomatic relations were only resumed eight months later when Qatar finally cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood—but they remained the open host and prideful backer of Hamas, its terrorist cousin. Today, it serves as the external headquarters for Hamas and provides more cash than any other country to the terrorist organization.

It would be one thing if in the inter-Sunni dispute, Qatar only chose the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas brand of ideology to support as a proxy. But it didn’t stop there. The emirate also supports al-Qaeda affiliates such as the al Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham, along with the Taliban. The Islamist tint seen in Syria’s civil war would not have been so vibrant and destructive without Qatar’s contradictory support for multiple terrorist elements.

These policies don’t represent a changing trend but a continuation and linear evolution of the same destructive course. One member of Qatar’s royal family ran a safe house for Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the founder of al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) and predecessor to the Islamic State, with the Emir Abdul Karim al-Thani dolling out Qatari passports and $1 million to finance AQI activities. That put Qatar at odds not only with the United States and much of the Arab world but with Iran as well. Zarqawi was killed in 2006; Qatar was already dancing with multiple partners at the ball.

The 2014 crisis was the last major regional pushback against Qatar. This recent conflagration, however, goes much further. Land and sea blockades weren’t used as punitive measures against the emirate in 2014 and could incur lasting damage, politically, economically, and diplomatically.

Why Qatar Overplayed Its Hand

Several factors have allowed the small emirate to punch far above its diplomatic weight internationally and give it the freedom to cause other regional powers heartburn. Qatar has a religiously homogenous citizenry, unparalleled wealth, and, situated as a peninsula, it shares only one land border.

So far Qatar has paid no price too steep for agitating from afar and served as no frontline in a modern war.

It is the richest country in the world, with the average household making a shade under $240,000 per year. Qatar also has the largest percentage of non-nationals in the world. Only some 200,000 people are considered citizens, despite a 2016 census that claims a population of 2,675,522. That means only around 10 percent of those living in Qatar are citizens, and they can put their money to work in a multitude of ways.

Qatar’s citizens are also overwhelmingly (90 percent) Sunni, the majority of which are adherents to the Salafi and Wahabi interpretation of Islam. Its only neighbor by land, Saudi Arabia, is the birthplace of Wahabism. Egypt, by way of comparison, is also 90 percent Sunni but also the most populous Arab state, with a population of 93 million that utterly lacks the wealth and oil and gas resources of the Gulf nation.

Since its independence, Egypt has paid a steep price for its bellicose postures. Fifty years ago, it managed to talk itself and others into war against Israel, which cost it and those involved dearly in lost territory and prestige. Egypt’s eventual pragmatism was a result of lessons learned the hard way and ultimately led it to finally make peace with its longtime enemy. Meanwhile, the internal challenges brought by the Muslim Brotherhood made the group outlaws in the movement’s own birthplace.

Qatar has no such restraints and faced no such costs. Factors that affected decision-making in Cairo were not considerations in Qatar. There is little fear of a public backlash for funding terrorist groups that share the same religious philosophy along the lines of al-Qaeda. The Muslim Brotherhood presented no domestic challenge—they were allies. So far Qatar has paid no price too steep for agitating from afar and served as no frontline in a modern war. Its territory remains intact, surrounded by the moat known as the Persian Gulf.

America’s Interest in the Crisis

The stakes are high in resolving the Gulf crisis. While the Trump administration initially navigated the situation well, in the days that followed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has emerged as the voice prematurely calling for a de-escalation.

The United States should look toward relocating its airbase to a regional ally with a longer and more helpful track record.

It is in America’s interest to see the situation peacefully resolved, especially with Qatar hosting more than 10,000 U.S. troops in addition to the all-important Al Udeid airbase from which the United States coordinates air operations in Syria and Iraq. Some argue the base gives Qatar leverage over the United States, but it works both ways. They feel free to act as they do knowing that the United States will protect its own assets. With a base on their soil, Qatar believes they are an asset.

The United States should look toward relocating its airbase to a regional ally with a longer and more helpful track record. The UAE has made such overtures for years. Even the formation of a group tasked to explore alternatives to Qatar would send an important message.

However, as former defense secretary, Bob Gates, recently pointed out, “transitioning away from there would be expensive and it would be very complicated operationally” and it would “run the risk that the Qatari government basically says ‘OK, then why don’t you just get the hell out altogether?’” Clearly, such considerations must be taken into account. Nevertheless, it seems to be the sort of negotiating challenge President Trump has been keen to tackle in pursuit of a deal.

The United States has an interest in bringing Qatar into the new regional alliance that has been quietly forming in recent years. The more durable those partnerships are, the easier it will be for Qatar to stop hedging its bets and appeasing Iran—if that is what they choose.

After all, in this dust-up, there is Qatar, Turkey, and Iran on one side, and everyone else on the other. It will be exceedingly difficult for that axis to endure. The United States and its allies should provide a stark choice where the carrots are sufficiently enticing and the sticks adequately tough. In this case, getting it right is better than getting it fast.

Terrorists Are Cowards. Don’t Let Anyone Tell You Otherwise,"The Islamic State has been backed into a corner. Its Syrian stronghold is teetering as money, soldiers, and territory all dwindle. Mosul’s days are numbered. Raqqa is the next target. When these pillars of the ISIS ‘caliphate’ fall, its prestige will also take a nosedive. But, as the recent attacks in London show, jihadists have no intention of going gently into the good night. Their atrocities have pushed us back into an old debate: Is terrorism cowardly?

Gerard Vowels, the hero of London Bridge, has this one right. Terrorists are cowards. It makes no difference that they suffer and die for things they truly believe. When a man takes special pains to savage the weak and helpless, that is an intrinsically cowardly act, regardless of the personal price he may pay for his cowardly actions.

Audacious Acts Aren’t Automatically Virtuous

That terrorism is not courageous can be easily established. As Aristotle explains in the “Nicomachean Ethics,” the courageous man stands fast in the face of danger for the sake of what is good. Since the killing of innocents is a grave moral evil, it clearly cannot be courageous. Anyone inclined to quibble with this is simply confused about the nature of virtue. Risk-takers of all sorts may impress us, but of course we appreciate that people may court danger for any number of reasons. They might be drunk or on a drug-induced high. They might be overwhelmed by rage, hatred, or lust. Self-destructive behavior often has deep and complex psychological roots, but audacious acts are not per se virtuous. That is why we do not honor the criminal mastermind or the reckless drunk.

Just because terrorism isn’t courageous, though, it doesn’t necessarily follow that it is cowardly. Many risky-but-not-courageous acts are properly viewed as rash. The rash person shows an excessive willingness to face dangers, and is prone to take risks for inadequate reasons. When young men goad each other into risking life and limb for the thrill of it, we scold them for their rashness, not for their cowardice.

Almost certainly, some terrorists are rash. Most are young, and the young very commonly lack a full appreciation of the gravity of certain dangers. Evil men are often able to exploit that deficiency in service of their own ends, and there can be little doubt that ISIS recruiters and terrorist cell leaders are experts in this kind of manipulation. Rashness, however, is not the terrorist’s primary deficiency.

Terrorists are cowards in the fullest and most proper sense of that term. They deliberately avoid honorable forms of combat, preferring instead to prey on the weak, the innocent, and those who are not in a position to defend themselves. This is the terrorist’s modus operandi, and we should not allow his eye-popping audacity to distract us from the deep moral depravity that lies at the heart of this stratagem. He is the kind of fighter who prefers whenever possible to shoot his enemies in the back. After all, who knows? Given a chance to turn around, they might prove quicker on the draw.

It’s Possible To Be Both Audacious And Cowardly

Whenever this question arises, there are inevitably a few “defenders” who step forward to insist that terrorism, however evil, is at any rate not cowardly. Two points typically arise in this context. One is that terrorists show a serious disregard for their own lives, which is not a feature we typically connect with cowardice. The second is that they genuinely believe in the causes for which they fight.

I grant both of these points, but neither addresses the central issue at hand. It is perfectly possible to be both audacious and cowardly. Consider, as an example, a man who has a grievance against a much wealthier and more powerful employer. Perhaps the employer has fired him without just cause, blaming him for a mishap that was the employer’s own fault. The situation is unjust, but because he lacks money and connections, he fears that any effort to pursue legal redress will be unsuccessful. Accordingly, the enraged employee gets his revenge by physically beating his (former) employer’s teenaged daughter. He knows that the girl herself has done nothing, but hurting her is simply the easiest and most effective method of hurting her father.

This man is a coward. It does not matter that he has strong convictions. It makes no difference if he acts with full awareness that he will almost certainly be punished, by the law or even by a lynch mob. He chooses his target because she is weaker than himself, and because she is innocent; he knows that these two considerations will exacerbate the injury to his true enemy. He can’t bring himself to confront that person in an honorable fashion, because he fears that he would lose such an exchange. This is the epitome of cowardice. It’s also exactly the sort of thing that terrorists do.

We Fall For Terrorists’ Sales Pitch

Terrorism has long been a preferred military tactic for the weak and the desperate. Insurgent groups turn to terrorism when their resources are obviously too limited to put conventional victory within reach. That is their motivation for “choosing soft targets”, or (to put the point less gently) for murdering children and shooting unarmed people in the back.

Why is it so hard for some people to acknowledge the cowardice intrinsic to terrorism? In the main, it’s because we fall prey to the terrorist’s “sales pitch”. Terrorist organizations typically have a sense of drama. They know how to turn heads with their ruthlessness. Primarily this is meant to instill fear, but it can also instill a kind of qualified respect, which psychologically sustains the organization and helps with recruiting. Even in our horror, we can’t quite put aside the dark fascination that we feel when the Islamist’s fatalistic vision springs to life before our jaded Western eyes.

We shouldn’t give them that advantage. But it’s hard to help ourselves.

Our own societies are currently plagued by a philosophical and spiritual malaise, which cripples our confidence and leads us to second-guess our every action. Juxtaposed against that background, the deadly resolve of the terrorist is doubly impressive, and even perversely appealing. He believes in something, enough to die and kill for it. We, by contrast, are roiling in self-loathing and existential angst. Who are the real cowards?

Terrorists Are Not Worthy Foes

By defending terrorists as not-cowardly, figures like Bill Maher can provocatively express their disgust with the West’s spiritual torpor. There may also be a certain attraction to declaring the enemy a worthy foe, since noble enemies can inspire heroic deeds. Winning a war against cowards doesn’t do much to bolster our own flagging confidence. “Clash of civilization” rhetoric carries more punch.

But terrorists are not worthy foes, and it’s important that we not forget. No such honor should be granted to the sort of “soldier” who stabs unarmed women and murders children. Taken in full context, the jihadists orchestrating the attacks in London and beyond are sore losers who want others to be as miserable as they are themselves. They are losing their battles and their war, so preying on the weak is the only sick pleasure that is left to them.

For Western governments, zealous counterterrorism efforts are the primary response. The rest of us can help, though, by keeping moral perspective. Terrorists don’t merit our respect, qualified or otherwise. They are cowards. Don’t let anyone forget it.

New Kind Of Terror In London Sees Potential Vigilante Attacking Muslims,"Late Sunday night, a van veered into a crowd of people in London, sending nine to the hospital. One man has died, although it’s unclear whether his injuries were a result of the incident. British authorities are calling it a terror attack.

But what makes this attack different than the London Bridge attack two weeks ago, the Manchester bombing in May, or the Westminster Bridge attack earlier this year, is that rather than being perpetrated by a Muslim man who had pledged his allegiance to ISIS, it was targeting Muslims.

The attack took place at about midnight on Sunday night, just as worshipers were exiting a mosque in Finsbury Park after a special Ramadan service. There are reports that the driver, Darren Osborne, a 47-year-old-man from Cardiff who was arrested, made anti-Islamic remarks while trying unsuccessfully to flee the scene.

Of course, we don’t know the attacker’s reasons for attacking this specific mosque, but it’s interesting to note that the Finsbury Park Mosque, was once, as The New York Times puts it, “a hotbed of Islamist militants,” although it purportedly reconstituted itself 12 years ago and has a “new ethos,” according to the mosque’s website. It seems likely that Osborne chose this mosque intentionally, although we won’t know for sure until he has been interviewed and more information is released.

When People Think Government Is Failing to Protect Them

What we do know is that Osborne perversely adopted a tactic that the Islamic State recommends to would-be jihadists—plowing into a crowd with a large vehicle—which capitalizes on minimum planning and produces maximum damage. This was the same tactic used in the London and Westminster Bridge attacks, and the same as was used last year in Nice, when a Tunisian man drove a truck into revelers at a Bastille Day celebration, taking the lives of 86 people.

This new kind of terror is an ominous sign for Britain, where the government has proven itself unable to prevent terror attacks after it emerged that the perpetrators involved in the attacks on the concert in Manchester and the London Bridge were already known to British police. Britons are understandably feeling frustrated and don’t believe their government can keep them safe.

With the spike in recent terrorist attacks in Britain and the ever-present politically correct rhetoric from Western leaders that accompanies them, there’s a sense in which something like this was inevitable. The frustration, fear, and anger finally boiled over into one man’s decision to target random and innocent Muslims. Osborne is reported to have said “I did my bit” after bystanders tackled him to the ground.

Sunday night’s attack targeting Muslims comes not only after a spike in terror attacks, but also amid a backdrop of British authorities looking the other way when Muslims commit crimes. That’s exactly what happened with the much-reported Rotherham scandal in 2014, in which men of Pakistani origin ran a child sex ring involving approximately 1,400 girls. British police refused to take action out of fear of appearing racist. Despite widespread coverage and condemnation, last year it came out that the problem was ongoing.

This kind of hyper-sensitivity toward the Muslim community in Britain, and a sense, real or not, among many non-Muslims that there are no consequences for wrong-doing in that community, has left many feeling resentful and impotent.

Resentment Rarely Ends Well

Muslim leaders have long expressed concerns that reporting on terror attacks perpetrated by Muslims and calling out radical Islamist ideology would result in Islamaphobic attacks. But it’s unclear what, exactly, those leaders would have suggested as an alternative. Would it have been better if no one mentioned the motives of attackers who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State?

Probably not. That’s because it’s exactly that kind of censorship and equivocation that has contributed to the anger and resentment many feel in the wake of every new ISIS attack.

Just to be absolutely clear, there is no excuse for what this man did, nor is it the fault of Muslim or Western leaders. Osborne alone is responsible for his unconscionable actions. But in order to prevent future attacks of this nature, and to prevent Britain’s security situation from spiraling out of control, it’s crucial that we understand the environment that contributed to this event.

It’s also important, as we move forward and as we condemn this monstrous act, that we also understand the differences between this and the previous attacks in London. Several news organizations, in reporting this story, have referred to it as the latest in a string of terror attacks in the country, and it is. But it’s an attack of a very different sort that bears noting, and it portends something wholly new.

Although more attacks against British Muslims may come, there’s little evidence so far to suggest any kind of organized group, unified belief system, or ideology motivates any such attacks, present or future. That’s a significant difference that affects both the nature of the threat and how the British police will investigate this and any future attacks.

What the mosque attack does suggest is that Britain is at a dangerous boiling point and that the violence is now coming from both sides of the spectrum. If British authorities can’t prove that they are capable of handling the ongoing threat from ISIS among Britain’s own Muslim citizens—and given the flood of British ISIS fighters returning home, it’s unlikely they’ll be able to—we can expect more of these “counter-attacks” on British Muslims. And that’s the last thing Britain needs right now.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/06/20/new-kind-terror-london-sees-potential-vigilante-attacking-muslims/,2017-06-20
"Islamic Terrorists Aren’t Nihilists, They’re Firm Believers In Evil","Another day, another massacre, and another string of euphemistic eulogies. Aren’t we all tired of this yet? Even in his recent speech in Riyadh, President Trump felt compelled to define terrorists primarily as nihilists, whose actions insult people of all faiths.

This is disappointing and condescending, and hearkens to the tone-deafness of the Obama era. The basic idea is that as long as you believe in anything, you can’t possibly believe in that. The truth, though, seems to be that quite a number of people do in fact believe in that.

Western secularism is derived from Christianity, and is still subconsciously influenced by Christianity in myriad ways. From this perspective, it is difficult to understand that other cultures may think positively of violence and oppression.

Most of us, for example, would affirm that the Westboro Baptist Church is monstrous and has nothing to do with the teachings of Jesus. This leads us, by analogy, to suggest that ISIS is monstrous and couldn’t have anything to do with the “real” Islamic faith. This is a fallacy born of sentimentality. But let’s start by talking about what nihilism is, so that we can see why ISIS and its ilk are not nihilistic at all.

A Brief History of Nihilism

The genesis of nihilism could be traced back to the collapse of both the Enlightenment and Romanticism. Enlightenment thinkers suggested there is an objective meaning of life that can be known through reason, whereas the Romantics suggested there is a subjective meaning of life that can be known through passion. Nihilism begins with despair over both of these projects, and confronts the possibility that life just has no meaning at all. The sense is captured by Fyodor Dostoevsky’s dark question in his novel “The Idiot”: what if the crucified Christ turned out to be nothing but a rotting corpse?

The foremost philosopher of nihilism is Friedrich Nietzsche. He distinguished between two modes of nihilism: the passive and the active. Passive nihilism is characterized by a sense of emptiness and a lack of faith in any and all values; it is a sort of depression where nothing seems worth doing. Active nihilism, on the other hand, refers to affirmatively trying to destroy existing values that are seen as arbitrary or false, so that new, perhaps truer values will be able to emerge. Nietzsche tended to think of himself as an active nihilist, and the subtitle of one of his books is, “How To Philosophize with a Hammer.”

We can also speak of a nihilism of means, where the basic problem is that you will do anything to get what you want. In that sense, ISIS surely is nihilistic. But so is the current president, and much of both the Democratic and Republican parties. It is a nihilism of means to say awful things just to get a rise out of your fans at a rally, and to shut down free speech with riots, or turn into a sycophant for your own “team.” Nihilism of this kind always happens when a man sacrifices his truth at the altar of power, and it seems to be more the norm than the exception. The opposite of such nihilism is only ever personal honor.

A true nihilist of ends would be a sort of paradox. The closest example I can think of is Heath Ledger’s Joker from “The Dark Knight”: a man who wants to return all of creation back to primal chaos, for its own sake, with no further ends in mind. You could say that itself is an end, except he doesn’t care about that, either—hence the looping paradox.

Nihilism may also sometimes be a matter of perspective. ISIS looks like nihilism from the perspective of America, because ISIS is positively trying to destroy the values of America. Likewise, from a conservative perspective, progressives seem like nihilists, because they are trying to undermine the constitutional values that sustain America. But such progressives think of themselves as dwelling on the right side of History. It is thus important to avoid slapping the label of “nihilism” on an ideology just because we disagree with or fail to understand it.

Are You Sick of This Newspeak Yet?

The phrase “Islam is peace” reeks of Orwellian Newspeak. Every time I hear it, I just want to ask: “What makes you say that? Is there any foundation for it beyond wishful thinking?” It should be a commonplace among both Muslims and all other sentient people that Muhammed was not a peaceful man. Nor can the Quran be plausibly interpreted as a peaceful text.

Are we just repeating the phrase over and over again, like some demented mantra, due to the political convenience of doing so? In that case, we would be the ones engaged in a nihilism of means, sacrificing principle for sheer efficacy.

Muhammed was a military conqueror, and numerous passages in the Quran call for the literal death of unbelievers. These are objective facts. When Muhammed speaks of the sword, reason suggests that this is not the same as Jesus saying that he came to bring not peace, but a sword. Jesus is speaking of spiritual struggle; in the only passage involving Jesus and a literal sword, he told his disciple to put it away.

Some Muslims like to think this is also what Muhammed “really” meant. It’s an implausible interpretation, however, given that Muhammed spread Islam with a literal sword, and many of the surahs of the Quran are set within this context of literal conquest.

There are 13 countries in the world, all Islamic, in which apostasy (i.e., leaving Islam) is a capital offense. The subjugation of women is an integral, not peripheral, element of sharia law. We are not talking about extremists, here; we are talking about what almost everyone would agree to call mainstream Islamic nations, such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

Is this what peace looks like, or are these nations not “really” Islamic either? A more pressing question emerges here: is the difference between mainstream Islam and its jihadist variants really a matter of kind, or does it rather resolve itself into one of mere degree?

The Limits of Charity

It is heartening that many Muslims want to believe that Islam is a religion of peace. Good on them, obviously. But in an important sense, this evades the critical problem. Do these countless Muslims the world over also believe that Muhammed, as portrayed in the Quran and Hadith, is an exemplary man?

If Muhammed is reported to have committed violence or even atrocities, then how do peaceful Muslims square this knowledge with their own values, religious or otherwise? Are there points at which they believe it is acceptable to disagree with Muhammed, and for a Muslim to conduct his own life in a different manner, while still remaining a Muslim?

Nihilism and evil are not the same thing, even if they may overlap in the popular imagination.

I imagine many people, including many Muslims, are sick of hearing that ISIS is not “really” Islamic. This is just plain false. Graeme Wood has put it best, in an in-depth article that should be considered required reading for anyone who wants to talk about radical Islam: “The reality is that the Islamic State is Islamic. Very Islamic. Yes, it has attracted psychopaths and adventure seekers, drawn largely from the disaffected populations of the Middle East and Europe. But the religion preached by its most ardent followers derives from coherent and even learned interpretations of Islam.”

Please note: it is not nihilism, or an absence of values; it is a positive system of values that most decent people are inclined to call evil. (Nihilism and evil are not the same thing, even if they may overlap in the popular imagination.) When the Quran repeatedly calls for devout Muslims to kill the infidels, how is it “un-Islamic” when terrorists, well, go and kill the infidels? A reasonable interpretation would be not that the terrorists believe in nothing, but rather that they believe, deeply and radically, in the affirmative commands of the Quran.

At a certain point, it is not charity but rather idiocy to ignore what these people keep affirming about themselves. As Ayaan Hirsi Ali says: “When a murderer quotes the Qur’an in justification of his crimes, we should at least discuss the possibility that he means what he says.” This would seem obvious enough, except in a culture and intellectual climate warped by Orwellian euphemism.

It should go without saying, of course, that I have nothing against the countless Muslims around the world who want to practice their faith in peace and follow an ethos of live and let live. My only question: is Islam, as an ideology, compatible with that? This is a critical reckoning in which the global community of Muslims must engage.

If ISIS is in fact justified by scripture, then what does this say about scripture, and interpretive methods related to scripture? And if ISIS is not justified, then why not? In short, there is need for a genuine reformation within Islam, marked by free critical inquiry and a refusal to turn away from the truth.

It’s Time For A New Qatar Policy That Puts America’s Interests First,"Those hoping for a quick resolution to the Qatar crisis may have to brace themselves for a lengthier slog ahead. After a host of Middle East states singled out the gas-rich emirate in early June over its problematic behavior, the feud appears to have reached a stalemate with the sides settling in for the long haul and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson returning from the Gulf region empty-handed.

While the disagreements stretch back over decades, the current impasse culminated in broken diplomatic relations and severed air, sea, and land links. It represents a far more serious retaliation than that of a few years ago when its neighbors last deemed Qatar to be abrasively paddling in the wrong direction. That dust-up resulted in the Riyadh Agreement in 2013 and additional arrangements a year later. The stern response today is a consequence of Qatar not only breaking those commitments but of stepping well beyond them.

This time around Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt issued 13 demands that Qatar promptly rejected. Their foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman bin Jassim al-Thani, called the demands and their actions, “clear aggression and an insult.” Predictably, the responding statement the four Arab countries released on July 7 was full of fire and brimstone.

The main points of contention involve Doha’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood, coziness with Iran, financial support to Sunni jihadis in the Syrian civil war, and using its state-funded Al Jazeera network as a regime mouthpiece and propaganda tool aimed at undermining its neighbors.

The External Effect

Having applauded the rise and mourned the subsequent fall of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Qatar remains steadfast in its long-running and avid support of the Islamic group, despite the threat it poses to most regimes around the region.

After the Egyptian coup that ousted them from power, many of the Brotherhood’s leaders found refuge in five-star hotels in Doha while, during the Egyptian demonstrations, Al Jazeera reportedly paid them for footage of their protests. The Brotherhood’s spiritual leader, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, has long been a respected guest of Qatar’s al-Thani ruling family, living in the country since 1961. His statements praising suicide bombers who kill Americans and Israelis are also broadcast on Al Jazeera. If that were the sum of all problems, it would be a surmountable challenge

Unfortunately, to grasp Doha’s duplicitous nature, one only needs to turn back the calendar a few months. In Qatar, April brought a visit from Defense Secretary James Mattis and May brought President Trump to Saudi Arabia for the much-anticipated Gulf summit, which included a one-on-one meeting with the Qatari emir. During that period, Qatar’s support for a colorfully noxious arrangement of terrorists was in full bloom.

A week after Mattis visited in April, Hamas scheduled a conference to unveil the ostensibly softer side of their grotesque charter. As the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, the United States, Canada, and the European Union officially list Hamas as a terrorist group but its leaders live lifestyles of the rich and infamous in Qatar. Doha has served as the external headquarters for the terrorist group’s leaders since they left war-torn Syria in 2012. The al-Thani family has provided more cash to the terrorist group than any other country has over the last five years, and Hamas uses the emirate as its private ATM machine. They use the money to build their terrorist infrastructure in Gaza to wage a predictable future round of war with Israel.

The conference, however, didn’t go according to plan. Two hotels, including the Intercontinental Doha, canceled the scheduled event after it became clear that the company “could face penalties for providing material support for terrorism.” But Qatar didn’t blink, so the conference was carried out a little later at the Sheraton Grand Doha hotel.

Meanwhile, in April the regime also showered Iran and Syrian terrorists with far more than rose pedals. They a $1 billion hostage payment that gave $700 million to Iran and its proxies and around $300 million to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a conglomeration of Sunni jihadi groups in Syria that includes al-Qaeda’s affiliate. In fact, they were early to the al-Qaeda funding party, supporting its Syrian affiliate, the al Nusra Front, before the Islamic State declared itself a caliphate to the east. The Islamist tint seen in Syria’s civil war would not have been so vibrant and destructive without Qatar’s contradictory support for multiple terrorist elements.

The Domestic Dimension

Trump’s message in May in Riyadh reasserted U.S. leadership behind America’s traditional allies towards a defined goal, namely, to destroy ISIS and push back on Iran. That, in part, explains why so many in the Washington policy-making establishment have called for sweeping the Qatar conundrum under the rug in an effort to coalesce into a united front that can face Iran.

Those arguments are not without merit. But an additional problem relates to America’s crafting of foreign policy and the public debate most see and read about outside the beltway. It is the vast sums of money Qatar spends in the United States to influence foreign policy through universities, think tanks, and of course, lobbyists. It allows the wealthy emirate that’s no larger than Connecticut to punch far beyond its diplomatic weight.

Angelo M. Codevilla, a fellow at the Claremont Institute, recently detailed those efforts and its effects and concluded, “Qatari investments in America’s foreign policy Establishment have paid good dividends; our investments, not so much.” It suggests what could simply be called a bad deal for the United States. After all, bad advice leaves policy-makers with poor options.

In a recent column in The Hill, Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD), also described Washington’s permissive approach to foreign policy-making on Qatar. According to Schanzer, his think tank, which takes no foreign donations, has “found it challenging to publish our analysis, or even to merely have a debate, often because the topic is a liability (politically or financially) for certain publications and other shops around town.” He concluded, “This wholesale purchase of opinion-makers in Washington has led to an even greater challenge: the acceptance of an unsustainable status quo.”

To the extent there is a public debate, it is in a highly charged atmosphere, fueled by foreign money, and designed to maintain a broken system. Unfortunately, Tillerson’s approach appears to be calling for continued policies that promote the very impasse he’s trying to solve. Moreover, it contradicts the stated goals of the president. It’s no wonder, then, that Tillerson seems to be spinning his diplomatic wheels.

Qatar’s promiscuous foreign policy isn’t just bad for the region, it’s harmful to U.S. interests at home and abroad. To realize the multiple dimensions this challenge presents and only seek to paper over them ensures the same cycle will repeat.

Given the goals President Trump laid out in Riyadh, he should seek a change in Doha’s duplicitous behavior and bring them back into the fold on terms that align more with his vision. That means the deal worth making is a new one predicated on American interests, not the interests of those addicted to both the money and the status quo.

Why It’s Time To Remove The United States’ Air Base From Qatar,"More than a month after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt imposed an embargo on Qatar over its support for terrorism, the tiny Gulf state is lonelier, but just as wealthy as ever. Central bank Governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saoud Al Thani boasted last Monday that Qatar is doing just fine, with $40 billion in cash reserves, gold, and other assets—more than enough to weather the dispute.

The world’s number one liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter has also set up new shipping routes to compensate for the shutdown of its border with Saudi Arabia, stashed billions in local banks, and enticed firms like France’s Total by announcing it will increase LNG output by 30 percent. The success of these measures—and the continued presence of 10,000 U.S. servicemen and -women at Al-Udeid Air Base—suggests the tiny Gulf state will be able to keep on resisting outside pressure and maintain its low-key support for extremist groups.

With Doha more defiant than ever, the United States needs to take more drastic action and remove a crutch that has been propping up the emirate for too long: Al-Udeid. Shutting down the base is one of the few tactics that could convince Qatar to mend its ways. On top of that, closing Al-Udeid would be a powerful way for President Trump to usher America on a new course in the Middle East that he first outlined in a speech during his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia this spring.

The Base Serves Qatar’s Interests Better Than Ours

Trump’s vision for U.S. policy in the Middle East represents a major reset from the Obama years, pushing Arab partners to take their share of responsibility in the fight against terrorism, reaffirming the longstanding alliance with Saudi Arabia, and refocusing America’s energy on confronting state sponsors of extremism like Iran. Moving U.S. troops out of one of the biggest troublemakers in the region would send a clear signal to Middle East partners that Washington is finally getting tough on terrorism again, and is willing to turn its back on deviants.

Trump has already signaled that he’s done with tiptoeing around the issue, tweeting what has been open secret: Qatar supports terrorism. The commander-in-chief calling out Doha for trying to have it both ways is about as strong a signal as the United States could possibly send.

The Al-Udeid base is a huge strategic asset to Qatar: as Dennis Ross put it, the reason Doha hosts the U.S. military is to use our men and women in uniform as a security guarantee to do whatever they like—not, as the Qataris claim, to support a key counterterrorism installation.

In fact, as far as counterterrorism partners go, Qatar has been one of America’s most problematic. The Qataris have insisted to American counterparts for years that they are doing everything to stop their citizens from channeling funds to extremist groups, but they have nothing to show for it. David Weinberg at the Foundation for Defense of Democracy published an extensive report back in January, in which he failed to find a single example of Qatar “charging, convicting, and jailing a US- or UN-designated individual.”

The country is known to have indirectly supported al-Qaeda, Islamic State, and other extremist groups by funneling them ransom payments, most recently for the release of members of its royal family. Paying ransoms like these has been condemned by the UN Security Council and numerous states because paying terrorists encourages more kidnappings.

Qatar Blatantly Supports Terrorists

Qatar doesn’t have qualms about directly financing some terrorist groups, either. The Qataris have been one of Hamas’ primary outside supporters for years, its most significant source of outside funds and the base for its political leader, Khaled Meshaal, directly supporting a murderous Islamist group committed to destroying Israel. The Gulf state also hosted two Taliban officials traveling in and out of Qatar to meet with the “Taliban Five”—dangerous prisoners who were released to Qatar in exchange for U.S. deserter Bowe Bergdahl. Leaked cables reveal U.S. government officials thought the Taliban could use Qatar as a base for fundraising, and Qatar has openly funded al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria—which the UN Security Council has labeled “one of the most effective branches” of the organization worldwide.

Qatar’s blatant support for terrorist groups makes their hosting of the largest U.S. military base in the region—ironically, a nerve center for the fight against Islamic State—an oxymoron, but one the Qatari emir has been able to count on for years. By hosting Al-Udeid, his government is able to hedge its bets under the comfort of the U.S. security blanket. Some might argue that closing Al-Udeid would mean losing a strategically located base, but the U.S. military is more than capable of making up for it with capacities in Bahrain, the UAE, and elsewhere in the region.

The Qataris, seeming to realize the United States won’t be willing to cover for their misdeeds indefinitely, have to hope some other power would put its soldiers in harm’s way on their behalf. As it turns out, one country just might take them up on it: in response to the embargo, Turkey fast-tracked the potential deployment of its troops to a military base in Qatar.

That decision is a show of support from one pro-Islamist regime to another, but Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan would have send thousands of his troops to the Persian Gulf—at the same time the Turkish military reels from political purges—to truly fill in for 10,000 departing Americans. Without the United States and beyond Turkey, Qatar’s list of friends is dwindling to terrorist groups like Hamas and rogue states like Iran. The Qataris can still decide to come in from the cold, but the days of playing both sides are running out.

"1,000 Leftists Gathered To Cheer A Convicted Murderer Who Hates Israel","More than 1,000 people packed Chicago’s International Union of Operating Engineers hall on August 12 for “A Farewell to Rasmea Odeh Featuring Angela Davis.” The event was described as a chance to say goodbye to Odeh, a convicted murderer who will soon be deported for lying to get U.S. citizenship.

Odeh masterminded a Palestinian terrorist group’s 1969 bombing of a Jerusalem supermarket that killed two Israeli college students. Her supporters on Saturday included dozens of progressive advocacy groups and anti-Israel organizations who sponsored the event, such as Code Pink, Jewish Voice for Peace, Students for Justice in Palestine and Black Lives Matter.

The convicted terrorist received well-wishers like the bride at a wedding and paused to meet children like a celebrity. Have your kid’s picture taken with a killer! Attendees appeared to be mostly young and of Middle Eastern descent. Quite a few of the women wore hijabs, but many others wore fully modern clothing. The room was generally young, energetic, organically diverse and united around a narrative that included a common enemy: Israel.

An Attorney Praised Odeh’s ‘Militancy’

Hatem Abudayyeh, executive director of the Arab American Action Network, began the program by welcoming Odeh and Davis. He then thanked Odeh for “her over 50 years of community organizing for the liberation of Palestine.” The bombing for which Odeh was convicted took place 48 years ago.

Odeh’s attorneys were honored and took the stage. Michael Deutsch, a Chicago attorney, said Odeh’s “militancy” had been an inspiration to him. At first, it seemed that word choice might have been a Freudian slip, but as he spoke, it became clear it wasn’t. Deutsch was the first speaker of the night to openly—if carefully—cast terrorism as morally acceptable. He was proud, he said, to “bring out in the federal court and in the public that the Israeli government systematically tortures political people… and most importantly, we were able to put forward the idea that Palestinians have the international law right to struggle against a brutal, illegal occupation by any means necessary.” The crowd cheered.

After a surprisingly good hip-hop act—with the usual messages of Israeli “apartheid,” mass murder, child execution and other crimes, as well as an opportunity for crowd participation by chanting the word “muqawama” (resistance)—the speeches continued. A woman from the Minnesota Committee to Stop FBI Repression spoke about the “injustices” of Odeh’s case and her own case from 2010. This was part of a theme of the evening—that American law enforcement and counter-terrorism efforts are racist and condemnable. The speaker never mentioned who was the U.S. president or attorney general in 2010.

Condemning Israel And Excusing Terrorism

Finally, Angela Davis was introduced. She gave the evening’s main indictment of Israel. Her speech was a disjointed mess of invective against the Jewish state, peppered with attempts to tie her Marxism and fringe non-sequiturs into condemnations of Israel. She criticized Israel for representing itself “as the paragon of democracy in the region. And specifically, the evidence it presents being that it is a haven for LGBTQ communities.”

This elicited a knowing groan from the crowd. Davis continued, “but Israel does not say that it is welcoming to queer Palestinians who call for justice for their people.” LGBTQ Palestinians do, in fact, seek refuge in Israel and often receive it. The cheering that followed her comment suggested this information was conveniently ignored. For a culture that literally kills LGBTQ individuals, that’s a curious argument to choose to go on offense.

While the cheering was muted somewhat when Davis claimed that attendees were gathered on stolen, colonized land (Chicago), it picked back up when she told the crowd that “Palestine, under Israeli occupation is certainly the worst possible example of a carceral society.” She name-checked—to thunderous applause—Assata Shakur, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Leonard Peltier. Odeh wasn’t the only killer the crowd was willing to celebrate.

By the time the woman of the hour was introduced, the crowd was ready for a different feel. Her speech was warm and personal. She left the anti-Israel invective to the previous speakers. But the repeated excuses for violence and terrorism left the impression that she not only has no remorse for her actions in 1969, but feels she is morally justified to be proud of them.

More Than 1,000 Cheered A Convicted Murderer

In the near future, Odeh will be deported from the U.S. The community represented at this event considers this one grave injustice among many perpetrated against them by a government—and society—that hates them. They are awash in victimhood and antipathy for the broader society in which they live.

It is easy and emotionally satisfying to dismiss them and their fringe ideas. But that is a mistake. More than 1,000 people gathered at a union hall in Chicago to cheer a convicted murderer. Ignoring that doesn’t make it go away. It lets it grow.

"Without Evidence, CNN Claims Barcelona Attack Was Charlottesville 'Copycat'","At least 13 people were killed in Barcelona, Spain, today by terrorists who drove a car into a crowd at high speed. Two suspects have been arrested, but only one so far has been named, 28-year old Driss Oukabir, from Morocco. ISIS has since claimed responsibility for the attack.

CNN’s Wolf Blitzer suggested that the terrorists who carried out the attack were copycats of the violence in Charlottesville, where a woman was killed when a car driven by a white supremacist plowed into a crowd of protesters who were marching in opposition to white supremacist rally in the Virginia city.

“There will be questions about copycats, questions about if not what happened in Barcelona was at all, at all, a copycat version of what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia,” Blitzer said. “Even though they may be different characters and different political ambitions, they used the same killing device — a vehicle going at high speed — into a group, a large group, of pedestrians.”

CNN’s Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto suggested that ISIS, the terror group which has taken responsibility for the attack, was taking a page from the Charlottesville suspect’s playbook, a suggestion at odds with the fact that radical Islamic terrorists have used vehicles as weapons for years.

https://twitter.com/DanRiehl/status/898279769174929408

He later doubled down on the idea.

Twice.

I'm aware — Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) August 17, 2017

But it wasn’t just Blitzer and Sciutto desperately attempting to draw a straight line from Charlottesville to Barcelona. CNN’s Peter Bergen directly equated Islamic jihadists with “right-wing extremists.”

“This is the 14th vehicle attack, terrorist attack, we’ve seen in the west since 2014,” Bergen said. “Most of them have been jihadist terrorist attacks but obviously you had the Charlottesville attack by a right-wing extremist just in the past week.”

CNN seems to have forgotten all the times jihadists have used a car as a weapon to kill innocent people by plowing into groups of them.

In London, England, three terrorists killed five innocent people and injured 50 others by running people over on London Bridge and then proceeding to stab them in June.

In Nice, France, last July, 86 people were killed, and a total of 303 people were taken to the hospital when a jihadist drove a heavy truck into a crowd of people who were celebrating Bastille Day.

At Ohio State University, 11 students were injured when a radicalized Islamist student plowed his car into a group of students and then proceeded to stab them with a butcher knife.

In Jerusalem, Israel, four Israeli officer cadets were killed at 15 others wounded when a truck plowed into a crowd of soldiers.

In Berlin, Germany, 12 people were killed when jihadists driving a semi-truck plowed into a crowd at a Christmas market.

AsThe New York Times‘s Rukmini Callimachi notes, car ramming is ISIS’s calling card. Islamic terror groups have repeatedly called for jihadists to mow over crowds of people with cars, as that type of attack is easy to carry out and have done so for years.

Yes, both the Charlottesville suspect and ISIS terrorists have used cars to kill and terrorize, but pretending that jihadists, who have been weaponizing vehicles for quite some time, were retroactively inspired by the horror scene in Virginia last week is absurd.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/08/17/without-evidence-cnn-claims-barcelona-attack-was-a-charlottesville-copycat/,2017-08-17
Trump’s Equivocation On Charlottesville Mirrors Obama’s On Terrorism,"Observers on the left and the right have expressed concern at the increasing hostility of our political discourse. Most commentators want to find ways to deescalate it, but it seems that most don’t even know where to start.

But one possible solution is to look at our mutual hypocrisy as a means to understand the frustrations and concerns of our political opponents. Although Charlottesville is a tragedy that shouldn’t have occurred, the way we talk about Charlottesville provides an opportunity to foster some détente in the public sphere.

Obama Equivocated On Important Issues, Just Like Trump

The left is correct that President Trump is equivocating on Charlottesville (sadly, the name of the city has already become a metonym for white supremacy). But Trump did condemn white supremacy and neo-Nazism—just not in strong enough terms for his critics on the left. His opponents (and many in his own party) are disturbed by his assertion that “both sides” deserve the blame. Though it is still unclear exactly how the protests descended into violence, critics are correct that giving both sides equal responsibility does make it seem as though Trump is partially excusing the assortment of right-wing extremists who came out to protest the removal of the statue.

That said, this type of equivocation isn’t a new feature of the White House. For eight years, conservatives fumed over President Obama’s constant equivocation when it came to radical Islamic terrorism.

Equal distribution of blame and responsibility for the conflict between the West and the Middle East was the overarching theme of Obama’s 2009 speech in Cairo. That speech suggested that 19th century colonialism (rather than terrorism) was the primary cause of the conflict. Furthermore, Obama carefully showed how Israel and Palestine were equally to blame for their tensions and explained that Islam and the Western Enlightenment were equally responsible for the technological advances of modern life.

When it came to radical Islamic terror (foreign and domestic), Obama often insisted, for as long as possible, that we couldn’t know if the event was a terror attack (most notably in reference to Benghazi). When forced to admit that an event was, in fact, a terrorist attack undertaken by a Muslim (or Muslims), Obama and his proxies routinely claimed that there wasn’t enough evidence to determine what motivated the perpetrators to violence. Famously, even in clear-cut cases of radical Islamic terror, Obama would use the euphemism “radical extremism.” Nevertheless, when it came to cases of terror like the one that left nine African-Americans dead at a church in Charleston, Obama was (rightly) comfortable in divining the motivations and ideologies that fueled the attack.

This Isn’t About Whataboutism

The point here isn’t that “Obama did it too!” My aim is to point out a glaring inconsistency. When Obama equivocated on radical Islamic terrorism (an issue of unique concern to conservatives), those on the right were outraged while those on the left saw only a principled, pragmatic nuance that showed a keen mind.

When Trump equivocates on Charlottesville (a metonym for white supremacy, an issue of special concern to progressives), the left (and some conservatives) are outraged, while some on the right see a principled, pragmatic nuance. This mutual hypocrisy (and apparent amnesia) showcases the schizophrenia of the political moment.

So what should we do about it? There are so many issues to be discussed in relation to Charlottesville: the role of sculpture as public art, our collective relation to a shared (and contradictory) history, the value we place upon free speech, how to most effectively counter an ideology of hatred and violence, the role of the police in situations like those at Berkeley and Charlottesville.

But perhaps the most immediate work needed is reflection. In looking at our hypocritical responses, we can see our mutual responsibility for the polarity of public discourse. Progressives can now understand the feelings of anger and frustration that conservatives felt when the President obfuscated regarding the extremist Islamic ideology that resulted in dead Americans in places like Benghazi, San Bernardino, and Fort Hood, Texas.

For conservatives who are waiting for more facts on Charlottesville, or who believe that groups like Black Lives Matter and Antifa do shoulder some of the blame in this particular case, perhaps remembering their own outrage on Obama’s equivocations can evoke some empathy for those who see Trump’s comments as uniquely egregious.

Looking for our own characteristics (and especially our own flaws) in the behavior of our opponents is one way that we can begin to humanize the other side. This is urgent work. It is certain that James Fields (and no one else) was responsible for the death on the street in Charlottesville. But when it comes to our increasing inability to talk to one another, there is blame on both sides.

"With Basilica Revealed As Target, Barcelona Attack Reverberates","The ISIS cell that launched coordinated attacks last week in Barcelona and the seaside town of Cambrils had something much bigger in mind than ramming vehicles into crowds of tourists. The latest reports indicate a group of 12 men had originally planned a series of coordinated explosions, including driving a van packed with explosives into the unfinished Sagrada Familia basilica. But when materials for the explosives accidentally detonated in a house on Wednesday night, the attackers, fearing their cell would be discovered, fell back on driving their vehicles into crowds.

Although observers in the West have celebrated ISIS’ territorial losses in Iraq and Syria as proof it is on the run, the attacks in Spain demonstrate the group’s adaptability and prove it is far from defeated.

What Happened in Barcelona Last Week

On Thursday, a man driving a van ploughed into a crowd of people in a popular tourist area of downtown Barcelona, killing 14 people and injuring more than 100. Hours later, the seaside town of Cambrils was hit with a second attack, leaving one dead and six wounded. The attackers’ vehicle, an Audi A3, overturned and five men emerged wielding knives and wearing fake suicide belts. The men were shot and killed by police. Several more men have been arrested and although police believe they’ve destroyed the terror cell, they are still looking for one of the men, Younes Abouyaaqoub, thought to be the driver.

The two attacks were straight from the ISIS handbook, literally. More than a year ago, the Islamic State issued a guide to would-be terrorists on how to implement a terror attack on a low budget and with minimal planning. One of those plans was to drive a vehicle, preferably a van, into a large crowd of people. The best place to find large crowds is a tourist hub. It also garners the most international attention, which is, of course part of their plan to maximize fear.

This tactic was used most devastatingly in the Bastille Day attacks in Nice last summer, which left 86 dead. Jihadists also used it to plow into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin in December and in two separate attacks in England this year.

Taking ISIS Terroritory Is a Temporary Setback

But unlike those attacks, which appear to have been carried out by individuals acting alone, the Spain attacks seem to be the work of an active terrorist cell. Most of the men involved were born in Morocco and lived in the town of Ripoll near the French border. The former imam from Ripoll is suspected of being involved in their radicalization.

With these attacks, the Islamic State has shown that it’s still very capable of inflicting enormous damage in Europe and, more importantly, that it does not require vast territorial holdings to inspire young Muslim men to do violence in the name of Islam.

What’s more, believers in fundamentalist Islam, who think that Islam is at war with the West—or with anyone outside the dar al-Islam—take a much longer view of history than we’re accustomed to. So ISIS lost most of its territorial holdings. That’s just one phase in a generations-long struggle. The war is far from over and plenty of Muslims, including those returning from fighting in Syria and Iraq as well as those who never had the opportunity to go, still want to fight the good fight against the infidels in Europe and beyond.

Spain Is a Recent Destination for Syrian Refugees

While it’s not surprising that ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, it is surprising that this is the first Islamic State attack to occur in Spain since the group rose to international infamy in 2014. In fact, the last time Spain was the target of an Islamist-related terror attack was in 2004, when four coordinated bombings killed 191 people on trains in Madrid. That was the worst terror attack in Europe since the end of World War II. Since then, the country has been left untouched, until this week.

Other European countries have seen regular occurrences of small-scale ISIS-related terror attacks, like knifings or beheadings, even if those attacks ultimately do little damage. But not Spain, despite having an active Islamist community in Barcelona.

What’s equally notable is that, up until the last few months, Spain has not been hit as hard as other European countries by the migrant crisis. The number of migrants arriving in the country has been very low given the proximity between Spain and North Africa, as well as the historical connection between Spain and the Muslim world. Now, as Italy works to bring migration from Libya to a halt, migrants are seeking alternative routes and Spain is an obvious choice. According to the United Nations refugee agency, Spain lacks the resources to adequately handle the sudden influx of migrants and refugees.

Although Spain is probably not the final destination for migrants given the country’s chronic economic problems, it does represent a new target for ISIS. If the Spanish were ever going to welcome Muslim immigrants, attacks like these are likely to sour them on the topic.

Europe Will React, Also

It’s also likely to continue scaring European nations into restricting their borders as countries like Hungary and even France have already done in certain places. Abouyaaqoub, the remaining suspect in the Barcelona attack, is thought to have possibly slipped across the Spanish border into France. How long before border closures become permanent fixtures of the European landscape?

And what, exactly, will the European Union do about it? One can easily imagine the EU overstepping its bounds and attempting to sanction its core member states over migration and borders even as it largely ignored the broader problems the migrant crisis presented. Such a move would lead to a further rise in anti-EU sentiments and member states voting to leave the union if their citizens think their safety hangs in the balance.

Regardless, this attack is a reminder that ISIS and the religious ideology that motivates its followers will not simply vanish once the Islamic State is driven from its remaining strongholds in Syria and Iraq.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/08/21/sagrada-familia-basilica-revealed-target-barcelona-attack-reverberates/,2017-08-21
President Trump On Afghanistan: We’re Not Leaving Yet,"On Monday night, President Trump finally announced a strategy for southeast Asia with a specific focus on Afghanistan. There has been a lot of anticipation for what the president would do in the region, especially after a presidential campaign in which he repeatedly called for pulling U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, more or less stating that we have no business being there. This was part of Trump’s “America first” vision for the United States abroad.

After his election, however, Trump gave Defense Secretary Jim Mattis the authority to set troop levels in Afghanistan, indicating he would support a more robust policy in that country than previously thought. On the other hand, there were also indications late last month that the administration was considering a wholesale withdrawal, leaving many wondering what the president planned to do and who had his ear.

But Trump made it clear in his speech Monday night that America was not pulling out of Afghanistan and would continue to engage its military to help the Afghan government fight the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and ISIS, and to stabilize the country. Recall that the Taliban has been resurgent in recent years, and currently controls or contests roughly 40 percent of the country, which has remained unchanged for at least the past five months. Some worry these numbers underestimate the Taliban’s control.

The United States currently has approximately 8,500 troops in the country training Afghan security forces and conducting counterterrorism missions. Maintaining the status quo or withdrawing would almost guarantee the Taliban’s ability to surge back into power, reestablishing Afghanistan as a safe haven for terrorism. That’s not what Trump has in mind.

It Wasn’t Just about Afghanistan, Either

The president said Monday night in his primetime speech that America will seek an “honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made,” acknowledging that Americans are “weary of war without victory.” Trump then called out the mistakes of the Obama era, most notably the premature withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 that gave up the hard-earned gains produced by the 2007 surge and left a vacuum that ISIS was ready to fill. Trump promised his administration would not make that same mistake in Afghanistan.

But Trump’s speech wasn’t just about Afghanistan. It was framed up as a strategy for all of southeast Asia and the problem of countries acting as safe havens for terrorists. Trump had particularly strong words for Pakistan:

We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars, at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change. And that will change immediately. No partnership can survive a country’s harboring of militants and terrorists who target U.S. service members and officials. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order and to peace.

The administration sees this as a major change in policy from previous administrations and one it feels the American public desire on a gut level. Why, so the argument goes, should the United States go on supporting and playing nice with a country that sheltered Osama bin Laden and continues to protect Islamist terrorist groups?

No More Announcements of Arbitrary Timetables

So, what about those troop levels? Trump didn’t say. In fact, he specifically rejected the Obama administration’s policy of forecasting its military plans in a given region and setting arbitrary timetables, something Trump brought up throughout his presidential campaign:

A core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions. We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities. Conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables, will guide our strategy from now on. America’s enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out. I will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will.

This is a welcome change in strategy. Obama never seemed to get that by campaigning on then following through with the specifics of planned troop withdrawals in Iraq, he gave Islamist groups (not to mention Iran) a clear timeline. They knew just how long they needed to hold out before they would have their opportunity to pounce.

However, Obama wasn’t the only target of Trump’s speech. Trump also had Bush-era policies in his crosshairs, specifically singling out what he sees as the mistake of trying to “rebuild countries in our own image instead of pursuing our security interests above all other considerations,” a jab at neo-conservative promotion of nation building and spreading democracy. While Trump may have changed his position vis-à-vis troop deployment to Afghanistan, he’s staying true to many of the foreign policy principles he espoused during his campaign, including the idea that American interests do not include installing democratic governments abroad.

While Trump was light on specifics about how many more U.S. troops would be sent to Afghanistan, it’s widely acknowledged that it will be somewhere around 4,000 and not reach anywhere close to peak 2010 levels, which were around 100,000. In fact, plans for any kind of Iraq-style surge to stabilize Afghanistan were reportedly not considered during the administration’s strategy review of the past few months. Any additional troops it deploys will remain part of a mission to train, advise, and support, rather than an Iraq-style counterinsurgency campaign.

So will the relatively small increase in troop levels be enough to get the job done? If not, is this the first wave of successive troop surges, despite the administration’s assurances to the contrary?

Trump Leans on the Generals for Strategy

A few final thoughts about Trump’s speech. First, it was one of the more presidential speeches he’s given, in tone and content. The likelihood this evidences a genuine transformation in the president is unlikely, but it’s a welcome change from his usual improvisational style and inflammatory rhetoric. It’s clear that Trump wanted to highlight the deliberative nature of the review process, drawing a stark contrast with the impulsive nature—or at least the appearance of impulsivity—of many of his previous actions.

In his speech Monday night, he said that in the Oval Office you can’t just go based on instinct, and explained why he conducted a lengthy review of America’s Afghanistan strategy. Perhaps Trump is tired of not being taken seriously and recognizes that to be treated with respect he must act respectably.

Second, it seems that in making this decision about Afghanistan, Trump has taken the side of “his generals.” Another such indication is the fact that Trump referred to terrorists like those that targeted Barcelona last week as “thugs and criminals and predators” but refrained from using his previously preferred phrase, “radical Islamic terrorism.” The shift in vocabulary may be a result of Stephen Bannon’s departure and National Security Advisor H.R. McMasters’ increasing influence in crafting the administration’s emerging Afghanistan policy.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/08/22/trump-afghanistan-not-leaving-yet/,2017-08-22
Trump’s Afghanistan Plan Upends His Promises Against Perpetual War,"“I share the American people’s frustration” with nearly two decades of “a foreign policy that has spent too much time, energy, money, and most importantly, lives trying to rebuild countries in our own image instead of pursuing our security interests,” President Trump said as he began to get to the meat of his Afghanistan strategy speech Monday night.

He then announced his intention to prolong exactly that foreign policy of frustration—indefinitely. This plan is a betrayal of the best of Trump’s campaign-era skepticism of post-9/11 foreign policy. It is a deep plunge into the swamp of imprudent interventionism he once critiqued. It is, above all, a pledge to double down on the bipartisan failures of the last decade and half, making changes only for the worse.

Wrong on All Three Main Counts

Trump’s speech listed three conclusions he has reached about Afghanistan, and it is worth examining each in turn.

The first, he said, is that we “must seek an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made” by U.S. troops on Afghan soil. The appeal of this sentiment is understandable, but it is also fallacious, precisely the sort of comforting untruth Trump insists he eschews. We will not honor lives lost in Afghanistan by extending a costly and often counterproductive intervention that does not contribute to American security. We will not justify sacrifices past by sending new generations of Americans to lose their lives in pursuit of an unobtainable goal.

Trump’s second conclusion is that a “hasty exit”—as if ending our country’s longest war at the 16-year mark could ever fairly be labeled “hasty”—will plummet Afghanistan into terrorist-ridden chaos. The reality, of course, is that Afghanistan is already in terrorist-ridden chaos, and 16 years of American military intervention, often a far grander scale than Trump now envisions, have utterly failed to fix it.

Today, Afghanistan is plagued with corrupt and dysfunctional institutions, an oft-ignored refugee crisis, widespread and growing Taliban control of up to 90 percent of the countryside, and an influx of Islamic State activity. The purchase of tens of thousands of U.S. and Afghan lives and trillions of tax dollars—including real-dollar nation-building expenditures in excess of the Marshall Plan that rebuilt post-war Europe—is continued turmoil and terrorism.

An American exit may well create a power vacuum in Afghanistan, as it did in Iraq. Trump is right on that fact but not in his analysis. The root problem in Iraq (as in Libya, another conflict of which Trump has been correctly critical) was not U.S. withdrawal but rather U.S. intervention: As even former President George W. Bush has noted with regret, our foreign policy missteps abetted ISIS’ rise.

There Is No Such Thing as Victory in Afghanistan

A post-U.S. Afghanistan would unquestionably have terrorist activity, as security expert Barry Posen concedes in a persuasive case at The Atlantic for “making Afghanistan someone else’s problem.” “America has been on the offense for nearly 16 years in Afghanistan and elsewhere and victory remains elusive,” Posen writes. What will be true of Afghanistan after American withdrawal is presently true of Afghanistan under U.S. occupation—and Trump’s criteria for exit as formulated Monday seek an implausible if not impossible end.

In Afghanistan, Trump said, the United States is “killing terrorists” and “will never let up until [they] are dealt a lasting defeat.” This is functionally a guarantee of forever war, a promise that the United States will endlessly pour out blood and treasure attempting to bomb an ideology out of human hearts. In setting this goal, Trump evinces a failure, to borrow the phrase of military historian Ret. Col. Andrew Bacevich, “to distinguish what the U.S. military can do, what it cannot do, what it need not do, and what it should not do.”

The president’s third conclusion is “that the security threats we face in Afghanistan and the broader region are immense” and that it is in the interests of the United States to root out all terrorist safe havens in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and surrounding areas. This is, again, a wildly unrealistic project, but it is also not nearly as protective of U.S. interests as Trump suggests.

This is so on three counts. First, as Bacevich notes, “U.S. forces [are] more or less permanently engaged in ongoing hostilities,” an interventionist roundabout in which “[n]othing really ends” and troops remain deployed without honest assessment of their mission’s progress or lack thereof.

The second problem with Trump’s definition of American obligations in Afghanistan is that U.S. military action too often comes with unintended, detrimental consequences. Independent investigations as well as U.S. military and intelligence officials have long warned that reckless counter-terror measures can creature more terrorists than they eliminate, radicalizing ordinary people who otherwise may have been sympathetic to the American cause. Pause and consider that some of the people the U.S. targets in Afghanistan today were toddlers on 9/11.

New would-be attackers contribute to the third count, which is that targeting terrorist strongholds in the Mideast has at best an indirect and at worst an exacerbating effect on domestic terror attacks like the recent vehicle rampage in Barcelona Trump referenced in his speech. It has been evident for some time now that as ISIS loses territory, it responds by ramping up attacks overseas, both via direct coordination with terror cells and in the form of uncoordinated, lone-wolf attacks that proceed without regard for the fortunes of ISIS proper.

This means is that even if there were vital U.S. national interests at stake here—and to be clear, there are not—Trump’s plan for escalation is not a step toward safety.

Nation-Building Is Nation-Building No Matter Its Label

After his three conclusions, Trump turned to his plans for regional relationships and tactical adjustments. In Afghanistan, Trump said, the U.S. is “not nation building,” merely “participat[ing] in economic development” and “assistance.” We are not “asking others to change their way of life,” he claimed, merely demanding they begin to “pursue common goals that allow our children to live better and safer lives.” It’s potayto, not potahto.

The commonality between Trump’s Monday speech and the Afghanistan policies and statements of former presidents Bush and Barack Obama is worth a moment’s mention. The surge has been done before—more than once. Like Bush, Trump rejects deadlines. Like Obama, he wants to put pressure on Pakistan and claims to oppose nation-building.

Indeed, Trump echoed many of Obama’s exact turns of phrase, cribbing from his first-year Afghanistan speech promises of a “clearly defined” mission that would refuse to provide a “blank check” in denying “safe haven” to terrorists. The promises are even less convincing now than they were eight years ago.

Early in his speech, Trump observed that “the American people are weary of war without victory,” a darkly incongruous preface to his announcement of a plan that will increase that very weariness. Perhaps some of the fault in Trump’s proposal stems from this shallow diagnosis based in a reality-TV metric of wins and losses. The American people are weary of an imprudent foreign policy that goes abroad seeking “monsters to destroy,” that plays a futile and dangerous game of world police, that ignores much-needed constitutional limits. After 16 years, we are weary of war.

"16 Years Later, Why Are We So Uneasy About 9/11?","I didn’t plan to write anything for the anniversary of 9/11 this year, because I figure we’re at the point where we save the extended analysis for round-number anniversaries. It’s something I care about deeply, as longtime readers know, but they will also know that I have written a great deal about that attack and about the War on Terror over the years. Unfortunately, I didn’t think there was much new to say about it this year. But maybe that—the lack of any real closure or any progress toward it—is news in itself, and people are beginning to notice it.

So I was a bit surprised to see how many other people seemed compelled to write and talk about 9/11 on its 16th anniversary, and how unsettled everyone seems to feel about it—more so than I expected. Tom Nichols, for example, asks if we are defeating ourselves. Hint: if we’re still asking that question 16 years later, the answer is probably “Yes.”

Maybe this sense of increased unease is just subjective; I don’t know any rigorous way of measuring it. But I suspect that part of the reason is because this is the first anniversary of September 11 to fall in the era of Donald Trump. No, I don’t mean this as a reflexive dig at his competence as a leader. There is a much deeper meaning to it, which has two parts.

The first is what David Harsanyi has pointed out: after an astonishingly brief period of national unity and bipartisanship after September 11, we’re at each other’s throats more than ever. The political debate got vicious, bitter, and personal in the later Bush years, it got worse under Obama, and Trump’s election—from the chest-thumping arrogance of his supporters to the hysterical “resistance” fantasies of his detractors—has somehow managed to make it much, much worse.

More deeply, however, I suspect people are beginning to sense that this is the first 9/11 anniversary where neither political party really cares all that much about its meaning and legacy—not enough to do any serious thinking about the long-term answer to the threat of Islamic terrorism.

Obama tended to define his approach to the War on Terror by a desire to be the opposite of George W. Bush. He clearly wanted to wash his hands of everything Bush did, but in practice he mostly ended up halfheartedly ratifying Bush-era policies: we stayed in Afghanistan, we kept on using drones, the Guantanamo prison camp was never closed. I used to call his policy “Bush without conviction.” His only major departure was that his total indifference and unwillingness to touch anything related to Iraq caused him to write off ISIS as the JV squad and dither uselessly about Syria, allowing the rise of a powerful new Islamic terrorist organization that has inspired attacks in America and around the world.

But during those years, Republicans put up two presidential candidates—John McCain and Mitt Romney—who were in favor of relatively hawkish engagement in the Middle East against Islamic terrorism and its state sponsors, like Iran and Syria. Voters rejected them, so now Republicans are led by someone who is more like Obama. Trump has boasted about bombing ISIS into oblivion or wiping them out in 30 days (though he hasn’t done either of those things yet), but overall his “nationalist” foreign policy tends to favor disengagement with the problems of the rest of the world.

To be sure, his secretary of defense, James Mattis, and his national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, are serious military strategists who are going to be engaged with the situations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. To the extent that “personnel is policy,” we’re in good hands. But we don’t get the same sense that the overall strategy and prosecution of the War on Terror personally matters to Trump. (What does personally matter to him is a bit of question since he just announced that he’s given up on his signature campaign issue, the wall on the Mexican border.) He seems like he’d rather just wash his hands of the mess in the Middle East and leave it to Vladimir Putin. In terms of policy, he mostly treats 9/11 as an immigration issue, as the justification for a Muslim ban.

So perhaps some of the increased unease about our foreign policy is about having a Republican president with isolationist tendencies. So we’re left wondering who exactly is minding the store on our long-term response to terrorism.

We are uneasy about the sixteenth anniversary of 9/11 because we realize that America has not solved the problem that led to that day and that we are not noticeably on the way to solving it. To be clear, my complaint isn’t that it is taking too long or not being done decisively enough. There’s been a little too much World War II nostalgia that leads to complaints that the War on Terror wasn’t completely finished in four years. There are just too many differences between this war and that one (and it’s a good thing, too, when you consider the horrific casualty rates the Allies suffered). But we should at least be able to have confidence that America has settled on a long-term strategy for dealing with the threat of Islamic terrorism, and that we have remained vigilant in carrying out that strategy.

That is precisely what we know is not happening, not at the highest levels of our political leadership.

My own view on this is horrendously unpopular and nobody wants to hear it, so naturally I’m going to tell it to you anyway. The only president who had good, clear, long-range policy ideas on what to do about terrorism was George W. Bush. The foreign policy grand strategy Bush developed had clear answers on how we were going to fight terrorism long-term.

There would be counter-terrorism and intelligence operations (which is all we have today). But there would also be a policy of seeking to overthrow or bring down state sponsors of terrorism like Iran and the Syrian regime, and of denying terrorists safe haven in chaotic and lawless areas like Afghanistan or (later) Syria. These were the pillars of the Bush Doctrine. Then he had a plan for what to do with those terror-supporting dictators after he toppled them, which was to encourage the spread of representative government and political freedom—the so-called Forward Strategy of Freedom—in the hope of creating new governments that would be reliable allies in the fight against terrorists.

Now, you could argue that Bush stumbled into this policy, which is highly exaggerated but has some truth to it. You could argue that it was naive and that “democracy promotion” didn’t work out in the Middle East, which is difficult to judge because the next administration promptly abandoned the effort. You could argue that it wasn’t worth the cost. This is the side of the argument that has won out. Bush’s strategy is the one idea that everybody has decided was awful and we don’t want to follow.

But in its absence, what have we got? No one has developed any other coherent strategic answer on terrorism. We’re not even trying. So we’ve gone back to a general sense of drift and of ad hoc reaction, of pronouncing our sympathy and resolve in response to a terror attack one day, then going back to business as usual the next. We’ve returned to a September 10 footing, and on some level, I think we all know it.

So we’d better get used to being uneasy about the anniversary of 9/11, because we don’t want to decide upon and prosecute a course of action that would ultimately answer the threat of Islamic terrorism.

'Designated Survivor' Argues Right-Wingers Are Worse Than Islamists,"What Does ABC’s “Designated Survivor” have in common with the Anti-Defamation League’s recent report on right-wing terror groups? Answer: both go to extreme lengths to minimize the threat of Islamist violence and magnify what the ADL calls “right-wing terrorism.”

Last May, as DS wrapped up its first season, ADL issued a new report on right-wing terrorism. Entitled “A Dark & Constant Rage,” the report explores the danger these extremists have posed since 1993. The result makes a compelling case that extremist ideologues are a grave threat to the American public. In focusing attention on this danger, the ADL has performed a valuable public service.

Yet the report goes off the rails in its tendentious comparison of the danger posed by “right-wingers”—comprising adherents of several distinct ideologies, including white supremacist, anti-government, anti-abortion, and anti-Muslim extremists—to that posed by “radical Islamic terror,” and assertion that right-wing extremists pose an “equally serious threat of terror” compared to “homegrown” Islamist terror.

Watch Out for Those Limited-Government Types

DS offers a similar vision of how many people in America today view threats of political violence from right-wing and Islamist extremists. The show’s main character, Tom Kirkman, succeeds from Housing and Urban Development secretary to the presidency after the U.S. government is decapitated by an attack on the capitol.

As Kirkman begins assembling a new government, the nation’s intelligence apparatus fingers an Arab terrorist group for the attack. Kirkman naturally feels pressure to retaliate, but resists until receiving proof in a taped admission by the group’s leader. He fires the new chairman of the joint-chiefs-of-staff for insubordinately ordering a retaliatory strike before Kirkman had authorized it.

It gets worse for the military. Eventually, Kirkman learns the Arab terrorist had nothing to do with the attack besides being paid to take the fall. The real conspirators are right-wingers led by former military personnel. They will stop at nothing to put one of their own in the White House.

Michigan’s National Guard defies Kirkman’s federalization order, insisting his presidency is illegitimate. The show repeatedly depicts the police negatively, whereas American Muslims are portrayed only as innocent victims. In Washington, police stop Kirkman’s Muslim speechwriter on the street and question him, apparently for the crime of looking Muslim. In Michigan, the governor orders police to arbitrarily detain Muslims for questioning, without warrants, and assault them without provocation, even beating a 17-year old to death. And the FBI wants to arrest a reporter about to reveal details of a sensitive investigation and compel him to reveal his sources.

In other words, the world of “Designated Survivor” is one in which:

Right-wing nuts, especially what ADL calls anti-government extremists, pose the greatest danger to the United States.

The military and military-industrial complex are crazed and bloodthirsty opponents of peace, liable at best to ignore and at worst to rebel against the legal government.

Police are ready to junk the Constitution and Bill of Rights.

Focus on Islamist violence is wrongheaded and obscures more serious threats (see above).

Christian Right Depicted as Crazies Also

DS is not unique in espousing views like these. The second-season opener of Aaron Sorkin’s “West Wing” postulated an assassination attempt by white supremacists. Its third season (2001-02), broadcast in the wake of 9/11, incorporated a plotline about Islamist violence, but the subject was nearly forgotten the next season. The fourth season concluded with the kidnapping of the president’s daughter.

Most of the show’s characters, and therefore viewers, presumed Islamists were responsible, but Sorkin later said that had he not left the show at that point, the kidnapping would likely have been attributed to Christian Rapturist fanatics. Just as DS characters assumed Islamists committed the crime only to discover the real criminals were right-wing extremists, the same would have occurred in “West Wing’s” fifth season opener, had Sorkin remained.

Nor have these views been limited to television. Back in 2009, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report emphasizing dangers posed by domestic right-wing terrorists. In particular, the report argued that right-wing groups would try to recruit disgruntled veterans, who thereby posed a threat. Unsurprisingly, many veterans’ groups were offended.

At the same time, the prior administration worked hard to eliminate phrases like “Islamic extremists,” “radical Islamic terrorism,” and “jihadi terrorism” from public discourse, as by having then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and then-counterterrorism adviser John Brennan refuse to say them, and eliminating their like from FBI training manuals.

Have Right-Wingers Killed More than Islamists Have?

In 2015, the New America Foundation (NAF) released a study claiming right-wing extremism had killed more Americans than Islamist attacks since 9/11. The study, and broad media coverage of it (e.g., in Time magazine, the New York Times, Washington Post, and Newsweek) implied that popular concern about Islamist violence was overblown, because “The main terrorist threat in the United States is not from violent Muslim extremists, but from right-wing extremists.”

The widespread coverage belied ADL’s complaint that “Far more attention in recent years has been given to the threat of homegrown radical Islamic terror” rather than “right-wing” extremism. Yet NAF used some sleight-of-hand to beef up its claim, such as excluding 17 murders caused by Beltway snipers John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo.

NAF discontinued its chart in fall 2016, after its own figures showed Islamists had killed substantially more Americans than had right-wingers. The original link redirects to an undated item, “Terrorism in America After 9/11,” which incorporates a chart graphing fatalities from what it calls jihadi and right-wing violence—currently listed as 95 and 68, respectively.

According to the ADL, “Right-wing extremists have killed 255 people” in the 25 years between 1993 and 2017. Of those, 168 were killed in the Oklahoma City bombing, leaving another 87 killed during that time period.

In the same time period, Islamist violence has caused at least 3,078 deaths, including six in the first World Trade Center bombing, 2,977 on 9/11, and the 95 post-9/11 casualties NAF recognizes. In other words, deaths by all right-wing extremist categories amounted to only 8 percent of the number of deaths by Islamists in the past 25 years. That percentage barely changes when including the death this year in Charlottesville at the hands of a neo-Nazi, included in the 95 versus 68 count on the website.

The report tries to finesse this problem by artfully referring to “homegrown” Islamist terror, rather than “Islamist terror” in general. That qualification apparently allows it to ignore the 2,977 casualties from 9/11 and the six from the first WTC bombing. This arbitrary division is deceptive. When considering which ideology is more dangerous to people in the United States, does it really matter that the thousands who died in the World Trade Center’s North and South towers and at the Pentagon were victims of a plot hatched outside the country and carried out by foreign nationals living in the United States? They were victims of Islamist terror, whether homegrown or not; and law enforcement resources are properly detailed to prevent this problem.

Even if the first WTC and 9/11 victims are excluded, Islamists murdered at least 95 people post-9/11. During that same time period, ADL has identified 60 victims murdered by right-wing extremists since 9/11; NAF claims 68. The data still do not support ADL’s insistence that right-wing violence is “equally” serious.

The Left Versus Right Trope Implies Islamists Are Leftist

It’s also unclear why ADL, New America, and others insist on lumping together a diverse group of ideologies, labeling them all as “right-wing,” and juxtaposing them against radical Islam. One could certainly argue that Islamism is itself a type of fascism, advancing what Sen. Lindsey Graham calls a master religion rather than a master race. Why not accept that all extremist ideologies pose a danger, and combat them accordingly? That does not mean any effort to combat the danger must focus on all ideologies simultaneously: the government must triage them, focusing its resources on effectively combatting the most serious threats.

DS’s portrayal of a world in which right-wing violence is much more severe than Islamist violence, and even the ADL’s argument that right-wing violence poses an “equally serious threat of terror” compared to “homegrown radical Islamic terror,” are both sadly misguided faults in what are otherwise enjoyable entertainment and a valuable contribution to knowledge of extremism, respectively.

Overall, and despite a too-intricate plot and a weak season-ender, “Designated Survivor” is well-made and very entertaining. Still, it’s a shame the show seems so determined to blacken the reputations of the military, police, and National Guard, while downplaying the very real threat of Islamist violence.

The ADL report does not go to such extreme lengths. It recognizes that radical Islam poses a danger, but unjustifiably minimizes it, seeing it only as competition for government resources and media attention it would rather see devoted to “right-wing terrorism.” The world of “Designated Survivor” isn’t like the real world, and neither is the world of the ADL report, but it’s what Hollywood and many others think the real world is like. Hopefully, neither will prevent audiences from properly triaging and combatting violence from whatever quarter.

France’s Terrorism-Prompted Restrictions On Civil Liberties Make Sense,"Although it didn’t receive a lot of press, on Sunday in the main train station of the southern French city of Marseille, a man who reportedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” stabbed one young woman in the stomach and slit the throat of another before being shot by police. Both the victims died. ISIS claimed responsibility.

France hasn’t had a large-scale ISIS attack since last summer, but it has experienced numerous small-scale attacks like this. These smaller attacks often result in no casualties and, because they frequently involve knives and cars rather than bombs and guns, receive relatively little media attention here in the United States. In France and across the European continent, such attacks are becoming almost quotidian.

Yet it’s important not to forget that regardless of how poorly equipped or trained the men and women who launch a terrorist attack might be, it is their intention to do as much damage as possible. It’s also crucial to remember that the Muslim followers of ISIS and its religious ideology aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. That’s something the French government, at least, isn’t having any trouble remembering.

Just two days after the Marseille knife attack, the French parliament assembled to vote on a new and controversial counter-terrorism bill proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron. The fast-tracked bill is meant to provide a way for France to end a state of emergency that was first put into place in November 2015, after the attack on the Bataclan music venue in Paris. The state of emergency has since been extended five times.

A Permanent State of Emergency

Under the state of emergency, police have the ability to search homes and properties without a warrant, put individuals under house arrest, impose curfew in certain areas, or forbid gatherings. All this can be done without judicial oversight, in the name of national security.

Macron has promised to end the state of emergency by passing legislation for a new counter-terrorism law. But that bill, which the lower house of parliament passed Tuesday, has received serious criticism. The problem is that the law would simply shift many of the temporary provisions of the state of emergency into permanent ones, making the move largely one of optics rather than substance.

The Human Rights Watch argues the new law will perpetuate the human rights abuses it says have occurred throughout the current state of emergency. United Nations human rights experts say that normalizing emergency powers “has grave consequences for the integrity of rights protection in France, both within and beyond the context of counter-terrorism.”

What specifically worries these groups is the possibility that French security forces will disproportionately and unfairly profile and target Muslims in an effort to prevent future terrorist attacks. That’s because the law would allow the police to assign areas as security zones if authorities perceive a threat, then limit movement within and through that area, as well as carry out searches. Since many of France’s Muslims live in concentrated neighborhoods, especially on the outskirts of cities, it would be easy for police to clamp down on them as it sees fit. What’s more, French police could shut down mosques if they think religious leaders there are inciting violence or encouraging terrorism.

A Perpetual State of War

But that is not, apparently, how French lawmakers by-and-large view the matter. To them, France is under attack and must protect itself. France’s Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told France Inter radio, “We are still in a state of war. We have foiled numerous attacks since the start of the year that would have led to many deaths.” As if to prove his point, police arrested five men in Paris on Tuesday who are suspected of being involved in a failed attempt to detonate a bomb in a swanky apartment building in the 16th arrondissement.

The way Macron and his government see things, the emergency powers are what allowed for preventing another large-scale attack. Without them, France would find itself more bloodied than it already is.

Moreover, France’s problem can’t be solved by travel restrictions because it is largely homegrown. The country is home to the largest Muslim population in Europe, mostly from its former colonies in North Africa, and the relationship between French Muslims and the rest of France is strained, to say the least. Both because of their ostracization and self-imposed segregation, an alarming number of French Muslims have proven open or vulnerable to the Islamic State’s violent mission to attack to the West.

Macron’s new legislation certainly does give the police sweeping powers that could easily be abused, and given human nature, most certainly will be. But French leaders finds themselves in a terrible position. They know that the majority of security threats come from sections of the Muslim population and from some, although not all, of its mosques. France has to be able to address that risk through increased scrutiny and the power to intervene when necessary. At the same time, France is supposed to be a liberal democracy that protects basic civil rights.

Safety Versus Freedom

So how does a nation like France balance a desire to be free with a desire to be safe? It’s the same question that many Americans are asking in the days following the Las Vegas shooting—is our safety worth stripping Americans of their Second Amendment rights? Right now, many on the Left are saying “yes,” as they have been for years. It’s also a question America has had to deal with on surveillance in the years following 9/11 and the 2001 Patriot Act.

But when it comes to Muslims, terrorism, and national security, the United States and France have had very different reactions. While France is moving toward stricter scrutiny of mosques and increased police powers, the dominant U.S. narrative, especially in the media, is that Muslims shouldn’t be scrutinized any more than any other religion is for national security.

We saw this phenomenon manifest itself in the uproar over the Trump administration’s series of travel bans that targeted Muslim-majority countries. It’s also why you often see grandmothers and small children being thoroughly patted down at the airport, as if they represent just as much of a security risk as any other demographic. For better or worse, the United States has thus far resisted the urge to engage in racial profiling, no matter the security risks.

But the United States is not France. It doesn’t have the same perspective or the same experiences (nor, obviously, the same laws or constitutional protections). France has also borne the brunt of ISIS attacks in Europe since the group emerged on the international scene in 2015, and has seen more than 240 people killed by the group’s followers on French soil. Every time a new attack takes place, accusations fly about how the security forces should have seen this coming.

That’s what Macron is trying to fix with this new counter-terrorism bill. The fact is, in the age of ISIS the constant threat of terrorist attacks, both large and small, has become the new reality for Europe. Americans might express their disapproval of the strict measures Macron is proposing, but it’s worth remembering that we in the United States don’t face the steady, seemingly endless stream of attacks that Europeans do today.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/04/dont-quick-condemn-frances-terrorism-prompted-restrictions-civil-liberties/,2017-10-04
Why Are All White People Culpable For Stephen Paddock?,"When I was a young student my father told me a story from his college days. He was a freshman at Temple University and his professor asked for the definition of the word “progress.” Prepared for class, my dad answered, only to be told he was wrong.

Dad objected, saying he had consulted several dictionaries. The professor said, “Young man, I’ve written dictionaries.” It was an important lesson about what words mean and who gets to decide.

Today, American society is locked in such a battle regarding the word terrorism. For several decades the word seemed to have a clear meaning. It involved acts of violence in support of a political agenda. More than that, it required that a group of people who objected to that agenda would be targeted and terrorized. The most obvious example has been Islamic terror, and the killing of innocents in support of its ends.

But in the wake of recent mass shootings by white men such as Stephen Paddock in Las Vegas, progressives have demanded that these incidents also be regarded as terrorism. They see the failure to label them as such as an example of white privilege. Often, as is the case in the recent massacre in Las Vegas, this demand is made before any facts are known about the motive for the shooting.

Yes, It’s Another Race Thing

All of this started out a few years ago as a way to show that people of color carry a racial baggage of representation that white people don’t. When an Arab person commits an act of terror it implicates all Arabs, but white terrorists do not represent all white people. That’s actually a reasonable point. But very quickly, the point started changing.

Now, calling out white people as the a priori and essential problem has become par for the course. This is no longer being used an example of why blaming a whole group for the action of an individual is wrong, it’s being used as the opposite. Now, we should all think this way: race should be the alpha and the omega of how we react to acts of violence.

Note what Shaun King has to say in The Intercept about how white privilege affects our conversation about terrorism, and in his opinion, leads to terrorism: “It also prevents our nation from having an honest conversation about why so many white men do what he did, and why this nation seems absolutely determined to do next to nothing about it.”

Let’s unpack this statement. The basic argument here is that American society teaches white men they deserve to get anything they want. If these white men don’t get what they want, they might shoot someplace up. The problem with this assessment is that tens of millions of white men who don’t get what they want somehow manage not to commit mass murder.

Let’s Define Terrorism

So who is a terrorist? How do we fill this dictionary entry? Here is what I believe progressives mean when they call any white man who commits a mass shooting a terrorist. When we talk about terrorists, we talk about networks. Was the individual connected to a terrorist network? The network in question for white men who commit mass shootings is American society. The argument is that American society is and always has been a terrorist white supremacist enterprise.

This is a vision of America that defies even the slightest scrutiny. This is a nation that has embraced diversity as few if any other nations ever have. We have not been immune to terror, even homegrown terror. The lynchings of the Klu Klux Klan are a permanent stain on our nation’s history. But they are that, a stain, a small mark on the greater fabric of a society that has made real the wildest dreams of freedom and inclusion.

The Left likes to claim that we only call people of color terrorists. This would come as a surprise to the very white people in the Irish Republican Army, who were regularly referred to as terrorists by our politicians and mass media. No, the mantle of terrorist has nothing to do with race, ethnicity, or religion. Terror is an attempt to influence a political process by threatening the people involved. Or it is at the very least an attempt to target individuals on the basis of their identity.

We Need to Know What Terrorism Is

Words matter. This word matters more than most. Terrorism is a thing we allow ourselves to fight without paying too much attention to the rules. So we better know what it is. We better know what we are giving ourselves authority to fight. Punch a Nazi? Stop a campus speech? Tear down a statue? How do you fight terrorism and know it when you see it?

We don’t know why Stephen Paddock did what he did. We might never know. But what we cannot do is allow ourselves to believe, as King apparently does, that his actions were the result of the freedoms that Americans demand for themselves.

Words mean things. But, we decide what they mean. Terrorism is a big one. What do we want it to mean? What are the implications? Who decides? I always remembered that story my dad told me, because it’s basically the most important story. What is a word? It’s what we decide it is. Let’s make a good decision.

You Can’t Call Every Shooter A Terrorist To Make PC People Feel Better,"The calls for gun-control after the horrific mass-murder this week in Las Vegas are predictable, yet understandable, even if you believe their logic or objectives are deeply flawed. But every time something like this happens, an army of halfwits invariably rises to the occasion to make the same utterly inane observation, which goes something like this: “If this guy were a Muslim, CNN would be calling him a terrorist. But that won’t happen because he’s just a white guy!”

Let’s ignore the fact that the mainstream media salivate over any opportunity to associate murder with whiteness and Christendom, and pick the lowest of the low-hanging fruit: the word terrorism has an objective definition, and you can’t just slap the title on every murderer whose demographic irks you.

We start with the basics. Words have meanings. I say “Imagine a green dog,” and you imagine a green dog. Not a red Corvette, not a grey pistachio, and not an empty parking space in a Toys-R-Us parking lot. Terrorism is also a word, and thus has a meaning. I don’t tell my uncle to pass the terrorism at Thanksgiving dinner, because it would not convey the meaning I intended. A terrorist is someone who engages in terrorism. So, similarly, you don’t call a robber a terrorist.

What Terrorism Means, Exactly

But we’ve hit a roadblock. What could the meaning of this word “terrorism” be? To get to the bottom of the mystery, I refer to my handy book of word-meanings (also known as a dictionary in common English parlance). One dictionary defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.” Another says it is “the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion.”

The Federal Code says something eerily similar. It’s as if society has given certain words universal meanings. It calls terrorism “the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.” These definitions cover the breadth of the matter.

Moreover, different dictionaries will give different meanings for the same word, and it is reasonable to associate meaning with a word based on what one of the dictionaries says. But if you never find a dictionary that defines terrorism as a 5v5 team activity in which different participants seek to put a ball through opposing hoops, then it is ridiculous to go around saying that basketball players are terrorists.

Similarly, when some trash-bag of a human being opens fire on a crowd of innocents, it does not automatically make him a terrorist. He is vile, wicked, and profoundly evil, but he is neither a basketball player nor an empty parking space at Toys-R-Us. They are terrorists if and only if their act of murder falls within the semantic bounds of terrorism.

Without a known political or ideological motive and a known intention to coerce, you simply can’t go around slapping the label on mass-murderers for the sake of political convenience. Moreover, you can’t accuse people of prejudice because they are applying the word as the dictionary indicates.

So Let’s Apply This Meaning to a Few Cases

Puzzle solved, case closed. Now we can apply our new knowledge to determine who is or isn’t a terrorist. The Orlando nightclub shooter? Terrorist. The Dallas cop-killer? Probably a terrorist. The Unabomber? Very terroristy. The Las Vegas shooter? Cannot be determined yet—not enough information. What about Dylann Roof? It’s debated, because he fits some criteria and not others.

Remember the Fort Hood shooter? Not officially a terrorist, although also arguably so. You’d be hard-pressed to find a news article or FBI document from the time calling this Muslim guy a terrorist. The media and authorities tend to be consistent in applying this standard. The “epidemic of prejudice in reporting” is basically a figment of the imaginations of grievance-mongers.

This is very simple stuff, yet I regularly see otherwise intelligent folk fail to grasp this very simple stuff. If you’re going to insist on calling someone a terrorist, then at least try to make it seem like you’re doing the whole “word-meaning” thing. The label “terrorist” isn’t a participation trophy—you don’t get to arbitrarily lower the standards of qualification for the sake of making all the kids feel equally included.

It may make leftists sad that mass-murderers of Middle Eastern descent are disproportionately more likely to qualify as terrorists, but no one is implying that the non-terrorist shooter is a better person than he’d be had he been a terrorist as well. So don’t act like the media and authorities are giving these shooters a moral pass. They’re all evil, terrorist or not. But you can’t go around changing definitions for the sake of trying to squash non-existent prejudices.",https://thefederalist.com/2017/10/05/no-cant-just-call-stephen-paddock-terrorist-make-pc-people-feel-better/,2017-10-05
"Red October Happened 100 Years Ago, But Soviet Ideology Lives On","This month marks the 100-year anniversary of Red October, an armed Bolshevik-led insurrection and catalyst for the larger Russian Revolution of 1917. During the ravages of the Russian Revolution, Leon Trotsky, Communist leader and founder of the Red Army, wrote “Terrorism or Communism,” a book scathingly critical of Marxist theorist Karl Kautsky. The book is not just a response to Kautsky’s polemics against the Bolshevik Revolution, but also further justification for using violence as a means to the Bolsheviks’ revolutionary ends.

In his chapter on terrorism, Trotsky denounces Kautsky’s view that by eliminating the free press, the Soviet government, “has destroyed the sole remedy that might militate against corruption… control by means of unlimited freedom of the press alone could have restrained those bandits and adventurers who will inevitably cling like leeches to every unlimited, uncontrolled power.” Considering this seminal work of one of the Soviet Union’s founders, it becomes clear that this ideology has resurfaced in the United States. Whether those practicing the premises of “Terrorism or Communism” know they are doing so is a different question.

‘This Problem Can Only Be Solved by Blood and Iron’

To Trotsky, “The Press is a weapon not of an abstract society, but of two irreconcilable, armed and contending sides. We are destroying the Press of the counter-revolution, just as we destroyed its fortified positions, its stores, its communications, and its intelligence system. Are we depriving ourselves of Cadet and Menshevik criticisms of the corruption of the working class? In return we are victoriously destroying the very foundations of capitalist corruption.”

A civil war was being waged to collapse capitalism. Thus, Trotsky was unconcerned with liberal pillars such as freedom of the press, as this freedom was insignificant within the larger context of a revolution, one in which violence was justified in the quest for a dictatorship of the proletariat. Bloodshed was necessitated on the belief that, “to make the individual sacred we must destroy the social order which crucifies him. And this problem can only by solved by blood and iron.”

The rest, is well, history. Trotsky was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1928 and assassinated in his home in Mexico under the order of Joseph Stalin in 1940. Initial efforts to silence the press evolved, throughout the history of the Soviet Union, into an elaborate system of censorship and propaganda. All speech was loosely interpreted as subversive, and thus the Gulags swelled with political prisoners, especially during Stalin’s regime.

Corruption became a mainstay of the Soviet political system, and continues to pervade Russia today. Russia continually scores low on indices of press freedom, and journalists are silenced or disappear frequently. Vladimir Putin continues to consolidate power. Thus, when considering this bit of Soviet history, two elements present themselves in the context of the modern United States.

The Reasons We Restrict Our Press

The first is restriction of press freedom as required for a lofty, collective purpose. Trotsky believed a free press was unnecessary, considering the violent goals of civil war. What then of a war of a global scale, with arbitrary definitions and a fuzzy enemy: the global War on Terror?

Media outlets have not been shuttered on a large scale in the United States. However, government whistle-blowers were prosecuted at an alarming rate by the Obama administration, with the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies actively spying on and subpoenaing journalists. Pressure placed on journalists in an effort to silence them ­­and discover their sources was ratcheted up during the Obama administration, setting a precedent for all future presidential administrations, including our current president, Donald Trump.

All of these efforts were justified under the premise that press freedom takes a secondary role to the collective goal of fighting terrorism and protecting Americans. Thus, the administration implied that these efforts to silence journalists and their sources was paramount to journalists’ efforts to uncover corruption and abuse of power taking place in the name of the global War on Terror.

Perhaps the modern Trotskyist quote could be: “Are we depriving ourselves of citizens’ criticisms of their government? In return we are victoriously destroying terrorism!” The size and scope of this government action is thus daunting considering the justifications, which reverberate premises used by Trotsky justifying suppressing the free press during the Bolshevik Revolution.

From Free Press to Free Speech

And the second premise? Underscoring the revolution was not only the need to engage in violence to implement the Bolsheviks’ political objectives, but also the need to secure adherence to this political ideology. Eliminating the free press, and subsequently free speech of all types, not only limited societal constraints placed on the Bolshevik revolution, but also ensured society’s adoption of a single ideology by silencing and ultimately eliminating all competing ideas. This idea also seems to have come back into play on U.S. college campuses today.

Student activist groups are continually attempting to prevent and ultimately eliminate speech from campuses that contradicts their own ideas, as well as speech that serves as a possible hindrance to activists’ collective goal of implementing their social justice agenda. Countless cases have occurred (recall Middlebury College and the University of California, Berkeley), in which the announcement and arrival of a speaker on campus has provoked not just protest, but violent protest.

Protest is free speech. Violent protest is an attempt to silence and obstruct. From this we can see that an attempt to silence is an attempt to further a cause by placing it within a vacuum devoid of competing ideas. Academics who support the silencing of other academics with views contrary to their own place themselves among the censors of the Soviet Union who stamped out any thought deemed offensive to the Politburo.

Thus, in this way, the premises conveyed by Trotsky’s “Terrorism or Communism” have replayed themselves to some degree in American society. Granted, this is not on a scale congruent to the Bolshevik revolution. However, the justification of silence for a larger, collective goal is unnerving, both among our government and the growing activist movement in U.S. colleges and universities.

Any effort to infringe on liberty in the name of a collective goal must be viewed with suspicion. History teaches us that liberty truly is a safeguard against violence and a worldview forced upon us.

How Multiculturalism Helps Breed Homegrown Terrorism,"The deliberate and brutal slayings of innocent people in New York City is still fresh and raw for those directly affected. We are family, friends, loved ones, co-workers, and neighbors of the victims, and we weep and grieve with them (and, yes, we pray for them) as they try to understand what has happened, and why.

One explanation for the rise in terrorist behavior in the United States is the insidious and significantly difficult-to-pinpoint problem of failure to assimilate into an adopted culture. It’s a phenomenon clearly present in Western Europe and apparently emerging from the shadows in the United States. By growing evidence, promoting “multiculturalism” is a major culprit. We certainly don’t discount the influence of ISIS’ ubiquitous propaganda, but to be compelling there must be a willing mind.

The New York Times ran an article back in 2011, “Assimilation’s Failure, Terrorism’s Rise,” addressing this very problem. In it, author Kenan Malik persuasively argues for re-examining the effects of institutional multiculturalism. Recounting the events of the July 7, 2007 terror attacks in London planned and carried out by British citizens, Malik identifies the uncomfortable reality when he points out, “The real question is not how people like Mohammad Sidique Khan, the leader of the 7/7 bombers, came to be radicalized, but why so many young men, who by all accounts are intelligent, articulate and integrated, come to find this violent, reactionary ideology so attractive.”

He adds, “To answer it, we need to look not at extremist preachers or university lecturers, but also at public policy, and in particular the failed policy of multiculturalism.” Even though Malik’s arguments center on Britain’s experience with multicultural policies and assimilation failures as the driving force behind homegrown terrorism, there are some striking similarities between what Britain has witnessed and what we are seeing today in the United States.

Immigrating Implies Acceptance of Existing Culture

Whether homegrown or imported, people who embrace extremist behavior such as terrorist acts demonstrate convincing evidence of a failure to assimilate into the culture in which they reside. An August 2011 public opinion survey of Muslim Americans by the Pew Research Center revealed, “A significant minority (21%) of Muslim Americans say there is a great deal (6%) or a fair amount (15%) of support for extremism in the Muslim American community.”

The Pew survey goes on to point out that, “Many Muslims fault their own leaders for failing to challenge Islamic extremists. Nearly half (48%) say that Muslim leaders in the United States have not done enough to speak out against Islamic extremists; only about a third (34%) say Muslim leaders have done enough in challenging extremists.”

The good news is one can surmise 80 percent of Muslim Americans reject extremist behavior. Embracing the moderate, assimilated Muslim community in America is where we want to be. We need moderate Muslims to defeat the extremists. To alienate the well-assimilated Muslim-American communities who are in the best position to step up to the advice, “If you see something, say something,” would be very unwise and counterproductive. Nonetheless, we are in the midst of the predictable consequences of a misguided multicultural experiment, and the results are nothing short of catastrophic.

Multiculturalism is the antithesis of what the United States stands for and the foundational thinking of our founding fathers that sustains America as its own unique society. You see, in the United States, we have a Constitution that establishes the basic tenets of American society and the laws by which we all abide.

So when immigrants come to the United States for whatever reason, they don’t get to supplant U.S. laws with their own, whether Sharia law or whatever strikes their fancy. No one forces or cajoles immigration to the United States. We citizens welcome legal immigrants with the assumption they come of their own free will. That means they come to accept living in the United States with our laws and our culture the way it is, not the way they might want to change it.

Too Many Have Too Easily Accepted Multiculturalism

Multiculturalism eschews this notion, and suggests that if a particular group with a different cultural background wishes to establish and live by their own views of law-abiding behavior, that diversity of thought and behavior within the larger society makes us stronger as a people. More troubling, advocates of multiculturalism maintain all cultures are morally equivalent.

That is hogwash. Ask any refugee seeking asylum here. It’s the total absence of moral equivalence that prompts them to make often dangerous, difficult journeys to seek the safety of the United States.

Then what gives staying power and faux legitimacy to multiculturalism to the point of being almost doctrinaire? Well, multiculturalism is good because advocates assert it is good. Those who take exception to that logic meet an onslaught of invective based on mindless ad hominem attacks. Political and academic purveyors of multiculturalism have so effectively and overly moralized the argument that all cultures and cultural practices are essentially equal, that anyone saying anything to the contrary will be exposed as an enemy of good, and branded an evil racist. The effectiveness of this rests with building consensus; a big-enough group, if you will.

The Federalist’s Stella Morabito wrote an excellent article entitled “10 Resources for Hack-Proofing Your Mind,” in which she points out the vulnerabilities of the human mind to the tyranny of “groupthink.” Groupthink proliferates when there is no room for introspection or questioning, seeking facts, or engaging in objective reasoning to elevate discourse about cultural mores. There is no more emblematic example of “groupthink” than the idea of multiculturalism in the United States. It is an enticing reason for a reluctance within ethnic and culturally similar communities to assimilate into the American culture.

Another Big Factor: Moral Decline

The second influencing factor is moral leadership. An advocate for the understanding of right and wrong and a respected champion of right over wrong who leads from the front is crucial for a country that values liberty and the freedoms we enjoy. There must be a standard for acceptable behavior and a respected standard-bearer.

In the past, we may not have agreed with the political views of our country’s leadership, but we took some degree of comfort from the belief the president and his administration stood for moral values that transcended political motives. President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, “The Presidency is not merely an administrative office. That’s the least of it. It is more than an engineering job, efficient or inefficient. It is pre-eminently a place of moral leadership.”

During President Obama’s term in office, mass shootings in the United States rose dramatically. Though the trend of the last five administrations has been steadily going up, mass shootings during the Obama administration outpaced the others by nearly twice as much.

Mass shootings aren’t the only indicator of moral decay in the United States. In a recent study of the increase in the murder rates generally in major cities from August 11, 2014 to August 31, 2015, The New York Times said that in the ten major cities where the rate increased, it increased an average of 31.8 percent, with Milwaukee, Wisconsin topping the list at 76 percent increase.

There are more teen pregnancies with absentee fathers now than at any time in America’s history, and lack of a present father is linked with increases in aggression and crime in social science data. If fatherless children escape Planned Parenthood’s fetal body parts profiteering, they have a struggle ahead to join the middle class. In large cities and in the country as a whole, the moral compass is missing. The consequence of the lack of clear moral leadership is not lost on the American public.

A June 2015 Gallup poll exploring what Americans believe about the state of U.S. moral, 72 percent believed moral values are worsening. More evocative, 58 percent of those polled who identified themselves as social liberals agreed that moral values are in decline. Of those who claim to be social conservatives, 81 percent think moral values are trending down.

The convergence of terrorism, as acted out in the recent gun violence in San Bernardino and New York City, with the general conditions of a failure of some to assimilate into the American societal fabric, combined with a lack of fathers’ and social leaders’ demonstrable moral leadership is difficult to ignore. We do want to be clear. There is no direct cause and effect relationship. There is, however, the gnawing idea that somehow these social realities are a “new normal” that does not bode well for the future in America.

15 Of The Most Unhinged Responses To The Texas Church Massacre Yet,"At least 26 people were murdered and another 20 were injured by a gunman who opened fire at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas on Sunday. Among those killed was 14-year-old Annabelle Renee Pomeroy, who was pastor Frank Pomeroy’s youngest daughter.

In the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in the Lone Star state’s history, a lot of idiots on the Internet have decided to say a lot of totally unhinged things. Here’s 15 of the most insane responses so far.

1. Praying Is For Losers

Thinking and praying is saving so many lives, isn't it? — Zack Ford (@ZackFord) November 6, 2017

Many have wasted no time to point out that the parishioners who were gunned down on Sunday were sitting in a pew inside of a church when they were killed — a fact they have falsely equated to mean that prayer and faith are totally invalid. You can read why this logic is totally insane and get a quick primer on the basic tenants of Christianity here.

2. Don’t Pray. Don’t Think.

thoughts n prayers for the people who were in a place made for thoughts n prayers when they were gunned the fuck down — Marisa Kabas (@MarisaKabas) November 5, 2017

Prayer isn’t a magic invisibility cloak that shields you from all evil and danger. In fact, the opposite is more often true. Jesus told his followers they would be hated, scorned and face difficulties — even death — for their decision to worship and obey him. Being a faithful Christian means facing certain difficulty, even death, an aspect of life Jesus himself did not attempt to hide from his followers.

3. Suggesting Prayer Makes You A Monster

Apparently Rep. Paul Ryan’s assertion to pray for the victims of the horrible tragedy was just too much for many to handle.

The murdered victims were in a church. If prayers did anything, they'd still be alive, you worthless sack of shit. https://t.co/iGHxPrYrLN — Wil Wheaton (@wilw) November 5, 2017

5. ‘Everything I Don’t Like Is Terrorism’

Others have decided to conflate the tragic events that unfolded on Sunday with terrorism, despite the fact that the shooter’s motivations are unknown. Terrorism means extremists using violent means to achieve a political agenda. We do not know if the shooter was acting to advance a political ideology.

13. Republicans Are To Blame

Sen. Elizabeth Warren is blaming Republicans for Sunday’s tragedy. In Warren’s mind, if you’re a Republican and dare to encourage people to pray, you’re the monster.

Thoughts & prayers are not enough, GOP. We must end this violence. We must stop these tragedies. People are dying while you wait. — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) November 5, 2017

I Calculated Ethnic Groups’ Rates Of U.S. Terrorism. Here Are The Results,"One detail about the recent terrorist attack in New York City has many readers scratching their heads: the perpetrator, named Sayfullo Saipov, was… Uzbek? From Uzbekistan? Is that even a country? After a bit of confused googling, a reader may find that, yes, Uzbekistan is a real, landlocked country in the heart of the Eurasian steppe, a former Soviet country now ruled by an authoritarian government. Oh, and yes, it’s a primarily Muslim country, although the government enforces a quite moderate version of Islam.

Given that a vanishingly small portion of Americans know anything about Uzbekistan, and that the country rarely appears in our news, most Americans will only remember Uzbeks if they were in the news for something bad in the past. Lo and behold, a number of commentators have perceptively noted that a strangely large number of people from Uzbekistan have been charged with terrorism-related offenses against the United States.

Oh, and, while there are no official figures for Uzbekistan, experts believe a substantial number of Uzbeks have joined ISIS, and its neighboring Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyz Republic all have elevated levels of ISIS recruitment. Indeed, many ISIS members from Kyrgyzstan may actually be ethnically Uzbek.

Given all of this, some Americans may think it prudent to have concerns about Uzbek immigrants. But media reports are a poor basis for determining national security policy. We shouldn’t be making immigration or homeland security decisions based on the anecdotes news outlets provide, or in the hysteria surrounding potentially one-off events. Whether gun violence or terrorism, we need a rational, fact-based approach to cut through the media noise and determine where the real risks lie. It turns out, there is quite a bit of data available.

So Let’s Look at that Data in Detail

The New America Foundation produces a comprehensive list of individuals charged or convicted of terror-related offenses from 2001 to today. This list provides basic citizenship data, but, more importantly, it provides names and other identifying information that can be used, with the help of some googling, to look up even more detailed biographic data on each alleged terrorist. Most people concerned about imported terrorism threats are not only concerned with foreign passport-holders, but also the second or third generation descended from immigrants.

To the best of my ability, I have catalogued the ancestry or ethnicity of all 426 alleged terrorists in this data in every case where any news report identified the individual’s ancestry, or the ancestry or immigration status of his or her parents. In the cases where a person was a U.S.-born citizen, if no news report identified parents as immigrants or the individual as a resident in a specific ethnic community, I simply identify them as of U.S. ancestry. I did not attempt to use name-language origin to classify ethnicity for U.S.-born individuals, because many Islamic terrorists change their names. As such, the language of a person’s legal name is not necessarily an accurate reflection of his or her ancestry or immigration history.

Notice as well that I said alleged terrorist. Many of the cases in this sample are extremely debatable. U.S. terrorism law is expansive and unevenly applied: many of the cases involved have not had convictions handed down, and many will ultimately be exonerated. Even many of the convictions are unclear: when a Somali sends money back to Somalia, it may go to an Al-Shabaab member, but is that support for terrorism if that person is also the father-in-law of the money-sender, and the money sent is simply a dowry for marriage? There are lots of disputed cases in this database, so it is vital to recognize that it is a very unclear indicator. We should not rush to too decisive a judgment from imperfect data.

Furthermore, the vast majority of terrorism-related cases in my database do not involve actual acts of terrorism on U.S. soil or against U.S. citizens. Most involve financial support for foreign terrorist organizations, attempts to join such groups, or other “indirect” involvement. The median terrorist plot in this database resulted in zero deaths and was purely financial in nature.

This is important to remember, because it suggests that the marginal case of terrorism is not a clear-cut incident of mass murder, but rather the murky world of international finance, unclear motives, and complex laws. Law enforcement has its work cut out for it, so do I as an analyst, and so do you as a reader: in interpreting the data below, it is vital to remember that (1) many individuals included are actually innocent, (2) some degree of error in assigning national origin is likely, and (3) even the typical guilty terrorist was not engaged in any violent act. If I restrict to just plots that killed people, the sample sizes get too small to make any meaningful analytic conclusions.

So Here Are Those Imperfect Estimates

Once we’ve worked through these problems, we get an estimate of how many alleged terrorists held passports from each foreign country, or were descended from fairly recent immigrants who did. There are lots of ways we can cut the data. I take the number of alleged terrorists by ancestry group, and divide it by the number of people in the United States who self-identified in that ancestry group. This gives us a kind of “average propensity to terrorism charges” for ancestry groups. It’s an extremely rough estimate, but is better to use than arbitrary news reports.

However, this yields some odd results, so I will make some adjustments. Basically, in very small ancestry groups, a single terrorism case can blow out the results. So I will take average of three estimates: the core average propensity estimate, a recalculated propensity where I increase the ancestry-group denominator by 100,000 people, and a recalculated propensity where I increase the number of alleged terrorists by two. I’ll weight the denominator-increase estimate a bit more heavily to insure we don’t unfairly label a low-risk group as high-risk on the basis of just one or two incidents.

The final result is a basic first estimation of where the actual risks of terrorism in America may lie (larger graph at link).

As you can see, there is a far-and-away leader: Somalians in the United States. The vast majority of these are financial support of foreign terrorist organization cases, but some do involve violence on American soil. While the vast majority of Somalians have integrated into the United States very well, it does appear that Somalians pose an elevated risk of being charged with terrorism-related offenses versus all other immigrant groups. I’ve argued before that Somalians may be a case where we should rethink the number of refugees we accept, replacing them with lower-risk refugee origins like Africa or Rohingya Muslims.

After Somalians come a basket of countries: Palestinians, Pakistanis, Sierra Leone, Algerians, Jordanians, Ugandans, Saudis, and Yemenis. Some of these countries, like Yemen, are included in President Trump’s travel ban. But most are not. Several are nonetheless small threats in terms of total numbers: there is just one Ugandan case, three from Sierra Leone, and just two Algerians. I’ve tried to correct for that, but even with my big corrections trying to bump up the denominator on these groups, they still show up as higher-risk.

As for Uzbekistanis

So where does Uzbekistan fall? Well, the Census Bureau’s surveys don’t break out Uzbek nationality specifically, but the “Other Asia” category is mostly Central Asians from Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Among the Central Asian countries, I’ve documented 15 individuals as being charged with terrorism-related offenses, of which 12 are associated with Uzbekistan.

This “Other Asia” category falls well below the high-risk countries, in a second grouping I would label “medium risk,” alongside Kenya, Sudan, Bosnia, Bangladesh, Morocco, Egypt, Afghanistan, Malaysia, Syria, and Eritrea. Individuals from these countries are charged with terrorism-related crimes merely a fraction as much as the high-risk countries, but nonetheless, in the grand scheme of things, they do show a greater risk than, say, immigrants from France, Mexico, Myanmar, or Poland.

Here Are the Low-Risk Countries

The next category, what I’ll call low-risk countries, is still lower, and includes countries like Haiti, Iran, Israel, Ethiopia, Australia, Nigeria, India, and the United Kingdom. Then we get to the “All Other Ancestries” category, which includes the vast majority of Americans, then from there, every other country has lower risk than your typical American.

If we were to admit 36,000 more Uzbeks, it would be reasonable to expect one person to be charged with a terror-related offense.

Viewed that way, it would seem that Uzbekistan is not one of the highest-risk immigrant-sending countries, but it nonetheless does present measurable risks that may be worth guarding against.

However, we need to get a little bit of perspective. Notice the scale of this graph: the highest-risk group, Somalians, has a score of 0.0212 percent. This means that one in every 5,000 or so Somalis is likely to be charged with some kind of terror-related offense. That seems pretty high, honestly; a reasonable person might have concerns with those risks. But the second-highest risk country, Yemen, has that number fall to one in every 9,000. By the time we get to war-torn-Iraq, the risk factor has fallen to one in every 31,000. For Uzbekistan, it’s about one in every 36,000. For Syrians in America, it’s about one in every 80,000.

In other words, if we were to admit 36,000 more Uzbeks, it would be reasonable to expect one person to be charged with a terror-related offense. The most likely outcome of that terror-related offense is that zero people would be injured and zero people would die; however, it’s plausible to consider that the risk could be as high as two people injured and two people killed, if we use averages instead of medians.

To be clear, that’s not one more terrorism-related incident killing or injuring 0-4 people per year, that’s one more terrorism-related incident killing or injuring 0-4 people ever. In other words, falling vending machines and children’s balloons claim more American lives than would admitting 36,000 Uzbek immigrants.

There Is Some Risk, Then, But It’s Small

It’s vital to be clear on what the facts say: there is some real risk to admitting refugees from poorer, Muslim-majority countries like Uzbekistan, and a plausible-scale increase in immigration could indeed yield a measurable amount of additional terrorism-related incidents. However, the scale of those incidents is very small, almost certainly, in the long run, lower risk than any number of daily risks Americans happily brave without a second thought.

The average American still has essentially nothing to worry about from Uzbek neighbors, coworkers, or friends, or additional Uzbek immigrants.

In other words, despite the heinous Islamic extremist attack carried out against innocent Americans by an Uzbek in New York, the average American still has essentially nothing to worry about from Uzbek neighbors, coworkers, or friends, or additional Uzbek immigrants. I have traveled to very few places with people as hospitable and kind as Uzbekistan. It would be unfortunate were Islamic militants to have the last word on what defines an ancient and honorable civilization in American media.

While the advocates of nanny-state-ism may want to establish new rules and regulations to protect us from falling vending machines and the 1 in 41 million chance of being murdered by an Uzbek-origin radical Islamic extremist, the truth is the government and the media would be better off focusing their energy and attention elsewhere.

One last note. The graph I showed above was population-adjusted risk. But if all someone cares about is the total number of incidents attributable to each nationality, then it’s clear what group is the most dangerous: native-born U.S. citizens who’ve had families in the United States for generations. More than half of all terror-related charges since 2001 have been levied against people with no foreign citizenship, parentage, or identifiable ancestry of any kind.

Why Trump Is Right To Designate North Korea A State Sponsor Of Terror,"President Trump declared on Monday that the United States has re-designated North Korea as one of the “State Sponsors of Terrorism.” In his own words, President Trump called this “something that should have happened a long time ago.” He is right.

How North Korea Got On and Off the List

The United States will put countries that repeatedly support acts of international terrorism on the list of “state sponsors of terrorism (SST),” pursuant to three U.S. laws: section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act, and section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act. There are serious, more than symbolic, implications for any country put on the list, including:

A ban on arms-related sales and exports.

Requiring 30-day congressional notification of exports of dual-use goods.

The United States will oppose loans from international agencies such as the World Bank to designated country.

Limiting diplomatic immunity to allow families of terrorist victims to file civil lawsuits in the United States.

Prohibiting any U.S. person from engaging in financial transactions with the government of designated SST country.

Prior to Trump’s announcement, there were three countries on the SST list: Iran, Sudan, and Syria. North Korea was first put on this notorious list in 1987, after its agents planted a bomb on South Korean Airlines Flight 858 and killed all 115 on board on November 29th, 1987.

North Korea has also been known to persistently abduct South Korean and Japanese citizens for decades, especially during the 1970s and ’80s. In 2002, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il openly acknowledged that his country kidnapped 13 Japanese citizens. Tokyo believes that as many as 800 missing Japanese could have been abducted by Pyongyang over the years.

Japan and South Korea are not the only two countries affected by North Korea’s orchestrated kidnappings. A 2014 United Nations report on human rights estimates that North Korea has kidnapped as many as 100,000 people from other countries through decades.

In 2008, during George W. Bush’s final year as president, his administration removed North Korea from the “State Sponsors of Terrorism” list to entice North Korea to return to nuclear weapon negotiations. As they say, the rest is history. North Korea used these negotiations to extract food and fuels from South Korea and the West, while secretly continuing to develop its nuclear weapons.

What Has Happened Since 2008

Removing North Korea from the SST list in 2008 failed to achieve its objective. The negotiations never bore much fruit. Instead, they provided North Korea with time and resources to continue accelerating its nuclear weapon development programs. Since 2008, North Korea has conducted five successful nuclear tests: 2009, 2013, in January and September 2016, and August 2017. Technically, North Korea is already a nuclear power.

Pyongyang has also made progress toward making a nuclear warhead small enough to attach an ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile), with the goal of reaching the United States. There is also evidence that Pyongyang is working with other “State Sponsors of Terrorism” such as Iran in illegal weapon trades and nuclear weapon development. Thus, Pyongyang’s nuclear weapon program has presented a grave security threat not only to people in the United States and South Korea and Japan, but also to the rest of the world.

Pyongyang has done more to terrorize people than its nuclear weapon program. In February 2017, Kim Jong-Nam, the half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, was assassinated by two women hired by North Korea agents at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. His assassins used VX nerve agent, a lethal chemical weapon banned by the United Nation.

In June, North Korea returned 23-year-old U.S. college student Otto Warmbier to his parents in a coma. Warmbier passed away just a few days later. There is sufficient evidence to believe Warmbier was tortured while he was illegally held by the North Korea authorities. North Korea still holds three Americans, one Canadian, and six South Koreans as political hostages.

The world should wake up by now that North Korea’s human rights abuses are closely linked to its nuclear ambitions. A regime who cares so little for its own citizens’ welfare won’t give two bits about citizens from other countries, or hesitate to deploy weapons of mass destruction to induce maximum harm to humanity.

What to Expect Now

It’s absolutely the right thing to do for President Trump to put North Korea back on the SST list. The day after he re-designated North Korea, the U.S. Treasury Department revealed a new round of sanctions. President Trump’s tweets may sound crazy and out of the norm sometimes, but his series of policy moves on North Korea has proved those who called him a “war monger” wrong.

Trump has shown a laser focus on dealing with North Korea, from increasing sanctions to pressuring China to do more. He has systematically deployed non-military options while demonstrating U.S. military strength through military exercises with U.S. allies. Just this month, the president deployed three aircraft carrier groups to the Pacific in an immense display of American strength. The message to North Korea should be clear. Trump’s multi-faceted policy toward North Korea is a clear break with America’s feckless approach of the past.

It’s true that we don’t know if any of these policies will stop North Korea’s nuclear ambition. But history should have taught us that appeasement of evil only puts the world in grave danger.

DC Metro Canceled All Religious Ads In Fear Of Terrorism,"My November 30 article covering a lawsuit against Washington DC’s transit system began: “Keep the cash in Christmas. That was the message the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington received from the D.C. Metropolitan Transit Authority when the archdiocese attempted to buy ad space on Metro buses for its ‘Find The Perfect Gift’ campaign.”

In the lawsuit, the archdiocese argued that by refusing its ads, Metro violated the church’s First Amendment and due process rights, and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. At the time, the archdiocese’s case seemed a pretty clear example of anti-religious animus and viewpoint discrimination. However, two happenings in the last week cast new light on Metro’s advertising guidelines that ban political and religious displays, and its use of those rules to reject the Catholic archdiocese’s “Find The Perfect Gift campaign.”

First, on Friday, when federal district court judge Amy Berman Jackson denied the archdiocese a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, she detailed the rationale underlying Metro’s decision to ban political and religious advertisements, writing:

The [Metro] Assistant General Manager for Customer Service, Communications, and Marketing also averred that she heard from the Metro Transit Police Department and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that running certain issue-oriented ads could pose security risks on trains and buses. One of the factors that spurred [Metro] to close its advertising forum was the submission of an ad featuring a cartoon depiction of the Prophet Mohammad. Drawing the Prophet Mohammed is highly offensive to Muslims, and [Metro] was aware that the ad was drawn at a contest where two gunmen were killed in an attempt to prevent the event.

But why then also ban the “Find The Perfect Gift” campaign ad—an advertisement that does not disparage? From a legal perspective, the answer flows from First Amendment jurisprudence, which grants governmental officials the right to control access to a “nonpublic or limited forum,” such as advertisement displays on government property, “based on the subject to be discussed as long as: the lines drawn are reasonable given the purpose of the forum involved, they do not favor one viewpoint over another, and they are consistently applied.”

Had Metro opened the “limited forum” of bus advertisements to the subject of religion, it could not then discriminate based on the content of the proposed ad. In fact, the archdiocese’s strongest argument for reversal stems from Metro allowing advertisements that promote the commercialization of Christmas while rejecting the archdiocese’s religious perspective of Christmas; or Metro’s acceptance of yoga-soul-saving ads, while refusing the church’s Christ-saving message.

The archdiocese, which filed its notice of appeal with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals yesterday, will likely stress these facts in seeking to overturn the district court’s decision. However, in arguing that it is entitled to an injunction to compel Metro to run its ad, a recent development will give the appellate court pause to interfere with Metro’s decision. Monday’s detonation of a pipe bomb by a terrorist inside a New York City subway passage.

According to The New York Times: “Law enforcement officials said the attacker, identified by the police as Akayed Ullah, 27, chose the location because of its Christmas-themed posters, a motive that recalled strikes in Europe, and he told investigators that he set off his bomb in retaliation for United States airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria and elsewhere.”

Unfortunately, the Homeland Security warning that prompted Metro’s new advertisement policy proved prescient. Whether banning ads is the proper response to the threat of terrorism, though, is another question. When they come for Baby Jesus, secular society may stay silent, but what’s next? The ads for alcohol that Metro voted to allow last year to offset the revenues lost from the banned religious ads? People of some religious sects consider alcohol offensive. With every new warning, will Metro continue to contract the scope of permissible advertisements?

In seeking to protect its right to religious liberty, the archdiocese inadvertently exposed a bigger threat to all liberty in the age of terrorism: self-censorship.

"After NYC Bomber, How Can The U.S. Better Identify Domestic Terrorists?","At 7:20 a.m. EST on Monday, the suicide vest worn by 27-year-old Akayed Ullah detonated at a Port Authority bus station in Manhattan. This increased the pile of radical Islamist terror attacks that have hit the United States this year.

While Ullah was badly injured and three other commuters sustained non-life-threatening injuries, countless other rush hour commuters around the scene at the time of detonation were thankfully spared. Former New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton confirmed on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Ullah had acted in the name of ISIS.

Ullah is a Bangladeshi man who has been in the United States for approximately seven years. He joins the ranks of domestic terrorists radicalized within U.S. borders before carrying out attacks inspired by the Islamic State terrorist group. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described Ullah as “disgruntled,” and confirmed that Ullah taught himself how to make the deadly “low-tech device” with wires, a pipe bomb, and a battery pack.

While radical Islamic terrorists continue to set their sights on intimidating the western world, the question remains as to what traits domestic terrorists who are radicalized within our borders share and how—if at all—clearer trends are helping identify potential threats.

Building a Profile of Domestic Terrorists to Predict Threats

Former assistant secretary of state Kim Holmes confirms that these traits exist, and that many terrorists radicalized in the United States are young men born overseas and brought over by chain immigration or through the gravely flawed visa lottery. Many more, he says, are the product of Muslim parents born overseas who emigrate to the United States but refuse to assimilate, fostering feelings of alienation and resentment and making them prime targets for radicalization.

“Many of these guys are being recruited online and by radical clerics. Like we saw with Ullah in New York, they don’t even need elaborate support structures,” Holmes says. “These are alienated, frustrated, and violent young men who are looking to belong to something, and that makes them prime targets.”

Holmes said we can look to Europe for data showing the threat of radical Islamic terrorism increases year by year, with a total of 15 plots or attacks in 2014, 38 in 2015, 59 in 2016, and 30 by May of this year. That number is even more daunting when you look at global statistics: between January 2014 and May 2017, there were a grand total of 142 radical Islamic terrorist plots recorded across 15 different countries in Europe alone.

“These guys are looking for ways to justify their violence and find a sense of belonging,” Holmes said. Twenty-eight-year Army Special Forces veteran and former Pentagon top dog Col. Steve Bucci echoed Holmes’ frustration with chain migration: “Look at the case with this guy in New York – he came to the states because his uncle was already here. Chain migration is something that was defined very broadly under the Obama administration. This [Trump] administration hasn’t tightened it up just yet, but they are talking about how to do that effectively.”

Importing Low-Skill People Can Lead to Trouble

Bucci also noted that most “remotely radicalized people” are unemployed or underemployed. “There’s a reason for that; they’re not the sharpest knives in the drawer. Most have frequented radical websites and have picked up the ideology from there. These are people who are wounded and are looking to be associated with something. Isolation, alienation, low income or no income all play a factor here.”

As global terrorism strategies evolve, so too should our defense, security, and intelligence strategies, says Lisa Daftari, an award-winning investigative foreign affairs journalist and editor-in-chief of The Foreign Desk.

“I’ve always deterred people from using phrases like ‘lone wolf terrorism’ or ‘homegrown terrorism’ because these guys are getting information directly from terrorist organizations online,” she says. “We saw this with Ullah: he had been downloading material and had been an online ISS fanboy since 2014. It’s not ‘homegrown terrorism’ when this information is originating in the caliphate.”

Daftari agrees with Holmes and Bucci about the role of economic factors: “Usually, someone who has a job and a life isn’t thinking about strapping a bomb to themselves and blowing something up.”

It’s clear, according to these experts, that Islamic terrorists radicalized within the U.S. do share a host of commonalities. Unassimilated, alienated, underpaid, or unemployed young Muslim men appear to be most vulnerable to radicalization, and chain migration seems to frequently assist these potential terrorists to come to the United States.

But what do we do in the wake of these attacks? Identifying the common threads that bind these terrorists together is an important first step, but does this make potential threats any easier to spot? To put it another way: how do we do a better job of stopping these guys before they kill more innocent people?

Nobody Has a Crystal Ball

Bucci puts it best: “It’s really tough. Larger events, like 9/11 for instance, require a lot of training and a lot of backside support, but our law enforcement, intelligence, and operational capabilities since then have been doing a great job at keeping those guys at bay and finding them before they’re able to carry out something that big. It’s a bit of a tradeoff: do you use manpower and resources to focus on the bad guys going for a huge homerun, which we catch around 99 percent of the time, or these low-level folks who are able to carry out less devastating events but who are harder to keep an eye on?”

Holmes says there are two predominant approaches to domestic terrorism: Urging action, even if we don’t know for sure what will be effective, or urging people to learn to live with the heightened uncertainty as a fact of life.

“Politically correct liberals want us to live with it, with this constant threat of radical terrorism, but the fact is it’s getting worse, so at what point do you change your mind?” he says. “Is it after 143 global attacks? 243 attacks? 343? Liberals’ underlying argument here is that it’s not yet bad enough to do something to stop this, but that implies that working to stop terrorism somehow makes it worse.”

Holmes and Bucci say part of the solution involves a delicate dance between increasing security measures and avoiding infringing on the civil liberties and rights of civilians.

“We should be asking police and law enforcement officials to discuss every crazy idea they come up with regarding how to spot these guys preemptively, because there may be one or two ideas in the bunch that folks will feel comfortable with constitutionally that could give the good guys the edge they need,” Bucci said. Holmes adds that local courts are exercising too much authority in waiving immigration laws.

“The courts are intervening with president Trump’s travel ban on very shady constitutional grounds. We’re at the point where local judges are making foreign policy calls. Where did they get that authority? We sort of glide over that like it’s any other day in America, but that’s not what the courts are for,” Bucci said.

Daftari says education, awareness, and acknowledgement are the most important factors in fixing America’s domestic terrorism problem: “This isn’t going to change whether we have a Republican or a Democrat in office. Until Left, Right, and center view terrorism, national security, and our relationship with foreign policy as a non-partisan issue, all of us are at risk…Radical Islamic terrorists aren’t looking to bomb and kill the alt-right or the progressive left; they’re looking to bomb and kill Americans. We need to be prioritizing safety and security over political correctness.”

It’s Time To Stop Enabling The Terrorist Palestinian Movement,"Consider this nightmare: Imagine that the United States helps create a militant regime hostile to individual liberty. Suppose this U.S.-funded, authoritarian regime becomes notorious for inciting violent attacks. Now imagine that Washington enables jihadists to gain political power within the regime. Then the authoritarians and jihadists join forces.

Chilling? Yes. Irrational? Yes. Far-fetched? Sadly, no. That, in a nutshell, is America’s actual relationship with the Palestinian Authority, a state-in-the-making. To fathom how we ended up in this absurd situation, look at America’s approach to the Palestinian movement.

A core problem is that our intellectual and political leaders push aside the need for a serious moral assessment of the Palestinian movement’s nature and goals. They disregard, play down, even whitewash the movement’s hostility to individual freedom. The situation today is the result of a bipartisan failure across many years.

Giving a Terrorist the Nobel Peace Prize

In the 1990s, the United States helped establish the Palestinian Authority, a transitional quasi-state designed to become fully sovereign. It was supposed to be a step toward a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. Its first “president” was the arch-terrorist Yasser Arafat, who led the Palestinian movement. With an indifference to genuine moral judgment, the Clinton administration brushed aside Arafat’s heinous crimes and militant agenda, embraced him as a peacemaker, and whitewashed his vicious record.

Why? The Palestinian movement claimed it would recognize Israel and end the campaign to destroy that country, the region’s only free society. Those promises were empty, yet Arafat became one of the most frequent foreign visitors to the White House and co-winner of a Nobel Peace Prize.

Instead, since its birth the Palestinian quasi-state has been yet another brutal, militant Mideast dictatorship, mocking the rule of law and methodically violating the individual rights of its own subjects. It has enabled and sponsored Palestinian attacks on Israel. In the first decade of its existence, more people were injured or killed in Palestinian attacks than in the preceding quarter-century, by a factor of two.

Despite these facts, the United States and European patrons played down the regime’s authoritarianism and militancy, and continued backing it. Washington has lately given it about $400 million a year.

George W. Bush’s administration compounded the problem. Bush, like Clinton, endorsed the goal of a fully sovereign Palestinian state. While the United States had for years given de facto backing to that goal, Bush was the first formally to go on the record in support of it. Despite his reputation as a morally principled leader, we have Bush to thank for handing Palestinian jihadists greater power.

Ultimately Bush was embarrassed into admitting the obvious fact that Arafat was a “committed terrorist” when the Palestinian Authority, in the midst of waging a terror war on Israel, was caught smuggling in a 50-ton arsenal of weapons and explosives aboard a freighter.

Bush called on Palestinians to bring to power new “leaders not compromised by terror.” Yet the White House insisted on allowing the jihadists of Hamas to field candidates in a 2006 legislative election. In doing so, the administration disregarded abundant evidence that jihadists were ascendant across the region and within the Palestinian community. Washington shut its eyes to the moral significance of that fact.

Funding Terrorism. What a Great Idea

The jihadists of Hamas made their name by out-martyring rival factions with suicide bombings, proof of the group’s uncompromising commitment to destroying Israel. Hamas won the 2006 election by a landslide. Hamas leaders were now entitled to play a role in controlling the Palestinian Authority.

Lest American dollars reach the blacklisted jihadists, the Bush administration scrambled to “isolate” Hamas financially. Soon, however, Hamas and Fatah (which runs the Palestinian Authority) waged a gangland-style civil war. They remained at odds for a decade, until recent talks of a “unity” deal.

Like Bush, Barack Obama continued to normalize the Palestinian Authority, despite its ongoing violation of individual rights and incitement of violence. The PA’s current “president,” Mahmoud Abbas, is in the second decade of a four-year term in office. Yet, like Obama, Trump has hosted Abbas at the White House, granting him the moral status of a reputable political leader.

If a recently proposed“unity” agreement goes through, the two major Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, may reconcile. Thus: a militant authoritarian regime that Washington helped create and bankroll could become honeycombed with jihadists, who’ve redoubled their commitment to wipe Israel off the map.

That prospect is one more marker of the moral bankruptcy in America’s approach. By negating the need for objective moral judgment and acting on it, our policymakers have landed us in a dead-end situation that sells out our ideal of individual freedom and harms our regional ally, Israel.

We need to begin undoing that pattern. For a start: Stop normalizing the Palestinian movement. Stop playing down its crimes and vicious aims. Stop pretending that Fatah is somehow well-intentioned—an idea refuted by its murderous, tyrannical history, not to mention its openness to allying with Hamas. Let’s recognize that the Palestinian movement is deeply hostile to individual freedom, and treat it accordingly.

5 Worst Echo Chamber Talking Points About The Iranian Uprising,"The Iranian people are in the midst of their largest protests since the 2009 Green movement, and many on the Left don’t seem especially thrilled about the prospects of a free Iran. The muted reaction is partly due to a troubling trend of justifying and excusing Islamic fascism in a broader and confused attempt at signaling tolerance. But almost surely an even more powerful factor is the need to protect Barack Obama’s legacy and criticize Donald Trump.

While we don’t know what will happen in Iran, or what we can do about it, it’s clearer than ever that our funding, legitimatizing, and propping up the Iranian regime — one that is now killing peaceful protesters who are demanding economic opportunity, freedom, and secular governance — was morally and politically tragic. (This includes imaginary “moderates” and mullahs alike.) Rather than further isolating and economically stunting the regime, Obama gave it cover.

It’s important to debate, not because we need to re-litigate the past (although why not?), but Democrats still believe the Iran deal was worth it. Rather than unequivocally supporting a movement that demands freedom, the Obama administration’s Echo Chamber, initially silent, has some talking points for you.

Nothing to See Here

The initial coverage of these historic protests—or in some cases, the lack of it—was scandalous. The New York Times’s Thomas Erdbrink, in particular, veered into revolting Walter Duranty territory. Looking back at the paper’s coverage of Iran, it’s unsurprising.

“For many years,” the reporter wrote only last month, “many Iranians were cynical about their leaders, but that is changing thanks to Trump and the Saudi crown prince.” Every unfiltered report from Iran told a different story.

Actually, thanks to Trump, the Times’ coverage swerved unconvincingly from “The protests are only small and and not worth your attention’” to “These protests are about economic woes and have nothing to do with political disputes and are not worth your attention” to the “Violence is the protesters’ fault because they won’t listen to the regime’s calls for calm.” All of this is particularly offputting when you consider how hard some in the media worked to make the Iran deal a reality.

Be Quiet!

“Be quiet about freedom and oppression” is really the Democratic-liberal foreign-policy mantra right now? Really? — John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) January 2, 2018

The first inclination of many liberals was to demand Americans shut up about a movement that demands self-determination and liberalism. Why? Whenever Trump fails to weigh in on a world event, the Left accuses him of implicitly endorsing fascism. Yet when the administration offers a statement condemning the Iranian regime, a long-time committed terror-supporting adversary of the United States, the same folks who daily call out Russian authoritarianism advise the president to ignore those protesting for freedom.

On the first days of the demonstrations, The New York Times ran an op-ed by former Obama administration official Philip Gordon, a long-term proponent of strengthening the regime’s “moderates,” arguing that the best thing Trump could do for the Iranians was to be quiet like Obama had been in 2009. This was repeated by a number of liberals, some claiming we had no moral authority to lecture anyone on freedom, which is, of course, absurd.

The more sophisticated case went something like this: If we encourage the protesters, the regime will begin to blame outsiders for agitating the situation and this will make the protesters look like saboteurs. This might come as a surprise to some people, but the Iranian regime has been blaming imperialists and Zionists for all their troubles for many decades. Yet protesters still chant, “No Syria, no Gaza, we’d die only for Iran.” From what we know, in fact, it seems that one of the key grievances of the demonstrators is that they’re sick of Iranian regime creating enemies around the globe rather than concentrating on their people at home.

What if the protesters don’t want the help? For starters, we don’t know what they want us to do. They may still detest United States, but that doesn’t mean we can’t advocate the cause. Perhaps, and this might sound nuts, they may appreciate others who advocated for their liberty. Perhaps that will win them over? And perhaps one day we can ask them how they felt about Gordon and others in the Obama administration legitimizing the regime that now threatens their lives.

Meanwhile, Obama’s silence did nothing for the Iranian people. The world’s silence does nothing. Just because the United Nations calls for an emergency meeting every time a Jew builds an extension on his bedroom in Jerusalem, doesn’t mean the United States has to follow suit. Sanctions hurt the Iranian regime. And the threat of new U.S. sanctions that target the Revolutionary Guard, which has its hand in much of the economic turmoil and answers only to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has, according to The Wall Street Journal and others, put Iranian government “in a corner.”

It’s About Them, Not Us

The Iranian people are rightfully demanding dignity, less corruption, more opportunity, and greater control over their lives. In looking at US twitter, it seems lost on too many that this is about what Iranians want for Iran, and not about us. — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) December 31, 2017

The Echo Chamber likes to make the Iranian protest sound like the Women’s March. Well, some of the Iranian protesters — the bravest of them — are also demanding freedom from theocracy, something Ben Rhodes will likely never mention. Nor John Kerry, nor Samantha Power, nor Hillary Clinton, nor anyone who tweeted out this talking point. Americans, they say, shouldn’t make this about themselves, but rather the aspirations of the Iranian people (which they misrepresent).

Fortunately, most human beings have the capacity to concern themselves with multiple events. How we react is important because Democrats constantly peddled what we now know is a false choice: war or the Iran deal. There is a restive population in that nation demanding freedom. We knew this in 2009, when we were told that the uprising was merely about voting irregularities, and we know it know.

A free Iran would be one of the most momentous events in the past 20 years. Yet, rather than tighten economic sanctions and undermine the regime, Democrats did everything they could to strengthen it. This includes the Obama administration ignoring the uprisings of 2009, releasing Iranian spies, slow-walking and shutting down investigations into Iranian criminality, and paying ransoms. These are political decisions made by a party that seeks to regain power here in the United States.

So why isn’t every supporter of the Iran deal being asked why he voted to fund Hassan Rouhani and the mullahs?

Well, We Didn’t Fund the Protest-killing, Terror-supporting Islamists, We Were Just Unfreezing Their Assets

I am wondering how many folks are aware that the money the US sent Iran as part of nuclear deal was actually Iran’s assets to begin with. It was their own money we returned. It wasn’t tax payer money. — Matthew Dowd (@matthewjdowd) January 1, 2018



For 30 years, both Democrat and Republican administrations managed to freeze funds that we procured in a dispute over a failed arms deal signed before the 1979 Islamic revolution that deposed the shah. Until, that is, the Obama administration decided to secretly send more than a billion dollars in various foreign currencies in unmarked planes as ransom for American hostages. Between those two events, Iran held 52 American citizens hostage for 444 days, was likely responsible for the death of another 500 American servicemen fighting in Iraq, and her proxy killed 220 Marines and 21 other service personnel in Lebanon.

None of this takes into account Iran’s attacks on allies, support of our enemies, funding of terrorism, and suppression of its own people. We don’t owe this iteration of Iran, a nation that has ignored international agreements for decades, anything. On what moral grounds does Dowd believe unfreezing the assets of a group that funds terror acceptable? The truth is, this talking point is simply meant to rationalize the tragic underpinning of the Iran deal.

But Trump…

We stand with the Iranian people so much that we won’t let them come here. https://t.co/fzbv8idiiJ — Samantha Power (@SamanthaJPower) January 1, 2018

Many echo-chamberists, who only a few days earlier were arguing that we should concentrate on the Iranian people or just shut up, attacked Trump’s support of Iranian protesters as a vacuous since he supported a travel ban for a number of suspected terror-supporting states, including the Islamic Republic.

It should be pointed out that none of these people, Power included, ever said anything as tough about Iranian fascists the Obama administration coddled for eight years. But Iran in fact offers a great example of why travel bans may be necessary. The Iranians refuse to cooperate with the United States on terror and security risks, because they are the security risk. Iranian nationals have not only been sent here to spy (the Obama administration released or slow-walked investigations into 14 of them, at least) and to create criminal enterprises through their terror proxies (the previous administration shut down those investigations), but to recruit other Iranians to assassinate ambassadors and blow up embassies.

Now, though we shouldn’t overestimate our ability to help the protesters, one wonders how this situation would look if Power and others hadn’t been so accommodating to Iran. Once the regime is gone, surely we can have open travel like we do with most other peaceful nations.

President Trump Has A Clear Shot At The Iranian Regime,"Over the past week, a new wave of anti-regime protests has broken out in Iran, and it could not have happened at a more opportune time. Following the defeat of ISIS in Syria, this gives America the clearest shot we have had in a long time at helping the Iranian people take down a dangerous and oppressive dictatorship. Please, please, please let’s not mess this up.

I describe this as a “clear shot,” because this is not the first time the Iranian people have risen up against their rulers. But each time it has happened before, America has seemed too distracted or blinded to do much about it.

The Islamic Republic—which is not a republic but a theocracy—has been on thin ice for a long time. It has often been observed that Iran was a rapidly modernizing and relatively liberal country before the Islamic Revolution in 1979, which in a way explains the revolution, as a backlash against all that modernity. But by the same token, the Iranian people have always chafed under the restrictions imposed by the mullahs, and have been trying to undo the Islamic takeover ever since, whenever public dissatisfaction reaches a boiling point.

Since the end of the Iran-Iraq War, mass protests have broken out every ten years or so. They flared up for a while in 1999 and into the early 2000s, but we were too absorbed by our conflicts with Iraq—which were not invented by George W. Bush but simmered throughout the 1990s—and by 9/11, in which Iran was not directly involved, so we had no casus belli for focusing our attention on that regime.

Bush believed that creating a successful democracy in Iraq would help undermine the Iranian regime, but by the time the Iranian uprising came in 2009, the Obama administration had decided to always do the opposite of the Bush administration. They were so intent on cozying up to the regime and striking a diplomatic bargain that they pointedly ignored the Green Revolution. Then they got distracted by the civil war in Syria and the rise of ISIS. This is undoubtedly one of the reasons the Iranian regime likes to light fires across the Middle East: to keep everyone’s attention tied up elsewhere.

Yet the underlying causes of the dissatisfaction with Iran’s rulers didn’t go away. An oppressive regime is constantly producing new reasons for the people to hate it, from arbitrary restrictions on their behavior, to the predatory kleptocracy of regime insiders, to massive official corruption and incompetence, to squandering the people’s wealth and sustenance in military adventures that serve the regime’s goals but have no compelling connection to the national interest. All of these are themes expressed by the current protesters—particularly the money Iran has spent to prop up the Assad regime in Syria while cratering the economy back home.

This indicates the big overlap between the protests in Iran and American interests. The Islamic Republic is a notorious state sponsor of terrorism that constantly tries to export its revolution, supports anyone who hates America, and has built a network of proxies and satellites throughout the Middle East. Currently, the sphere of Iranian influence goes through Iraq, where Iran supports and controls Shiite militias; to Syria, where it has provided so much support to the Assad regime that some are calling it an Iranian takeover of Syria; to Lebanon, where Iran is the main sponsor of the Shiite state-within-a-state run by Hezbollah, which it is currently trying to whip up into a new war against Israel.

In response—and in the absence of any substantial American leadership during the Obama administration—Saudi Arabia has been trying to gather together Arab and Sunni forces in a kind of Cold War against Iran, including a possible nuclear arms race. I don’t think I have to explain to you why this is not a good thing.

I have pointed several times to a startling graph showing how the number and deadliness of wars across the world dropped off precipitously after the collapse of the Soviet Union, revealing the degree to which Communism was an engine of conflict. (We American warmongers were still around and stronger than ever, yet strangely we failed to keep all of the wars going.) The Iranian regime is a similar engine of conflict, if on a smaller scale. Imagine the peace dividend that could follow from its fall.

Better yet, this new uprising comes at a time when ISIS has been defeated and its foreign fighters have gone underground. There will be hell to pay when they get back to their home countries, but for now there is a lull. There is nothing to distract us from supporting the Iranian protesters and helping them topple the regime.

Unless, of course, we distract ourselves. President Trump started, well, using Twitter—appropriate in this case, given the role of social media in Iran’s protests—to proclaim his support for the uprising.

Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 1, 2018

Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2017

The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their “pockets.” The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018

Just as the Obama administration was obsessed with doing the opposite of the Bush administration, so Trump is strongly motivated to do anything that is the opposite of Obama. In this case, that’s a pretty good rule of thumb. So far, Obama-era CIA Director John Brennan has harshly criticized Trump’s approach, which is the best endorsement he could hope for.

But our mercurial commander-in-chief has since become distracted again. When North Korean dictatorship Kim Jong-Un made an indirect nuclear threat against the United States, which happens every other Tuesday, Trump took the bait and responded by boasting about the size of his button.

North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018

In fact, the likelihood of war on the Korean peninsula has been decreasing lately. For the Kim regime, rattling the saber is also their way of rattling the tin can, angling for financial support from South Korea, China, or the United States. It’s their shtick. But Trump can’t resist a petulant battle of boasts, so he has to go chase that squirrel.

We can only hope that the administration’s response to the uprising in Iran will follow the same pattern as our war against ISIS, which we quietly won while the president was tweeting about other things. We won against ISIS because we had competent strategists in top national security positions who were focused on the issue and not distracted, even by their own commander in chief. Let’s hope they can maintain their focus on Iran, too, because there are a lot of things the United States can do.

One of the measures, as Eli Lake points out, is to publicize the names of dissidents and protesters who are arrested, and to make all Western relations with Iran—both diplomatic and economic—dependent on their treatment. “The model here is the late-Cold War diplomacy with the Soviet Union, when US envoys made the treatment of dissidents there a feature of every other encounter with this dictatorship of the proletariat.” To the extent that the West can use this kind of publicity to shield dissidents from the worst forms of retaliation, we can help break down the Iranian people’s fear of the regime.

Helen Raleigh provides some more substantive suggestions, including giving protesters and dissidents material support, whether overtly or covertly, particularly focusing on technology that will help them communicate and get around the regime’s crackdown on the Internet, social media, and messaging apps. In effect, we should do for the Iranian opposition what we did for the Solidarity movement in Poland in 1980—and on the same time scale, if necessary.

It is also time to seize the assets of regime officials and supporters. The latest wave of protests began after the Obama administration gave Iran $100 billion in frozen assets as part of the failed nuclear weapons deal, and that money promptly disappeared into Iran’s foreign adventures and a vast morass of official corruption. The Iranian people noticed, and so should we. It’s time to take back as much Iranian money as we can get our hands on and seal off the regime and its supporters from the international banking system and the international economy.

Finally, we need to recognize that this is only the beginning of a long process. A few tweets won’t do the job. If their role in Syria is any guide, the Iranian regime isn’t going down without a bloody fight, even if they have to go to war against their own people. Get ready to back a new Iranian revolution with arms, training, intelligence, and even air support—or sit back and watch the Middle East collapse into chaos on a scale bigger than the disaster in Syria.

It may take years. It may take more focus than the president has shown so far. It will certainly require vigorous, careful, patient effort on the part of this administration’s top strategists. It will also require this administration to very prominently undermine the interests of Russia, which has adopted Iran and its Syrian satellite as the center of its sphere of influence in the Middle East. But the rewards are enormous.

It’s not often you get a chance to undermine, not just the power of your enemies, but their entire ideology and model of government. That’s what is at stake here. The young, reform-minded Saudi crown prince who has been consolidating his power put it this way recently:

After the Iranian revolution in 1979, people wanted to copy this model in different countries, one of them is Saudi Arabia. We didn’t know how to deal with it. And the problem spread all over the world. Now is the time to get rid of it. We are simply reverting to what we followed—a moderate Islam open to the world and all religions. Seventy percent of the Saudis are younger than 30. Honestly, we won’t waste 30 years of our life combating extremist thoughts, we will destroy them now and immediately.

This is exactly the sentiment being echoed by Iranian protesters who are denouncing the Islamic regime and demanding a secular government. Now imagine what the Middle East might look like if the big regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran is over which country can be more modern, secular, and liberal.

Maybe it’s a long shot, but so was the Reagan administration’s effort to undermine the Soviet Union. It’s definitely worth a serious effort, if we don’t let ourselves get distracted.

"Heroes Discuss Real-Life, Acting Roles In Eastwood’s ‘The 15:17 To Paris’","The story came and went in 2015 with the freight-train speed of our 24/7 news cycle. Three 20-something friends, two serving in the U.S. Armed Forces, were traveling on summer vacation. A Moroccan man boarded the train they were on, concealing an AK-47, a pistol, a box cutter, and 270 rounds of ammunition.

An extraordinary series of events led Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, and Alek Skarlatos to neutralize the would-be terrorist, despite being unarmed. On Friday, director Clint Eastwood brings their story to the big screen in “The 15:17 to Paris.”

Dirty Harry—er, Eastwood—is known for the grit he lends biopic films. In “Sully,” Tom Hanks played the titular commercial airline pilot America knows from the “miracle on the Hudson.” Bradley Cooper donned fatigues to portray Navy SEAL Chris Kyle in “American Sniper.”

This time around, the director takes a new approach. “It made us nervous when Clint asked us to play ourselves!” says Sadler. The 20-something African-American man recently graduated from college, two years after the harrowing incident. “He told us he did not want us to take any formal acting training, because he wanted the vibe and energy of the movie to be as true as it was when we lived it.”

Stone notes how quickly the film follows on the heels of their best-selling book. “Usually it takes five to seven years for any incident to get made into a movie,” he says. “The fact that it’s only been a little over two years is another crazy part.” Sadler and Stone spoke via phone in an interview; their friend Skarlatos, a former National Guardsman who also played a key role, was unavailable.

The film delves into the three men’s years-long friendship before their 2015 heroics. They note those bonds of loyalty to each other reflect how they were raised. “It’s actually the last thing my dad told me before we left,” recalls Sadler. “He said, ‘No matter what happens, just have Spencer’s back.’ He didn’t know that it would come to us being on a train with a terrorist.”

Terror on a High-Speed Train

On August 21, 2015, the three friends boarded a train in Amsterdam. They had traveled to Europe to enjoy excursions over the last week of summer. As the train sped across France at 186 mph, two of them dozed off in the afternoon sun.

A shot rang out and a train employee sprinted past them, heading to the front. The commotion woke Stone and Sadler. They peered into the train car behind them, which carried about 30 passengers. “The first thing we see is the gunman picking up the AK-47 off the ground. Within seconds, Spencer [Stone] is already getting up and running at him,” Sadler said.

Stone, who had enlisted in the U.S. Air Force three years prior, says his proactive stance reflected what he learned in training. Seeing the shirtless man brandish an AK-47 gave him a clear sense of the situation. But it didn’t go down how he feared it would. “As I ran up to the terrorist, he was able to point and fire the gun at me,” says Stone. “But it didn’t fire. It was a bad primer in the bullet. That rarely happens.”

Even when the terrorist was neutralized, the airman took further action. A former medic, Stone gave life-saving critical care to another passenger who had been shot. Clearly that faulty AK-47 saved many lives. “If that gun had went off, I would’ve dropped as soon as I got up,” continues Stone. “Probably the situation would not have ended the way it did. We feel like God protected us in that moment.”

The three friends often bring up what they view as the providential nature of the events. As dramatized in the film, Stone, Sadler, and Skarlatos first became inseparable when they met during their elementary years at Freedom Christian School in Fair Oaks, California. Sadler’s father continues to serve as a local Baptist pastor, and all three profess a strong Christian faith.

“All these factors went our way,” says Sadler of their train heroics. Among several inexplicable coincidences, he cites how the three almost stayed longer in Amsterdam and changed seats midway through their train ride. “We feel we were being used by God,” he notes.

Their defense of other passengers contrasted the assailant, Ayoub El-Khazzani. The captured terrorist initially claimed he found the weapons in a park and planned to rob the train only to get his next meal. “You don’t need an AK-47 and nearly 300 rounds of ammunition to do that,” says Stone.

He elaborates: “A few months later, he was linked to the terrorist cell that planned the Bataclan theatre attack. He grew up with those guys in Morocco. He was confirmed ISIS and part of a pretty radicalized extreme group.” Currently, El-Khazzani remains in custody in France, awaiting trial.

On a train carrying more than 500 people, not a single life was lost that fateful August day. A publisher soon came calling for a book deal—and it was just the beginning.

Hollywood Fast-Tracks Story of Bravery

The three friends were everywhere over the next year. French president François Hollande awarded them his nation’s highest honor, naming them Knights of the Legion of Honour. President Obama hosted them at the White House.

In June 2016, they were honored as heroes at the Guys Choice Awards. They first saw Clint Eastwood in the green room backstage before he presented their award. “We knew that real-life movies are his specialty, obviously,” says Stone. “So we all came up with a quick plan. One of us said nonchalantly, ‘We’d love for you to direct our movie.’ Of course, at this point we had no movie!”

‘It was like we were just hanging out with each other and a film crew just happened to be there.’

The small-town friends felt way out of their league. “He said, ‘Here’s my address. Send me your book and I’ll see what I think about it.’ It went from there,” recounts Stone. Warner Bros., which has a long-term deal with Eastwood, soon announced “The 15:17 to Paris” as a major motion picture.

Despite the recent rise of biopics, some critics still consider the film risky. After all, Eastwood cast the heroes as themselves—without any acting tutelage. “It ended up being a genius move on his part, because it made us really comfortable as we were shooting the film,” says Sadler. “It put us there again. It was like we were just hanging out with each other and a film crew just happened to be there.”

“Believe it or not, almost everyone is playing themselves in this movie,” says Stone. “You’ll see the same train employees, the same guy driving the train, a lot of the same police and medical team who brought me off the train two years ago. We just couldn’t get the terrorist.” The two guys crack up at the remark. “He’s busy doing something, he’s got a tough schedule,” offers Stone.

Filmed on-location in the United States, Italy, the Netherlands, and France, the three friends were thrust into the center of a big-budget production. They’ve sought to remain grounded despite the accolades.

“We hope the film depicts us in a way that shows just how ordinary we are,” says Sadler. “Alek and Spencer have military experience, but we’re pretty regular. Ordinary people can find themselves in a situation and they can have what it takes to do something extraordinary like this.”

With all the speaking, travel, and media appearances, Stone admits he had let himself go a bit. His trainer on the film got him back into military shape, losing 38 pounds and putting on 15 pounds of muscle.

“The boy got a little hefty in the last two years!” he confesses with humor in his voice.

Old-School Values Inspire Greatness

Following their heroics, commentators like Mona Charen of the Ethics and Public Policy Center praised their values of honor and self-sacrifice as a much-needed throwback in a culture that often marginalizes masculinity. “Their military training prepared them for violence,” wrote Charen. “There is all the difference in the world between using violence aggressively and using it defensively.”

‘These are values we credit to our families. If those values are not a part of the new wave, we’re still part of the old wave, I guess.’

The men are quick to praise others involved in the incident, notably Frenchman Mark Moogalian, who was shot, and British businessman Chris Norman. “Chris came right on time with four neckties in his hand,” recalls Sadler. “He pinned down the terrorist and hog-tied him, as we’ve seen in all the media coverage.”

Yet in a roundabout way, the three accept her assessment. “We have always been raised to be aware of our surroundings and to value each other’s friendship,” says Sadler. “These are values we credit to our families. If those values are not a part of the new wave, we’re still part of the old wave, I guess.”

As to what’s next, the two military men were honorably discharged before filming started. “It’s been a crazy ride,” says Stone. “When you get out of the military, it’s still a shock—no matter who you are or what position. I’m glad I’ve been able to progress.”

He notes all three of them gained so much from the filmmaking experience, they’re now pursuing other roles in film and TV. “We’ve all fallen in love with acting now, and we want to make a run at it,” he concludes.

They hope audiences worldwide find deeper meaning in their fast-paced story, Sadler says. “The message of the film is really right there in the trailer: that ordinary people can do extraordinary things.”

“The 15:17 to Paris” opens in theaters nationwide on February 9.

‘The 15:17 to Paris’ Shows The Imprint Of Clint Eastwood’s Masterly Hand,"Sometimes a felicitous film seems more a natural occurrence, half magic and half accident, than a deliberate product. By most accounts, “Casablanca” is an example of this. But there are times when you simply know a master’s hand is at work. In the case of “The 15:17 to Paris,” that hand belongs to director Clint Eastwood.

The film is based on the events of August 21, 2015, when three Americans touring Europe, two of them soldiers on leave and all of them childhood friends, overcame an Islamic terrorist attacker, Moroccan Ayoub El-Khazzani, who boarded a high-speed train to Paris armed with a sack of deadly weapons. El-Khazzani was equipped with an AK-47, an automatic pistol, a box cutter, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

Imagine being trapped, weaponless, on a speeding train while an Islamic terrorist makes his way down the aisle with a machine gun. In stopping the terrorist, the three men, Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos, and Anthony Sadler, along with the passengers who aided them, likely prevented a horrific bloodbath and dozens of murders.

There was one causality that day. Dual-citizen French-American Mark Moogalian, heroic in his own right, yanked the machine gun from the hands of El-Khazzani, then was shot in the back of the neck by El-Khazzani with a pistol as he tried to move away. He dropped the gun, and the jihadist picked it back up. It was then that Stone charged El-Khazzani. After overcoming the terrorist with the aid of Skarlatos and Sadler, Stone behaved with cool-minded heroics and stopped the blood flow from Moogalian’s neck artery. It was a bravura performance of courage and competence.

Meanwhile Skarlatos and Sadler, with the help of British businessman Chris Norman, secured the terrorist and his weapons. The three Americans reacted as a unit, forged in friendship. It is clear that, even with Stone leading the charge, it was teamwork that stopped El-Khazzani cold in his tracks, thus saving many lives.

These raw events from that day in 2015 are the foundation Eastwood begins with. There is also a given that the memory of the events is relatively fresh in the minds of many audience members. Obviously, one could hire actors and tell the story in a conventional manner. One could also make a documentary. Eastwood does a little of both, and it proves an inspired choice.

First, he makes the perhaps surprising decision to use the men themselves as his actors. Ordinarily, this might be disastrous. Acting is not easy. As a man who married an actress, I can attest to my wife’s skill and commitment to developing her craft. My own cavalier attitude toward the craft changed when she challenged me to take classes from one of her mentors, the great Ed Morehouse, who taught for many years at HB Studios in Manhattan. It was humbling, and I’ve never bad-mouthed the actor’s trade since.

Eastwood, of course, knows this very well. But he must also have been aware of how fresh the images of these young men are to many of us. Then there is the fact that these are three fairly good-looking dudes in real life. So Eastwood went with the real guys. There is precedent for such a stunt. For instance, Medal of Honor winner Audie Murphy plays himself in the uneven, but watchable 1955 biopic, “To Hell and Back.” Of course, Murphy had appeared in numerous films before “To Hell and Back,” including John Huston’s “The Red Badge of Courage.”

Eastwood’s decision to use the guys mostly pays off, although there are trade-offs. The dialogue is wooden. A good part of it seems to be either improvised, or taken directly from the prose of the book the men wrote (with Jeffrey Stern) about the incident. This is particularly evident in the static scenes of character and backstory development. Stone and Skarlatos and Sadler’s sports talk seems canned. But by letting the men use their own words, Eastwood coaxes natural delivery and realistic, unstilted physical action from them.

Meanwhile, Eastwood uses flashbacks that add nuance and context to a climax that occurs quickly in real time. For instance, we learn that, while Stone’s courage seemed to be present from the get-go, his competence was hard-won and a long time coming.

It seems all three boys had problems fitting in as they were growing up, and were often in trouble with teachers and administrators. The children playing the three in middle school, William Jennings, Bryce Gheisar, and Mikél Williams, do a serviceable job, especially Jennings as young Spencer. In fact, the three middle school amigos came together as the odd-men-out while visiting the principal’s office of their Christian academy.

The faculty of the school do not come off at all well. Their mothers, on the other hand, come across as faithful, godly, protective of their sons, and quite heroic. Played by actresses Judy Greer and Jenna Fischer in the movie, they are the sources from which the courage their sons later display likely originated.

This flashback sets up the key scene in the film. After graduation from high school, Stone has let himself go physically, and is leading a bit of a directionless life. He and Sadler are sitting around watching a game, when Stone informs Sadler that he plans to join the Air Force and become part of a specialized para-rescue unit. He has told Skarlatos as well, and is surprised when neither friend reacts strongly to the news. Sadler then nonchalantly delivers his verdict on Stone’s chances. “It’s not that we think you can’t do it. We just don’t think you will.”

Instead of whining or falling into depression after this epic putdown by a buddy who incontrovertibly knows him well, Stone decides to change things. He drops forty pounds. He gets into excellent physical shape. But all, it seems, is to no avail when he does not quality for Air Force Para-rescue due to his lack of depth perception, something he cannot fix by hard work. When he subsequently washes out of Air Force SERE training, it seems the old problems from middle school have returned to drag him down. Perhaps Spencer Stone was born to fail.

Yet Eastwood carefully chronicles the incremental improvements and hints of the fortitude and competence Stone is developing because of his repeated disappointments. After a blown treatment attempt on a first-aid dummy, we watch as Stone asks the right questions and learns how to correctly treat traumatic bleeding. We see an instructor talk him through how to apply a proper jujitsu hold to the neck to knock out an opponent — and we see that, though frustrated and initially clumsy at it, Stone does not give up until he has the technique figured out.

The story is told in flashbacks from two points in time: as El-Khazzani’s attack unfolds, and from various points in the European travels of the three men leading up to their boarding Thalys number 9364 to Paris together on that fateful August day. Ray Corasani does a scarily good job of depicting El-Khazzani, and the passengers on the train, including Moogalian and Norman, are mostly played by the real people who were there. It’s a fascinating bit of meta-realism that Eastwood keeps from appearing staged and overly sentimental by the sheer immediacy of its depiction.

Because he used Stone, Skarlatos, and Sadler as themselves, Eastwood is able to deliver a moving denouement. The film shows the actual footage of French president Francois Hollande presenting the actual men with their actual Légion d’honneur medals. In this unique moment, Eastwood’s decision to go with the men in the lead roles feels totally justified.

“The 15:17 to Paris” is a worthy and unusual piece of filmmaking, a careful blend of biopic and documentary. At one hour and thirty-four minutes, it is just the right length. The storytelling technique works, and the movie manages to create exciting and emotional moments, both because of the freshness in the audience’s mind of the events it portrays, and due to Eastwood’s consummate storytelling skill. Perhaps in ten or twenty years, the film will have lost the power of immediacy and seem a historical oddity and not really a flick still worth watching by a general audience. But for now, it delivers on both counts.

"If You Want Gun Control, Stop Calling The NRA A ‘Terrorist Organization’","Now that the smoke has settled after tragedy in Parkland, Florida, partisans on the Left and Right have hunkered down in their foxholes to fight a familiar fight. Many on the Left are so exasperated and furious with the lack of gun control measures in Congress that they have taken a fairly new route: calling the National Rifle Association (NRA) a terrorist organization.

We can argue about effectiveness of certain proposals, but if gun control advocates ever want gun owners to come to the table, they need to stop mindless name-calling or risk further dividing the country and neutering their cause.

In looking for a villain to blame for shootings across the country, many have latched onto the NRA, trying to turn the organization into a bogeyman to unite against. We saw this knee-jerk reaction from places like Keith Olberman in 2017 to the The Root to comedians like Michael Ian Black.

https://twitter.com/michaelianblack/status/963881272396451840

While it may feel cathartic in the moment to lash out online, it’s a gross misunderstanding of the NRA and the source of their power in American politics. Even worse, this sends a divisive message to gun owners across the country that further splits our already fractured republic.

The NRA Gets Its Power from Millions of Americans

The NRA is an old organization, founded originally in the wake of the Civil War to teach marksmanship to northerners unfamiliar with firearms. Fundamentally, the NRA is a membership organization. Members pay either hundreds of dollars for a lifetime membership or opt for memberships as expensive as $40 per year. In 2013 the NRA passed 5 million members. If all NRA members lived in a single city, it would be the second-largest in the country, behind only New York.

This big chunk of the American population is the true source of the NRA’s lobbying power. Sure, many firearms companies donate to the NRA, but that money is nothing compared to the power of their membership base. If politics is any predictor, money is hardly the determining factor in political success. We saw Hillary Clinton outspend Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign, and history is rife with monied interests losing out to motivated grassroots.

Further, the NRA accounts for a small portion of the spending on lobbying. In 2017 the NRA spent $5.1 million lobbying Congress on firearms issues, which accounts for just 0.15 percent of the $3.34 billion spent on lobbying last year. The New York Times lists Sen. John McCain as the recipient of the most money from the NRA and affiliated groups, at a total of $7.74 million during his political career. In a small footnote, they clarify these numbers are from 1989 onwards, nearly 30 years of contributions.

While this number might seem staggering, consider that McCain has received more than $208.39 million in campaign contributions since 1989. The NRA’s contributions amount for less than 4 percent of all donations he’s received. The NRA’s contributions and spending don’t buy the support of legislators. In the grand scheme of things, the money the NRA donates to politicians and to lobby Congress is a drop in the bucket.

But that 5-million-member activist group isn’t. NRA members are highly motivated to vote, engage in activism, call Congress, and get involved politically at the state and local levels. They help primary conservatives weak on gun issues and fight for their right to keep and bear arms. The NRA can call upon these people to cripple congressional offices with calls. They can organize events, motivate their members, and get their policies enacted.

Calling 5 Million Americans Terrorists

Because of this member base, the NRA has been able to secure huge wins across the country, from the sunsetting of the Assault Weapons Ban in 2004 to the expansion of concealed-carry licensing to the entire nation. And the NRA isn’t alone. Groups like Gun Owners of America go even further in pushing for Second Amendment freedoms the NRA won’t argue for. GOA has made great gains recently in the wake of the NRA’s position change on bump stocks.

The NRA and other gun rights organizations draw their power from their members, and their members know it. So when people call the NRA a terrorist organization, the implication is that its 5 million-plus members are terrorists, too. When people tweet over and over that we are terrorists, putting us in the same bucket as ISIS and al-Qaeda, it’s hardly an invitation to come together and talk about how to solve gun-related issues.

The millions of us who pay for memberships and attend NRA training events are just normal Americans who disagree on policy issues. But by turning normal-American NRA members into some kind of demonic monster to be defeated, histrionic gun-controllers calcify opposition against any kind of even moderate reform.

In addition to the millions of NRA members, Pew estimates 42 percent of Americans live in a household with guns, so that’s tens of millions of people across the country. Polling on firearms ownership also likely underrepresents gun ownership in America (if a stranger randomly called, would you tell him about valuable items in your home?).

Instead of calling millions of their fellow citizens terrorists and promoting radical policies, gun control advocates should look to the NRA’s recent softening on some issues. As The Free Beacon’s Stephen Gutowski has reported, the NRA is pushing legislation that would address “the records reporting failures in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) which were exposed by the shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas” and strengthen background checks. The NRA also called on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to review bump stocks in the wake of the shooting in Las Vegas.

While these changes have irked many of the more stalwart gun-rights proponents, it should be received by the Left as willingness to discuss this issue. Unfortunately the gun-control audience has made their tactics clear: Demonize gun owners and demand Australian-style gun confiscation schemes by pushing fake statistics.

How The FDA Plan To Take Nicotine Out Of Cigarettes Will Fuel Terrorism,"Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the head of the Food and Drug Administration, has announced plans to reduce to non-addictive levels the level of nicotine in cigarettes sold in the United States. The hope is that without the chemical that produces the pleasure of smoking, these cigarettes will appeal to fewer people, and therefore fewer people will smoke.

It is a terrible idea for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that it deprives adults of the choice to use tobacco as they see fit. But there are other unintended consequences to this policy that must be seriously considered, perhaps most importantly the effect on cigarette smuggling in the United Sates.

By making all sales of effective cigarettes with normal nicotine levels illegal, the FDA will be opening a huge illegal cigarette market in this country that has barely existed before. Among the prominent groups profiting off global illicit cigarette trade are Islamic terror organizations.

Cigarette Smuggling Today Is Domestic

There is a vibrant illegal cigarette smuggling market in the United Sates, but it is almost entirely domestic. The market is driven by the disparity in taxation from state to state. A typical operation would be for someone to buy cartons of cigarettes in Virginia for $5-$6 a pack and sell them in New York City for $8-$10 a pack, which is $5 less than they cost legally under New York’s tax regime. As long as the gap in taxation is wide enough, there is always room for the supplier to make a profit and the buyer to save money.

According to Eric Proshansky of the New York City Law Department, who has prosecuted illicit tobacco cases, illegal tobacco sales are not a major priority for law enforcement. One can see why: it is a relatively harmless crime, and though there are sometimes ties to organized crime, and even allegedly domestic terror cells, overall domestic smuggling doesn’t create any major immediate threats.

But another thing domestic smuggling operations do is close the market off to foreign competition. So long as actual brand-name cigarettes are available in some states at low prices, there is no practical reason to engage in international smuggling. If the FDA plan to render cigarettes ineffective goes through, all of that changes.

Although its extreme proposal of rendering legal cigarettes useless has never been tried, as the FDA admits, we can look to Australia to see what happens when a government makes the purchase of legal effective cigarettes next to impossible. The land down under taxes so heavily that a pack of cigarettes costs nearly $40. Australia’s first round of aggressive taxation passed in May 2016. By December 2016, the Australia Border Force was calling the illegal tobacco trade a “national security risk” that had ties to international terror.

The Dangers of International Smuggling

Although international smuggling is not a major issue in the United Sates, it is in many parts of the world, including Western Europe. Both China and Russia have robust counterfeit and smuggled cigarette producers. These cigarettes, referred to in the industry as “duty not paid,” or DNP, products, can come with dangerous additives, as some are not produced under any regulatory system. They also dump billions of dollars into the international criminal and black markets, which terror organizations use.

In 2016 the fact checker PolitiFact looked into claims by Pennsylvania State Rep. Rick Saccone (yes, that Rick Saccone) that illegal cigarette sales in the United States are funding terror. PolitiFact found the claim mostly true. Thus far, those cases have been thankfully rare. In other parts of the world, such cases are extremely common. For the above-mentioned reasons that keep international smuggling from being profitable in the United Sates, we aren’t bleeding enormous amounts of money to terrorist organizations. If we make effective cigarettes illegal, it is almost certain that we will, and spend millions trying not to.

Staunching the flow of illegal cigarettes that results from this regulatory policy will require extraordinary resources from those who patrol our borders. If Gottleib hasn’t noticed, those people already have their hands full keeping out heroin, cocaine, smuggled human beings, and terrorists. How many resources does he want to pull from those efforts to track down cartons of Camels?

The FDA Is Contradicting Itself

The policy announcement came with scientific back up in the form of an FDA-funded study from the New England Journal of Medicine all about how many people would quit smoking if nicotine were drastically reduced in cigarettes. The experts they surveyed varied widely on projections, but all of the projections included a huge portion of quitters that switch to non-combustible nicotine delivery systems like e-cigs, snus, and heat and burn technology. The problem with that is that the FDA has steadfastly refused to accept or advocate for the position that these alternatives are less harmful than traditional cigarettes.

Just last month Gottleib was railing against e-cigs on Twitter. In 2016 the FDA denied Swedish Match, a snus (oral tobacco delivery system) company, a designation called Modified Risk Tobacco Product, which allows a product to be marketed as a less harmful option to smoking. The FDA, which is considering another MRTP request from Philip Morris for the IQOS heat not burn product, has never approved the designation for any tobacco product.

At the same time the FDA argues informing people that alternative products are less harmful than smoking is too dangerous, they are enacting a policy in which a huge portion of those who will quit smoking will do so by switching to those very same products. The FDA has decided that instead of just using regulatory power and tax policy recommendations to help people choose to switch to non-combustible products, they must engage in an expensive, onerous, and dangerous regulatory regime that wipes out an entire industry with myriad effects down the retail line.

This is absolutely crazy. If the goal is to move people from combustible cigarettes to non-combustible alternatives, and according to the underlying research it is, then there are much better ways to do it. One of the world’s leading experts on the issue, Dr. Konstantinos Farsalinos, told me at a conference this fall that he thinks there should be no, or almost no, taxes on these alternatives,to encourage switching. Certainly it makes more sense to at least try that kind of approach before going nuclear and denying Americans the legal right to smoke cigarettes.

Given the risks and the far better alternatives available, this foolhardy approach to smoking from the FDA must be called out for its abject absurdity. As a matter of national security, it’s a decision that probably shouldn’t be left solely in the hands of a crusading FDA head.

Why People Need To Stop Calling The Austin Bomber A ‘Terrorist’,"The nightmare in Austin, Texas is finally over, as the psycho behind the bombings that plagued the city these past three weeks blew himself up as police cornered him in his vehicle.

We know little about the Austin bomber. He was 23 years old, white, and unemployed. His name and face have been made public, but we as a society should not feed the fame he desperately desired or inspire other sociopaths by giving him notoriety.

But since his identity has been known, many on social media immediately labeled him as a “terrorist.” Even Fox News’ Geraldo Rivera called his string of bombings “terrorism.” So why is there this sudden rush to call him a terrorist? Well, there could be two reasons.

The first reason could be the ignorance of what terrorism actually is, or at least how the U.S. government defines it. The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations says terrorism is “the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.” In other words, there has to be some sort of political or social motivation behind an attack in order to fit the legal definition of terrorism.

It has been reported that the bomber recorded a 25-minute video “confession” on his cell phone of him describing each bomb he constructed, but authorities say he did not include his motivation for making them. So until his motivation is discovered, what happened in Austin wasn’t terrorism, and if he were alive today, he wouldn’t be charged as a terrorist.

The second reason some automatically labeled the bomber a terrorist could be an effort of political correctness. Ever since 9/11, Islamic extremists have monopolized how many of us interpret terrorism. Whether it’s the shooting at a nightclub in Orlando or at a Christmas party in San Bernardino or driving a truck down a bike path in New York City, they were all defined as terrorism because there were political motivations behind those attacks, for all of which the Islamic State took responsibility.

However, there’s this continuous fear, particularly on the Left, that the general public is incapable of separating Islamic extremists from peaceful, law-abiding Muslims who make up the vast majority of Islam. So to counteract the dozens of attacks committed by Islamic extremists, they attempt to label a bunch of violent white guys “terrorists” as well.

That’s not to say that white terrorists don’t exist, because they certainly do. The monster down in Charlottesville who killed peaceful protestor Heather Heyer was a domestic terrorist. The loon behind the assassination attempt of GOP lawmakers in Alexandria, Virginia was a domestic terrorist. The gunman who attacked a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs in 2015 was a domestic terrorist. The Weather Underground, whose members were white, was a domestic terrorist organization. Note that these are all examples of domestic terrorism, because the political motivations are homegrown while Islamic extremist ideology originates overseas.

If we simplify the definition of a terrorist as “one who terrorizes,” then you can virtually call every serial killer, armed robber, and rapist a “terrorist,” because they all terrorize their victims. The downside to such simplification is that it diminishes actual acts of terrorism. And while all mass shooters and bombers terrorize people, that doesn’t necessarily make them terrorists.

At the end of the day, the truth may be too hard for some to handle. They’d rather dismiss rationality and what’s literally written in our laws because it feels good to call every violent white man a terrorist. But, as Ben Shapiro famously said, facts don’t care about your feelings.",https://thefederalist.com/2018/03/23/people-need-stop-calling-austin-bomber-terrorist/,2018-03-23
Western Media Scrub Mention Of Hamas From Headlines On Israeli Clash,"Every once in awhile, the Western media finds itself complacent in playing to the narrative of those opposed to liberal values. In an attempt to seem universalist and open-minded, the international press often portrays immensely complicated global conflicts in Leibniz terms that fit their progressive and simplistic paradigm. In the course of such oversimplification, the press becomes increasingly more apt to demonize Western nations in order to fit their reductionist narrative.

Take, for example, the recent events in Gaza. This past Friday, before the first night of Passover, the Palestinian-Arab terrorist group Hamas launched a series of protests on the Gaza Strip near the Israeli border. Over the course of the afternoon, the protests turned violent, as Palestinian-Arabs heaved rocks and firebombs towards the border fence and sent tires engulfed in flames towards Israeli soldiers. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) responded in kind by targeting those civilians instigating violence or attempting to breach the border wall. In total, seventeen Palestinian-Arabs were killed in confrontations with Israeli soldiers, while over a thousand others were injured in the clashes.

For context, Hamas labeled the planned six-week insurrection the “March of Return,” a reference to the Palestinian-Arab desire to return to Israeli land after their defeat in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and subsequent departure. Hamas planned the protests to coincide with the Palestinian-Arab holiday known as “Land Day,” a day in 1976 when Israeli security forces killed six Arab-Israelis who were protesting the appropriation of Arab-owned land in northern Israel.

At the behest and encouragement of Hamas, roughly 20,000 Palestinian-Arab civilians set up five large camps near the border fence, demanding the “right” to enter Israeli land. The final “push” of the six-week protests will involve rushing the border wall on May 15, the day coined by the Palestinian-Arabs as nakba or “the catastrophe,” a politically absurd reference to Israeli Independence, which occurred on May 14, 1948. May 15 holds particular contention this year, since it is also the day upon which President Trump will open the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem.

In response to the Hamas-led protests, the IDF tweeted, “Hamas is responsible for violent riots and everything taking place under its jurisdiction. The IDF will not allow the security fence to be turned into an area of terror.” The IDF had earlier alluded to the existence of various terror sites within the rioting encampments, whose chaos Hamas has used to “camouflage” its terrorist activities next to the border wall.

Friday’s headlines did not disappoint in their failure to properly assign blame to the responsible parties. From The New York Times, the headline read “Israeli military kills 15 Palestinians in Confrontations at Gaza Border.” And from Reuters, “Israeli forces kill 16 Palestinians in Gaza border protests: Gaza medics.” And from CNN, “Gaza protests: 17 Palestinians killed in confrontations with Israeli forces” The LA Times performed its job, as well: “15 Palestinians reported killed by Israeli fire as Gaza border protest builds.” Like clockwork, various outlets have whitewashed any mention of Hamas from their headlines, though Hamas is solely responsible for instigating the violence. In fact, the media categorically ignore much of the context behind the Palestinian-Arab frustrations that have nothing to directly do with Israel.

For those unfamiliar with the various cadres of ineffective and corrupt Palestinian-Arab “leadership,” Hamas is the Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist faction that consolidated control of the Gaza Strip following the Battle of Gaza in 2007. As of now, Hamas remains in league with the Palestinian Authority (PA), the subordinate governing organ that controls the rest of the Palestinian-controlled territories in Judea and Samaria.

While the international community is strangely more forgiving of the PA, about 10 percent of its budget, which amounts to roughly $350 million, is allocated towards funding terrorism against neighboring Israelis. Similarly, there is no shortage of “Days of Rage” — public days of protest condoned and sponsored by the government — that Chairman Mahmoud Abbas has incited in an attempt to weaponize his own civilians against the Israeli army and distract from his own miserable approval rating within the Palestinian-controlled territories.

Indeed, much of what we are currently witnessing on the Gaza border is a direct attempt by Hamas to weaponize the Palestinian-Arabs under its control, much as the PA has done. According to reports from the IDF, Hamas is systematically goading its civilians to rush the wall in the hopes of drawing Israeli soldiers into confrontation with the civilians. For example, the IDF reported that a seven year-old Palestinian-Arab girl had approached the fence but that they were able to locate the young girl’s parents. The IDF then released a statement: “Hamas cynically uses women and children, sending them to the fence and endangering their lives.”

Israel’s cynicism of Hamas’s use of human shields is well-placed. Civilian deaths at the hands of Israeli soldiers capture the attention of the international media and result in the collective demonization of Israel, irrespective of whether the civilians were engaging in violence prior to being killed. With the Western media’s willingness to portray Israel as the routine aggressor despite the Israeli military following highly specific and moral rules of engagement, the Hamas method of using civilians as bait will continue to be a successful tactic for shoring up international apologia for the terrorist group.

Israeli reporter Caroline Glick summarizes this pernicious strategy well: “Hamas’s strategy of harming Israel by forcing its soldiers to kill Palestinians is predicated on its certainty that the Western media will act as its partner and ensure the success of its lethal propaganda stunt … So long as the media and the left rush to indict Israel for its efforts to defend itself and its citizens against its terrorist foes, who turn the laws of war on their head as a matter of course, these attacks will continue and they will escalate.”

There is also an additional element to the international press’s desire to frame the Arab-Israeli conflict in a negative manner toward Israel and it fits the Left’s theory of intersectionality. Elliott Hamilton, Daily Wire writer and former research associate for Americans for Peace and Tolerance, describes the Left and Western media’s propensity to blame Israel for Hamas’ actions as an example of turning non-westerners into a noble savage, a literary stock character that represents the “outsider” who usually garners sympathy due to his assumed goodness and his adamant resistance to a corrupt civilization:

“The Left’s propensity to view the world through the prism of race and ethnicity results in them blaming seemingly white, European, Christian, and Jewish entities to be at fault for every apparent disadvantage that non-Westerners face. In their eyes, the supposedly oppressed non-Westerners can do no wrong and are in the right when it seeks to resist against the supposed oppressors. Conveniently, they will actively ignore the most dangerous aspects of any given entity, such as Hamas’ modus operandi to wage genocide against the Jewish people.”

Hamilton suggests that by framing the Palestinian-Arabs as the “other” and placing the entirety of the blame on Israel for the tragic situation that the people of Gaza live under, the international press engages in the soft bigotry of low expectations, where the Palestinian-Arab leadership seeks to lack the agency to charter alternative directions to better the people they supposedly represent. This deeply-seeded racism within the progressive media elites obscures the nuance of the conflict and it prevents us from being able to actively discuss and tackle long-standing problems within the ranks of the Palestinian-Arab leadership.

I encourage you to actively examine how the international press portrays the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, taking special note of how the Israeli response to Palestinian-Arab aggression is categorically portrayed as the source of said conflict, rather than as the only logical diffuser. The Gaza protests are yet another battlefield for the press to display its overwhelming commitment to a narrative that only emboldens terrorism.

John Bolton’s Appointment Rattles Muslim Brotherhood Echo Chamber,"The attacks on former ambassador John Bolton following his appointment as National Security Advisor (NSA) have inadvertently served as some of his strongest endorsements.

First there were the hysterical cries of “neocon warmonger!” This would come as news to the NSA-designate, who was never a “liberal mugged by reality” but a self-identified “Goldwater conservative” from the start; explicitly rejects the belief in democracy-building as imperative to achieving America’s national interest under democratic peace theory; and suggests, exaggerating for effect, that following the removal of Saddam Hussein, as soon as practicable he would have told the Iraqis, “You’re on your own. Here’s a copy of the Federalist papers. Good luck.”

Although the “neocon warmonger” moniker is inapt, to say the least, maybe it is not such a bad thing if our enemies buy this line. In fact, this may be part of President Trump’s strategic rationale as a dealmaker for elevating a “peace-through-strength” realist portrayed as a cantankerous cowboy to the top of the National Security Council.

Then followed another narrative: Bolton is not only a real-life Dr. Strangelove, but worse. He is actually an adroit bureaucrat—“crazy and dangerous.” Then-senator Joe Biden, a man prone to malapropism, actually put it best when, in Bolton’s retelling, Biden said of him in 2005: “My problem with you, over the years, has been, you’re too competent. I mean, I would rather you be stupid and not very effective.”

But the truly revelatory attacks concern Bolton’s positions on Islamic supremacism, which reflect an understanding that jihadists pose a mortal threat that must be countered using every element of national power. You know these attacks are meaningful partly because they have been made under cover of a smear campaign.

Opposing Jihadis Isn’t the Same as Opposing Islam

Bolton has been cast as an “Islamophobe” for the thought crime of being a counterjihadist who supports other counterjihadists. The charge of “Islamophobe” is a baseless, intellectually dishonest, and lazy slur. Although it does not deserve to be dignified with a response, it goes without saying that there is nothing to indicate Bolton harbors an irrational fear of Islam, and everything to indicate he holds the very rational belief that we must defeat Islamic supremacists who wish to subject us to their tyrannical rule or destroy us.

“Islamophobe” is being lobbed at Bolton to try and discredit him and ultimately scuttle policies he supports intended to strike at the heart of Islamic supremacism. The “tell” is that the articles raising such accusations frequently cast counterjihadist policy positions themselves as de facto evidence of Islamophobic bigotry.

As the representative par excellence of the position that America should exit the Iran deal, it should come as no surprise that the Iran deal echo chamber in exile has sprung into action in savaging the ambassador with the most outlandish of insinuations. For the Islamophobia campaign, the lesser-recognized and perhaps more insidious Muslim Brotherhood echo chamber has been activated. Bolton is on record as supporting its designation as a terrorist organization, and Brotherhood apologists and true believers cannot abide this.

Either We Work With Terrorists or We Don’t

Recall that the national security and foreign policy establishment has long held that as a “political Islamist” group, the Muslim Brotherhood ought to be treated as a legitimate diplomatic partner. The theory is that we have to choose between violent and seemingly peaceful Islamic supremacists, ignoring the fact that their differences are tactical and strategic, not ideological. They are all still Islamic supremacists.

Most infamously, the Obama administration supported the ascension of Mohamed Morsi, leader of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, to president during the Arab spring, with predictably horrific consequences in particular for the nation’s Christians that persist even in the era of the much-maligned counterjihadist Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

Such disastrously naïve policy pushes ignore that the Muslim Brotherhood is the tip of the Sunni jihadist spear. It’s the ideological fountainhead from which violent jihadist groups from Hamas to al-Qaeda and ISIS spring. The “political” element of the Muslim Brotherhood is, if anything, more pernicious precisely because its adherents do not goose-step, guns in hand, in the public square.

No, the political arm engages in political and ideological warfare, tactfully seeking to impose its will through policy and subterfuge. “Social welfare” activities provide a convenient cover for the group’s ultimate aims. As the Brotherhood put it in its 1991 Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Group in North America:

The Ikhwan [Muslim Brothers] must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion is made victorious over all other religions.

On account of the Brotherhood’s nature and activities, it has been designated as a terrorist organization from Egypt to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. A bill first introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz in 2015, calling for the U.S. secretary of state to submit a report to Congress on designating the Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization in America, lays out several other reasons the group merits this, including:

The [group’s] explicit calls for violent jihad, with the end goal of imposing Islamic law over all the world of the group’s founder and spiritual leader Hassan al-Banna, and the consistently violent Islamic supremacist content of the Brotherhood’s core membership texts The terrorist efforts of numerous jihadist groups explicitly tied to the Muslim Brotherhood, and the efforts of individual Muslim Brotherhood members designated as terrorists by the U.S. government themselves The litany of terrorist financing cases involving the Muslim Brotherhood, including the…Holy Land Foundation case [the largest terror financing case in U.S. history]…

Do What We Like or Get Smeared as a Bigot

On the campaign trail and in its early days the Trump administration indicated an interest in designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. But within months it shelved these plans. What happened? The Muslim Brotherhood echo chamber deployed.

The Brotherhood undertook an extensive lobbying and information operation designed to dissuade the administration’s plans, reportedly backed by millions of dollars. The U.S. foreign policy establishment quickly proliferated articles and comments in prominent mainstream publications defending the Muslim Brotherhood against charges of being a jihadist group, adding that designated it as such would be impractical and impracticable. Notably, The New York Times went so far as to print an op-ed in the Brotherhood’s defense written by Clinton Foundation-linked Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad el-Haddad.

In the midst of this flurry of articles, it leaked to the media that the CIA and State Department both produced memos against Muslim Brotherhood terrorist designation. Concurrently, counterjihadists throughout the Trump administration were subjected to a barrage of attacks. Many would ultimately be sidelined, though some like Secretary of State-designate Mike Pompeo survived. He, like Bolton, is being attacked as an Islamophobic bigot as well.

Bolton recognized at the time that these events were not random. During a July 2017 interview he noted:

There’s been an amazing campaign. It’s always amazing to me how these stories and op-eds and lines of chatter appear simultaneously, all very well-coordinated…The argument being the Muslim Brotherhood is a complicated organization, not every part of it is devoted to the support of terrorism. Some of them do humanitarian work and so on; a declaration that the entire Brotherhood is a foreign terrorist organization would actually buttress the cause of the jihadis; so, therefore, don’t do anything.

Bolton’s riposte?

Let’s take the notion inherent in that argument as having some validity, that there are pieces of the Muslim Brotherhood that don’t qualify under the statutory definition we have of a foreign terrorist organization…My response to that is, ‘Okay, we need some careful drafting based on the evidence we have now that excludes some affiliates, some components of the Muslim Brotherhood from the designation.’ I’m prepared to live with that, of course, until we get more complete information.

This position is what really draws the ire of the Brotherhood echo chamber. CAIR, the unindicted co-conspirator in the previously mentioned largest terror financing case in U.S. history, published a press release condemning the appointment of “Islamophobe John Bolton” as NSA, citing corroborating articles from such non-biased sources as Think Progress, The Nation, Islamophobia.com, Vox, and Huffington Post.

As I have written previously, CAIR’s Muslim Brotherhood and jihadi ties are numerous and longstanding, involving not only its founders and present leaders to Hamas, but its harboring of apologists for Islamic terrorism, and alleged impeding of counterterrorism efforts.

Bolton’s endorsement of designating the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization illustrates a keen understanding of the size, scope, and nature of the Islamic supremacist threat that the national security and foreign policy establishment lacks. It is a proxy for a worldview that if followed to its logical conclusion would turn our largely futile efforts to beat back jihadists over the last 17 years on their head. This view takes Islamic supremacists at their word in their desire to impose upon us the Sharia-based, totalitarian theopolitical ideology to which they adhere. Hence the pushback.

Applying this worldview would lead to decisions antithetical to the progressive Wilsonian internationalists and political Islamists on myriad issues in the Middle East, including:

Treatment of Israel versus the Arabs

The Iran deal

Iran policy more broadly, including appropriate measures against its proxies in Syria and Lebanon

Qatar’s bellicosity

Turkey’s behavior under Islamic supremacist Erdogan

The Trump administration ought not to concede one inch to those who self-evidently wish to sideline the personnel and stifle the policies that would make its counterjihadist agenda a reality. This specious and slanderous smear campaign reflects all the better on the appointment of Bolton as NSA.

Watch Trump Shred Obama’s Disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal,"President Donald Trump announced Tuesday the United States is withdrawing from the Obama administration’s “disastrous” Iran nuclear deal. Trump began his remarks by highlighting Iran’s actions against the United States and its aid to terrorists.

“The Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terror,” Trump said. “It exports dangerous missiles, fuels conflicts across the Middle East, and supports terrorist proxies and militias Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al-Qaeda.”

“Over the years Iran and its proxies have bombed American embassies and military installations, murdered hundreds of American service members, and kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured American citizens,” he said. “The Iranian regime has funded its long reign of chaos and terror by plundering the wealth of its own people. No action taken by the regime has been more dangerous than its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them.”

He proceeded to critique the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a formal name for the nuclear deal the Obama administration brokered.

“The so-called Iran deal was supposed to protect the United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb and a weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime,” he said. “In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and over time reached the brink of a nuclear breakout. The deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on our end in exchange for very weak limits on the regime’s nuclear activity and no limits at all on its other maligned behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen, and other places all around the world.”

“At the point when the United States had maximum leverage, this disastrous deal gave this regime — and it is a regime of great terror — many billions of dollars and some of it in actual cash,” Trump said. “A great embarrassment to me as a citizen and to all citizens of the United States. A constructive deal could easily have been struck at the time, but it was not.”

“At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program,” he said. “Today we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie.”

Trump then outlined the findings revealed last week by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a televised press conference, Netanyahu showed the world that Israeli intelligence had discovered evidence indicating Iran had a secret nuclear site.

“The agreement was so poorly negotiated that even if Iran fully complied, the regime could still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time,” Trump said.

“The Iranian deal is defective at its core,” he continued. “If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen.

Obama Says ‘I Didn’t Have Scandals.’ So What Are All These?,"At a Las Vegas tech conference last week, former president Barack Obama told an audience that his presidency had been scandal-free. “I didn’t have scandals, which seems like it shouldn’t be something you brag about,” Obama joked, according to Newsweek. We hear this talking point quite often from Democrats.

Now, perhaps the president didn’t experience the fallout from a scandal, which is very different from never having been involved in one. For this confusion, Obama can thank the political media.

Why does it matter now? For one thing, historical revisionism shouldn’t go unchallenged. Democrats are running to retake power, and many of them were participants or accomplices in numerous corrosive scandals that have been airbrushed.

The other reason, of course, is that when we start to juxtapose the mythically idyllic Obama presidency with the tumultuous reign of Trump, we’re reminded that many journalists largely abdicated their responsibilities for eight years — which has a lot to do with the situation we find ourselves in today.

It’s not about Obama’s brazen lying about Obamacare or even recurrent abuse of power. I’m talking about supposed non-scandals like “Operation Fast and Furious,” a program devised by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) that put around 2,000 weapons into the hands of narco-traffickers (and an Islamic terrorist), leading to the murder of hundreds of Mexicans and at least one American, border agent Brian Terry.

The body count could have been higher when a homegrown extremist who, with another assailant, attempted to murder the audience at a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas with one of the Fast and Furious weapons. An off-duty police officer killed both of the attackers.

Despite the incompetence, absurdity, recklessness, and fatalities of the program, the entire affair never really received scandal-like attention. No one lost his job. There will almost certainly be a tweet from Trump this week that political media will afford more attention than a story in which an American border agent was murdered with the gun Obama’s ATF provided.

Not even when the administration refused to cooperate with congressional investigators was it handled like a scandal. Not even when a federal judge rejected Obama’s assertion of executive privilege in efforts to deny Congress files relating to the gun-walking operation was it treated as a scandal. Not even when we learned that Obama attorney general Eric Holder misled Congress about when he was made aware of the program did it rise to the importance of a Trump tweet. Holder became the first sitting attorney general in American history to be held in contempt of Congress — a vote that included 17 Democrats — and Obama still never paid a political price.

As it was, the Obama administration persistently ignored courts and oversight, breaking norms because it was allowed to do so. The president was articulate, friendly, and progressive. He might have executed an American citizen without a trial (not a scandal!), but his contempt for the process could be forgiven.

It’s why Obama could secretly send planes filled with cash to pay a ransom to a terror state (using money earmarked for terror victims) and most reporters and analysts would regurgitate the justification they heard in the echo chamber. One Politico reporter might drop a 14,000-word heavily sourced investigative piece (two officials involved in the program went on the record) detailing how the Obama administration undermined law enforcement efforts to shut down an international drug-trafficking ring run by the terror group Hezbollah operating in the United States, and most major news organizations never even mentioned the piece.

When they did, it was usually to give space to former Obama officials to smear the reporter.

It needn’t be said, but if the names were changed to Trump and Russia, the president would be accused of sedition. But by any conceivable journalistic standard, it’s a scandal that should have triggered widespread coverage. So when we see mass indignation over every single hyperbolic statement from the current president, it’s a bit difficult to buy the outrage.

An Obama official famously bragged to The New York Times Magazine that he could rely on the ignorance, inexperience, and partisan dispositions of reporters to convey administration talking points to help push through preferred policy. Rather than being hurt or embarrassed by this kind of accusation of unprofessionalism, many reporters are more reliant on the same people than ever before.

Yet many professionals who supposedly deplore the authoritarian nature of an administration that doesn’t answer CNN’s questions were generally quiet when Obama spied on reporters. The Obama DOJ spied on the Associated Press in an attempt to crack down on internal leaks. The DOJ tapped around 20 different phone lines—including cell phone and home lines—that snared at least 100 staffers who worked for the outlet. The Justice Department spied on Fox News reporter James Rosen in 2010, collecting his telephone records, looking at his personal emails and tracking his movements.

Color me skeptical, but somehow I doubt similar Trump efforts would be framed as a “rare peek into a Justice Department leak probe,” as if we were pulling the curtains back on a fashion show. It would be, rightly, depicted as an assault on democracy.

Then again, spying was also never really given the scandal treatment during the Obama years. As Obama’s CIA director, John Brennan became aware of an operation of illegal spying of a legislative branch staffer over torture files and misled the media about it. Did the president know? Shrug. The story hardly made a dent. Likewise, Obama’s director of national intelligence, James Clapper, admitted he misled Congress about spying on American citizens. No scandal.

Today both these people are on TV chumming around with serious journalists who allow them to continue to make reckless, unsubstantiated political statements all the time. It isn’t Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press” who asks Clapper tough questions, it’s Meghan McCain on “The View.”

There was unprecedented politicization of the government under Obama — most of it, I imagine, excused for being part of a good cause. The NLRB. The Justice Department. The IRS. The Office of Special Counsel, which reviews whistleblower allegations, found that IRS employees urged callers to vote for Obama, wore pro-Obama swag, and campaigned for Democrats in conversations with taxpayers — all of it illegal.

But far more seriously, IRS leadership, specifically Lois Lerner, aggressively targeted conservative groups before elections. The IRS admitted as much in an apology letter. Lerner was held in contempt by Congress for refusing to comply with investigators’ demands. She never answered questions for this genuine attack on democracy.

What difference does it make, right? While the extent of the incompetence and negligence during the Benghazi terror attack on September 11, 2012 is still unknown, what we do know is that Obama and a number of high-ranking officials in his administration lied about what happened for partisan reasons. Susan Rice went on a number of national television shows and claimed that Benghazi was a “spontaneous reaction” to “hateful and offensive video,” even when she knew it was a sophisticated and pre-planned terror attack. (Rice is now on the Netflix board, and Obama is a very rich man. At some point you’ve made enough money, but that time is not yet. )

Although they knew it was a complex terror attack, Obama and Hillary Clinton cut television ads to placate radicals in Islamic nations by repeating the claim that a video perpetuated the attack, and apologizing for American free speech — a scandal in itself.

Worse, however, the administration detained the man who produced the offensively amateurish “Innocence of Muslims,” and initially charged him with lying about his role in the production of the video. This was a blatant attack on free expression. Yet most of the mainstream press continued to take the administration’s word for it and report that the video was the cause of the “protests.”

Democrats in general just kept pretending that every accusation was merely a partisan, racist plot to undermine the president. Whether it was bypassing process and oversight to fund cronyistic green projects that enriched political and ideological allies with tax dollars, or the Secret Service’s embarrassing debauchery or Hillary Clinton’s attempts to circumvent transparency or, perhaps the most immoral, the Veterans Affairs’ negligence regarding veterans, they would never admit they faced a scandal.

This double standard in coverage makes today’s often sanctimonious reactions to Trump a bit difficult to take. Many reporters will snarkily point out that most of the stories critics latch onto have been reported on or broken by mainstream journalists. It’s true. There are plenty of good journalists out there. But it’s the intensity of the coverage and the framing of the events that is evidence of ideologically motivated coverage. And every time Obama or his allies claim that they were scandal-free, millions of Americans are reminded of the obsequiousness of most media coverage.

Terror Plot Against Iranian Dissidents Foiled In Europe,"The regime in Tehran must be growing nervous. European officials disrupted a terrorist plot aimed at a large conference in France for exiled Iranians opposed to the ruling regime.

An Iranian diplomat was arrested in Germany, along with two others suspected of plotting the bomb attack at the gathering. Three others of Iranian origin were arrested in France. Apparently, as both internal and external pressure mounts against the regime, they are recklessly lashing out against the West.

The two Belgian nationals, identified only as Amir S. and his wife, Nasimeh N., of Iranian origin, were charged with “attempted terrorist murder and the preparation of a terrorist offence,” according to a statement from the Belgium prosecutor. They were found with approximately 500 grams of a homemade explosive and an ignition mechanism inside their Mercedes.

Their contact, Assadollah A., an Iranian diplomat at the Austrian Embassy in Vienna, was also arrested. The failed plot is all the more brazen considering that Iran’s President Rouhani landed in Zurich on Monday and is scheduled to visit Vienna for talks regarding the nuclear agreement on Wednesday.

The choice of target was undoubtedly intended to send a message as well. The National Council of Resistance of Iran, an umbrella bloc of Iranian opposition groups that demands regime change, hosted the event, in which tens of thousands attended in Villepinte, just outside Paris. Aside from the range of European and Arab officials who attended and spoke, President Trump’s lawyer and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani also addressed the gathering, along with former House speaker Newt Gingrich.

They were joined on stage by many former U.S. diplomats and politicians from both sides of the aisle, who included former UN ambassador and Democratic governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson. In response to the foiled attacked, Giuliani expressed his appreciation of the “fine work of law enforcement particularly in Belgium and France.”

An Untrustworthy Iran Denies Involvement

Naturally, Iran’s silver-tongued foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, dismissed his government’s complicity in the planned operation via Twitter: “How convenient: Just as we embark on a presidential visit to Europe, an alleged Iranian operation and its ‘plotters’ arrested. Iran unequivocally condemns all violence & terror anywhere, and is ready to work with all concerned to uncover what is a sinister false flag ploy.”

The problem, however, is that lying is somewhat of a regime specialty. For example, in April Zarif also told reporters, “We don’t intend to get a bomb,” and “Iran never raced towards a bomb, nor will it race towards a bomb. End of story.”

A few days later, Israel revealed a half ton of documents and digital files, blueprints it says it lifted from a secret warehouse in Tehran that detailed Iran’s plans to build nuclear weapons. Zarif’s condemnation of terrorism also rings hollow given that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and forces loyal to it have killed thousands in Syria in the regime’s effort to keep Bashar al-Assad in power.

Nor is it the first time such an audacious Iranian terrorist plot was thwarted in the West. For example, a scheme to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States with a bomb at a popular Washington restaurant was uncovered in 2011.

Iranians Are Fed Up With Their Authoritarian Leaders

The foiled terrorist plot takes place amidst a backdrop of growing discontent within Iran. For more than six months, Iranians have been protesting and in some cases striking, and their numbers are increasing. Unlike the crowds that took to the streets to protest the sham elections in 2009, the current outpouring of anger towards the regime has leapt from small cities in the Iranian hinterland to the capital in Tehran and more than 140 cities and towns. The demonstrations involve a cross-section of Iranian society that has included farmers, truck drivers, students, and bazar merchants, among many others. Unfortunately for the regime, the movement is proving durable.

The people have denounced the regime for spending money and other resources on foreign military adventures rather than using the $100 billion financial injection from the nuclear deal to improve the situation for ordinary Iranians at home. They’ve chanted, “Leave Syria alone, deal with us” along with “Neither Gaza, nor Lebanon, I give my life for Iran.”

In recent weeks, Iranians were even seen chanting “Death to Palestine,” an indication that standard regime-sponsored rallying cries, such as “Death to Israel” or the United States, are fast fading from fashion. In fact, whatever the regime promotes is increasingly being seen as antithetical to what everyday Iranians are striving for.

Iran’s rulers are bound to be further squeezed financially. When President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran, it triggered a wind-down period to the return of biting economic sanctions set to go into effect on August 6 and November 4, respectively.

Those will target Iran’s energy sector (oil, petroleum, and petrochemicals), and all of the ancillary sanctions associated with it, such as the banking sector, shipping, shipbuilding, and ports. That is in addition to the U.S. Treasury Department terminating licensing for civil aviation, no longer dealing financially with Iranian rial, and not providing precious metals to the Iranian regime. European businesses are already fleeing the Iranian market in advance of the deadlines. If the Iranian rial is currently in a tailspin, it’s bound to nosedive in August.

It remains to be seen how the Trump administration or America’s European allies will respond to the latest Iranian terrorist challenge in France. Long before taking up the post of defense secretary, Jim Mattis told those gathered at the 2013 Aspen Security Forum that he thought the United States made a serious mistake by not responding more assertively to the 2011 foiled Iranian plot in Washington.

“We caught them in the act,” Mattis said, “and yet we let them walk free.” There’s a new sheriff in Washington today, who is bound to be less forgiving than his predecessor. The first indication of Europe’s response will be seen by Wednesday, when Iran’s president sits down with European diplomats.

Feminist-Celebrated Imam’s Son Ran Terrorist Camp For School Shooters,"Already missing from the news cycle is the story of Muslim leader Siraj Wahhaj, who alerted authorities to the squalid conditions in New Mexico in which his son, two daughters, another man and woman, and 11 children were living.

Authorities arrived at the compound to some of the most horrifying conditions they had ever seen, and prosecutors identified the makeshift home as a training ground for militant children, including in carrying out school shootings. The imam’s son had been wanted for kidnapping his own four-year-old child, who had severe disabilities. The body of a young child was recovered from the site, but authorities have yet to verify its identity.

Siraj claims his son and daughters had strayed from his teachings of Islam, had somehow become radicalized, and were possibly dealing with mental illness. He presented himself as a peaceful and well-respected imam, careful to distance himself from the terrorist conditions in which his family was found. But the facts on that count are doubtful.

Who Is Siraj Wahhaj?

Born Jeffrey Kearse in Brooklyn, Wahhaj converted to the Nation of Islam in 1969, and changed his name to Jeffrey X12. He became a leader in the community and regularly taught that “white people are devils.” By 1975, he reigned in his outspoken racism toward white people and converted to a more orthodox Sunni Muslim, changing his name to the Arabic Siraj Wahhaj.

He is the founder of and an imam at Masjid At-Taqwa in Brooklyn, and is well known and respected, attracting Muslims from all over the world to hear him speak. In 1991, Wahhaj became the first Muslim to lead a prayer at the start of a session of the U.S. House of Representatives.

In that same year, he said, “As long as you remember that if you get involved in politics, you have to be very careful that your leader is for Allah. You don’t get involved in politics because it’s the American thing to do. You get involved in politics because politics are a weapon to use in the cause of Islam.”

Siraj Wahhaj, In His Own Words

He appeared on a prosecutor’s list of possible co-conspirators in the 1993 World Trade Center attack, and was an unwavering defender of the Blind Sheik, Omar Abdel-Rahman, who had been a worshipper at Wahhaj’s mosque. He is on record as referring to America as the “Most wicked government on the face of planet Earth.”

He has also stated, “If only Muslims were clever politically, they could take over the United States and replace its constitutional government with a caliphate. If we were united and strong, we’d elect our own emir and give allegiance to him. Take my word, if eight million Muslims unite in America, the country will come to us.”

He has claimed, “In time, this so-called democracy will crumble, and there will be nothing. And the only thing that will remain will be Islam.” He says the United States should be under Sharia law, that Muslim men should be allowed to have four wives, and that people should be stoned or have their hands chopped off if it is the will of Allah.

Perhaps he is not personally responsible for this training camp in New Mexico, and perhaps his children operate at a more extreme level than he does, but he is no peaceful American religious figure.

Islamic Extremist Influences Liberal Poster Children

Wahhaj is also a mentor to Linda Sarsour, an American-born activist of Palestinian heritage who is on the board of the anti-Trump Women’s March. Also a Brooklyn native, she is known for her staunch support of the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, and her outspoken desire for Sharia law in the United States.

Sarsour introduced Wahhaj at the Islamic Society of North America conference as, “My favorite person in this room, that’s mutual, is Imam Siraj Wahhaj, who has been a mentor, and motivator and encourager of mine, someone who has taught me to speak truth to power and not worry about the consequences.”

Sarsour once touted Saddam Hussein as a “hero” to Palestinians. She and the Women’s March praised Assata Shakur, who was convicted of murdering a police officer in 1977, as a hero. Her blatant anti-Semitic values are hidden in plain sight behind the smoke screen of intersectional feminism. She once said “Nothing is creepier than Zionism,” and her Twitter account profile describes her as “Islamophobia’s Worst Nightmare.” This is her primary raison d’être.

It’s Not Just Sarsour, Either

Although Sarsour claims not to be anti-Semitic, she signed the Ali Abunimah’s 2012 Orwellian definition of anti-Semitism, which made the preposterous claim that Zionism oppresses Judaism and Islam. Sarsour is joined in highly questionable connections to hateful men by fellow Women’s March board members Tamika D. Mallory and Carmen Perez. All three women are ardent fans of the racist, homophobic, anti-American leader of The Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan.

Mallory has appeared on stage at many events with Farrakhan. Perez claims their appearance and association with Farrakhan gave them a platform to speak for millennials. When confronted with the idea that associating with Farrakhan seems like a refusal to condemn anti-Semitism, Mallory balked, claiming that she had a rich history with the Nation of Islam.

She claimed her history of feeling marginalized and belittled led her to feel safe and comforted around the women at the events she attended. She used the cloak of intersectional politics to guilt people away from the fact that she willingly and eagerly shares a platform with a man who spews hate and intolerance.

The dangerous connections that the leaders of this influential progressive group have are incredibly alarming, and hardly ever in the news long enough for people to notice. A camp within the United States where children were being trained to shoot up schools in terrorist attacks should be in the news every day, until every connection is explored and scrutinized.

Here Are Horrifying Things From The New Mexico Terrorist Compound,"New evidence revealed in a court filing on Friday further suggests that the five adults arrested earlier this month on charges of child abuse at a rural New Mexico compound were running a terrorist training camp. Those arrested include Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, his sisters Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj, Subhannah’s husband, Lucas Allen Morton, and a women an FBI agent involved in the case identified as Wahhaj’s “Islamic wife,” Jany Leveille.

Officials also took custody of the Wahhajs’ 11 children, placing them with the state’s child protective services. A few days later, agents discovered, in a tunnel on the sprawling property, the corpse of Siraj Ibn Wahhaj’s three-year old son, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, whom he had kidnapped in Georgia late last year from his estranged wife, Hakima Ramzi.

The Wahhaj siblings’ father is the senior Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, who according to National Review Online’s Andrew McCarthy is “a well-known (some would say notorious) sharia-supremacist imam who runs a mosque in Brooklyn (Masjid al-Taqwa).” In January, following the kidnapping of his three-year-old grandson, the imam made an appeal on Facebook for information on the whereabouts of his children and 12 grandchildren.

Later, according to the senior Wahhaj, one of his daughters asked for help from a man in Atlanta, saying they were starving at the New Mexico compound. The Atlanta contact passed the information to the imam, who told the authorities, resulting in the early-August raid.

Taos County District Attorney Donald Gallegos filed charges of child abuse against the five adults, while Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and Morton faced additional charges related to the kidnapping. The prosecutor sought to detain the adults while the investigation continued, arguing the defendants presented a risk to the community given the cache of weapons recovered from the compound and statements by some of the children that they were being trained to attack schools and other locations.

Two weeks ago, a state court judge denied the government’s request to detain the defendants pending trial and ordered their release on a $20,000 “signature bond,” which means money is paid to the court only if the defendants violate the terms of release—nothing is paid up front. The terms of release the judge set merely required the defendants to wear a GPS tether, cooperate with child protective services, and obtain suitable housing.

Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, however, is not eligible for release because of the outstanding warrant from Georgia related to the kidnapping, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement took custody of Leveille beause she is a native of Haiti, according to USA Today.

On Friday, the DA filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its decision to release the defendants on bond. That motion detailed the evidence known to date, including some just discovered, which strongly suggests that the Wahhaj family had turned their rural compound into a terrorist training camp. Inexplicably, though, the mainstream media has moved on from this story or, in the case of CNN, has decided that terrorists-in-training make for an interesting personal-interest story.

Tweeting its article under the caption “New Mexico compound family struggled with life off the grid,” CNN linked to its sympathetic profile of the Wahhaj family living in the rural southwest. Rather than detail the circumstances surrounding the raid and the arrests of the siblings and their spouses, CNN instead painted a touching portrait of the parental figures.

“One of the men tenderly wiped the nose of a crying child,” a local resident who saw the group during a rare outing to the city told CNN. Sure, the defendants are accused of training their children to shoot up schools, CNN noted in passing, but locals’ real fear is “that the publicity around a case infused with allegations of terrorism, children abuse and faith healing might contribute to a rise in racism and Islamophobia.”

The timing of CNN’s bizarre attempt to garner sympathy for the Wahhaj clan couldn’t have been worse given that Friday’s filing by Taos County’s DA summarizes disturbing evidence of the group’s intent to commit acts of terrorism. CNN, however, is not alone in going off the grid in covering this huge story of a homebuilt terrorist camp. Too busy Stormy-chasing, the entire mainstream media has ignored the recent developments in the Wahhaj case. And what hasn’t been told is terrifying.

An FBI agent testified that two of the malnurished children said “they had been trained in advanced firearms handling and had been instructed to shoot law enforcement personnel when the time came and that they would be instructed in the future to attack specific targets such as teachers, schools, banks, and other ‘corrupt institutions.’”

In his motion, the prosecutor stressed that the defendants possessed an arsenal of weapons. He included evidence from a neighbor stating that the group used the shooting range on the compound excessively. Add to that the seizure of a DVD that describes how to build an “untraceable assault rifle” at home and a book on the psychology of combat, and the picture of a group bent on a terrorist attack forms more clearly.

[scribd id=387257050 key=key-rATWvGyKnWIJaf8kGN1x mode=scroll]

There is more: The prosecutor presented to the trial court a letter Morton delivered to Muhammad, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj’s brother. That letter encouraged Muhammad to follow Allah “until he makes you die as a martyr as you wanted and the only way is by joining the righteous (us).” The letter added that Muhammad should “take all your money out [of] the bank and bring you guns,” showing the Wahhajs intended to grow their fighting force beyond the 16 residents of the compound.

[scribd id=387257049 key=key-7f5uMAQE2OkrM8tmc5hs mode=scroll]

Agents also recovered a ten-page, handwritten document, titled “Phases of a Terrorist Attack,” from the compound. That document included instructions for “the one-time terrorist” and provided detailed instructions on determining ideal attack locations, using “choke points,” defending “safe havens,” escaping perimeter rings, and detecting sniper positions. This document indicates the defendants were not merely talking a deadly talk, but had been carefully planning an attack.

Follow-up interviews with some of the children garnered more evidence, including statements that Morton told them he “wished to die in jihad, as a martyr,” and Leveille and Subhanna Wahhaj joking about dying in jihad. The children also relayed that Leveille and Suraj intended to confront “corrupt” institutions, such as the military, CIA, and American schools, and reveal to them “the truth.” If they refused to accept the message, the children said, Leveille would provide a signal to Suraj, who would attack the individual.

The DA’s motion also states “Siraj told the group that if police ever came to the property at night, they were to defend the property using firearms.” A search of the compound revealed numerous guns located at the end of a tunnel. The children told officials the tunnel served as an escape route should authorities raid the compound.

Additionally, the government detailed several passages in a journal recently recovered from the compound, written by Leveille. Leveille’s journal makes quite clear that she is delusional. For instance, she believes that Suraj’s son, Abdul Ghani, was originally conceived in her womb, but that Hakima Ramzi used black magic to remove the fetus from Leveill’s womb and transfer him to Ramzi’s womb. Leveille’s journal also detailed the circumstances of Abdul Ghani’s death, and her revelation that “ghani would be resurrected as Jesus.”

Whether motivated by mental illness or an extremist view of violent jihad, the Wahhaj family presents a serious risk to the community. Hopefully, when the state court holds a hearing on August 29 at 1 p.m. on the DA’s motion to reconsider, the judge will agree and assure that none of the defendants remains free to execute their plans. Also, hopefully the FBI, which reportedly was monitoring the compound, doesn’t wait so long to intervene next time.

"Rift Between Police, Feds Allowed NM Terror Compound To Fester","Questions keep coming about how the U.S. justice system responded to a New Mexico compound that housed five alleged would-be jihadists and 11 reportedly malnourished children along with the remains of a twelfth child who died on the compound.

A federal grand jury recently indicted the five alleged jihadists on weapons and conspiracy charges, alleging the group created their compound in the desert outside Taos, New Mexico as a training camp and firing range to facilitate a “Common plan to prepare for violent attacks government, military, educational and financial institutions” and sought to “engage in jihad and form an army of jihad” according to the federal indictment published by the Department of Justice on September 11.

The five suspects—Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, Lucas Morten, Subhanah Wahhaj, Hujrah Wahhaj, and Jany Leveille—had previously faced state charges of child abuse, but the charges floundered in court after a New Mexico judge dismissed charges against all five suspects when state prosecutors missed a 10-day deadline for a preliminary hearing. Prosecutors argued extenuating circumstances but were rebuffed.

The federal charges echo information first laid out in the state prosecutors’ motion urging the judge in the case to reconsider the judge’s dismissal of bail, given evidence that the suspects had discussed targeted attacks against “corrupt institutions,” including schools and an Atlanta-area hospital. Suspects reportedly had repeatedly discussed a willingness to fight and kill law enforcement, and to die as “martyrs.” Prosecutors cited testimony from children inside the camp saying they were being trained to conduct school shootings or other attacks.

The five suspects were arrested after local police launched a raid to respond to reports of child abuse from inside the camp, only to discover a shooting range, multiple weapons, and documents describing a potential terrorist attack, including a document titled “Phases of a Terrorist Attack.”

Neighbors Were Telling Police Disturbing Information

The federal charges highlight what appears to have been a disconnect between state and federal law enforcement over how to address the New Mexico compound and its armed residents. The compound was under surveillance from both local and federal law enforcement, but it took several months for law enforcement to intervene despite reports from the local community.

Sirraj Ibn Wahhaj faced a Georgia-issued child abduction warrant, and neighbors reportedly identified the missing child, Abdul Ghani, who was known to possess a limp. A child with a limp was also reportedly detected by FBI aerial surveillance.

Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe has told media that local authorities didn’t intervene over concerns they lacked probable cause to act. But CNN reported that a local officer told neighbors law enforcement’s “hands were tied” by the FBI.

“‘We’ve gotten multiple calls on this child but, at the same time, our hands are tied because the FBI has whatever they got going on up there with them,’” CNN quoted the officer as saying, according to a recording the news channel acquired.

This would not be the first case in which a disconnect between federal and local officials led to potential danger for a local community. In Garland, Texas, a free speech protest and cartoon contest on May 3, 2015 was targeted by two Islamic State-linked jihadists armed with rifles, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi. The attack took place while an undercover FBI agent shadowed the two attackers and took pictures.

While the FBI says they warned Garland police that the two may have had an interest in the target, police guarding the event say they were never warned of an impending assault. Simpson and Soofi injured a security guard before being shot dead by a quick-acting Garland police officer.

Failing to Intercept ‘Known Wolves’

Repeated incidents of western law enforcement agencies having detailed intelligence on terror suspects, yet failing to prevent attacks has led to the use of the term “Known Wolves” by policy critics, who say agencies aren’t doing enough to preempt terrorism by those under surveillance.

Feelings of mutual distrust between local and federal law enforcement linger, despite the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) system intended to incorporate local and state law enforcement with the FBI’s efforts. While local law enforcement complains of having hands tied or being left uninformed of dangerous jihadists in their midst, federal law enforcement sometimes sees local law enforcement as compromised.

Examples include Fairfax County Police officer Weiss Rasool, who in 2005 allegedly searched police databases and tipped off terror suspects, who were preparing to flee when federal law enforcement swooped in to make an arrest. And in 2009 FBI agents fumed when a local imam tipped off Najibullah Zazi, the leader of a three-person terror cell plotting bombings in New York City. The imam had been contacted by New York Police Department officers looking for intel.

While federal authority over terrorism cases predominates, the New Mexico case feeds local law enforcement’s growing perception that they can’t assume the FBI has the situation under control. It also indicates the difficulties for local law enforcement when complicated cases with possible terror links are suddenly thrust into their laps.

It’s local law enforcement, not federal agents, who remain most likely to receive community tips, and to recognize changes in their neighborhood beats. Local law enforcement is also more likely to be the first to spot tell-tale signs of criminal schemes to finance terrorism, or crimes like child or domestic abuse that may open a window of intervention, as occurred in the New Mexico case.

While investigators’ handling of the child abuse case in New Mexico raises concerns, the use of state-level terrorism prosecutions has seen significant success in states like neighboring Arizona, where counterterrorism laws do not require an “overt act” to prosecute, as federal terrorism laws do, making preemptive prosecutions of would-be jihadists more viable.

We should continue to expect better cooperation between all levels of law enforcement in the effort to defeat jihadist terror. But at the end of the day, local law enforcement should not accept having their “hands tied” from protecting their communities nor take a back seat on counterterrorism.

Kavanaugh Allegations Are Psychological Terrorism. It’s Time They End,"The left’s smear tactics have come on full display during the surfeit of attacks on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Whether you support or oppose this SCOTUS nomination, the tactics being used are more extreme even than during the Clarence Thomas hearings.

But as we know, they are nothing new, and Democrats will continue to use them until the American people scream “Enough!” — because they are effective. The real goal is psychological terrorism—that is, engaging in a scorched-earth effort to destroy the target, and in so doing intimidating anyone willing to enter public service, or even just support a public figure that does not parrot the politically correct line.

The charges do not need to be true, or even credible. People do not recoil because of the charges themselves (although, as we see, the left spares no effort to dream up the worst accusations they can think of). People recoil out of fear.

This tactic relies on the human herding instinct. People naturally shy away from anyone so vilified, whether the charges are credible or not, simply out of fear of being smeared with the same brush. They don’t want to be ostracized by the group.

Such excommunication has real consequences on reputations, jobs, relationships, even survival. The real goal is to threaten the rest of us into silence. How many people, for example, never used Donald Trump yard signs or bumper stickers out of fear of ostracism, or even property destruction?

Psychological Terrorism Enables Actual Terrorism

The vilification tactic is a form of psychological terrorism. Furthermore, because the fury displayed by those leveling the charges is so relentless and uncompromising, it carries its own threat. Sometimes people act on it and it becomes actual terrorism.

In 2012, homosexual activist Floyd Corkins attacked the Family Research Council’s office, intending to murder as many as he could. He admitted he was inspired by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which had FRC on its “Hate Watch” list. FRC, a mainstream conservative Christian organization, is still on the list.

Corkins was convicted of terrorism, and only stopped by a security guard who was injured in the process. Similarly James Hodgkinson, who attacked GOP congressmen practicing for a baseball game in 2017, engaged in a real act of domestic terrorism, fueled by hatred for Republicans. Hodgkinson “liked” SPLC on his Facebook page.

Antifa, the new name for anarchist left street rioters, has made explicit threats of violence. After chasing Sen. Ted Cruz and his wife out of a local restaurant, an Antifa DC chapter threatened on Twitter, “You are not safe.” And more: “This is a message to Ted Cruz, Bret [sic] Kavanaugh, Donald Trump and the rest of the racist, sexist, transphobic, and homophobic right-wing scum: You are not safe. We will find you. We will expose you. We will take from you the peace you have taken from so many others.”

Another Antifa member, a professor at the City University of New York, tweeted, “Reminder that if Trump does end up winning this stupid thing to assassinate Mike Pence *first*.”

GOP senators decry the tactics being used against Kavanaugh while virtue-signaling their insistence on hearing the accuser’s testimony. What they should be doing instead is taking every opportunity to highlight this unethical behavior.

Defamation Attacks Follow a Definite Pattern

In 2010, Laird Wilcox penned an article titled “The Practice of Ritual Defamation,” that describes the process. The most salient points are quoted here:

In ritual defamation the victim must have violated a particular taboo in some way, usually by expressing or identifying with a forbidden attitude, opinion or belief… The method of attack… is to assail the character of the victim… Character assassination is its primary tool… An important rule in ritual defamation is to avoid engaging in any kind of debate over the truthfulness or reasonableness of what has been expressed, only condemn it… The victim is often somebody in the public eye – someone who is vulnerable to public opinion… An attempt, often successful, is made to involve others in the defamation… In order for a ritual defamation to be effective, the victim must be dehumanized to the extent that he becomes identical with the offending attitude, opinion or belief, and in a matter… where it appears at its most extreme. Also to be successful, a ritual defamation must bring pressure and humiliation on the victim from every quarter, including family and friends. If the victim has school children, they may be taunted and ridiculed as a consequence of adverse publicity. Any explanation the victim may offer, including the claim of being misunderstood, is considered irrelevant. To claim truth as a defense for a politically incorrect value, opinion or belief is interpreted as defiance and only compounds the problem…

This defamation tactic has a long and ignoble history. It was first systematically developed by a regime whose primary governing method was terrorism. One hundred years ago, the first Soviet leader, Vladimir Lenin, announced:

We must be ready to employ trickery, deceit, law-breaking, withholding and concealing truth… We can and must write in a language that inspires hate, revulsion and scorn toward those who disagree with us . (Emphasis mine.)

His goal, adopted and practiced by the world’s communist parties, was to vilify, isolate, and destroy anyone who opposed their political goals, for any reason. In subsequent years, the Soviets told the world’s Communist parties to magnify this criticism:

Members and front organizations must continually embarrass, discredit and degrade our critics. When obstructionists become too irritating, label them as fascist or Nazi or anti-Semitic… constantly associate those who oppose us with those names that already have a bad smel l . The association will, after enough repetition, become ‘fact’ in the public mind . (Emphasis mine.)

By Tolerance, They Mean You Must Be Silenced

In 1965, Frankfurt School Communist Herbert Marcuse, then a professor at Brandeis University, further developed the idea with an essay titled “Repressive Tolerance.” He dedicated the essay to his Brandeis students.

Marcuse argued that, even though America has the First Amendment, the left could never get its agenda adopted because we are an unrepentantly repressive, imperialist, capitalist country. So of course America would never voluntarily adopt the “liberating” tenets of communism. Marcuse argued for what he called “liberating tolerance,” i.e. silencing the left’s critics and allowing leftist ideas only:

Not ‘equal’ but more representation of the Left would be equalization of the prevailing inequality… Given this situation, I suggested in ‘Repressive Tolerance’ the practice of discriminating tolerance in an inverse direction, as a means of shifting the balance between Right and Left by restraining the liberty of the Right, thus counteracting the pervasive inequality of freedom (unequal opportunity of access to the means of democratic persuasion) and strengthening the oppressed against the oppressors.

Marcuse further described the types of people who needed to have their freedom curtailed:

[It] would include the withdrawal of toleration of speech and assembly from groups and movements which promote aggressive policies, armament, chauvinism, discrimination on the grounds of race and religion, or which oppose the extension of public services, social security, medical care, etc.

In other words, pretty much anyone who disagrees with them. Can you visualize the Internal Revenue Service making up an “enemies list” of those who opposed Obamacare, for example? They did. Significantly, Marcuse referred to opponents as the “party of hate” in opposition to humanity.

This essay was very popular among the left, although most of the rest of us never heard of it. The tactic has come to be called “partisan tolerance.” Marcuse, by the way, was called the “Father of the New Left,” and was one of the prime progenitors of cultural Marxism, or political correctness. He was thrown out of Brandeis for being too radical, believe it or not, and resettled at the University of California, San Diego.

The Left Explicitly Uses These Tactics On Purpose

Marcuse worked closely with Julian Bond, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which adopted Marcuse’s partisan tolerance methods. That is why moderate Muslims, Christian groups, anti-terrorism groups and practically all prominent conservatives find themselves on SPLC’s “Hate Watch” list.

Nobody really “hates” them except the SPLC and its allies in the far left, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Council on American-Islamic Relations, and even now the Anti-Defamation League. But do not be mistaken: Their goal is not merely to silence us, but ultimately to criminalize what we say for simply disagreeing with them.

Most people are now familiar with Saul Alinsky and his “Rules for Radicals.” President Obama and Hillary Clinton were both avid followers of Alinsky. But his contribution was merely taking Lenin and Marcuse, and turning their ideas into 13 concise rules.

Leftist leaders all learn these tactics. They are taught in training schools like the Midwest Academy, and in seminars throughout the country. Not only Antifa types, but media leaders, political leaders, teachers, and professors have become conversant in this tactic. Rank-and-file Democrats have caught on, and now you can face this same tactic sitting across the dinner table from a liberal relative, neighbor, or friend.

The Media Amplifies These Techniques

The media, particularly, is to blame. It is insufficient to describe the media as “in the tank” for Democrats, Hillary Clinton, Obama, or whoever. The left media is a leader of the opposition, and has been for decades. It sets the narrative for the day, which is often word-for-word across news outlets; it pushes Democrat talking points and cultural Marxist priorities; it suppresses news adverse to the left and misinforms on the news it does report; it weaponizes language and acts as a self-funded intelligence agency for the left, researching, outing, doxing, and vilifying its enemies.

Reporters have been scouring the nation to find anyone, anywhere, who can say anything against Kavanaugh. Would they do that against any Democrat? Rush Limbaugh today described one caller’s experience:

She told us on this program yesterday that reporters from the Huffing and Puffington Post and other Drive-By outlets were hounding her throughout the summer for data, for information, tell-all on Kavanaugh. From the summer! From THE SUMMER! The media has been chasing down, tracking down anybody and everybody that might have gone to school with Kavanaugh! They’re calling them up and they’re interviewing them, in some cases browbeating them, and this caller yesterday said (summarized), ‘They’re clearly looking for certain angles, and I didn’t provide it to them, and they got irritated and pending ending the conversation.’

Democrat Hillary operative Brian Fallon even acknowledged the Democrat strategy against Trump in a New York Times interview: “First, block Kavanaugh, then fight like hell to win back the Senate.”

Bork Was Only One Casualty in This Long War

This tactic has a long and sordid history, solidly in evidence since its use against Robert Bork and well before that. The Joseph McCarthy hearings were another page out of the communist playbook. You may like or hate McCarthy. It is irrelevant. He could have been Mother Theresa and the left would have set out to destroy him.

Everything the Democrats have done is proof that they intended to use this tactic against Kavanaugh: from the screaming (paid) protesters they organized for the first hearings, to the accusations being leveled at him by ever-more outrageous “witnesses.” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose tactics were nakedly designed to stall the hearings and destroy Kavanaugh, can and should be censured for her actions.

Don’t Use Saudi Abuse As An Excuse To Prop Up The Iranian Terror State,"For many, Jamal Khashoggi’s gruesome death at the hands of Saudi government-sanctioned gangsters has become a good time to debate the morals of doing business with authoritarians and theocrats. We shouldn’t fool ourselves into believing any Islamic state shares our values — though, of course, Democrats would never put it so starkly.

Then again, most of the loudest advocates for withdrawing from the Saudi alliance were themselves prepared to pay off the theocracy of Iran for merely dropping their nuclear plans, ignoring decades of terror and murder aimed at Americans and others. So when it comes to the issue of human rights or national virtue in Middle East, the Iran boosters shouldn’t be taken seriously.

#SaudiArabia are rat killers who’ve used filthy oil money to buy silence & access in DC & around world, crypto Islamic-fascists-We’ve wrongly made Iran boogey man. He’s been living in #Riyadh whole time. Remember 9/11-Remember African embassies-Remember UssCole Remember Khashoggi — Geraldo Rivera (@GeraldoRivera) October 19, 2018

Here, for instance, is Geraldo Rivera, perhaps more transparently than most Iran advocates, laying out the choice.

Perhaps Rivera doesn’t know that Barack Obama’s Defense Department believed the Islamic Republic was likely responsible for the death of at least 500 American troops in Iraq — and the wounding of hundreds more. Those Americans might not have been opinion journalists at The Washington Post, but they faced a boogey men who armed and funded by the Iranian regime.

Perhaps he doesn’t know that in 2018, the State Department found that Iran was a leading state sponsor of terrorism with a “near-global reach,” sending operatives around the world, including to the United States. As reported in The New Yorker (and elsewhere,) Iran has sponsored “at least 30 terrorist attacks between 2011 and 2013, in places as far flung as Thailand, New Delhi, Lagos, and Nairobi.” We know this is true because we keep catching them here. Some of these boogey men were caught in a scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to blow up the Saudi Ambassador at a restaurant near the White House.

Though acts of terrorism have fallen around the world — and, whether we like them or not, Saudis have helped in this regard — the U.S.’s Annual Country Reports on Terrorism, also singled out Iran as using “terrorism as a tool of its statecraft. It has no reservations about using that tool on any continent.” We know this from that time some boogey men blew a Jewish center in Buenos Aires, killing 85 innocent people.

Of course, Iranian treatment of journalists has been consistently appalling, as well. At least four have been murdered in Iran since 1997, probably more. Maybe they were hung next to gay men, adulteresses or dissidents that are regularly executed. Zahra Kazemi, a Canadian, was raped, tortured and murdered by Iranian officials in 2013. Hundreds more have been flogged and brutalized since the revolution by these boogey men.

Iran has been taking American hostages since 1979. The most infamous recent case was that of journalist Jason Rezaian, who was lucky to get out. Right now, though, Siamak Namazi, Baquer Namazi, Karan Vafadari and Afarin Neyssari are all naturalized American citizens sitting in jail cells in Iran. Right now an American named Xiyue Wang — not a journalist but a PhD candidate and researcher at Princeton University — is serving a 10-year sentence.

Moreover, Iran has a hand in every terrorist act that Rivera points to as proof of Saudi guilt.

Though surely Saudis, themselves religious totalitarians, deserve blame for creating an environment that fosters Islamic radicalism (Obama couldn’t even get himself to utter the words much less do anything about it) none of the 9/11 hijackers — 15 of the 19 were born in the Kingdom — were sent to the United States by the Saudi government. Iran wasn’t officially tied to 9/11 either, but the 9/11 Commission Report did find that 8 to 10 of the hijackers had passed through Iran and “their travel was facilitated by Iranian border guards.” The report also found other ties between Iran and Al-Qaeda.

And since you bring it up, Geraldo, in 2011, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that bombing of those U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were the result of “direct assistance” from Iran and Sudan. Not the Saudis. Iran, the court found, “aided, abetted and conspired with Hezbollah, Osama Bin Laden, and al Qaeda to launch large-scale bombing attacks against the United States by utilizing the sophisticated delivery mechanism of powerful suicide truck bombs.”

We shouldn’t forget those 17 American sailors who were murdered in the USS Cole bombing in 2000. In 2015, a U.S. federal judge found that Iran was complicit in that attack as well, stating that “Iran was directly involved in establishing Al-Qaeda’s Yemen network and supported training and logistics for Al-Qaeda in Gulf region” through their proxy Hezbollah. The Islamic Republic was ordered to pay $75 million to the families of the dead. It’s a shame Obama didn’t think to deduct the amount from the over billion in cash he sent on unmarked plane headed for Tehran.

Though it’s a long time ago, I also remember the Beirut Marine Barracks bombings, in which Iran had a hand in the murder of 241 U.S. troops (also, over 60 French peacekeepers and civilian workers.). Today Iran still sends Hezbollah cash, and advanced weapons that can turn rockets into precision missiles. It still funds the Assad regime in Syria, which is responsible for the gassing of thousands of innocent people, as well as an array of atrocities that cross every moral red line imaginable.

Right now, Iran and Saudi are fighting a war in Yemen. Yet, only one of those nations gets the brunt of criticism. Iran also still threatens and funds terrorism against Israel — our only ally in the Middle East (and let’s include Turkey for kicks) that doesn’t jail, or torture or execute dissenters. Yet, that is the only other ally Iran-boosters seem interested in criticizing.

So I do wonder if Youcef Nadarkhani, the Christian pastor sentenced to death for his beliefs, sees Iran as a boogey man. I wonder if Salman Rushdie, or other blasphemers, think Iran is a boogey man. Or if those women and girls subjected to “domestic violence and early and forced marriage,” which is “widespread and committed with impunity,” think Iran is the boogey man.

Saudi Arabia and Iran are both openly Islamic theocracies. We can hold the former responsible for the murder of Khashoggi, and exert more genuine pressure to force it to embrace reforms, but in the end, the choice right now is whether we do business with a theocracy that helps alleviate terror or one that instigates and deploys it. Once the Iranian government is overthrown, maybe the calculus changes.

4 Times The Popular Narrative Was Wrong About Terror Attacks,"With less than two weeks before the midterms, it is instructive to remember that the rush to presuppose the culprits and motives behind unsolved terror attacks sometimes leads to blind alleys. The facts of these cases do not always end up following preconceived narratives.

Alexander Soros, the son of major leftist funder George Soros, is among those who blame President Trump for inspiring the recent pipe bomb mailings directed to former vice president Joe Biden, actor Robert De Niro, former President Obama, Hillary Clinton, George Soros, former attorney general Eric Holder, former CIA director John Brennan, and California Rep. Maxine Waters.

One can understand why a son frightened for his father’s safety might lash out at a president who seems to share political enemies with the culprit of these attacks. But the rest of us shouldn’t believe accusations like this without good evidence.

The culprit (or culprits) need to be caught and punished. Period. There’s no political angle to that proposition. History has repeatedly made fools of those who attempt to solve terror attacks based upon narratives. Things are not always what they seem. Here is a list of four times that apparent terror attacks on America ended up not fitting the popular narrative.

1. The 1996 Atlanta Olympics Bombing

As described by Wikipedia, Richard Allensworth Jewell was an American police officer and security guard who discovered a backpack filled with three pipe bombs in the Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 summer Olympics. Jewell alerted police and helped to evacuate the area before the bomb exploded, saving many people from injury or death.

Three days later, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution revealed that the FBI was treating him as a possible suspect, based largely on a “lone bomber” criminal profile. For the next several weeks, the news media focused aggressively on him as the presumed culprit, labeling him with the ambiguous term “person of interest” and sifting through his life to match a leaked “lone bomber” profile that the FBI had used.

The media, to varying degrees, portrayed Jewell as a failed law enforcement officer who may have planted the bomb so he could “find” it and be a hero. The media frenzy was wrong. The real culprit was Eric Rudolph. The allegations nevertheless destroyed Jewell’s life.

2. The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing

In 1995 a massive bomb exploded outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people. Initially, several news organizations, including CNN, reported that investigators were seeking to question several men, described as being Middle Eastern in appearance, who had driven away from the building shortly before the blast. The real culprits were not connected in any way to Islam or the Middle East.

3. The 2002 DC Sniper

In October 2002, the DC area was terrorized by a shooting spree that claimed ten lives and injured three. On October 3, 2002, a witness spotted a white van or truck speeding from the scene of one of the shootings. The initial FBI profile had law enforcement looking for a white male, 25-40 years old, who was a firefighter or construction worker.

These assumptions were wrong. The real culprit did not drive a box van or truck, was not white, and was not a firefighter or construction worker.

4. The 2001 Anthrax Attacks

Shortly after the 2001 terror attacks on September 11, 2001, letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news offices and to Democratic Sens. Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy. Initially the FBI focused on an American physician and virological weapons expert who worked at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.

The FBI repeatedly raided his house and his phone was tapped. In addition, Attorney General John Ashcroft named Steven Hatfill as a “person of interest” in the investigation on national television. Eventually, however, the federal government was forced to pay Hatfill $4.6 million to settle a lawsuit and issue an official exoneration.

In 2008 the FBI identified Bruce Edward Ivans as the sole perpetrator of the anthrax attacks. Ivans committed suicide before being brought to justice.

To the victims of these apparent latest pipe bomb attacks, I offer my prayers and support. Thank God nobody was hurt. I also offer my thanks and support to law enforcement, whom I suspect are already closing in on the culprit or culprits.

When Sen. Bernie Sanders supporter James Thomas Hodgkinson attempted to shoot several members of Congress, including Steve Scalise, a number of conservatives distinguished themselves by refusing to blame Sanders for the acts of one of his political supporters.

Peter Roff of U.S. News and World Report noted, “It is remarkable therefore that those potentially most affected by this, including President Donald Trump, have been counseling reconciliation and unity. They have not…sought to blame and shame their opposite numbers for creating an environment in which such things are possible.”

Conservative talk show host Sean Hannity said, “There’s always gonna be a crazy in every crowd. The shooting that took place at that baseball game practice, where Steve Scalise was shot, he was a Bernie supporter, but I don’t blame Bernie Sanders for the fact that one of his supporters is a nut.”

Not every conservative can claim the honor of refraining from politicizing the shooting. But history is kind to those who resist this temptation, particularly before the facts are in.

What makes these attacks so puzzling is that they come at a time that the president is trying to emphasize the violence of his political opponents. These attacks undermine that message and do not help the political opponents of the victims. Certainly, of someone who has the broken mental circuitry required to construct and mail pipe bombs, it is not a stretch to imagine that he also lacks rational political instincts.

One thing we know for certain: We don’t yet know the full story.

Iran’s Hits On Western Soil Reveal Establishment Hypocrisy,"While America is often insulated from the most malign of Iran’s activities, even if only by dint of our distant geographic position, the brazen and bellicose mullocracy has reminded us of its global reach at a pivotal time. This global reach extends from our Transatlantic allies, to our southern neighbors and our own shores. Clearly, Iran feels it perfectly acceptable to carry out murderous acts here in the West with impunity.

This all should only underscore the need to counter the Khomeinist regime using every element of national power at all points of leverage. The political establishment’s silence in the face of this threat — if not its urging to engage further economically with Iran while punishing its foes in spite of the calamitous consequences of that very policy during the Obama years — is stunning.

For the latest evidence of Iran’s audacious aggression, America need look no further than Europe. There, Iranian hit squads, in part under diplomatic cover, have been exposed for plotting a string of assassinations in what seems to be a concerted campaign to take out the ayatollahs’ political rivals in exile, among other foes.

The latest evidence of this effort comes mere days before U.S. sanctions are set to “snapback” on Iran in strategically significant sectors like shipping, energy and finance. Some Europeans have resisted these very sanctions. But do not hold your breath waiting for the media and political establishment to harp on these attempted hits. This is Iran after all, not Saudi Arabia.

According to the Associated Press, in September 2018, Denmark’s national security service foiled an alleged assassination plot directed by Iranian intelligence against a leader of the Danish wing of a militant Iranian separatist group called the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA). This follows the 2017 murder of the founder of the ASMLA, Ahmad Mola Nissi, in The Hague at the hands of an “unidentified assailant.” Dutch authorities reportedly expelled two Iranian diplomats who may have been linked to the Nissi assassination.

ASMLA consists of Ahwazi Arabs, a small minority in Persian-dominated Iran, who desire independence, and according to Amnesty International are subject to severe repression. ASMLA has engaged in violent acts against the Iranian regime, including attacks on energy infrastructure in Iran’s oil-rich Khuzestan province, where Ahwazis predominate, and against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

ASMLA was implicated — at least by the Iranians — in an armed ambush of a military parade just days before the Danish assassination plot was foiled, killing more than 20 people. Their alleged connection to that attack is unclear. Iran has since further cracked down on the Awhazi population. In the wake of the alleged ASMLA ambush, the Islamic Republic also recalled the envoys of Denmark, Great Britain, and the Netherlands for supposedly harboring ASMLA, which it lists as a terrorist group.

It appears Western governments disagree with this designation. Danish authorities had reportedly been protecting the ASMLA leader targeted by the Iranians for months because of threats to his safety. Israel’s Mossad supposedly provided critical intelligence that enabled Denmark to scuttle the attack. Denmark’s Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen tweeted after the plot was revealed: “It is totally unacceptable that Iran or any other foreign state plans assassinations on Danish soil. Further actions against Iran will be discussed in the EU.”

It is clear the Danes did not consider this some kind of justifiable Iranian counterterror operation. Meanwhile, ASMLA’s branch in the Netherlands appears to operate openly. The United States does not designate ASMLA as a foreign terrorist organization. It is telling that Iran has denied the plot allegations as “biased” and “anti-Iran,” while threatening Denmark over taking “ill-advised and controversial actions,” rather than even trying to level a propagandistic argument that it was pursuing a terrorist organization abroad, as Western nations do.

Meanwhile, this past summer, Iranian intelligence allegedly plotted an attack on an event outside Paris attended by thousands, including notable American political figures such as Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani. The rally was organized by The National Council of Resistance of Iran, and backed by the Iran-hated Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) opposition group. The foiled plot resulted in four arrests, including that of an Iranian diplomat stationed in Austria.

MEK, which is dedicated to overthrowing Iran’s mullocratic regime and establishing a “secular republic,” used to be designated as a terrorist group by many Western governments. Those designations were lifted in the EU, United States, and Canada between 2009 and 2012. In March, Albanian authorities arrested two Iranian nationals on terrorism charges — purportedly threatening MEK — after they were caught allegedly carrying out reconnaissance on a location prior to the Iranian Nowruz New Year celebration.

Iran’s unwillingness to take responsibility for these operations betrays its full knowledge that it is acting illegitimately, not just fighting militants, living up to its name as the world’s leading state sponsor of terror. Iran’s assassinations abroad of course extend well beyond just seeking to pick off threats to the dictatorship’s power. In January, German police conducted raids across the nation in pursuit of 10 alleged IRGC Qods Force intelligence officials spying on Israeli and Jewish targets.

Back in 2012, Hezbollah operatives allegedly blew up a bus at the Burgas airport, killing 5 Israelis and the Bulgarian bus driver and injuring 32 more Israelis. Highly curiously, in spite of Bulgarian authorities’ original attribution of the attack to Hezbollah, and of substantial evidence supporting that claim, the prosecutor of that case has now excluded Hezbollah from the indictment, perhaps indicating fear of further Iranian bloodshed. Such Iran-linked plots in Europe stretch back 40 years.

Perhaps most brazenly of all attempted Iranian attacks on political opponents in the West in recent memory is the alleged Quds Force-backed plot to bomb the then-Saudi ambassador to the United States, Adel al-Jubeir, at Georgetown eatery Café Milano in 2011. There is also disastrous competition for Iranian carnage in our hemisphere, when one considers the 1994 AMIA bombing. Needless to say, behind the bespectacled, Cheshire cat-like, seemingly urbane Iranian officials who face the West, lies a regime that has no qualms about murdering its perceived rivals abroad.

At home, the Khomeinist mullocracy is responsible for pervasive human rights abuses and violently suppressing political dissent (even taking Washington Post journalists hostage), and holds the dubious distinction of ranking number one in the world in per capita executions. It seeks to expand its Islamic Revolution and subdue rival regimes not only by threats, proxy wars and jihad, but also by cyberattacks and information warfare.

“Death to Israel,” followed closely by “Death to America,” form the unifying ethos of Iran’s Islamic totalitarian theocracy. Stated succinctly, Iran combines the brutal savagery and repression of the Saudis, with the subversion and destabilization emphasis of the Russians and the Jew-hatred of the neo-Nazis – with its hands drenched in the blood of hundreds of Americans dating back over the almost 40 years since the overthrow of the Shah and the taking of U.S. hostages at our embassy in Tehran.

Yet in the wake of l’affaire Khashoggi, Russiagate and the neo-Nazi attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue, there is no such widespread call for challenging Iran. On the contrary, the badgering by the likes of former Obama national security advisor Susan Rice, representative of our progressive media and political establishment, to push Saudi Arabia’s Muhammad bin Salman (MBS) aside as our number one priority in the Middle East would lead to the very chaos that would benefit none other than the Saudi’s sworn enemy, Iran.

Of course, making Iran the Middle East hegemon while empowering the “political Islamist” Muslim Brotherhood was always the desire of the Obamaites, many in the foreign policy establishment, and certainly their like-minded lackeys in the media. Perhaps more baffling is that Jason Rezaian, the Iranian-American former Tehran bureau chief of the Washington Post, who was arrested and held prisoner for a year-and-a-half by the Khomeinist mullocracy, yet argues, “Instead of isolating Iran and its people any further, I say embrace them.”

This coddling of Iran and chiding of its foes is inexplicable from the perspective of American national interest, given only Iran poses an imminent, direct threat to America and her allies, not just on the streets of Berlin or Paris, but in Latin America and on U.S. soil. In fact, as we fast approach the re-imposition of sanctions on the Iranian regime, there are indications that the Khomeinists will directly threaten if not outright attack America and her assets.

Those who continue to adhere to the Iran appeasement agenda while attacking its foes and giving other equally brutal and detrimental regimes a free pass should be asked the following questions regarding Tehran:

If you believe in the imperative to punish dictators who threaten human rights, why do you steadfastly oppose exerting maximum economic pressure to hamstring such a regime? If you believe in preserving Western civilization, why are you willing to sell it out to a mullocracy that threatens to murder citizens on your own soil? If you believe in the necessity to fight anti-Semitism, why would you appease and enable supremacist fanatics dedicated to destruction of the Jewish state?

Our Wilsonian internationalist national security and foreign policy establishment owes us an explanation for why, given the history of tyranny, bloodshed, and anti-Americanism, its faithful are so devoted to making their bed with Khomeinists on the Shia side and Muslim Brotherhood members and Islamist fellow travelers on the Sunni side. Either the establishment should treat all such regressive powers with equal contempt and aggressiveness, or it should admit it plays favorites, and tell us why its favorites happen to be the most hostile of all towards America.

More pressingly, the foregoing underscores the danger posed by an Iran evidently willing to engage in assassinations around the world, an Iran likely to grow increasingly desperate and thus dangerous as sanctions starve it for cash. The answer to Iran’s aggression is not to appease it — which only rewards aggression — but to meet it with overwhelming strength and an indomitable will.

Foiled Terror Plot Underscores The Need For Maximum Pressure On Iran,"A recent Iranian plot to assassinate an Iranian opponent living in Copenhagen came to light when it was disrupted by authorities in Denmark. At least one would-be terrorist was arrested, and the Iranian ambassador was summoned to answer for the incident.

The Danish plot was evidently traceable to Iran’s leadership, as was the terrorist plot foiled by French, Belgian, and German intelligence a month prior. A comprehensive French investigation left no doubt about the Iranian regime’s responsibility for the plan to bomb a rally of Iranian expatriates outside Paris. Two operatives, along with the leading Iranian diplomat in Europe for whom they were working, were caught red-handed.

These latest terror plots demonstrate a pattern of Iranian behavior that goes well beyond the two incidents. Prior to the Paris plot, two operatives were arrested in Albania, where they had been planning an attack on the residence of more than 2,500 members of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), the primary rivals to Iran’s theocratic rulers.

Thankfully, all three recent plots were thwarted, but Western policymakers and foreign governments should not assume that all Iran-backed terrorism will prove unsuccessful. Iranian proxies like Hezbollah have killed hundreds of Western nationals over the years, and other acts of Iranian terror did in fact claim the lives of their targets.

Even when the nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1 was being negotiated, as well as when that deal was in full force, the regime’s behavior did not change for the better. While the world squarely focused on the nuclear issue, and Tehran basked in the international legitimacy handed to it, the clerical regime stepped up some of the worst of its behaviors. Many human rights experts note that the environment of domestic repression only grew worse in the wake of those negotiations.

The nuclear agreement failed to deliver on its promise of facilitating regional peace and stability, or of encouraging the Iranian regime to moderate. In the wake of at least three major Iranian terror plots in 2018, Western leaders must recognize the futility of attempting to bribe Iran’s leaders into compliance with international standards. A policy of “maximum pressure” is much more likely to compel reasonable behavior.

This is especially true now, given the explosive domestic situation in Iran. As much as it is acting in line with its traditionally hard-line, anti-Western identity, the regime is also reacting to ongoing protests when it reaches far beyond its borders to kill or injure pro-democracy activists. Maryam Rajavi, the president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, predicted in March that the recurrent uprisings could lead to the people’s victory over a deeply unpopular regime. The regime’s reckless efforts to lash out suggest that it recognizes that same scenario.

It will do no harm for Western powers to adopt that same view and begin exerting serious pressure on the regime in support of the uprisings. The more pressure Tehran faces from abroad, the more it will be compelled to focus on the fight within its borders. The imperative for the EU and the United States to confront the Iranian threat jointly is more pressing than ever. Circumventing U.S. sanctions, as the EU has proposed through “PVC,” is completely out of touch with reality.

There are several key ways that Western powers could and should support the people of Iran, while exerting well-deserved pressure on the ruling regime. First, all Iranian embassies in Europe known to have provided diplomatic cover for terrorism on the continent should be shut down, and all Iranian diplomats engaged in illegal activities expelled. Second, all Iranian agents in Europe and the United States should be prosecuted. Third, all companies and organizations involved in planning, training, facilitating, and funding terrorism should be sanctioned.

Western support for democratic change can be expressed over both traditional and digital media platforms. America is taking action in this regard: In the past two years, the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), the U.S. government agency responsible for international media, is improving and expanding its outreach to Iran’s people. The BBG’s Office of Internet Freedom is also helping millions of Iranians break through tough digital barriers erected by the regime in Iran. The EU should follow the BBG’s lead and take similar actions.

These are concrete steps to rectify the conciliatory Western policies that turned a blind eye to human rights abuses in a bid to encourage moderation. We know that approach produced little more than worsening abuses and an increased threat of Iran’s terrorism extending to the West. Hopefully, they are also concrete steps toward a goal we can all unite behind: an end to Iran’s terrorism, warmongering and domestic repression.

"If Patterns Hold, There May Be Terrorists Inside The Border Caravan","President Trump’s recent claim that some Middle Easterners might be among caravan members moving north from Honduras provoked a storm of inquest seeking proof. The president had none to immediately offer. Scorn followed. Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, in one emblematic expression, dismissed the idea of Middle Easterners and potential terrorists among them as “pretty much a canard and a fear tactic.”

When reporters pressed a few days later, the president said he had “very good information” that the caravan included Middle Easterners, but “There’s no proof of anything.” Sunday night, a group of mostly male caravan members charged the U.S. border throwing rocks and shouting “Yes, we can,” according to Fox News. In response, U.S. Customs and Border Protection closed the port of entry between Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego.

While President Trump may well have employed the prospect of terrorist infiltration as election messaging, Middle Easterners from places like Syria, Iraq, and Egypt do indeed travel the same routes as Hondurans to the U.S. southern border, and rising numbers of suspected terrorists have, in fact, been apprehended at the border or en route in recent years.

One public case-in-point is Somali national Ibrahim Qoordheen, caught in Costa Rica in March 2017 after passing through Panama on a northward route. Costa Rican authorities publicly announced that U.S. officials requested his detention to investigate him as “connected to an international terrorist organization.”

Qoordheen is among growing ranks of suspected terrorists now being encountered on well-known U.S. border-bound land routes, or at southwest border itself. In fact, intelligence community sources with access to this information tell me that more than 100 migrants from “countries of interest” were apprehended between from 2012 through 2017 at the border or en route who were on U.S. terrorism “watch lists”— namely, the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), or the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB).

Much of this kind of information is classified, since all such encounters spark law enforcement investigations and intelligence-gathering that could be ruined by public disclosure. But quite a few instances over the years have become public to include border-crossers connected to al-Shabaab of Somalia, Hezbollah of Lebanon, and Harkat-al-Jihad-al-Islami of Bangladesh.

For instance, in December 2012, U.S. prosecutors convicted Somali national Abdullahi Omar Fidse for asylum fraud after he traveled through Latin America to a Mexico-Texas port of entry in 2008. An FBI counterterrorism investigation found he had served as an al-Shabaab combat operative, possessed the cell phone number of a terrorist implicated in the 2010 Uganda bombing that killed 70 soccer fans, and knew detailed operational knowledge of an aborted plot to assassinate the U.S. ambassador to Kenya.

In June 2014, another Somali crossed the Mexico-Texas border and admitted al-Shabaab had trained him to be a suicide bomber. Another Somali who crossed the Mexico-California border in 2011 went on to conduct a vehicle-ramming attack in Edmonton, Alberta in Canada in September 2017 while carrying an ISIS flag in his car.

In 2010, two Bangldeshi migrants reached the Mexico-Arizona border together. One admitted to being a member of a designated terrorist organization Harkat-al-Jihad-al-Islami Bangladesh. He was deported, but his partner absconded after release pending an asylum hearing that never happened. Court records from a recent material support prosecution against a reputed Hezbollah operative in New York revealed that the defendant’s father, Mohammad Kourani, who also was involved in the terrorist group’s activities, had illegally entered the United States through Mexico.

Other examples are too numerous to mention here. I have conducted face-to-face interviews with Middle Easterners who undertook this kind of migration. I have traveled from Syria and Jordan to Guatemala and Mexico investigating how they achieve these fantastic journeys and where the routes run. I have also analyzed thousands of court records from 22 U.S. migrant-smuggling prosecutions confirming the travel and revealing that a full-bodied American homeland security response to it has been quietly underway for years on the informed assumption the threat is real.

It is not just Middle Easterners traveling to the southern border, as the president said. Migrants from countries in South Asia such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh routinely make the U.S. border trip too, as do those from the Horn of Africa like Somalia and Sudan.

In fact, a Univision reporter found Bangladeshis in the current caravan and marveled at how they had made it so far from home. Homeland security agencies today identify these migrants as “special interest aliens” if they were from some 30 or so “countries of interest” where Islamist terrorist organizations fester, influence, and recruit.

Thus migrant flows from these parts of the world do have the potential to carry terrorist travelers. The idea, then and now, was that if benevolent migrants fleeing bad conditions in Muslim-majority countries could make it all the way to Mexico, then so could the malevolent. The threat derives mainly in the fact that most migrants arrive without any prior vetting or identification documents to help our border security people distinguish the malevolent from the benevolent.

This shouldn’t be a hard concept to grasp. Nor does this idea reside in right-wing nativist conspiracy territory; the threat concept been mainstreamed for years at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol, and the FBI. Terror travel over the United States’s land border was soberly warned of in the 9/11 Commission Report. One 2006 National Counterterrorism Center intelligence report characterized the thinking like this: “Terrorists could try to merge into SIA smuggling pipelines to enter the U.S. clandestinely…”

The threat is also bipartisanly recognized. Just two years ago, President Barack Obama’s DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson apparently had become so concerned about special interest alien travel over the southern border that he ordered a massive intelligence community-wide initiative to counter the migrants as “potential national security threats to our homeland.”

Dismissal and ridicule are perhaps made easier when no attack on U.S. soil from a border-crossing special-interest alien since 9/11. But what’s been happening in Europe lately, with its migrant caravans moving terrorists to its borders, must be mentioned. There, terror group operatives and sympathizers conducted significant numbers of plots and attacks, such as in Paris and Brussels, after traveling camouflaged with caravans of illegal immigrant asylum seekers.

Pundits can mock and ridicule, but they do so out of an unnecessary and easily remediated ignorance. They also do so to the faces of those in homeland security who work every day to reduce this infiltration risk, often in faraway lands and at personal risk.

WaPo Claims There's A 'Surge' In Right-Wing Terrorism. There Isn't,"A new Washington Post “analysis” of domestic terrorism argues that attacks from white supremacists and other “far-right attackers” have been on the rise since Barack Obama’s presidency, and “surged since President [Donald] Trump took office.” It’s a familiar storyline meant to assure liberals that, yes, Trump-motivated right-wing terrorists are running wild. There are, however, a few problems with this proposition.

For one thing, even if we accept the numbers the Post offers, the use of the word “surge” — meaning a sudden, powerful forward or upward movement — strains credibility. There’s no evidence of a “surge” either in historical context or as a matter of ideological preference. But even if we’re okay with replacing “uptick” with the word “surge,” a cynic might note that the Post’s reporters seem to filibuster their own findings to push preconceived partisan notions about the state of the nation.

That is to say, we have good reason not to accept the numbers. According to The Washington Post, which relies on Global Terrorism Database (GTD) data, there were allegedly zero — not one — acts of right-wing terrorism in the entire nation in the year 2002. Since then we have seen a “surge” to 36 in a nation of 325-plus million people by 2017. Among those acts, there were 11 fatalities.

Or, in other words, fewer homicides were committed by political terrorists of any stripe in the United States in 2017 than were committed by illegal immigrants in the state of Texas alone — which I am assured is an incredibly low number that shouldn’t worry us very much. If one of these is scaremongering, why not the other?

Then again, even if we use the criteria offered by GTD, we need to be exceptionally generous to even get to 36 incidents of right-wing violence in 2017 (I could only find 32).

For example, although the Post acknowledges that the Las Vegas shooter’s motivations are still unknown, the CTD had no problem categorizing the murderer of 59 people as an “anti-government extremist.” And it takes these sorts of assumptions to get in the vicinity of a “surge” in right-wing terrorism.

Of the 32 incidents I was able to find, 12 featured perpetrators who were merely “suspected” of being right-wing terrorists. Some of these incidents could have been the work of one person, as in the pellet-gun shootings of Muslims in New York. In other incidents, we are asked to treat patently insane people as if they have coherent political agendas. In still others, the attacks could easily have non-terroristic motivating factors.

Still other events are even more opaque. In San Juan, Puerto Rico — apparently a hotbed of white supremacy — an incendiary device was thrown into a gay night club. No one was injured, thankfully. Also, no one was caught and no one claimed responsibility for the act. The episode doesn’t even earn a “suspected” designation from GTD. And the Washington Post almost surely added this to its right-wing terror stats.

If the definition of domestic terrorism is muddy at best, the definition of “right-wing” terrorism is often arbitrary and self-serving. To help bolster right-wing terrorist stats, for instance, we would have to perfunctorily include every anti-Semitic act. The Washington Post even mentions an Anti-Defamation League (ADL) study showing “a 57 percent surge in anti-Semitic incidents in 2017.”

If anything, the ADL study is the kind of cautionary document demonstrating how difficult it is, not only to quantify these incidents, but to categorize them ideologically. The ADL’s faulty data was self-reported, and most of the “surge” can be attributed to a single Jewish teen in Israel calling in a number of bomb threats to Jewish centers.

In the real world, a Jewish American is probably more likely to encounter anti-Semitism at a college campus or progressive march in the guise of “anti-Zionism” than he is anywhere else, because Jew hatred is non-partisan.

Then there is the matter of inconsistently defining terrorism. If throwing a rock through the window of an Islamic center is an act of right-wing terrorism, why isn’t it an act of left-wing terrorism for anti-capitalists to throw rocks through the window of a business in Portland? Surely both fall under the description of terror, which is “the threatened or actual use of violence by nonstate actors seeking to attain political, economic, religious or social goals through fear or intimidation.” As far as I can tell, only one of these genres makes the cut at GTD.

Even if we were to accept the numbers, The Post decided to bury the lede. According to their own data, there were more fatalities due to domestic Islamist terrorism than to all other types combined over the past three years. In 2017, there were 16 fatalities due to Islamic extremism. Fatalities from Islamic terrorism in 2016 — which includes 49 killed in a gay Orlando nightclub by an ISIS-inspired jihadi — and 2015 were higher than all alleged right-wing terror attacks. There’s just as strong a case to be made that there has been a “surge” in Islamic terrorism in the United States since Donald Trump ran for president.

Then again, none of the three authors of the article take the time to mention a single one of those Islamic attacks. So while we learn that Trump is being blamed for a pipe bomb being thrown “yards” away from an Islamic enter by the “White Rabbit 3 Percent Illinois Patriot Freedom Fighters Militia,” we read nothing about the man who pledged his allegiance to ISIS before killing eight people on the West Side Highway in Manhattan.

This is what happens when reporters work backwards from a predetermined premise.

You’ll notice, as well, that these analyses typically begin in 2002, since the 2,996 Americans murdered in 2001 is inconvenient to the white-supremacy-is-more-dangerous-than-radical-Islam narrative. The reason we don’t have a real-life “surge” of Islamist attacks since 2001, incidentally, is that the United States has spent billions yearly to stop it.

Political violence isn’t the monopoly of any one group. Although there have been flare-ups of leftist violence in the 1900s and late 1960s-1970s—and other domestic acts of terror before and since—for the most part this kind of violence is still rare. That could change. And none of this is to say horrible events aren’t happening. Nor is it to say that haters don’t exist. But exaggerating the problem for political reasons doesn’t help anyone. Covering your partisan work with a bogus veneer of scientific analysis doesn’t make it any more useful.

The Nigerian Government Enables Islamic Terrorism Against Christians,"Although it has occasionally made headlines due to the rise of the violent Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram in its northern hinterland, Nigeria is still largely misunderstood and major events in the country remain under-reported in the American media. There are significant U.S. values and strategic interests at stake in Nigeria’s forthcoming election, including questions about the persecution of Christians, the future of U.S. military cooperation in Nigeria, and the spread of Islamist terrorism.

Nigeria is Africa’s largest democracy, with approximately 200 million people and expected to grow to more than 300 million by 2050. The country has long had a history of religious tension and conflict between the mostly Muslim north and predominately Christian south.

This conflict has intensified over the past several decades, engendered by the rise of a new radical Islamism, which has preached a brutal campaign of international holy war against unbelievers. In recent months, Nigeria has witnessed shocking anti-Christian violence, resulting in thousands of deaths and maimings.

Americans Largely Ignorant About What’s Happening

Few Americans are aware that the United States is in the process of selling a dozen light attack aircraft to the government of current President Muhammadu Buhari––a government that has continually soft-peddled and enabled a campaign of violence and ethnic cleansing carried out by Islamic militants against Nigeria’s Christian population.

This new radicalism was initially fueled by the ideology of groups like Al Qaeda, whose influence began to expand rapidly after the end of the Cold War. The ideology reached Nigeria in the form of Boko Haram, the radical Islamist group that made international headlines in 2015 when it kidnapped more than 200 school girls and publicly pledged its allegiance to the infamous and barbaric Islamic State.

The Islamist campaign against nonbelievers in the country hasn’t been limited to Boko Haram’s activities. Nigeria’s middle belt region (which serves as a de facto border region between its Christian and Muslim populations) has seen a running campaign of murder and intimidation against the Christian community there.

The campaign of religious murder has long been marketed by much of Nigeria’s leadership, particularly by its current president, as little more than a petty, mafia-style conflict between Fulani tribesmen, who are predominantly herdsmen, and Christian farmers over rights to grazing land. This approach, led by the current Buhari, downplays the significance of the violence. The violence is predominantly of a religious nature, with Christians being targeted for extermination by radical Islamists, as the Nigerian pastor Hassan John recently reported in the Wall Street Journal :

Boko Haram, a radical Islamic movement whose name roughly translates to ‘Western education is forbidden,’ has ramped up attacks on Christians this year. Since 2009 when Boko Haram began its rampage, about 20,000 Nigerians have been hacked with machetes or shot. Two million have been displaced. Pastors and their families have been specifically targeted for death…Pastors in northern and central Nigeria face daunting pressures. Some conduct funerals almost every week for victims, often in mass burials. They struggle to answer their parishioners’ questions about God’s love and justice. They hear powerful voices dismiss this as an ethnic clash, but they understand it is a strategic scorched-earth war, a jihad against Christianity.’

Who Is Muhammadu Buhari?

Buhari has sought to downplay the violence caused by Boko Haram-linked Islamist militants in the region. This policy of soft peddling the jihadi campaign of aggression against Nigeria’s Christians may be in Buhari’s personal and political interest. It makes arms sales and foreign support easier to obtain, and Buhari is a member of the very tribe that has been largely responsible for the anti-Christian violence.

Buhari’s tribe, the Fulani, have, according to a comprehensive report by World Watch Monitor, become a kind of nomadic vanguard for the spread of Islamic militancy and terror in Nigeria:

‘Herdsmen terrorism’ in Africa always needs to be seen in the context of Uthman Dan Fodio’s war of jihad: ‘Allah prescribed the jihad upon us in order to remove us from the harm which arises from leaning towards an impure world and clinging to its things which actually amount to nothing and the only benefit from it is regret.’… The transformation of the nomadic Sufis into guerrilla fighters, army commanders and even state leaders resulted from the ideology espoused by Ibn Taymiyya that jihad was not only a struggle for personal spiritual reformation but also a struggle against the degradation of the Islamic faith and those causing it, either Muslims or foreigners…Today’s nomads use sophisticated weapons, and in Nigeria, there has been a resurgence of violent conflict and Islamic jihad perpetrated by Muslim nomads belonging to the Hausa-Fulani group. Some have settled in the Middle Belt region, particularly Southern Kaduna, and some are migratory from across the Sahel.

Buhari was initially the military dictator of Nigeria during the 1980s, leading a regime known for its strict discipline and frequent human rights abuses. He rose to power once again during the 2015 presidential election in which he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan on a platform of anti-corruption and a vow to crush the Boko Haram insurgency.

Although Buhari’s opposition to Boko Haram seems to be at least partially genuine, he has also consistently supported the imposition of Sharia law in the country’s north and has had to continually shrug off rumors that he is a crypto-Islamist. These persistent suspicions have long earned him the distrust of much of Nigeria’s Christian population.

The Imposition Of Sharia Law

Although usually associated with brutal regimes in the Middle East like Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, or the Islamic State, sharia has seen a resurgence in Nigeria’s Muslim-dominated northern provinces since 1999 and has been expanded to include both civil and criminal cases. Although in theory only applicable to Muslims, sharia’s legitimization by the government has emboldened Islamist forces in north Nigeria, some of whom have established roving gangs who seek to impose sharia codes on Muslims and non-Muslims alike.

This has created a climate of terror and fear among Nigeria’s Christians. The country’s Christian population have the dual agony of finding themselves facing the guns and machetes of anti-Christian vigilantes and criminals, but also of having their pleas for help and protection dismissed by a Muslim president who publicly calls their plight a local “ethnic conflict.”

Bloomberg reports that conditions have grown so bad that the United Nations issued a statement about a recent spate of violence that left more than 90 people dead in a matter of days. If it is allowed to continue, such violence may even endanger local food supplies and potentially lead to the risk of famine, as farmers may simply be too afraid to harvest their crops.

Just this week a U.K. aid group, the Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust (HART), released a report into the crisis affecting Christians following an in-country investigation. HART reports:

As recently as 1 October, four people including a soldier were killed by Fulani herders in Nkiendoro village, Plateau State. As with other similar attacks, the village was remote and vulnerable. Herders used sophisticated weaponry, forcing families to flee their homes and farmland. Two churches were burned, 17 water pumps were demolished, and 47 farms were cut and destroyed.” HART concludes its report by stating even though the “causes of violence are complex, the asymmetry and escalation of attacks by well-armed Fulani upon predominately Christian communities is stark and must be acknowledged.

In spite of the ongoing campaign of Islamist violence and terror against Nigeria’s Christians––and in spite of Buhari’s soft-pedaling and enabling of it all––the Trump administration has decided to go through with a $500 million sale of a dozen Super Tucano light attack aircraft to the Nigerian government, ostensibly to fight Boko Haram.

Buhari’s government has, for years, sought to obtain the aircraft, but the sale was blocked by the Obama administration due to concerns about atrocities carried out by Nigerian government troops, which included : “committing extrajudicial killings, torture, rape, arbitrary detention, and widespread violence.” In addition, Nigeria’s air force has carried out reckless airstrikes in the past, including one which managed to kill over 100 innocent civilians.

Although it is propeller-driven and, at first glance, seems to more resemble a vintage World War II fighter plane than most of today’s modern military fighter jets, the Super Tucano’s potential lethality, including against civilians, should not be underestimated . Designed as an effective, low-cost alternative to the expensive operating costs of modern, high-tech jet aircraft, it has carved out a niche as a go-to counter-insurgency aircraft in the global arms market. In Afghanistan, the Super Tucano is now being employed by the Afghan air force to attack insurgents with rockets, bombs, cannons and now even laser guided bombs.

Is Wall Street Financing Christian Terror?

There is growing alarm over state-sponsored involvement in the killing of Christians. Report after report suggests some level of involvement by the Nigerian military. In September , armed Fulani herdsmen accompanied by Nigerian soldiers slaughtered 17 Christians, including four children. The attack took place near the Rukuba Barracks, an army cantonment.

In 2015 , soldiers killed six Christians, who had mounted a temporary roadblock during a church service. In a more serious attack, 35 people were killed by the Nigerian military’s air raids on villages in January. Witnesses described the jets bombing houses, as well as specifically targeting civilians trying to escape the carnage.

In a statement by Amnesty International , the human rights group says by failing to act, Nigerian authorities are encouraging impunity that is only causing the violence to escalate. For example, the Buhari administration refused to intervene on behalf of five Christians sentenced to death by a court in Adamawa for killing a herdsman.

While violence in any form is deplorable, the current Nigerian government is willing to look the other way while Christians are murdered, yet won’t intervene to protect Christians. This conflict is growing, claiming 1,800 lives this year alone. Armed Fulani groups have now surpassed Boko Haram jihadists as the deadliest threat to civilians.

These developments pose troubling questions for Wall Street financial institutions as the Nigerian government seeks more than $2.86 billion in Eurobonds to fund government operations. Leading Wall Street banks like Citibank and Standard Chartered are the lead underwriters for the bond offering. Last week, the Nigerian government went on a roadshow in London selling this bond. Unfortunately, not on the agenda of these banks was a full account of the slaughter of thousands of Nigerian Christians.

Perhaps this is about to change. Just before Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of African Affairs Tibor Nagy arrived in Nigeria recently for an official visit, Rep. Mark Meadows (an ally of President Trump) wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with concerns about “reports of ongoing persecution of Christians in the Middle Belt region of Nigeria.”

Buhari’s government has shown consistent contempt and disregard toward its Christian population, despite the appalling violence committed against them. It has enabled the rise of elements, including radical Islamists, who strike at the heart of the core values of U.S. foreign and domestic policymaking. It now seeks weapons from the United States, with Trump’s blessing, and financing from Wall Street to carry on its morally bankrupt campaign against Christians. The situation in Nigeria deserves far more scrutiny than it currently receives.

Jihadist Beheader In Oklahoma Cleared For Execution,"This fall, the U.S. Supreme Court essentially cemented the execution of America’s least known Islamic terrorist. Jihadist convert Alton Nolen is now set to be put to death in Oklahoma, likely by nitrogen gas inhalation.

The Supreme Court’s October 1, 2018 rejection of Nolen’s final death penalty appeal went unremarked upon by news media so, partly as a result, I missed it. But the Nolen case is very much worth remembering, along with all terror attacks that occur on U.S. soil, if not just for the victims and their survivors but for lessons that can and must be learned.

The September 24, 2014 attack in Oklahoma is somewhat notable in the annals of many officially uncalled terrorist strikes in that Nolen emulated a favorite ISIS death tactic no doubt learned online: he fully beheaded a co-worker—the beloved wife, mother, and grandmother Colleen Hufford—inside the Moore, Oklahoma food processing plant where they both worked. Shouting “Alluah Akbar” throughout the attack, Nolen used the same oversized butcher knife on the neck of a second co-worker, Tracy Johnson, when the company’s chief operations officer, a reserve law enforcement officer named Mark Vaughn, burst in with an AR-15 rifle. He shot and wounded Nolen as Nolen disengaged from his second victim and charged at him with the bloody knife.

Such an attack must generate a particular horror in its witnesses and, when Nolen is finally put to death, one should keep in mind what Hufford must have experienced in her last moments.

The Benefits of Calling Terror Attacks ‘Terror Attacks’

Rather than to call this an Islamic terror attack and charge it federally as such, President Obama’s U.S. Department of Justice let the local district attorney charge Nolen under state murder statues (and as an assault and battery against survivor Traci Johnson). The whole disgusting affair was quickly forgotten by the rest of the nation, government, and all but those involved and some locals. But make no mistake: This was a jihadist terror attack on American soil.

This attack and its repercussions warrants our full national attention and should be properly memorialized until all related matters are finally resolved, not least for any comfort this can still bring the victim, survivors, and witnesses. Terrorism acknowledgement and media treatment can encourage the nation to comfort those who were there and help them close the emotionally important loop of knowing why loved ones and innocents died, who did it, and for what cause.

Calling terrorism out for what it is portends practical benefits too. Federal acknowledgement of Islamic terrorism opens the throttle on investigations that can identify co-conspirators and foreign connections. Public acknowledgement and remembrance can spur suspicious activity reporting from the general public, which can roll up other cocked and loaded extremists before they also kill.

Also importantly, federalizing the identification of terrorism cases helps homeland security authorities look inward to determine if intelligence failures occurred. Homeland security professionals learn from those what not to repeat and how to fix broken processes, to reduce the chances of future law enforcement intelligence failures.

The Obama administration decided not to call this a terror attack or count it as one soon afterward, even though Nolen, a prison convert to Islam, had filled his Facebook page with hideous ISIS propaganda and openly praised the death cult’s rise to global prominence through constant blood-letting. Nolen had just been suspended after co-workers rejected his Islamist proselytizing and demands for religious accommodations at Vaughan Foods. This gave those already predisposed to downplay Islamic terror attacks the excuse needed to suggest workplace violence and mental illness was somehow at play, instead of the prima facie terror attack it was.

Proof of Terrorism Overflowed at Trial

The 2017 trial, which received only some highly localized Oklahoma TV news coverage, decisively showed this was neither mental illness nor workplace violence. Taped police interviews of Nolen and other evidence showed Nolen was motivated by Qur’anic scripture and the very same well-worn extremist ideology we have seen cited for attacks across the globe, to include the 9/11 attacks. Nolen has proven unrepentant.

On September 29, after hearing the evidence a jury rejected defense arguments that Nolen was insane. Right after the attack, for instance, police asked a very calm and collected Nolen if anyone had told him to behead unbelievers. He responded that the Qur’an gave him the idea. (Qur’an 47:4 states that “When you meet the unbelievers, strike their necks.) Nolen answered: “Uh, no. I read the Qur’an. Like I say, the Qur’an is easy to understand. No one guides me but Allah.”

When asked why he beheaded Hufford, he answered: “I just feel like…I did what I needed to do. What Allah says in the Qur’an to do. Oppressors don’t need to be here. You know the Muslim is somebody who submits their will to Allah…Whatever he wants done, that’s what we do…And you know he wants us to get the oppressors out of this place.”

When asked if he regretted murdering Hufford, Nolen answered: “There wasn’t nothing but a trial for me. I passed it because, like I said, I felt oppressed. I knew for sure that, if I was to die right then, I was going to heaven.” He added: “I feel, you know, you know what I’m saying, if I was to die in five or 10 minutes, I’m going to heaven. That’s all that matters to me.”

Nolen also confirmed that he had screamed “Allahu akbar” as he beheaded Hufford.

Johnson testified that she ran into the next room after hearing screaming and saw Nolan standing over Hufford with a bloody knife. “When I saw the defendant, I was frozen. I couldn’t move. And I saw the knife with the blood on the knife, and he made a mad dash toward me and pushed me up against the wall and held me up with his forearm against the wall and just started splicing my neck. He was just going back and forth like he was just cutting a piece of meat.”

The hero of this tragedy is Vaughan, then COO of Vaughan Foods and an Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office reserve deputy. When the call came that a knife attack was underway, Vaughan suited up with his weapon, ammo, and first aid on a vest. Vaughan testified that he and another employee entered the building where the attack was underway and saw Nolen on top of Johnson. He testified that he called for Nolen to stop. Nolen jumped up, ran around a corner and charged Vaughan at full speed. Vaughan said he fired three rounds.

Nolen leaned against a wall and fell to the ground. Vaughan then held Nolen at bay until police arrived and took the suspect away.

Deserves National Acknowledgement and Coverage

Although Nolen’s execution warrants national notice, no solid date was readily available. Oklahoma has been caught up in political wrangling with death penalty opponents and thus shut down the state’s supply of lethal injection drugs. Most of the state’s executions are awaiting a resolution over state plans to start using nitrogen gas. Earlier this year, the state announced it was working to develop a new execution protocol making nitrogen hypoxia the preferred method.

When this is all sorted out, politically and legally, Nolen’s turn will come and bring the state’s only possible final resolution to this terrorism episode so we can all properly move on. When that resolution is at hand, I hope somehow the world finds out about it.

Why Does Lin-Manuel Miranda Enthusiastically Support A Terrorist?,"If a celebrity celebrated the release of an abortion clinic bomber from prison, gave the abortion clinic bomber a present, then personally hung out with the abortion clinic bomber, we wouldn’t chalk it up to naïveté; we would conclude that the celebrity liked the idea of bombing abortion clinics.

Lin-Manuel Miranda––yes, that Lin-Manuel Miranda, the “Hamilton” guy, co-star of Disney’s upcoming “Mary Poppins Returns,” recipient of a MacArthur genius grant, awardee of a shiny new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame––did all of those things as an avid supporter of the Puerto Rican nationalist terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera, ringleader of the 1970s terrorist group FALN (Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña / Armed Forces of Puerto Rican National Liberation), which murdered at least five and probably six innocent New Yorkers.

If you’ve never heard of Oscar Lopez Rivera or FALN, you can read all about them in Bryan Burrough’s excellent history of the 1970s leftist underground, “Days of Rage.” Lopez Rivera’s FALN tried to murder cops. They murdered four innocent people eating lunch. They murdered a man in his office. They committed strings of bombings in multiple cities.

They managed to support much of this, by the way, because one of their members was the director of a Hispanic-oriented religious outreach organization, and appointed multiple FALN members to her organization’s board, effectively funding FALN by parasitizing the Episcopal Church. Even after this connection was exposed (to much protest from, among others, the leftist National Council of Churches), FALN kept rolling by means of armored car robbery. In 1980, they raided the NYC campaign headquarters of George H.W. Bush and the Chicago headquarters of the Carter-Mondale campaigns, and even threatened convention delegates.

Most of FALN was rounded up on April 3, 1980, during an attempt to rob another armored car, but robbery mastermind Lopez Rivera wasn’t with them at the time. By a curious coincidence, though, another Puerto Rican terrorist group started up shortly after: Puerto Rican Armed Resistance, which bombed Penn Station in New York then set off a bomb at the JFK airport that killed a man.

That bomb used the FALN bomb design, a caller to the New York Post claimed the bombs were the work of FALN’s bombmaker Guillermo Morales, and once Lopez Rivera was busted in a random traffic stop after the JFK bombing, Puerto Rican Armed Resistance was never heard from again. Funny, that.

The FALN members were sentenced to lengthy prison terms for seditious conspiracy. Lopez Rivera himself was “sentenced to 55 years in prison on a variety of charges, including seditious conspiracy, attempted armed robbery, explosives possession, car theft and weapons violations.”

Then, at the end of his presidency, with an eye to New York’s large bloc of Puerto Rican voters and Hillary Clinton’s upcoming senatorial campaign, Bill Clinton offered clemency to FALN members, on the condition they renounced violence. Lopez Rivera refused this condition, so remained behind bars. The Chicago Tribune’s Charles Lane noted his motivation in doing so was solidarity with the plotters behind an FBI-foiled attempt to break him out of prison. (Yeah: the FBI foiled a plot to break him out of prison.)

But everything comes round again, and in the last days of his presidency President Obama gave clemency to Lopez Rivera, no strings attached. This was Miranda’s immediate reaction:

https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/821470034472136708

In an era of social media causing career problems for people––an era in which Disney fired Roseanne Barr from her own show and cut ties with video game streamer Pewdiepie––Miranda celebrated on Twitter, with the honorific “Don Oscar,” no less, the release of an actual terrorist who was the ringleader of a group that committed actual terrorist acts including bombings and multiple murder. Not only did Miranda suffer zero career blowback, but he’s getting ready to open wide for Disney as the costar of “Mary Poppins Returns” and preparing to make his feature film directorial debut with a movie that is literally called “Tick, Tick…Boom.”

It’s Not Just Tweeting, It’s Friendship

Nor is Miranda’s support limited to tweeting; Miranda gave Lopez Rivera a free ticket to see “Hamilton” and personally took him to the show. It turns out that there’s actually an answer to the question “Who do you have to kill to get a ticket to ‘Hamilton?’” and the answer is “Harold Sherburne, Frank Connor, James Gezork, Alejandro Berger, and Charles Steinberg.”

One grotesque irony of this is the location of FALN’s most infamous bombing. Sherburne, Connor, Gezork, and Berger were murdered by FALN while they were eating lunch in the Fraunces Tavern. That is the place George Washington gave his farewell to his officers in 1783. Col. Benjamin Tallmadge described that scene in his memoirs, although he doesn’t note whether Miranda’s subject Alexander Hamilton was present:

We had been assembled but a few moments, when His Excellency entered the room. His emotion, too strong to be concealed, seemed to be reciprocated by every officer present. After partaking of a slight refreshment, in almost breathless silence, the General filled his glass with wine, and turning to the officers, he said: ‘With a heart full of love and gratitude, I now take leave of you. I most devoutly wish that your latter days may be as prosperous and happy as your former ones have been glorious and honorable.’ After the officers had taken a glass of wine, Gen. Washington said: ‘I cannot come to each of you, but shall feel obliged if each of you will come and take me by the hand.’ Gen. Knox being nearest to him, turned to the Commander-in-Chief, who, suffused in tears, was incapable of utterance, but grasped his hand; when they embraced each other in silence. In the same affectionate manner, every officer in the room marched up to, kissed, and parted with his General-in-Chief. Such a scene of sorrow and weeping I had never before witnessed, and hope I may never be called upon to witness again. It was indeed too affecting to be of long continuance for tears of deep sensibility filled every eye and the heart seemed so full, that it was ready to burst from its wonted abode.

In “Days of Rage,” Burrough describes the scene a little less than 192 years later:

The duffel [bag], which carried a bomb consisting of roughly ten sticks of dynamite and a propane tank, detonated at 1:22 p.m. The immense explosion collapsed the staircase and blew a hole in the floor seven feet wide. Windows and plate-glass doors shattered in buildings up and down Broad Street; a truck parked outside was wrecked, tossed on its side. The thin wall to the Bissell dining room evaporated. Sitting behind it, Frank Connor and Alex Berger were killed instantly; Jim Gezork would die on the operating table. All around, bodies were thrown into the air, people somersaulting through a blizzard of deadly flying glass. Knives and forks zinged through the restaurant like angry bees, impaling a number of diners; doctors would later remove cutlery from a dozen or more patients. More than forty people were badly injured in the Bissell dining room alone. The force of the explosion erupted upward as well, sending a single floor nail firing through the ceiling like a bullet, where it tore through the bottom of a chair and ripped into the body of a sixty-six-year-old banker named Harold Sherburne, killing him.

Lin-Manuel Miranda had more than 1 million followers on Twitter at the time of his tweets regarding Lopez Rivera’s clemency. He has more than 2.5 million followers on Twitter now. Miranda’s tweets in support of Lopez Rivera have not been deleted; they are still up.

Yet the national response to Miranda’s support for a ringleader of terrorism and multiple murder has been silence. Silence when he tweeted it, silence when he did comic bits at the Oscars, and when he performed on the Oscars’ stage. Except for The Chicago Tribune, which admirably followed up on Miranda’s comments to learn that he followed through, there was silence when he personally escorted a terrorist out to a lovely evening at the theater.

This is remarkable, isn’t it? “Hamilton” is really good, but it’s not “Yay! dead people!” good.

If Miranda Were on the Right, the Media Would Never Rest

Well, there’s no time like the present. Disney’s “Mary Poppins Returns,” co-starring Miranda, is opening December 19. Here are some simple questions any enterprising journalist might take the opportunity to ask Miranda or his sponsors at Disney:

Do you support an independent Puerto Rico?

Would you support violence to obtain an independent Puerto Rico?

If Oscar Lopez Rivera re-formed FALN and they bombed something tomorrow, would you still support him?

What’s the difference between bombing something tomorrow and bombing something in the 1970s?

Are you concerned that you’re breaking ground for people who admire abortion clinic bombers?

Do you have anything to say to the families of Harold Sherburne, Frank Connor, James Gezork, Alejandro Berger, Charles Steinberg, and Alex McMillan?

Does Disney have any comment on your support for Oscar Lopez Rivera?

What kinds of terrorists can somebody support and still work for Disney?

Can anybody who murders innocent people get a free ticket to “Hamilton”?

We’re in a radical age. Domestic terrorism is a real concern and a deservedly serious topic of conversation. Also, one of the preeminent popular artists of our time is an avid supporter of an actual terrorist, and nobody is talking about it. Not only has he received zero blowback, he hasn’t even had to address it.

But Miranda is friendly with Lopez Rivera because FALN’s bombing campaigns murdered people. Not “even though,” because. Otherwise, Miranda would never have heard of Lopez Rivera. And none of his enablers in the press—or, God forbid, his sponsors, most notably Disney—have called him on it. Because, you know. “Hamilton.”

Middle Easterners Illegally Enter The United States Thru Ctrl. America,"In December 2018, the Center for Immigration Studies dispatched Senior National Security Fellow Todd Bensman to Panama and Costa Rica to investigate President Donald Trump’s widely ridiculed assertions that suspected terrorists had been apprehended among Middle East migrants through Latin America. Panama is a geographic chokepoint, or bottleneck, through which migrants from countries of the Middle East, who are moving out of South America, must push on their way to the U.S. border.

The following article is based on Bensman’s on-the-ground research over two weeks. His video reports, photos, and writings from the trip can be found here.

Golfito, Costa Rica — It was here in March 2017, at the main aluminum structure of a government migrant camp, that federal Costa Rican police arrested Ibrahim Qoordheen of Somalia as a suspected al Shabaab terrorist operative on his way to the U.S. southern border.

Qoordheen had been smuggled from Zambia to Brazil, passed through Panama, and was making his way north through Costa Rica when the Americans had him arrested here, 20 miles inside Costa Rica, according to an American intelligence official with knowledge of the case who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Golfito camp, with a capacity of 250, was set up as a two-day rest station for South America-exiting migrants whom the governments of Panama and Costa Rica register and help move through northward to Nicaragua.

Luckily, the Somali stayed long enough for an American intelligence analyst working with the name he had provided in Panama to unscramble it and match it to a pre-existing intelligence file that identified him as intertwined with an al Shabaab cell and smuggling network in Zambia, the U.S. intelligence official said.

The Americans interviewed Qoordheen at length, but the Somali gave up nothing, the U.S. officer said. The Americans then arranged to have him deported to Zambia, the officer said. It turns out the Qoordheen case was only one of other such episodes about which the American public was never told, where terrorist suspects were discovered migrating through Latin America to the U.S. border.

Terrrorists Know the U.S. Border Is Not Secure

A Costa Rican immigration service official whose jurisdiction includes the Golfito camp disclosed that at least several other U.S.-bound suspected terrorists also were pulled from this camp since Qoordheen’s March 2017 arrest, likewise based on significant derogatory U.S. counterterrorism intelligence. The Costa Rican official declined to provide specifics of the intelligence beyond that it involved terrorism, offering only that: “Most are good, but some are bad.”

The American public was never told that Qoordheen and other suspected terrorists were pulled off U.S.-bound migrant routes in distant Costa Rica and Panama because such information is usually classified or not disclosable, in line with standard practice to protect ongoing investigations and operations.

That necessary opacity, unfortunately, seems to have given life to denialism about President Trump’s claims that terrorists are among migrants from countries of terror concern, like the Middle East. The skeptics have demanded proof then cited Trump perfidy when protected intelligence wasn’t provided. Trump’s assertions were thus ridiculed and dismissed as unsupported fear-mongering.

But the rejectionists, many of whom obviously do not know that a central homeland security practice is threat preemption, are wrong. Down here, on the southern-most leg of migrant routes to the American border, it is they who invite ridicule and eye rolls.

American, Panamanian, and Costa Rican law enforcement and intelligence officials are engaged in actual programs here to hunt, investigate, and deport real terrorist suspects who are, in fact, discovered among the thousands of migrants from the Middle East, Horn of Africa, and South Asia funneling through this section of Latin America—as President Trump said and as I saw and heard on the ground.

They are working at it here because sheer geography pushes tens of thousands of U.S.-bound migrants from all over the world who pass from South America landing zones through these two countries as they push north. Panama and Costa Rica are chokepoints on the migrant trail where “extra-continental” travelers, as they are sometimes called at the American embassies, can become known in the greatest concentrations.

Terror Migrants Pulled From U.S. Border Routes

Some acknowledgements of terror travel through these countries—and of the American efforts to mitigate it—are in public evidence, even if the underlying reporting remains confidential.

A December 19 Immigration and Customs Enforcement statement, for instance, announced the deportation of U.S.-convicted Brazil-based smuggler Sharafat Ali Khan after time served for transporting at least 100 aliens from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh through South and Central America to the United States. The statement offered this nugget, with the usual lack of elaboration: “Several of the individuals smuggled by Khan’s organization had suspected ties to terrorist organizations.”

The new statement seems to comport with earlier reporting by The Washington Times that one of these individuals was an Afghan involved in a plot to attack in the United States or Canada and had family ties to members of the Taliban.

Also in December 2018, an INTERPOL statement announcing the arrests of 49 human smugglers in the multi-nation “Operation Andes,” networks that funneled migrants from places like the Middle East into Panama and out of Costa Rica en route to the U.S. border, said four arrestees were linked to fraud, homicide, “and terrorism.”

Clearly, even if we can’t know all the details, something has been happening in this part of the world involving migrants who show up in terrorism intelligence reporting databases.

Dozens of migrants suspected of terrorism involvements are also reaching the U.S. border. As reported for CIS in a paper titled “Have Terrorists Crossed?” intelligence community sources said more than 100 migrants caught at the American southern border, or caught en route, were on U.S. terror watch lists between 2012 and 2017. More than half were first noticed at the American border; many of the rest were caught en route, like Qoordheen.

Fifteen terrorists are listed and described in the CIS report, including a Somali migrant who passed unnoticed through Panama in 2011, crossed the Mexico-California border, and went on to commit two 2017 vehicle ramming attacks in Alberta, Canada while carrying an ISIS flag.

Governments Assist in Human Smuggling

The terrorist travel threat associated with migration through this area (from the Middle East, Horn of Africa, and South Asia) is regarded as a primary American law enforcement and intelligence preoccupation in Panama, intelligence officials say. The U.S. effort is purposefully centered on the migration through Panama and Costa Rica because homeland security professionals, some of whom agreed to talk anonymously, regard the migration danger as real, present, and most visible here.

One reason migration from countries of terror concern is visible here is that Panama and Costa Rica follow a catch, rest, and release policy, virtually unknown to the American public, locally called “Controlled Flow.” The 2016 policy has Panama’s military collecting special interest migrants hiking in from Colombia’s wilderness borderlands. These migrants number about 700 per week these days, according to one Panamanian military official.

The military’s Central Battallion’s Oriental Brigade based in Yaviza, the last town on Panama’s Highway 1, places them in camps where they are fed and medically treated. The military then provides them with temporary legal status and commercially buses them north to the Costa Ricans, who likewise provide the means and resources for the migrants to pass north again on through to Nicaragua, where smugglers often take things in hand again. (See video report about Controlled Flow here).

“There is a thing the world does not see, and it is the work we do,” said a ranking Panamanian military commander who spoke on condition of anonymity. “No other country, or, I believe, any country in all of Latin America, does what Panama does. And that is to receive [foreign citizens], to aid them, give them medication and to organize them” for transport to Costa Rica. Asked if terrorists may be placed on this human conveyer belt, the officer offered, with a knowing chuckle, “Maybe!”

The Panamanian central government declined repeated interview requests and decided not to reply to a list of CIS questions about its this policy, saying only that “We can assure you that Panama and the U.S. are strong partners in ensuring we have secure migration flows and inpromoting regional security.”

Several Panamanian national Assembly members explained how the policy works in the interests of both Panama and most of the migrants. For Panama, they said, the policy removes the cost burdens of interdicting, detaining, processessing legal asylum claims, and deportation. It also protects migrants from smugglers while exploiting what most want: to reach America.

“Panama is like a bridge or a passway to another country,” said Juan Carlos Arrango, of the ruling coalition Panamanian Popular Party. “Wherever they come from, by boat, plane, or walking through the Darien jungle, they’re very vocal in saying, ‘We don’t want to stay in Panama. We want to pass through, to the north.” So, Arrango said, the government is happy to see to that.

Middle East Migrants and Terrorist Suspects in Panama

American law enforcement has taken some advantage of controlled flow to filter the migrants for terrorism history or connections, even though unknown numbers of migrants choose illicit smuggling through the region instead. American officials declined requests to discuss these efforts on the record. Others, however, did speak anonymously.

Panama and Costa Rica follow a catch, rest, and release policy.

“This is national security,” the American officer said of the programs filtering terrorists from the migrant flows through in Panama. “We’ve extended our border.”

The publicly available annual U.S. State Department Country Reports on Terrorism, released most recently in September 2018, provided one confirming peek at the American counterterrorism partnership with Panama. It said one program objective there now was “to detain and repatriate individuals for whom there were elevated suspicions of links to terrorism.” This is significant because it means America has intercepted terror suspects flown to their home countries from Panama, as was done with Qoordheen, rather than to gamble with a U.S. border entry and an attack on the homeland.

An illustrative August 2016 case involved six Pakistanis who entered Panama from Colombia on their way to the American border and were pulled off the route then deported home. The deportations of the six were publicly reported but not the reasons why, so it attracted almost no notice. But Juan Carlos Vargas, political editor for La Prensa newspaper in Panama City, said his paper was told the Pakistanis were arrested on suspicions that they were associated with al Qaeda and after they were seen taking photos of sensitive sites around the city, including the Panama Canal.

“The government closed out all information about that news,” the journalist said, adding that this wasn’t the only such case. “Other (terrorism suspect) cases were shut down too. So officially, we have no news to report.”

Terror List Hits Trigger ‘Deep Dive’ Investigations

The American intelligence officer quoted earlier in this report also described processes that launch in Panama when migrants hit on terror watch list databases or otherwise come to U.S. attention. Such hits are fairly common, and when they occur, trigger in-country “deep dive,” investigations and analyses that might involve foreign intelligence services and agencies, as well as interviews with the suspected migrants, the U.S. official said.

Of course, there’s no publicly reportable metric for something that doesn’t go boom.

Some of these investigations clear things up pretty quickly with no terrorism finding, or maybe just a distant association to someone that wouldn’t warrant deportation. But enough other cases surface that warrant hard effort, vigilance, and deportations from Panama that reduce terror attack risks the American public would never know about.

For example, the deep dive process had to be applied to one Pakistani pulled off the route in Panama when he was found to have a long history with a terrorist organization, the American security official said. The Pakistani remained in Panamanian custody, at the behest of the Americans, for about a full year during the investigation. The investigation turned up no specific terrorism plot, but because of his confirmed history as a terrorist, the Pakistani was deported by plane anyway to reduce risk, the officer said.

The Costa Rica immigration official also cited earlier in this report explained that American counterterrorism officers in the region pay close attention to the migrant traffic coming through the camp in Golfito and maintain “close contact” about the Costa Rica services.

The Americans, the Costa Rican official said, are mainly interested in interviews of migrants from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Pakistan, and countries like those, because of the elevated chance those migrants are terrorists. The Americans sometimes call the Golfito migrant camp and have immigration officers interview such migrants—in an interview room I saw—and ask that the intelligence reports be forwarded to the U.S. embassy where the Americans work. That’s how other suspected terrorists were caught here, the Costa Rican official said.

“It’s important if they suspect there is a person traveling to the U.S. for terrorism, they need to know where they are staying and to know who they are,” the Costa Rican official said.

One way migrants with terrorism intelligence records are getting noticed is through another major American-backed counterterrorism program here known by the shorthand “BitMap.” Americans supplied equipment and trained the Panamanians and Costa Ricans to collect retinal eye scans, fingerprints and facial photography of migrants moving through the countries, the State Department country reports on terrorism document said. I watched as U.S.-trained Costa Rican immigration officials collected biometrics on Iranians, Pakistanis, Eritreans, and Iraqis. This allows homeland security to run the information against international terrorism databases where perhaps the migrant’s biometrics had been enterered somewhere else previously.

None of this, of course, is communicated to the American public, for reasons of operational security that enable skeptics to mock the dearth of “evidence.” And, of course, there’s no publicly reportable metric for something that doesn’t go boom.

Foreigners Pour Through the Darien Gap

Let no one ever again say that migrants from countries of terror concern, to include the Middle East, aren’t moving in significant numbers through Latin America to the U.S. border, or that the risk of terrorists or those predisposed toward terrorism would mix with this traffic. American homeland security certainly believes so, due in no small part to the discovery of terrorist suspects in this flow.

In both Panama and Costa Rica, I observed hundreds of mostly young male migrants from countries of terrorism concern, of often unverifiable identity and backgrounds, traveling toward the U.S. border. I photographed and spoke to them. Some told me they were from Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Eritrea. I interviewed an Iranian, an Iraqi, a Pakistani, and a Bangladeshi. Some of their interviews are posted here for all to see.

At issue is that American authorities don’t know who many of them are and can’t verify their stories. All of those I interviewed said they had no identification with them. At the main bus station in Panama, one day, I met two travelers who initially identified themselves to me as Indonesian, a nation riven with violent Islamist groups, then rushed away from me when I identified myself as an American. Thousands like them are on the move through here, heading for the southern border every year, where they will show up as complete strangers.

Did Panama Ever Reopen Its Investigation Into The Flight 901 Bombing?,"PANAMA CITY, Panama—Several alert, uniformed sentries stood behind defensive barriers in front of the Ahavat Sion synagogue in a tony neighborhood of extreme high-rise hotels and residential buildings, ubiquitous in this prosperous Central American city. The sentries required identification and a stated purpose for the visit, studied my face, and disappeared inside after warning that no exterior photos were allowed for security reasons.

I showed up seven months after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu provided intelligence information to Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela that he said solved a long-unattributed terror attack on this small country of 4 million that includes 15,000 Jews. The mid-air bombing took down Alas Chiricanas Flight 901 in 1994, killing all 22 commuters and crew aboard, including 12 Jews, and had remained unsolved and uninvestigated for nearly a quarter century.

During an official state visit in Israel with President Varela, the Israeli prime minister said it had been a Hezbollah suicide attack. Varela, who had lost a college roommate in the attack, promised a reopened investigation. If Argentina’s investigations of similar attacks on its Jewish community in the early 1990s was any indication, this one in Panama had the potential to lead straight to senior figures in the upper echelons of Iranian and Hezbollah leaderships.

During a reporting trip to Panama in December, I wanted to find out how this potentially consequential investigation was coming along. The synagogue seemed a logical starting place because inside were not only those in contact with the Varela administration about this but surviving relatives and memorials to the dead. I left Panama two weeks later, however, believing it was more likely than not that no such promised investigation of Iran and Hezbollah was actually happening.

A Sleeping Mystery Kicked Awake

There’s good reason Jews throughout Latin America worship behind layers of barricades and security. Few can forget the high-casualty Hezbollah attacks of 1992 and 1994 on Jewish facilities in distant Argentina. Iran and its mortally anti-Semitic Hezbollah proxy maintain clandestine forces throughout Latin America, including Bolivia, Venezuela, Peru, and Nicaragua.

Panama’s 15,000 Jews live mainly in Colon by the Caribbean coast and in Panama City, economically buoyed by industry associated with the Panama Canal. Flight 901 is a painful, lingering episode in the community’s history.

Notably, the bombing of Flight 901, shortly after takeoff from Colon to Panama City, happened one day after the bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AIMA) building in Buenos Aires, Argentina. That one left 85 Jews dead and hundreds injured and captured almost all shares of global media attention.

The main lead for Flight 901 was the mangled torso of a man the FBI later “possibly identified” as Ali Hawa Jamal and said was suspected of carrying a bomb aboard the plane. The FBI’s “Seeking Information” bulletin went unfilled for 24 years.

While no terrorist group claimed either the Flight 901 or the Argentine bombings, deep and thorough investigations of the Argentina bombings, tormented by political mayhem and the murder of the chief prosecutor, eventually produced book-length indictments in 2006 of a slew of senior Iranian government officials and of Hezbollah figures. In 2017, the former president of Argentina was indicted for a cover-up conspiracy with Iran. Tehran has always denied it all.

Netanyahu blew the dust from that status quo, welcomed or not, with a private November 2017 letter to President Varela outlining Israeli intelligence information, presumably about Ali Hawa Jamal. The letter was sent ahead of a planned state visit by Varela to Israel scheduled for the following May.

After that May 2018 visit, both leaders publicly revealed that Israel’s new information had all but solved the bombing. It was a Hezbollah terror attack just like the Argentina attacks, they both indicated at a joint press briefing in May 2018

“Thank you for that information, which I shared with the families,” the Panamanian president told Netanyahu. “And I will keep following that case, to make sure that justice is done.”

Later in Panama, Varela told local reporters he would ask local and international authorities to reopen the investigation “given intelligence reports that clearly show it was a terrorist attack.” Then, in the seven ensuing months, nothing.

Knocking at Doors that Never Opened in Panama

Prior to my trip, through various interlocutors, I tried to set up interviews with Jewish community leaders to see how the investigation was meeting with community expectations and sentiment about it.

I’d had no response, which is how I ended up with the security guards out front, asking for a sit-down interview with community leaders, a rabbi, perhaps the survivors of victims killed in the attack. Eventually, I was asked to submit a list of written questions, which I know from long experience is usually the death knell for a request.

I submitted some questions anyway, looking for any sign of an investigation. They never followed through and allowed the remaining time they knew I had in-country to elapse while deflecting follow-ups.

One Orthodox Jewish family kindly took me in to their high-rise apartment and treated me to a lovely Chanukah night meal and candle lighting (it was night four). But the family was not interested in being quoted about the investigation without community endorsement. The family did lobby on my behalf, but to no avail.

It soon became abundantly clear: No one in the community wanted to talk about the investigation. From others, however, I was able to glean some informed speculation about where the investigation was and what it meant to the community. But by now, my first spark of doubt had caught: maybe there was no investigation.

Doubts Deepen About Investigation Progress

I went to the country’s biggest mainstream newspaper, La Prensa, and met with Juan Carlos Vargas, political editor in Panama City. One question not quite answered by the Panamanian president’s promise to reopen the investigation: to what end? The bomber evidently died with his victims, so he certainly couldn’t be indicted, tried, or convicted.

Carlos said the idea was that investigative conclusions might lead to judicial proceedings against others. This sounded like Argentina. He confirmed that the government had provided no update on its investigation in the seven months since its reopening was announced. He said his newspaper had reported nothing else. I asked how that could possibly be and if he knew whether the investigation was even happening. He said the newspaper didn’t know.

“The Panamanian government opened the case but has released no new information,” Carlos told me. Had he heard anything through sources that he couldn’t publish but would indicate progress? No, he said.

I asked why he thought people from the Jewish community didn’t seem willing to meet with me to discuss the situation. One reason, he said, might be that Jewish community members “didn’t want to relive that. Most have little interest in knowing more. It brings a lot of painful memories.” “They don’t want to be victimized all over again.”

I wondered aloud that, if that was the sentiment, perhaps the Jewish community could have pressured the government into killing the investigation. The journalist told me the community was wealthy and highly influential but that, ultimately, the newspaper didn’t know what was happening.

The Panamanian Government Response

I worked at length with the Panamanian embassy in Washington D.C. for several months ahead of my trip to Panama, mostly for unrelated national security stories. I’d been asking my point of contact in Washington, who was working on my requests with senior security and government officials in Panama, for sit-down interviews with government officials. After a couple of months, though, I got the fatal request to submit a list of questions. I did anyway, including the Flight 901 issue.

I was told if the president didn’t want to actually push an Iran-Hezbollah investigation, all he had to do was wait it out and he’d be off the hook.

I received a catch-all response by email declining to discuss national security-related matters, which could be understandable, given that public disclosure could damage the proceedings. But the government response also did nothing to reassure my growing sense that maybe an investigation into Flight 901 wasn’t really happening.

“With regards to ongoing investigations,” my embassy contact wrote in an email, “our authorities have no comment. We understand this may not be the detailed response you expected, however it is all the information we can provide at this point.”

While in Panama, I interviewed three members of the Panamanian Assembly, which is akin to the U.S. Congress. One was Juan Carlos Arrango. His Panamanian Popular Party was a member of President Varelo’s ruling coalition. Like the La Prensa political editor, Arrango is in a unique position to catch information about the investigation. But he too professed to knowing absolutely nothing about the investigation beyond initial reports that there would be one.

Cesar Argueta, of the opposition party Democratic Revolutionary Party, similarly had heard nothing in government circles about the investigation. He could only offer that: “If the Israeli government is asking to reopen the case, in particular, I would have to say that is because they have information that Panama doesn’t have. Because they have information they have been able to collect, that allows them to find the culprits of that act.”

While at the assembly, a parliamentary insider I spoke to reminded me that President Varela was a lame-duck president. He is constitutionally unable to run again in a new national election scheduled for May of this year. I was told if the president didn’t want to actually push an Iran-Hezbollah investigation, all he had to do was wait it out and he’d be off the hook.

The Israeli Non-Response

The Israeli government is never known to miss an opportunity to criticize Hezbollah and discuss its nefarious networks in Latin America and anywhere else in the world. Except, evidently, in the case of Panama.

After returning from Panama doubting Flight 901 will be investigated, I reached out to the Israeli government through its public affairs section at the embassy in Washington. For sure, I thought, the Israelis would be able to confirm the promised investigation actually went forward.

After submitting a detailed email about what I wanted, I was assigned to spokesman Elad Strohmayer. In return emails before and during the holidays, he seemed amenable to setting up interviews to impart information about Flight 901 and Hezbollah in Latin America contemporarily and more generally.

But nothing ever came of it after repeated voice messages and email from me through to now. I gave up, left to presume there was something so clearly radioactive about this investigation and terror attack that no one would talk out loud about it—not even the normally loquacious Israelis who re-started it all.

An Unsettled Mystery Forever?

Either I simply had terrible reportorial luck over a period of three months, not finding the right people at the right time with questions about sensitive investigations. Or there simply is no investigation into Flight 901, and no one wants to admit it.

Experience, gut, and result have me leaning toward the latter. My running theory is that no one in Panama wants to repeat Argentina’s tumult over its investigations. Taking on Iranian ruling mullahs with indictments has proven painfully consequential in Argentina. Perhaps Netanyahu inadvertently put the Panamanians on the spot where they never really wanted to be.

The presence of Iran and Hezbollah in this region of the world did not end 25 years ago, particularly in Panama.

I stand ready for my theory to be proven wrong and to write about any new contrarian information. The presence of Iran and Hezbollah in this region of the world did not end 25 years ago, particularly in Panama. That matters in a national security, context because Panama is a major strategic American ally, with a stake in the canal’s uninterrupted operation.

From a current New York court case about which I have written extensively, we learn that Hezbollah sent a U.S.-based operative to Panama for months of intelligence collection as recently as 2012. In court papers, it emerged that Samer El Debek of Dearborn, Michigan was a Hezbollah 910 operative, the notorious clandestine terrorists who move around the world conducting assassinations and bombings like in Thailand. The court records say Hezbollah sent El Debek to Panama for at least a month in 2011 and again in 2012, where he collected target information on the Panama Canal, American embassy, Israeli consulate, and Jewish community.

El Debek transferred all of this intelligence to Hezbollah afterward. The group would still have all of it. Beyond any immediate threat to Panama targets, while in Israel last year President Varela voiced the most persuasive reason for a strong, decisive and conclusive investigation into Flight 901.

“I believe in public life we should always be on the right side, to make sure that nothing like this happens again, in my country or anywhere else in the world. Fighting terrorism shouldn’t have boundaries. Fighting terrorism should unite all human beings, to stop evil that all terrorism represents and to fight for the right to all human beings to live in this world in peace.”

Here’s to hoping he follows through before he leaves office.

Terror-Linked Muslim Group Pressures Amazon Into Yanking Products,"The online giant Amazon, which is one of the world’s largest retailers, recently capitulated to a demand by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) to remove products the terror-tied pressure group deems to be offensive to Muslims.

Earlier this month, CAIR called on their supporters to complain to Amazon about doormats and bath mats sold by third-party vendors on the Amazon website that were inscribed with Quranic verses of blessing and greeting. The group said it organized the effort because the Islamic references would be stepped on or otherwise disrespected.

Days later, CAIR announced that Amazon had agreed to remove the items. That week, CAIR claimed it had found other offensive items sold on the Amazon website, and asked for those too to be banned. Although they might seem a bit silly, CAIR’s bath mat complaints can be viewed as part of a current strategy to exert influence over tech giants and Silicon Valley powerhouses. While Amazon is chiefly known as an online retailer of almost any item imaginable, it is also one of the world’s largest tech companies.

The bathmat complaint came at exactly the same time CAIR is supporting efforts for Somali workers at an Amazon fulfillment center in Shakopee, Minnesota, to force the company for greater religious accommodations and other demands. According to The New York Times, Amazon recruited heavily from the Somali community and already designated spaces at the center for prayer and ritual washings dictated by the Quran. For one of its meetings with Somali workers, the company even brought in from Texas a Muslim manager “who works on accommodating Islamic practices.”

Working Hard Is Against Our Religion

Still, CAIR participated in a rally outside the Shakopee Amazon facility on Dec. 14. Rallying Somali workers claimed the pace of work demanded at the facility infringes on their freedom of religion. CAIR-Minnesota’s executive director Jaylani Hussein spoke at the rally, saying he had toured the facility and that Amazon’s accommodations for Muslim workers were insufficient.

CAIR was previously involved in targeting four Amazon warehouses in the Twin Cities area this past July when Amazon’s Prime Day coincided with Ramadan. The demands, to which Amazon management acquiesced, included slower work pace and an extra holiday for Muslim employees to celebrate the Eid festival ending Ramadan.

This is hardly the first time that Amazon—and for that matter, other tech giants and major companies—has been targeted by Islamist pressure groups, especially CAIR.

In May 2005, a Muslim woman purchased a used Quran from a small bookstore in Pennsylvania through Amazon’s website. She claimed that when the book arrived it had “Death to all Muslims” inscribed in black marker on the inside front cover. The woman, Azza Basarudin, was a longtime Islamist activist, but both Amazon and the used bookstore apologized.

In 1998, CAIR claimed that a pair of Nike shoes featured calligraphy that they said bore a semblance to the word “Allah” in Arabic script. CAIR called for a boycott of the company’s products, which prompted Nike to apologize and recall nearly 40,000 pairs of shoes. Nike also promised to build playgrounds at four Islamic centers. That incident occurred before CAIR’s extensive associations with overseas terrorist organizations were well known.

CAIR Has Well-Established Terrorist Ties

Since then, federal prosecutors and law enforcement agencies have publicly noted in court the group’s terror ties. In July 2008, the Justice Department filed a brief in the Holy Land Foundation trial, the largest terrorism financing case in American history, identifying CAIR as one of four organizations under the direction of the Palestine Committee established by the international Muslim Brotherhood to provide “media, money, and men” to the Hamas terrorist organization.

CAIR was identified as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation trial for its role as an active player in the U.S. Muslim Brotherhood’s Palestine Committee. During that trial, FBI Special Agent Lara Burns testified in federal court that CAIR was a front group for Hamas.

When CAIR and other Islamist groups attempted to have themselves removed from the case as unindicted co-conspirators, Jorge Solis, a federal judge, ruled that the Justice Department had provided “ample evidence” establishing CAIR’s association with Hamas and that the trial evidence created a “prima facie case” of CAIR’s role in conspiracy to support Hamas.

When CAIR attempted to intervene in another federal court case involving the appeal of a convicted terrorist, federal prosecutors reminded the court that “CAIR conspired with other affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood to support terrorists.” For those reasons, among others, the FBI formally cut ties with CAIR following the successful prosecution of the Holy Land Foundation executives.

More recently, the United Arab Emirates named CAIR a designated terrorist organization in November 2014. Given its extensive history of terrorist support, it might seem odd that many companies and others targeted by CAIR are quick to capitulate to their pressure campaigns.

Yet with many media outlets who regularly downplay or whitewash CAIR’s terrorist ties altogether, and the attempted rehabilitation of the group by the Obama administration, it is no surprise that, when faced with CAIR’s standard tactics of public accusations of bigotry and smears, companies are quick to fold.

Why The US Should Label This Muslim Brotherhood Leader A Terrorist,"Last December, Interpol quietly removed a “red notice”—a computerized flag notifying police across the world that an individual is wanted for arrest by an Interpol member state—from Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, a Qatari-based nonagenarian cleric wanted in Egypt in connection to violent protests following the ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood-dominated government of Mohammad Morsi.

Qaradawi has long been central to the ongoing conflict between Qatar and its Gulf and its Arab neighbors—Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain—who accuse the small peninsula state of harboring and funding Islamist terrorists and insurrectionists who seek to destabilize the region. The red notice dismissal is a win for Qaradawi’s patron, Qatar, which has refused to distance itself from the Muslim Brotherhood cleric despite this intense diplomatic and economic pressure. While Qatar updated terror designations last year in response to international criticism, it has stubbornly defended Qaradawi.

It is not immediately clear whether the decision to remove the “red notice” was taken at Qatar’s direct intercession. But it is clearly a reflection of how the smaller nation has skillfully wielded influence in a manner that outsizes its larger neighbors. This influence has allowed Qatar to defiantly ignore international criticism over its record of playing host and supporter to terrorists and extremists, especially Yusuf Qaradawi.

To understand why Qatar remains defiantly supportive of Qaradawi requires understanding the significant role he plays in Qatari affairs and in Qatar’s larger influence strategy.

Qaradawi is perhaps best known in the West for his vitriolic anti-Semitism on the Qatari state-run media outlet Al Jazeera and fatwas supporting the use of suicide bombings by the terrorist group Hamas. In 2008, the U.S. government designated the Qaradawi-led international charitable coalition known as “The Union of the Good” for its role in financing Hamas.

The Israeli Security Agency has described the Union of the Good as “the umbrella organization for Hamas and Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Islamic charity funds.” Union of Good members have been found to support other jihadist groups, including Al Qaeda affiliates.

Qaradawi has been fundamental to the rise of Qatar since he was granted citizenship there after fleeing the crackdown on the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in the 1960s. Qaradawi remains an influential spiritual leader and ideologue for the Islamist group. He has twice declined offers to become the Brotherhood’s supreme guide.

As U.S. Ambassador Chase Untermeyer wrote in a 2005 State Department cable, Qaradawi is “the only Islamic thinker in Qatar who matters,” and since his arrival in Qatar, he has wielded tremendous influence throughout Qatar’s religious, media, education, financial and charitable sectors, as a friend and confidante of the reigning al-Thani family.

Qaradawi helped establish the Qatari education system and has been deeply involved with the Qatar Foundation, a nominally independent nonprofit that serves as a vehicle for promoting Qatar’s influence. In particular, the Foundation’s Education City, which has agreements with many U.S. colleges and universities, also hosts the Foundation-run Al-Qaradawi Centre for Islamic Moderation and Renewal and the Qaradawi Scholarship for Islamic Studies. Using the legitimacy provided by U.S. colleges, the Qatar Foundation has promoted Islamist narratives to U.S. teachers.

Qaradawi has played a significant role in the Qatari banking system as an advisor to Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB), and the Qatar National Bank (QNB). All these Qatari banks have been blacklisted by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over their alleged role in facilitating terror finance.

Outside of Qatar, Qaradawi also exerts great influence. With Qatari support, Qaradawi established an international network for promoting the Brotherhood’s objectives, which he described in a 1996 meeting in Toledo, Ohio as the conquest of the West “through dawah” a term that translates as “proselytizing,” but is often used by the Muslim Brotherhood to refer to their brand of ideological indoctrination.

At the international level this is done through the International Union of Muslim Scholars (IUMS), best known for its 2004 fatwa authorizing the targeting of Americans in Iraq, including civilians. Qatar’s opponents have designated the IUMS as a terrorist organization as part of their effort to combat Qaradawi’s international apparatus.

In Europe, Qaradawi spreads his message through the European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) and the Federation of Islamic Organizations of Europe (FIOE), organizations led by Muslim Brotherhood operatives. Qaradawi has also been influential in the United States, serving as an inaugural trustee for the Islamic Society of Boston, a mosque with connections to more than a dozen terrorists convicted, deported, or killed by police, and founded by a convicted Al Qaeda financier.

Qaradawi provides Qatar access to an international network of committed Islamist activists throughout the West, who are willing to support Qatari policy goals. In turn, Qaradawi’s global reach is bolstered in large part due to Qatari state sponsorship. It is because of Qaradawi’s unsavory ties to Islamists across the globe, not in spite of them, that the Islamist cleric receives Qatar’s full-throated support, ignoring the protestations of their fellow Arab states, and U.S. and European criticism over Qaradawi’s violent rhetoric and terror finance ties.

Because of Qaradawi’s centrality to Qatar’s strategy of using Islamist networks to expand its influence, Qatar can be expected to continue to protect the Brotherhood cleric from international counterterrorism efforts, despite any negative repercussions. Western policymakers should come to understand that the Qatari regime won’t willingly change its stripes. The termination of the “red notice” reflects the mistake of relying on international institutions to police extremists like Qaradawi.

Fortunately, the United States has ready-made tools at hand for addressing this challenge. Most appropriately, the U.S. Treasury can add Qaradawi to the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list for his role in leading the already designated Union of the Good. Expanding designations to other Qaradawi-led organizations based on intelligence gathered about Qaradawi’s network in cooperation with the United States’s Arab allies would tighten the screws still further.

Given Qaradawi’s centrality within Qatar’s system of finance and influence, designating Qaradawi would place real pressure on the Qatari regime in a way that cannot easily ignored.

"Against The Evidence, Media Insists Terrorists Aren't Crossing The Border","Much of the noise accompanying President Trump’s partial justification for a wall concerns the veracity of a general threat: that Islamist terror travelers in the flow of “special interest aliens” (SIAs) might easier breach the southern border without one.

Critics in the media vehemently argue that the administration is trafficking in ridiculous, baseless fearmongering. After President Trump said Muslim prayer rugs were intercepted at the border, one Vox article said migration from Muslim-majority countries only happened at “vanishingly small rates.” Another, in The Washington Post, called southern border migration from Muslim countries a “conspiracy theory.”

But perhaps the most influentially misleading article on the subject came from The New York Times. On January 18, The Times published a “Fact Check” column by Linda Qiu titled “Trump’s Baseless Claim About Prayer Rugs Found at the Border.” It essentially concluded that migration from Muslim-majority countries is an unproven conspiracy theory and, even if it did happen, no one could consider it a security threat.

The column contained numerous errors and inaccurately cited two government reports to support the story’s weak contentions. This sort of recurring problem in the media must finally be called out.

Thousands of migrants from countries of terrorism concern do reach the southern border every year; whether they leave prayer rugs behind is irrelevant. U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) professionals have, for many years, regarded this migrant traffic as a higher threat, so much so that public funds have long been earmarked for special vetting, investigation, and intelligence work.

The first error from Qiu comes when she states: “Nowhere in the White House’s 25-page counterterrorism policy, released in October, was the threat of terrorists infiltrating the nation’s southwest border raised.” In fact, the White House’s “National Strategy for Counterterrorism” includes pointed information on the threat of terrorists infiltrating the border.

The document Qiu insists makes no mention of our borders says: “Europe’s struggle to screen the people crossing its borders highlights the importance of ensuring strong United States borders so that terrorists cannot enter the United States.” It then goes on to list “priority actions” about disrupting terrorist travel and securing the border from terrorist threats. One is by sharing intelligence information with our partners, and by helping foreign law enforcement agencies arrest and prosecute them.

Did Qiu even read it?

Misleading By Omission

Qiu then misleadingly cited another government report that many others have now cited, the State Department’s annual “Country Reports on Terrorism 2017.” She cited the report to support the theory that no one believes there’s a terror threat inherent in this migrant flow. “And the State Department, in a September report, said there was ‘no credible evidence’ that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the United States through Mexico,” she wrote.

In reality, the report clearly states and preserves the idea that the border does indeed remain vulnerable to terrorist infiltration, even if in 2017 no organized group deployed over it. This nuance is always tactically truncated (by Fox News’s Chris Wallace and many others) to support a very different narrative. It says that “The U.S. southern border remains vulnerable to potential terrorist transit, although terrorist groups likely seek other means of trying to enter the United States.”

Elsewhere, the report (p.194 for those who are curious) again states the border’s vulnerability: “In addition, many Latin American countries have porous borders, limited law enforcement capabilities, and established smuggling routes. These vulnerabilities offer opportunities to foreign terrorist groups, but there have been no cases of terrorist groups exploiting these gaps to move operations through the region.”

To cite this report as only saying no terrorists have crossed from Mexico in the year 2017 — and never that it also says the southern border remained vulnerable to terrorist infiltration despite all of that — misleads by substantial omission.

Also worth noting is that the State Department is addressing organized terror groups, not lone offenders and small cells that no group can deploy, and only covers the year 2017. Other news outlets have reported migrants on terrorist watchlists being apprehended at the border in the first half of 2018, and intelligence community sources have told me more than 100 reached the border or were en route between 2012 and 2017. None of this is reflected in The Times’ report.

Next, the Qiu article, in its headline, characterizes Islamic migration to the border as an “unproved rumor,” when the opposite is true. This is similar to the claims made by Vox, MSNBC, and CNN commentators, and The Washington Post.

I have met actual migrants from Islamic countries who make the journey. In my capacity both as a former journalist and as an intelligence practitioner, I have photographed and videotaped them at the border after they have crossed and while they were en route through Latin America. I have interviewed them in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention and while they were still on the routes coming in. Meanwhile, thousands of court case records from two dozen smuggling prosecutions are available, in which sworn federal officers discuss how the migrants and their smugglers do it.

No Security Threat?

Most confusingly, Qiu makes the assertion that such Islamic migration, even if it did exist, presents no security threat. Yet congressional testimony is readily available in which many high-ranking DHS officials over the years have discussed land-border migration from Islamic countries as a unique homeland threat, long before Donald Trump.

The Democratic likes of DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson regarded this completely undisputed migration as such a serious homeland security threat as recently as 2016 that he called for a whole-government program to counter it. Most of the signature homeland security legislation following 9/11 explicitly refers to border infiltration as a terror threat to counter, as to this day do annual strategic plans of DHS component agencies. Like this border patrol plan––from the Obama years––that lists as its top priority the prevention of terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering between ports of entry.

It would be one thing if Qiu’s column were anomalous, but the reality is that journalists continue to dismiss these terror concerns based on incomplete research, misreadings (or no readings) of primary source documents, and mendacious omissions of vast publicly available evidence.

Meanwhile, well-trained and experienced homeland security professionals, like Johnson and those who write the nation’s homeland security strategic plans that cite terrorist border infiltration as a major threat problem, are never cited. Writers need to overcome their personal disdain for the president and seek out the other voices and facts available to them. They also need to simply work hard.

I’m not holding out hope for improvement on either count.

Protecting Americans Simply Doesn’t Require U.S. Troops In Syria,"At the height of its power in 2014, ISIS was filthy rich, scoring hundreds of millions of dollars in bank heists and hundreds of millions more in oil sales, kidnapping-for-ransom, extortion, and even artifact sales. In June 2014, ISIS fighters all but demolished the Iraqi army in northern Iraq, an embarrassing rout for a military that U.S. taxpayers built and financed at a cost of $25 billion.

Today, ISIS is anything but a triumphant force. After four years of combat, the group’s militants are tired, dirty, smelly, hemmed into smaller and smaller patches of territory in the remote Syrian countryside, and increasingly trying to escape inevitable death by blending into the civilian population. At the time of writing, ISIS is down to its last square mile of territory. Sooner or later, 100 percent of the fake caliphate will be retaken.

Seeing these gains, President Donald Trump wants out. If reports are true, U.S. troops will leave eastern Syria by April. This has predictably caused heart palpitations among military officials, the national security blob, and the usual suspects who have never seen a U.S. intervention they wanted to end.

Gen. Joseph Votel, the outgoing CENTCOM combatant commander, apparently has some issues with the withdrawal as well. Speaking to CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr, Votel said that Trump’s decision to remove the troops “would not have been my military advice at that particular time … I would not have made that suggestion, frankly.”

Votel is certainly entitled to his professional opinion. But it’s perfectly legitimate to inquire whether the general’s paradigm about the terrorism problem is the right one.

“The caliphate still has leaders, still has fighters, it still has facilitators, it still has resources, so our continued military pressure is necessary to continue to go after that network,” he points out. Nobody would dispute the Islamic State still has fighters, facilitators, and resources. But ground troops and an endless counterinsurgency campaign are not required to counter terrorism threats. The U.S. military can monitor, target, and eliminate any anti-American threats anywhere the world.

If declaring mission success is measured in terms of killing every last lunatic who calls himself a member of the caliphate or draining every last dollar out of ISIS’s bank account, then the counter-ISIS mission will go on and on and on. That may not be a problem for the insiders in Washington who are perfectly comfortable with mission creep on autopilot, unlimited expenditure of resources (despite the U.S. having a national debt that is $22 trillion and counting), and mimicking the 18th-century British Empire, but this myopic view is not exactly a position the American people would subscribe to.

The measure of success is not whether ISIS can still claim fighters and money, but rather whether the U.S. homeland and interests overseas are protected. There are dozens upon dozens of terrorist groups around the world that launch attacks against civilians, make money in a number of illicit ways, and in some cases control territory. Most of them, however, are either focused on local concerns or understand that attacking Americans would be like signing their own death warrant.

Protecting the American people doesn’t require a constant U.S. troop presence at considerable risk to our soldiers and considerable expense. All it takes it good intelligence work, information collaboration across federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, common-sense security policies along ports-of-entry, and pragmatic partnerships with governments around the world.

“They [ISIS] still have this very powerful ideology, so they can inspire [attacks],” says Votel. Again, this is no doubt true. In its heyday, the Islamic State managed to attract tens of thousands of foreign fighters by deliberately targeting the disaffected and pilfering fighters from its competitors. Despite ISIS’s stinging defeats on the battlefield during the last three years, 50 foreign fighters are still reportedly crossing into Syria every month to enlist with the group.

A perverse ideology, however, can’t be defeated by foreign boots on the ground. It’s not a problem that can be bombed to smithereens, captured and prosecuted in court, or sniffed out by counterinsurgency doctrine. Ideologies die when those who are most harmed by them—in ISIS’s case, the Muslim world—proactively address them in an honest, sincere, and comprehensive way over the long-term. American soldiers can’t and shouldn’t do it for them.

If Washington and its partners in the Middle East want to vanquish the ideology behind ISIS, Arab leaders can no longer afford to avoid tackling the deeply rooted, systemic crises (horrible economic inequality, low economic opportunity, political systems seeped with corruption, sectarianism, poor public services, a restless youth bulge who want a better life than their parents, etc.) that have made the region such an epicenter of terrorism and violence.

Votel also said, “We want (ISIS) to be able to be controlled or addressed by the indigenous partners…that when they are capable of handing this threat on their own, without our assistance, that will be another key criteria indicating to me that we have accomplished our mission of defeat of ISIS.”

On the overarching concept, he is right: the “indigenous partners” have the primary responsibility to ensure the Islamic State is beaten down to the point it can be contained and managed. However, it’s highly unlikely these indigenous forces will take charge of the problem if the United States remains in the immediate area and maintains military bases in the vicinity.

Why would they? If their partner is willing to do much of the work, why would the Iraqi and Syrian governments step up to deal with the political, social, and economic issues that have uplifted ISIS and helped the organization continue to operate?

If anything, Damascus, Baghdad, the Syrian Kurds, the Turks, and the Sunni Arab tribes would have a bigger incentive to eviscerate ISIS if Washington withdrew its troops. The Islamic State, after all, is primarily a significant national security threat to the region’s ruling regimes, not to the United States.

As we continue to hear the naysayers in Washington vocally oppose a U.S. departure from Syria, we would all be wise to remember that ISIS is not an existential threat to the United States. If U.S. intelligence discovers a credible and imminent ISIS plot against Americans, the Trump administration should not (and would not) hesitate to interdict it. But maintaining an American military presence in the eastern Syrian desert for the next 50 years (or more) is more likely to delay the security handover to local partners than it is to eradicate terrorism.

It also happens to be unnecessary, costly, and dangerous for the United States since it prevents us from focusing on higher priorities, like deterring great power conflict.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/02/18/protecting-americans-simply-doesnt-require-u-s-troops-syria/,2019-02-18
Christian Journalist In Hot Water Over Terrorism-Linked Ex-Boyfriend,"On January 17, Dutch journalist Ans Boersma was expelled from Turkey. Initially, journalists and politicians in the Netherlands responded with outrage, decrying this as another instance of the Turkish government’s violating the freedom of the press.

However, the story quickly took a bizarre twist. Dutch authorities have confirmed that Boersma, 31, is a suspect in an ongoing terrorism investigation.

The investigation centers on her ex-boyfriend, a man of Syrian origin who has been identified publicly only by the name “Abdulaziz al-H.” He was arrested last year on the grounds that he had fought for Jabhat al-Nusra, an organization sometimes called “Al-Qaeda in Syria.” During a pretrial hearing in February, Dutch prosecutors alleged that Abdulaziz held a leadership position in al-Nusra. They claim that he climbed the ranks quickly after he helped orchestrate an attack that killed 200 people. He is also accused of laundering money for al-Nusra.

His case drew significant media attention in the Netherlands long before his connection to Boersma became public. In September 2017, Aziz attended the Amsterdam screening of a documentary about the Syrian civil war. Other people from Syria were in attendance and recognized him as a jihadist. They attempted to have him apprehended, but in the ensuing commotion he managed to flee the theater.

Aziz arrived in the Netherlands in 2014. Dutch authorities suspect Boersma of helping him obtain false documents he used to secure a residence visa. Aziz and Boersma broke up in 2015.

Boersma filed a lawsuit against the Dutch government and is giving interviews to tell her side of the story. She says Abdulaziz admitted to her that he been involved with al-Nusra in its early days when its mission was only to overthrow President Assad. She says he said he quit when it became an Islamic extremist group.

“He always told me that he had no blood on his hands and that he had never committed any human rights violations,” she said in an interview with Dutch media.

Her account was contradicted at Abdulaziz’s pretrial hearing. Dutch authorities were tapping his phone prior to his arrest. Prosecutors allege that in one call Abdulaziz told his brother about an incident in which Boersma found incriminating information on his iPad. He told his brother this caused him to vow to her that he would never kill again. Boersma denies anything of the sort ever took place.

She is not suspected of involvement in acts of terrorism, only of helping a terrorist. When Turkish authorities learned that she was under investigation, they decided to expel her. A spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan tweeted an explanation, “If a credible foreign gov’t agency tells you that one of their citizens has links to terrorism, you don’t take any chances. The Dutch authorities alone are in a position to explain why they arrived at that conclusion. We won’t speculate on the credibility of their intelligence.”

We won't speculate on the credibility of their intelligence. — Fahrettin Altun (@fahrettinaltun) January 17, 2019

At first glance, Boersma and Abdulaziz seem like a very unlikely couple. She comes from a Christian background and obtained a BA in journalism from a Christian college.

However, Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf writes, “Sources close to Boersma describe her as a lady-like, Christian and naïve woman. It was not a total surprise to them that she started dating a Syrian.” Boersma was passionate about helping Middle-Eastern refugees. In 2015, she spent her vacation volunteering on a Greek island where large numbers of refugees were landing. According to De Telegraaf, upon her return she posted on Facebook, “The term ‘terrorist’ no longer has any meaning for me. Neither does ‘evil.’ Because both words are selectively applied.”

Many Christians in the Netherlands believe their country should welcome refugees from the Middle East. They see this as an important way of “loving thy neighbor.”

American media coverage of the Netherlands often centers on its anti-immigration movement led by far-right politician Geert Wilders. However, the country also has a big pro-immigration faction, many of whom are Christians.

In the Dutch parliament, the Christian Union political party is one of the strongest proponents of pro-refugee policies. In January, the Christian Union played a critical role in enacting a new amnesty for child refugees. Around 600 minors, plus their families, who are deemed to have become rooted in Dutch society will be granted residence permits.

It remains to be seen if Boersma will face charges. Either way, her career in journalism is over. Her employer has publicly cut ties with her. She will also find it difficult to travel outside the Netherlands since many countries bar entry to individuals with links to known terrorists.

Thus, Boersma is unlikely to live down her infamy as the journalist who dated a jidahist.

"Before Omar, Obama Mainstreamed Anti-Semitism Among Democrats","D.C. is still reeling from last week’s debacle involving Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has made a series of statements many have criticized as anti-Semitic. In 2012, she tweeted, “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.”

In February, Omar had tweeted that support for Israel was “all about the Benjamins baby,” prompting charges she was raising anti-Semitic tropes involving Jews and sinister financial machinations. Two weeks ago, she raised the issue of dual loyalty, and old anti-Semitic canard, before a D.C. crowd: “Nobody ever gets to have the broader debate of what is happening with Palestine. So for me, I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.”

When a fellow Democratic congresswoman lamented “that Rep. Omar continues to mischaracterize support for Israel,” Omar responded by saying, “I should not be expected to have allegiance/pledge support to a foreign country in order to serve my country in Congress or serve on committee.”

In response, last week Democrats threatened to vote on a measure condemning anti-Semitism. What should have been a simple resolution to condemn such statements got watered down until the resolution failed to directly condemn the things Omar had said.

One key component here is simply rank partisanship. Even though Omar has an extensive history of tracking in anti-Semitic tropes, going back to her days in state office, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is out there defending the indefensible, having resorted to such insulting arguments as “I think she has a different experience in the use of words.” This is what you might say about a child or mentally disabled person, not a member of the foreign affairs committee.

The more creative, if more dishonest, defense of Omar is that she’s one being victimized merely because she’s a black female Muslim. Rep. James Clyburn even went so far as to suggest that Omar has some sort of immunity because her experience as a refugee was “more personal” than the objections of people whose parents were Holocaust survivors.

Oddly enough, when Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who like Omar is a female Somali refugee, speaks out against the anti-Semitism and illiberal (in the meaningful sense) tendencies of the Muslim world, her own intersectional bona fides don’t seem to matter. In fact, in the Southern Poverty Law Center’s “A Journalist’s Manual: Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists,” written in collaboration with the obsequious Democratic Party defenders at Media Matters for America, Ali was labeled one of these anti-Muslim extremists. Go figure. (The SPLC later lost a $3 million lawsuit over their libelous “Field Guide.”)

How we arrived at a place where Democrats would insist that Omar is being persecuted for saying Jews hypnotize people no doubt requires some unpacking. It seems a lot of people who are surprised and disheartened by Omar’s comments are under the impression that tolerance for anti-Semitism in the Democratic Party is a new turn of events. That’s hardly the case.

Lost in the mists of the last decade is Barack Obama’s mainstreaming of anti-Semitism into Democratic and American politics. To be clear, even after two terms as president, Obama remains such a cipher that saying he mainstreamed anti-Semitism is hardly the same thing as saying he’s personally anti-Semitic. It is fair, however, to say he has consorted with Israel critics with dubious motivations and people with anti-Israel terror connections to such a degree that the most charitable thing one can say is that there’s a possibility his embrace of these people was just a way to cynically advance his political career and foreign policy priorities, priorities that were just coincidentally threatening to Israel’s security.

In fact, when Obama ran for president in 2008, people spoke openly of his “Jewish problem.” It wasn’t strictly a partisan concern, either: Hillary Clinton raised the issue in the Democratic Party. Obama did a poor job of persuading people that this wasn’t a legitimate concern.

In 2008, Jimmy Carter met with the leader of terror group Hamas, a move condemned by Condoleezza Rice, who then was secretary of state. Obama declined to condemn the meeting because “he’s a private citizen. It’s not my place to discuss who he shouldn’t meet with.” This is a remarkably calm reaction to Carter’s blatant Logan Act violation, a crime the Obama administration would later deem so serious it was used to justify investigating and surveilling the Trump campaign.

Obama reversed course a few days later, after it became obvious that refusing to condemn the meeting was damaging his campaign. As the Los Angeles Times observed then, when the condemnation finally came it was “as he tried to reassure Jewish voters that his candidacy isn’t a threat to them or U.S. support for Israel.”

Of course, there were plenty more reasons to think Obama didn’t really think that the murderous and anti-Semitic Hamas was all that bad. When Hamas came out and officially endorsed his candidacy in 2008, Obama’s chief strategist, David Axelrod, said the endorsement was “flattering.” This is not an exaggeration. “We all agree that John Kennedy was a great president, and it’s flattering when anybody says that Barack Obama would follow in his footsteps,” Axelrod said.

Obama’s problematic pastor, Jeremiah Wright, was also notoriously anti-Israel. Aside from making plenty of public criticisms about Wright, in 2007 the bulletin at Wright’s church reprinted an article by a Hamas official.

Of course, Obama would famously break publicly with Wright, but that was again in the middle of the campaign when he faced public pressure. If the church where you baptized your kids starts putting terrorist propaganda in the pews, right then might be time to find a new place to worship, not after continuing to attend threatens your political career.

But Wright was hardly the first person with these views Obama had very visibly associated with. Much has been made of Obama’s friendship with scholar Rashid Khalidi, who has been accused of working as an advisor for the PLO terror group (Khalidi claims he was only helping the press understand the group). Obama sat on the board of a foundation that gave $40,000 to a local charity Khalidi’s wife headed.

In 2008, the Los Angeles Times notoriously reported on a videotape of Obama speaking at an event in Khalidi’s honor, where one of the speakers compared Zionists to Osama bin Laden. While the still unreleased video of this event attracted the most attention, other aspects of the Los Angeles Times’s lengthy report on Obama’s close ties to Palestinian activists are noteworthy. For instance, in the same report Khalidi heavily implies that any pro-Israel sentiment Obama expresses while running for president was “a stance that Khalidi calls a requirement to win a national election in the U.S.”

If Obama’s campaign was trying to pivot toward Israel with friendly speeches to AIPAC, privately the campaign did not act like they were especially inclined to be favorable to Israel. The Obama’s campaign’s chief military adviser and national-campaign co-chairman was Gen. Merrill McPeak. In 1976, McPeak wrote an article for Foreign Affairs criticizing Israel. He said Israel should return to its 1967 borders and hand the Golan Heights back to Syria.

McPeak also trotted out the “dual loyalty” issue and in a 2003 interview with the Oregonian accused Jewish and evangelical voters of placing their interest in Israel above U.S. interests. Asked what was impeding world peace, McPeak said, “New York City. Miami. We have a large vote . . . here in favor of Israel. And no politician wants to run against it.” Obama disavowed McPeak’s thoughts on Israel being primarily responsible for impeding peace in the Middle East, but stood behind his campaign’s affiliation with the general.

That wasn’t the worst of it. The Obama campaign publicly fired journalist Robert Malley from their campaign after previously denying he was an adviser to the campaign. If that sounds strange, here’s what happened.

The Obama campaign issued press release calling Malley an adviser to the campaign, and liberal Jews freaked out because Malley has a long track record of writing rabidly anti-Israel articles (and his father was friend of Arafat’s and a PLO sympathizer). After the press release came out, the Obama campaign clarified that Malley was not an adviser to the campaign and had only offered informal advice. Most liberals accepted this explanation.

“Malley, who has written several deceitful articles in The New York Review of Books, is a rabid hater of Israel. No question about it,” wrote Marty Pertetz in The New Republic in January of 2008. “But Malley is not and has never been a Middle East adviser to Barack Obama.”

Flash forward a few months to May 2008, and the London Times reports that not only was Malley serving on the Obama campaign’s Middle East advisory council all this time, but that the campaign had recently got around to firing him after they learned he’d been in regular contact with Hamas the whole time. It turns out that the Obama campaign wasn’t just flattered by Hamas, they were likely taking their advice as well. If contemporary Democrats now purport that the collusion with and infiltration of campaigns by hostile foreign powers renders a presidency illegitimate, well, there are revealing parallels here. Make of it what you will.

That was just Obama’s first campaign. Suffice to say, there is a rogues’ gallery within and without the Obama presidency that continued to prove Obama wasn’t terribly concerned about how the criticism of Israel was expressed in the corridors of power. But if you looked at what went on with the first Obama campaign, then it logically follows that his presidency would be laser-focused on empowering Iran, the largest benefactor of murderous on anti-Semitic and anti-Israel terror groups such as Hamas, even if it meant engaging in a variety of extraordinarily deceptive behaviors to hide such policies from Congress and the American people. Top administration officials eventually admitted the manipulation and deceit.

Now, not every critic of Israel or Zionism is an anti-Semite, and it is unfortunate that such perspectives are often lost in foreign policy debates. At the same time, however, just about all anti-Semites are also critics of Israel and Zionism. And it’s safe to say that, whatever Obama’s personal feelings and public statements about Jews and anti-Semitism, the practical consequences of his presidency amounted to very publicly elevating and legitimizing lots of people one could criticize as anti-Semitic, to say nothing of empowering Iran.

By allowing people who pal around with terror groups and employ questionable anti-Israel rationales to have a seat at the table, Obama allowed the legitimate critics of Israel to be eclipsed, and it was only a matter of time before someone such as Omar broke through to a position of power in American politics without expressing much concern about masking anti-Semitism.

Naturally, Omar doesn’t see herself following in Obama’s footsteps. That’s not how radicalism works. Recently, Omar attacked Obama because he “got away with murder” and was “droning” other countries. Vanity Fair’s take on the article was revealing: “Democrats didn’t abandon Omar over her comments about Israel. Her criticism of Barack Obama is another matter.” Saying that in today’s Democratic Party it’s more heretical to criticize Obama than be an anti-Semite is both accurate and depressing, in that a mainstream journalistic outlet thinks Obama’s legacy is the bigger concern here.

It’s also wrong, because the Democratic Party is on a path to become even more toxic than this game of pick your poison suggests. Omar tried to backtrack unconvincingly, but there was never any danger of Democrats abandoning her over her Obama remarks. The new socialist wing of the party largely agrees with her criticisms of the former president.

Unfortunately for Obama’s legacy, radicalism only begets even more radicalism. We came to tolerate his radicalism on Israel. If we come to tolerate Omar’s political vision, just wait until the next iteration of left-wing politician comes along and builds on her success normalizing this rhetoric by declaring that she was insufficiently radical. It could well prove dangerous and terrifying.

"Ilhan Omar Doesn’t Represent U.S. Muslims, She Represents Islamists","When the newly elected Rep. Ilhan Omar kicked off her acceptance speech with “As-Salaam-Alaikum,” I felt a space of belonging. There was a feeling that American Muslims had arrived—but what arrived with them, and which version of Islam was going to be represented through her and fellow Muslim freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib?

As-Salaam-Alaikum means “peace be with you,” but how Omar has carried herself in the weeks that followed has been anything put peaceful. Here’s a quick rundown of her recent actions.

Omar accused American Jews of holding dual loyalty toward Israel. However, there was no word of her loyalty to Islamist supremacism and its gold star prize of advancing the Palestinian cause by decimating the Jewish state’s right to exist.

Omar dehumanized President Trump by saying he’s not really human. Now, Omar has survived a war zone. It takes a distorted mind to have received dehumanization at such scale, then dehumanize another.

Omar had trouble distinguishing between her opinion and a fact when discussing Sen. Lindsey Graham, whom she accused of being compromised with no evidence to support the smear.

Her high frequency of tweets and statements peddling anti-Semitic tropes led to congressional resolutions against anti-Semitism, which Omar made about Islamophobia. With the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ influence, the House resolution mutated from a specific issue to a catch-all that includes Islamophobia — a term that has no tangible meaning and has extended from initially meaning “fear of Islam” to being any perceived criticism toward Islam or Muslims (even if it comes from other Muslims).

The Lack of Accountability Continues to Grow

Omar frequently backpeddles on her statements, saying she’s been misunderstood. There is a term for this: gaslighting. As fellow Muslim reformer Dr. Zuhdi Jasser pointed out, Omar relies on the excuse of naivety granted her by the Democratic Party.

The gross level of permission given Omar to continue to be hateful and unrepentant is its own form of prejudice that sounds a lot like an inner Democratic monologue that might go like this: ‘The poor little oppressed brown Muslim girl is overwhelmed. We need to help her.”

Yes, we need to help her. We help her by giving her the dignity and respect of being treated as an adult, a peer, and a colleague. If we’re going to be generous, we help Omar by recognizing we’re looking at someone deeply affected by war and powerlessness, and unsteady in wielding power. We help her by holding her accountable.

The reluctance to hold her accountable stems in part from this idea that these are clumsy missteps. Yet none of this is new for Omar, who served in Minnesota’s House of Representatives in 2017, a role she stepped into after being politically active in her community. This is her second public office, and she enters her term with a trail of interviews that show a consistency in provocative and extreme views.

Past interviews offer telltale signs of revulsion toward America and a disturbingly odd defense for terror groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. Omar has also asked for leniency toward ISIS terrorists (even though Minnesota’s Somali community has a radicalization problem), but has been hesitant to commit to defending young Somali girls against female genital mutilation (the Somali community also scores high for ritualistic cutting).

Complicated Effects on American Muslims

For the public at large, Omar isn’t destroying any stereotypes in public office. In fact, so far she reinforces the stereotype that someone like her would believe what someone like her actually appears to believe, and that makes it almost insurmountably more difficult for other American Muslims. Because of her behavior, we will be hated more and trusted less.

Her effects on the American Muslim community are complicated to tease out. Pushing aside her unwavering Islamist allies (and most ardent public supporters), we find a mixed bag of American Muslims who find themselves struggling with her representation as a Muslim.

As one American Muslim pointed out to me in private conversation, “She has the right enemies.” Those enemies include Saudi Arabia, which despite its current favor with the Trump administration, is collectively hated by American Muslims for their unwillingness to sever the head of Wahhabi ideology and terror funding. It’s also hated for its gross human rights abuses and failure to leverage its wealth and power to offer humanitarian assistance to displaced Muslims. Yet Omar is pictured sitting in private meetings with Turkish President (and Islamist dictator) Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Her position on LGBTQIA issues is also divisive. Deeply disapproving of her anti-Semitism, liberal Muslims will align with Omar on her support for gay and trans issues, while traditional or conservative Muslims will further distance themselves. Meanwhile, Muslim reformers and traditionalists all but align on Omar, except on her criticisms of Jews, the state of Israel, or however else she might package those views. On that, traditionalists and fundamentalist Muslims are divided even amongst themselves.

All this is to underscore that it is not possible to peg Omar as representative of a collective Muslim identity. However, she checks off the boxes for Islamist representation, and that comes down to three key factors:

Vitriolic hate for Israel, while blurring or tolerating gross anti-Semitism alongside sloppy scrutiny of Israeli policies.

Absolute disinterest in good faith engagement and dialogue with non-Islamist personalities, particularly Muslim reformers.

Using Western political channels to advance the agenda of Islamic supremacism, where Islam is narrowly defined by a small segment of a Muslim demographic. This demographic drives the public narrative through a visible Muslim identity, which must currently be seen as oppressed or victimized to gain additional public favor and tolerance that then reinforces the underlying supremacism.

Islam weaponized as a political tool, including weaponizing language such as “Islamophobia,” only advances Islamists. Islamism is not a representation of Islam. It is, however, a representation of an expansionist ideology among Muslim supremacists.

That 9/11 Poster Is the Problem in One Picture

The clumsy poster displayed at the West Virginia statehouse of Omar paired with the falling Twin Towers kicked up a fresh hysteria. The poster generated all sorts of jumping to conclusions, including fanning the fear that (1) Omar is a terrorist or a Trojan Horse, (2) Omar is responsible for the 9/11 attacks, (3) Omar is in some way linked to the 9/11 hijackers, and so forth.

This poster is in your Capitol on a booth sponsored by @WVGOP “When someone shows you who they are, believe them” pic.twitter.com/4k566ztHWo — (((Mike Pushkin))) (@pushkinforhouse) March 1, 2019

It is as absurd to jump to any of these conclusions as it was to have created that poster. However, that poster exists, so let’s talk about it. Let’s start by putting the poster into words: the ideology of “tick tick boom” went from crashing into the Twin Towers to walking the halls of Congress.

A destructive ideology is hijacking Islam, and it see-saws from violent extremism to Islamism. Both the ideology of terror and the ideology of Islamism are destructive.

We’ve spent nearly 20 targeted years fighting terror at home and abroad. After all that, the West is seeing an increased tolerance toward radicalization, including from American politicians who in some cases can’t identity basic terror groups and in other cases lump terrorists of one ideology with non-violent Islamists of another ideology, as we see in the poster.

Among the far-left, terror ideology is no longer outrageous—it’s bundled under a banner of inclusivity. Among the far right, all Muslims are practicing taqiyya (the stealth art of lying). Almost 20 years after 9/11, most American political influencers and thinkers on the hill still struggle with discriminating between the faith and the ideology, between everyday Muslims and Islamists. Most still don’t know what a Muslim reformer is.

So yes, of course someone was going to create that poster because that is where we are in the conversation. We’ve bombed and killed a lot of people overseas, while allowing dangerous Muslim supremacists to rise as political and culture leaders at home.

Meanwhile, for the rest of us, having a public conversation on this level is only possible once an individual has swashbuckled her way through the Islamophobia accusations, because everything is Islamophobia — even if you’re a Muslim. Especially if you’re an anti-Islamist Muslim.

In sum, criticism of Omar’s actions is not an attack on her faith, nor is it an attack on the Somali community, or her skin color. It’s an attack on Omar’s actions, while raising the question of if and how America failed in integrating Omar and the community that influenced her.

As we pan through her tweets, interviews, and legislative work, we’re looking for American values that transcend race, color, and creed. Those American values aren’t defined by whether she practices Islam, chooses to wear a hijab, and so forth — those factors are absolutely irrelevant here. We’re looking to see if she can isolate the values that gave rise to a nation she and her family sought refuge in from war-torn Somalia.

If you have difficulty identifying what distances America from foreign terror groups for example, or deflect criticism with accusations of racism or bigotry versus engaging in a sophisticated debate of ideas, then once at the helm of power, you run to risk of not being able to keep America from becoming another country to escape from.

Omar is part of a growing legislative arm of the Islamist body, a body that was already well-formed with lobbies, cultural icons, and academics. Yet, as a Muslim reformer, my concern is less with Omar and more so with the debilitating chaos, controversy, and polarizing communication breakdown she brings. That is what Islamists do. They create chaos because they thrive in chaos.

How Long Will Media Use SPLC’s Garbage Hate List To Smear People?,"Like other mainstream publications, Roll Call regularly stoops to citing the thoroughly discredited Southern Poverty Law Center as a credible source for labeling “hate” groups. One recent such article was titled “Among the ‘Jewish groups’ Trump cites, one with neo-Nazi ties.” The author had worked for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and this was clearly part of Democrats’ effort to cover Pelosi and derail criticisms of Ilhan Omar for anti-Semitism.

I work with both of the “hate” groups named in the article, the Center for Security Policy and ACT for America. SPLC’s characterization of them is fraudulent, like most of what it does. It is thus little surprise to anyone who knows anything that SPLC recently jettisoned founder Morris Dees over accusations of racism and sexual assault.

Despite years of takedowns of SPLC’s business model from both sides of the aisle, major media companies such as Amazon, PayPal, Twitter, the Washington Post, Facebook, Google, The New York Times, and more cite them and use their determinations for business decisions such as Amazon’s nonprofit donations program. When will this ever end? How many lawsuits and lies will it take?

The SPLC’s Hate Group Definitions Are Garbage

ACT does not now, nor did it ever have, ties to any “neo-Nazi.” Both ACT and the Center are long-established organizations whose leaders and scholars seek to inform and warn America about the subversive goals of Islamic radical groups in the United States, not everyday Muslims. Everyday Muslims are often as much the victims as others.

Most of the prominent Islamic organizations in the United States are either Muslim Brotherhood (MB) fronts or tied to the Deobandi movement of South Asia (which also has ties to MB). Both are aggressive, subversive organizations that engage in terrorism throughout the world.

In the United States they generally use subversion as a more effective strategy, and have insinuated their allies and agendas into the U.S. government, media, Hollywood, public schools and universities. This is helping encourage the recent rise of anti-Semitism in the United States.

They also engage in terrorism. The 2015 San Bernardino, California attack that killed 14 and wounded 22 was carried out by followers of Deobandi. Terrorists of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas attack and murder Israeli Jews and even Arabs on an almost daily basis in the West Bank, and—note to border wall opponents—in Israel proper before Israel built its wall.

Hamas is a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, whose U.S. front is the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Why doesn’t SPLC mention CAIR?

CAIR was an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation terrorism financing trial, and only avoided trouble because the Obama Justice Department under Eric Holder discontinued prosecutions of organizations named in the case. CAIR is also a subversive wrecking bar against the U.S. Constitution, conducting nonstop lawfare against America. CAIR’s Chicago branch—one of 27 in the United States—brags a tally of more than 5,200 lawsuits against U.S. governments.

Smearing People Is Big Business

Many of the “hate” groups on SPLC’s list are simply those it disagrees with politically. Rather than engage in legitimate debate, the SPLC seeks to destroy its political enemies with defamatory smear tactics. The Russian Communist Vladimir Lenin advocated this strategy, saying, “We must write in a language that inspires hate, revulsion and scorn among the working class toward those who disagree with us.”

Frankfurt School Communist Herbert Marcuse developed that idea into what came to be known as “partisan tolerance”: tolerance only of leftist ideas, individuals, and groups, and a wholesale effort to discredit and silence opponents. Marcuse and other Communists worked closely for years with SPLC co-founder Julian Bond.

The SPLC regularly consorts with Communist organizations. In his pamphlet, “Rules for Radicals,” Saul Alinsky advocated the tactic of accusing opponents of hate, but SPLC was the first to institutionalize it. It has since spread far and wide, in media, universities, Hollywood, and in mindless chants of leftist protesters. Apparently now it reaches even into the editorial staff of Roll Call.

The SPLC never criticizes even the vilest leftist groups. For example, Antifa, which uses violence and increasingly expresses vitriolic, obscenity-laced hate and anti-Semitism, earns no criticism or “hate” designation from SPLC. Instead, the SPLC defends groups like Antifa against the big, bad Proud Boys!

When Occupy Wall Street Black Bloc activists attempted to bomb a bridge in Ohio and blow up the GOP convention in 2012, SPLC was asked why Black Bloc was not listed among its “hate” groups. “We’re not really set up to cover the extreme Left” was the lame response.

The oldest Muslim Brotherhood front is the Muslim Students Association. It is responsible (along with the left) for the rise of anti-Semitism on college campuses. It never gets a mention by the SPLC.

There are countless other examples. The SPLC has singled out and destroyed numerous individuals and organizations using these smear tactics. It is a form of political terrorism.

SPLC’s Targets Have Begun to Fight Back

SPLC lost a $3.5 million lawsuit last year against Maajid Nawaz, a moderate Muslim the SPLC labeled an “extremist,” because he spoke out against Islamic extremism and terrorism. You literally can’t make this stuff up.

Now about 60 organizations have either sued or are considered suing the SPLC for its fraudulent smears. It’s about time. Thousands more could join in. It should be stripped of its 501(c)3 “nonpartisan” tax-exempt status and sued into penury. A dedicated prosecutor could easily make a claim that they are a continuing criminal enterprise and seize their assets under racketeering statutes.

The SPLC shows its extreme partisanship every day. Even liberals like Dana Milbank, Alexander Cockburn, and Stephen Bright have labeled the SPLC a fraud. It spends more than 20 percent of its income on fundraising and has amassed almost half a billion dollars in assets, some of which is squirreled away in overseas accounts.

Less than half of its revenues last year were needed to cover expenses, while its overtly socialist executives earn very capitalist salaries, and live like kings. Must be nice to be such conscience-free hypocrites.

Media Act as Megaphones for SPLC Smears

The Roll Call article cast both ACT and the Center as “hawks” on national defense, as if that were somehow further evidence of bigotry or some other evil. That is idiotic, but “hawks” isn’t even applicable.

The Center for Security Policy staff, for example, includes former CIA officers, military and law enforcement specialists, and other national defense experts. These people take positions based on a careful evaluation of each situation, not some knee jerk “hawk” response to everything. The only knee-jerk reactions seem to be coming from the pages of Roll Call and other mainstream outlets that continue to give the SPLC credibility, like Facebook and The New York Times.

It is tragic that large outlets like these have joined the ranks of leftist smear merchants who have reduced political discourse in the United States to little more than infantile name-calling. The SPLC is one of the nastiest hate groups on the planet. It deliberately provokes division and anger in America on a daily basis to advance its extreme left agenda and rake in millions in donations.

Roll Call, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, Google and all the others need to drop the SPLC as a consultant on “hate” groups, but since they are all of the same stripe, they probably won’t.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/03/20/long-will-media-use-splcs-garbage-hate-designation-smear-people/,2019-03-20
Cory Booker Peddles False Gun Law ‘Loopholes’ During CNN Town Hall,"During Wednesday night’s CNN town hall event, 2020 presidential hopeful Cory Booker indulged in a favorite pastime of Democratic politicians: spewing false and inaccurate information on gun laws.

When answering an audience member’s question on his plan to address gun misuse, Booker immediately turned to attacking the National Rifle Association and laws that are not actually found anywhere in federal law. Let’s look at the each of the gun “loopholes” Booker is so passionate about abolishing.

https://twitter.com/jason_howerton/status/1111098164529037313

“[The NRA] is defending loopholes, like that loophole if a man is convicted of beating his wife, he can find a loophole to go out and buy a gun and murder her,” Booker said. “They are defending, not their membership, but the loopholes, like the loophole that says someone on the terrorist no-fly list in our country can still go to a gun show and buy weapons. That somebody that’s convicted of a violent crime can still find a loophole to buy a violent weapon.”

The claim that a wife-beater or someone convicted of a violent crime can purchase or possess a firearm is categorically false. The 1968 Gun Control Act prohibits anyone convicted of a felony or misdemeanor crime of domestic violence from possessing a firearm.

Every dealer with a Federal Firearms License must perform background checks through the FBI’s National Instant Background Check System (NICS) every time they sell a firearm to a consumer. It doesn’t matter if this sale takes place online, at a gun show, or in a parking lot. So anyone with a domestic violence conviction on his or her record should be prevented from buying a gun.

Where the system often fails is not in the lack of background checks, but in a bureaucratic failure to enforce the existing background check. States sometimes fail to submit or update their records with NICS, allowing for lapses in the background check system.

For private sales within the same state, including a gift, trade, loan, or reselling an old gun, the seller does not have to perform a background check. Some states with universal background check systems do require background checks on private sales.

To accurately address the second “loophole” Booker mentioned, it’s best to evaluate the “terrorist no-fly list” and the “gun show” loophole individually. First, there is no such thing as a “gun show loophole.” See above about FFL dealers, who even at gun shows must run background checks with the NICS.

Secondly, while it is true that inclusion on the FBI’s terrorist watch list would not prevent an individual from purchasing a gun, it doesn’t mean we are letting terrorists buy weapons, like Booker is implying.

First of all, there is no such thing as the “terrorist no-fly list” that Booker describes. What we do have is the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, which manages multiple watch lists, and does so in mostly secrecy. The largest one, Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, reportedly adds 20,000 people to its list every year, and totals are now suspected to be higher than 1.5 million people. Also, inclusion in that database does not mean an individual cannot fly. If being one of the million names on TIDE makes you a terrorist, then that’s a lot of known terrorists freely walking around.

We also know the FBI maintains a “No Fly List” and a “Selectee List,” but there is not much public information on how one gets placed on them, or how he or she can get removed. This is partially what makes them unconstitutional. The supposed standard for getting put on a list is “reasonable suspicion,” which could pretty much mean anything, from having facial hair to the color of your skin. And when an American is placed on one of these arbitrary lists, it’s done discreetly. An individual isn’t notified that he or she has been added, or given a reason why.

These are the types of due-process violations and discrimination battles that civil rights organizations like the ACLU have been fighting for decades. As more Democrats attempt to equate “No Fly” lists with “known terrorists,” it’s a battle that gun rights advocates are having to fight too. Creating such a law would mean allowing the government to strip the constitutional rights of anyone who is not even charged or alleged to have committed a crime (let alone terrorism), but simply suspected of being a criminal.

Booker is not the first, and certainly won’t be the last, Democratic presidential candidate to spread these myths about firearms and gun laws. Maybe Booker is a strategic campaigning genius, but it sure seems dicey to me to build a platform on abolishing laws that don’t exist.

"No, Omar And Ocasio-Cortez Are Not The Real Victims Of 9/11","The controversy over Rep. Ilhan Omar’s trivialization of the 9/11 attacks has continued unabated, with top Democrats like presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren claiming Omar is a victim and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi blasting President Trump for criticizing Omar.

For those on vacation last week, here are the comments that led to the current firestorm:

https://twitter.com/Imamofpeace/status/1115454942536327168

In recent days, we have been treated to the bizarre spectacle of leftists and media mouthpieces pretending that Omar’s reference to “some people” was no different than President George W. Bush standing atop the rubble of the World Trade Center promising justice for the nearly 3,000 people killed in the worst terror attack ever on American soil. Equally bizarre is the defense that these comments were less bad when heard in context. In reality, the comments are worse in context.

Omar’s dismissal of 9/11 as just “something” that happened was in service of the falsehood that the group to which she was speaking—the Council for American Islamic Relations (CAIR)—was founded after 9/11 to defend the civil liberties of American Muslims. But CAIR was founded in 1994. In context, Omar is downplaying mass murder in the service of suggesting that American Muslims were the real victims of 9/11.

The spike in reported hate crimes against Muslims after 9/11 was shameful. But it is possible to condemn those crimes without trivializing the terror attacks themselves, unless the agenda is something other than the truth.

The attempt to mythologize CAIR as a response to America’s post-9/11 bigotry is particularly odious in light of the organization’s true history. As federal district judge Jorge Solis found during the Holy Land Foundation (HLF) trials—the largest terrorism financing case in American history—the government “produced ample evidence to establish the association[] of CAIR… with HLF… and with Hamas” sufficient to name CAIR as an unindicted co-conspirator.

Our government did not designate HLF as a terror group until December 2001, but it designated Hamas in 1995. It has long been apparent what Hamas is. After 9/11, Hamas leader Sheikh Yassin said “no doubt this is a result of injustice the U.S practices against the weak in the world.”

Omar displayed a similar mindset in a recently surfaced 2013 interview. Here is the clip circulating on social media, in which Omar complains that people (one of her professors in particular) refer to al-Qaeda and Hezbollah with a weighty tone they do not give to America or our Army:

What kind of sick monster would find comedy in the words Al-Qaeda and Hezbollah and compare those two terrorist organizations to America and the U.S. Army? Rep. Ilhan Omar. That’s who. pic.twitter.com/YyyuddzGMi — ForAmerica (@ForAmerica) April 12, 2019

Omar and her defenders will claim the clip is taken out of context. But if you watch the entire interview, it is another case where the full context is worse. Omar makes clear she is making a general cultural observation. Moreover, the interview reveals she subscribes to the view that terrorism is simply a reaction to atrocities and oppression committed by governments, and faults those who do not view the subject this way (11:40-12:40).

Omar’s mentality manifests itself in her view of Israel, including her infamous anti-Semitic rant about Israel hypnotizing the world. It also manifests in her delusional view that where a socialist dictator like Nicolas Maduro is starving and abusing the people of Venezuela, the real fear is that America is plotting a right-wing coup by supporting a legitimate, democratic socialist alternative.

It more generally manifests in her apparent view that America was the villain during the Cold War. And it manifests in a speech to CAIR that suggests the real victims of 9/11 were not the 2,977 people who died, along with their families.

One fair point Omar made in the 2013 interview: it must be annoying as a Somali-American that she should be expected to condemn every incident of radical Islamic terrorism. This would have been and would be less of a problem if the left were not so often committed to denying the role a radical theology plays in groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. But the annoyance remains understandable.

Yet with Omar in particular, the annoyance is astoundingly hypocritical. She is entirely a creature of identity politics. She and her ilk routinely respond to criticism of her far-left, anti-Semitic agenda by accusing her critics of racism, sexism, and Islamophobia. She is greatly annoyed at having to say “not all Muslims,” but spends many of her waking hours spewing prejudiced views about Jews, Caucasians, men, Republicans, and so on.

Omar and her defenders have taken this approach to a new low with their monolithic assertion that Omar cannot be criticized because it threatens her life. Obviously, death threats against Omar, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or anyone else are to be condemned in the strongest terms.

Yet the idea that public officials should be immune from criticism simply because evil or mentally ill people exist in our world is profoundly undemocratic. Moreover, it is an assertion based in the guilt by association mentality that irks Omar so much when directed her way.

Furthermore, if this assertion were applied as a standard, supporters of Sanders, like Ocasio-Cortez, should still be keeping their mouths shut because a Bernie Bro attempted to assassinate a group of GOP representatives and seriously wounded Rep. Steve Scalise. Also given that there are far more reported hate crimes against Jews than Muslims in America, Omar should have resolved to remain silent in the wake of her string of anti-Semitic attacks on supporters of Israel and her support of the anti-Semitic boycott, divest, and sanctions movement.

Of course, the left would never accept their undemocratic claim as a universal standard because progressivism is not about standards. Rather it is the political version of Calvinball, where the “rules” change whenever it empowers the left. Omar trivializes a heinous act of terror to promote her politics of victimhood, but Republicans are the real villains for “pouncing” on it, i.e., criticizing her disgusting remarks.

Indeed, Ocasio-Cortez now wants to hide behind the notion that reminding people of the tragedy of the 9/11 attacks is wrong because it is “triggering”:

AOC on NY Post/Ilhan Omar front page: “We are getting to the level where this is an incitement of violence against progressive women of color and if they can’t figure out how to get it back to policy, we need to call it out for what it is because this is not normal.” pic.twitter.com/Zxad5H4I8n — Jason Donner (@jason_donner) April 11, 2019

No one on the right was rubbing the noses of leftists like Omar and Ocasio-Cortez in the 9/11 attacks until Omar decided to trivialize them and people like Ocasio-Cortez decided to defend Omar. “Never forget” is an entirely appropriate response, no matter how much the left wants to squeal about it.

The Moral Case For Israel Annexing The West Bank—And Beyond,"The April 2019 election victory for Benjamin Netanyahu will see him serve a record fifth term as Israeli prime minister and form a new right-wing coalition government. It also brings the promise of a commitment Netanyahu made to the nation during his campaign: That he would annex Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian territories.

Vowing to extend sovereignty without distinguishing between settlement blocks and the isolated settlements, Netanyahu promised not to transfer any sovereignty to the Palestinians. His victory in the elections will, hopefully, see the enactment of Netanyahu’s promise.

Israel has the moral right to annex all of the West Bank (even Area C) for a plethora of reasons.

Israel’s Mistake Was Allowing the Palestinian Pretense

Israel made an altruistic mistake toward the Palestinian people after the 1967 defensive war with Jordan. Rather than regard them as “war settlers” or refugees or, after legally occupying conquered territory, as “illegal occupants,” they made the Palestinian people their political and moral problem.

After victory, the “war settlers” could have been seen as enemies of the state: supporters of the Fatah (Palestine Liberation Organization) Charter, which basically calls for the end of Jewry in the region. Under a malevolent and illiberal regime, they would have been regarded and treated as such, not as Israel did treat them: as human beings with specific, inalienable rights.

Under a different set of political sensibilities, the Palestinian people would have been militarily removed from the area because, morally speaking, after the 1967 war, they never belonged there. The proper response from Israel should have been to immediately annex the land and make the people there the responsibility of their original political homeland: Jordan.

There can be no such thing as legitimate “Palestinian Territory” in a geographic region legally seized in a defensive war instigated by a foreign aggressor. The purpose of war is always to vanquish the enemy. The losers of the war cannot make demands on the victors that the victors themselves would not have been put in the position of meeting had the adversary or enemy not forced the victors into making it in the first place.

Israel was forced into a war, which it won. It was then expected to renounce and repudiate the consequences of its fairly won war by capitulating to the conditions of its vanquished enemy, which included, among other self-sacrificially undertaken goals, granting statehood, autonomy, right of return, and the ultimate elimination of Jewry from the region.

The Palestinian Authority Is a Terrible Government

Since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1994, Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) have enjoyed joint rule by Israeli military government and the Palestinian Authority with around 98 percent of the Palestinians living in areas under jurisdiction of the PA. In such areas, the PA has destroyed the freedom Palestinians enjoyed under Israeli rule and their economy through kleptocracy, corruption, nepotism, and authoritarian forms of governance subject to none of the checks and balances that characterize Israel’s Knesset.

Jewish exceptionalism and the exceptionalist nature of Jewish civilization require an unconditional space for the continued evolution of their civilization. What’s good for Jewish civilization is good for humanity at large. Jewish civilization is an international treasure trove that must be protected.

Not all cultures are indeed equal. Some are abysmally inferior and regressive based on their comprehensive philosophy and fundamental principles—or lack thereof—that guide or fail to protect the inalienable rights of their citizens.

Given the voting patterns of Palestinians—towards Islamicism and terrorist organizations for the most part—that openly advocate and work for Israeli and Jewish destruction and annihilation, a strong argument can and ought to be made to strip Palestinians of their right to vote—period. The regional hostilities towards Israel in the Middle East are such that Israel must take those threats seriously. It must work for a coalition of forces to neutralize them.

Israel Has Every Right to Defeat Terrorists

The Israeli left should abandon its agonistic handwringing over so-called Palestinian occupation and realize that applying Israeli law in Judea and Samaria, meaning the wholesale destruction of Hamas in Gaza—Hamas being a terrorist organization that can claim no rights as a group and no right to any square inch of land in the region—is an application of democratic law protecting the rights of the individuals who rightfully belong there.

Speaking of Gaza, although the strip was unilaterally relinquished, when one considers the reign of terror executed by the Hamas terrorists and the unadulterated illiberality of the movement itself, Israel has every moral right to wage a ruthless and unrelenting war against Hamas and to re-settle the land if it ever so desires.

America must also admit that it owes Israel political and financial reparations for America’s many decades of support of the PLO and the PA, which have pledged destruction to Israel, and have rejected all plausible peace offerings from Israel, preferring instead war and destruction.

This political and economic reparation would see the United States supplying Israel even more advanced military capabilities, and funding Israel’s military defense in any manner Israel deems necessary for its survival and unrivaled military status in the Middle East. Some may ask why this is necessary. The answer is two-fold.

Should a regional conflict between Israel and her Arab neighbors emerge, Israel will need to demonstrate extraordinary, excessive, and unprecedented military might in a manner that can act as a deterrent and, if necessary, to irrevocably destroy her offensive enemies.

Additional U.S. militarization of Israel is also moral in its execution. It sends a univocally clear message to the world that in any conflict between Israel and her adversaries, the United States stands willing and ready—along with her ally—to destroy any political agent that attacks the sovereignty of Israel. This is because Israel’s right to exist is non-negotiable and it has a right to unilaterally apply Israeli law over its nation-state.

Why Palestinians Have No Moral Authority

Continued militarization of Israel comprises protracted support of our political and moral alter-ego in the Middle East. The decline of the Palestinian people is narrated by their willful ideological malfeasance. They have never come into their own as a people largely because they have never explicitly held a philosophy that can support freedom, the basic liberal principles of individual rights, and a free market economy.

Given Fatah and Hamas’s genocidal aspirations toward Israel and universal Jewry and, in the case of Hamas, of a global caliphate, a moral goal would be to reverse the potential sovereignty of every Palestinian movement in the region. It ought to force Jordan to re-revoke its citizenship status of the Palestinian majority in Jordan.

A people that overwhelmingly approves of their terrorist leaders cannot be made to become citizens of any civilized country such as Israel.

The Palestinian terror war Fatah launched after the 2000 Camp David Peace Summit and unilaterally accepted by the Palestinian people places them in a precarious position. Whatever actions Israel or any of her allies take against them in a war against terror are their responsibility, and are moral. A people that overwhelmingly approves of their terrorist leaders cannot be made to become citizens of any civilized country such as Israel. No moral or political distinctions must be made between Fatah, Hamas, and the people who elect and or support them. No constituted people responsible for the election and appointment of terrorist actors can or should be entrusted with the responsibility of voting.

They constitute a national security threat to Israel because a core feature of their identity is a commitment to destroying Israel as a Jewish state. Therefore, only a policy of radical containment or expulsion remains a viable option. No state can obstruct the case for the achievement of its own justice and territorial safety by aiding and abetting its own destroyers. By making strategic alliances with ISIS, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations—should political expediency dictate such a move—we will witness the destruction of Jewish secularism in the region and religious militarization of the entire region.

One cannot admit anti-Semitics devoted to the destruction of Israel into the domain of Jewish civilization. There has to be some semblance of re-shaping the political sensibilities of those outside the historic process. If this is not possible, then we have to admit to their intrinsic humanity, but also, nevertheless, confess to their tragic status as political ballasts.

Islamic Terrorism Remains The World’s Greatest Threat To Peace,"After the horrific mass murder of 50 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand, there was widespread coverage and a torrent of mainstream news networks contemplating the threat of white supremacy. These conversations, completely reasonable and necessary in the face of violent attacks from a racist gunman, soon began deteriorating into politically motivated and specious claims contending that “white supremacy” had become the predominate terror threat in the world.

Well, the coordinated bomb blasts aimed at Christian worshippers on Easter Sunday, which killed at least 290 people and injured hundreds more, demonstrates the kind of meticulous planning, funding, resources, and support that is still exclusively the domain of radical Islamic terrorism. It’s not merely that the act was planned to maximize the death toll, but that it is a continuation of long-standing efforts by Islamists to destroy the Christian communities left in Asia.

Those who kill in the name of Islam are part of a worldwide, historic, ideological, and political movement that includes, to various degrees and various reasons, radicalized men and women from both great factions of the faith. Then again, terrorist groups—as well as their recruitment and propaganda outfits—are often functioning in Islamic regimes, which either actively sustain terror, tolerate these groups, or pay them off to engage in terrorism elsewhere.

The Christians who remain in the Islamic world are often oppressed in other ways. In a number of these nations, publicly praying in any faith but Islam is forbidden and, in many, converting to Christianity is still punishable by death. “Islamic extremism remains the global, dominant driver of persecution, responsible for initiating oppression and conflict in 35 of the 50 countries on the list,” according to Open Doors, a worldwide Christian group.

The idea that a similar threat exists in the West is risible.

There’s not a single Western country that doesn’t afford people of color or of other faiths the same exact rights it does all other citizens. No government on Earth supports white supremacy. There is no funding infrastructure for those who support white power. There is no Christian or Jewish denomination, or any notable political factions, in those nations that imbue white supremacy with any real theological or ideological legitimacy. There is no white supremacist government trying to obtain nuclear weapons, and none sending their terrorists to other countries. In the world’s free nations, including the United States, where any political party can participate in the process, the power of racist groups is minimal.

Yet the American left continues to downplay the danger, first by arguing that Islam has nothing to do with Islamic terrorism, then by lumping every white-skinned person who commits a terrorist act into one imaginary coherent political movement to contrast against it. It’s true that Americans have been spared much Islamic terror since 2002—a year that, curiously, nearly every graph media uses to measure domestic terrorism starts—but only because we’ve spent billions of dollars each year and immense resources, both in lives and treasure, keeping it out of the country and fighting it abroad.

Another reason the majority of Americans might not comprehend Islamic radicalism’s reach is the skewed intensity of the media coverage. Political correctness and a chilling fear of being labeled “Islamophobic” makes it difficult to honestly report on terrorism around the world.

In addition to the massacre this Easter in Sri Lanka, at least 200 Christian civilians have been murdered in Africa by Islamic militants thus far in 2019—many of them killed by machete, some by bombings. Many more Christians have been murdered during the past calendar year.

In November 2018, for example, 42 people were slaughtered in an attack on a Catholic mission in the Central African Republic. In October, 55 Christians were murdered by a group of Islamists in Nigeria. Another 29 were killed when 10 churches were burned down in Ethiopia last summer. Another seven Coptic Christians were gunned down in Egypt—and others spared only because of the good work of police.

There are pockets of racists in the world, and individuals who engage in terrible acts of violence against innocent people. These are dangerous men, capable of doing tremendous damage. But no group threatens global peace the same way that political Islam does. None has its reach or material and theological support. None has created more mayhem and death in the world since the end of the Cold War. The Sri Lankan massacre is just another harrowing reminder.

Designating The Muslim Brotherhood Signals Needed Policy Realignment,"In a scene straight out of North Lebanon, children in a school in Philadelphia were recently seen singing “Blood and Martyrs,” a song traditional to terrorist organizations like Hamas. This comes after Rep. Ilhan Omar claimed anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are two sides of the same coin, barely weeks after the deadliest terrorist attack in Asia, where more than 500 people were slaughtered in Sri Lanka after a coordinated Islamist attack, of which India and U.S. intelligence had warned.

In light of that, the Trump administration’s proposed designation of the Muslim Brotherhood as a terror organization is a recalibration of American foreign policy that has been a long time coming. According to the BBC, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed the plan, and said, “The President has consulted with his national security team and leaders in the region who share his concern, and this designation is working its way through the internal process.”

She also said this comes at a push from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has been a major influence and ally of the United States, as well as Israel, against the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas.

For years, regardless of Republican or Democrat governments, there was a utopian streak in American foreign policy that ignored realpolitik’s concern for national interest while pursuing “monsters to destroy.” Nowhere was this more visible than in the Middle East. For example, Damascus under Bashar al Assad, and Tripoli under Muammar Gaddafi, were the two governments that provided the most information against Islamist terrorists. Brutal though they may have been, they were secular, and were facing the same threat from al-Qaeda, like us.

Yet the first thing President Obama did after the Arab Spring was misunderstand the nature of the revolt. Put simply, we toppled the tyrants who were a bulwark against the terrorists. That same course carried on in Egypt, the historic ally of the West since 1979, as we saw a brief Muslim Brotherhood government after Hosni Mubarak was toppled in a revolt, which, among other things, saw a sexual assault on Lara Logan by the same people we were told were Madisonian democrats. If one calculated strategic mistakes, Obama’s naïve misunderstanding of the Arab Spring would rank among the top five in American history.

The potential designation of the Muslim Brotherhood as a terror organization is a needed corrective. It is not just a civil society group, which should be needless to mention.

A report by the Counter-Extremism Project states that “As the progenitor of the modern Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood (i.e. the Brotherhood) has had a profound influence on the belief system that fuels al-Qaeda and ISIS. These groups share ideological underpinnings based on the writings of the late Brotherhood ideologue Sayyid Qutb. The Brotherhood has also served as a bridge for young Islamists—including bin Laden, al-Baghdadi, and al-Zawahiri—to more violent jihadist groups. Although their execution strategies may differ, at their core, all three groups maintain a shared Islamist vision of establishing a global caliphate.”

That in itself has been a cause of discontent in the West. It is easy to ignore the Muslim Brotherhood, which enjoys the support of a section of the Middle Eastern population, but it is not just that. Western nongovernmental organizations and Islamist apologists, for example, get funded by organizations with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Reports suggest the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is heavily funded and tied to the Muslim Brotherhood, and in turn influences a lot of American debates on Islamism. The same is true for other Islamic organizations in the United States, which lobby freely. The Muslim American Society and CAIR are so toxic that even the United Arab Emirates designated them as terrorist organizations, on par with groups like Boko Haram and Al Shabab. Unfortunately, that didn’t stop Omar from speaking to and showing solidarity with CAIR.

Thankfully that is changing. One of Trump’s changes from the previous two administrations is the infusion of a bit of realism while dealing with Islamists. The engagement rules and strategy of dealing with ISIS changed, from Obama-era attrition to annihilation. More importantly, the change in grand strategy is more reflective of a new-age Kirkpatrick doctrine.

For the uninitiated, Jeane Kirkpatrick wrote an essay in 1979 that formed the baseline of the Reagan administration foreign policy. It said that for the greater good, sometimes one needs to align with dictators and totalitarians, if that provides stability against a greater evil.

The Trump administration’s alignment with al-Sisi of Egypt and Khalifa Haftar of Libya portrayed that recalibration. The days of utopian nation-building and democracy promotion to actors in regions that are fundamentally incapable of adopting such is over, and realpolitik is back. Secular tyrants and strongmen, while not ideal, are still a better alternative than chaos, anarchy, and terrorists filling a vacuum. In that sense, Trump is trotting a different path from both the Bush and the Obama administrations.

The bottom line is this. Dubbing the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization might be a controversial policy, but it serves a valuable purpose. It is better to be vigilant of those forces trying to destabilize the west from within than to spread values in foreign lands.

As Thomas Hegghammer wrote in his phenomenal paper, Islamism spreads through the available jihadi entrepreneurs, and clandestine actors. Put simply, agents and apologists within western societies are far more dangerous to overall security than are foreign jihadis.

Most of the families of ISIS terrorists, for example, who are currently rallying to bring back their jihadist relatives, knew about their deviant, anti-western, jihadist intentions. The insurgency attitude cannot survive without the knowledge of elders and guardians in traditionally tight-knit communities. And most of these community centers, lobby groups, NGOs, and so forth have ties to organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood.

Political Islam remains a potent enemy of the Western lifestyle and values, and marking them as enemy agents sheds further light on these people, their activities, and their political backers. Americans have a right to know which politicians, and which NGOs and lobby groups, promote what in their society.

Rep. Ilhan Omar Supports Group That Produced Child Beheading Skit,"Shocking footage uncovered by the Investigative Project last week shows a skit produced by the Muslim American Society (MAS) in Philadelphia showing children calling for martyrdom as soldiers in the “army of Allah” and threatening to behead their enemies and subject them to “eternal torture” to wrest Jerusalem from Jewish control.

The horrific MAS-Philly children’s skit was posted to their Facebook page and shows a choreographed production as part of the group’s April 17th “Ummah Day” pageant dedicated to supporting jihad to control Palestine. A MAS statement on Friday said the songs and poems the children recited exhorting violence and terrorism were an “unintended mistake” and attributed the incident to a vetting error.

MAS has 42 chapters across the United States. A 1997 FBI file obtained by Judicial Watch identifies MAS as the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States controlled by Hamas sympathizers “known to conduct firearms and other military type training.” A Justice Department filing (p. 58, fn. 13) in a terrorism-related case states that “MAS was founded as the overt arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in America.” A September 2004 Chicago Tribune investigative report revealed that MAS had been founded by Muslim Brotherhood leaders, adopted the group’s strict code for secrecy, and promoted Islamic supremacy.

The article interviewed one former MAS member who explained the group’s vision for Islamic rule in America: “It would convert Americans to Islam and elect like-minded Muslims to political office.” Even more shocking is that freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D–MN), of other recent controversies, has openly supported MAS.

In fact, Omar’s support for MAS goes back years. Her deep ties to the group were on display when she had the MAS-Minnesota chapter Oresident Asad Zaman stand with her as she was ceremonially sworn into the Minnesota House of Representatives in January 2017 with her hand on an enormous Quran. MAS held a reception in honor of her inauguration.

Just a few months later, Omar spoke at the 2017 MAS “Muslim Day” at the state capitol, acknowledging that she had previously participated in the group’s annual event before. Omar was subsequently elected to Congress in November 2018, succeeding former representative and now Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who had his own ties to MAS.

In fact, Ellison was the subject of a House Ethics investigation after MAS-Minnesota paid for his 16-day trip to Mecca in 2008. At first, Ellison had attempted to conceal the sponsors of the trip, and a senior MAS official had initially denied the group’s involvement.

The MAS-Minnesota chapter both Omar and Ellison have supported has a long history of controversy. The group gained national attention in 2007 when they issued a fatwa authorizing Muslim taxi cab drivers at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to deny service to non-Muslim passengers with seeing-eye dogs or who were carrying alcohol.

As I reported in May 2009, the MAS-Minnesota’s Vice President Hassan Mohamud had published a YouTube fundraising video decrying the “hell of living in America,” and had defended Palestinian suicide attacks. When questioned by the local Minneapolis Fox News affiliate about his remarks, Mohamud claimed that he didn’t mean anything anti-American by describing the United States as “hell.” When asked about his statements in support of suicide bombings, he had to stop the interview on three separate occasions and consult with his attorney.

That incident was shortly after a local Somali reporter had identified Mohamud and his mosque as radicalization incubators following the disappearance of dozens of young Somali men, who left the country for Somalia to join the Al-Shabaab terrorist group. In an interview with USA Today, Mohamud denied any radical preaching or that any of the terror recruits had been involved in his mosque.

Yet Mohamud was again tied to a terror recruiting case after five men from the Twin Cities were arrested attempting to fly to Turkey to join the Islamic State in Syria. In March 2016, Justice Department prosecutors asked the court to disqualify Mohamud from the defense team of one of the men, telling the judge that they intended to introduce testimony during the trial of a witness claiming Mohamud had been preaching jihad and making other extremist statements. This disclosure prompted another member of the defense team to move to withdraw from the case.

This raises questions about why Omar has openly supported an organization with a long reported record of supporting terrorism and violence, as exhibited most recently by the shocking children’s pageant in Philadelphia last month. When she previously accused American Jews of dual loyalties, drawing accusations of anti-Semitism by leading Democrats, why would she have willingly associated herself with an organization that the FBI has identified for at least two decades as a front for the Muslim Brotherhood?

Rashida Tlaib Is Pushing A Terrorist Narrative About Israel,"Rep. Rashida Tlaib, along with 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, have accused Republicans of taking Tlaib’s comments about the Holocaust “out of context.” The problem is, when you put Tlaib’s remarks in the proper context, they’re far worse.

The most generous possible reading of Tlaib is that, in a discussion about why she opposes a two-state solution, she was trying to credit Palestinians for providing Jews a “safe haven,” and saying she’s proud of that—not just proud, but that it gives her a “calming feeling,” because at least her Palestinian ancestors tried to help.

The problem with such a reading is that as matter of history, it’s simply untrue, even laughable, as the Washington Examiner’s Philip Klein notes in a thorough fisking and my colleague David Harsanyi argues here. (The grand mufti of Jerusalem during World War II was a Nazi collaborator, for crying out loud.)

But no one really believes Tlaib was trying to argue that Palestinians gave Jews safe haven after the Holocaust. The Democratic congresswoman from Michigan can’t be wholly ignorant of the history of the modern Middle East, and especially the role Arabs played before, during, and after the Holocaust. So far from offering Jews a safe haven, Palestinian Arabs rejected the United Nation’s partition plan in 1947, surrounded Jewish villages, cut off their food and water, and started massacring them.

Like everyone else, Tlaib knows this. She also knows she can’t give her Palestinian forebears credit for helping the Jews while also casting them as victims of Jewish predation. By trying to have it both ways, Tlaib was actually doing something more subtle and insidious than historical revisionism with these remarks: she was mixing western and terrorist narratives about the creation of Israel.

Tlaib said, “I love the fact that it was my ancestors that provided that [a safe haven for the Jews]… But they did it in a way that took their human dignity away and it was forced on them.” The idea that the Jews took the “human dignity” of Palestinians, stole “their land,” and wiped out their “existence” is of course what Palestinian leaders like Yasser Arafat and terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah have always maintained. It is the controlling narrative of their cause.

It’s why Hamas calls for the destruction of Israel under its rallying cry, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” It’s why Hezbollah ambushes Israeli soldiers. It’s why Arafat walked away from Camp David in 2000 and launched the Second Intifada, which killed a thousand Israelis over the next three years.

Unlike Omar, Tlaib Knows Exactly What She’s Saying

This isn’t the first time Tlaib has adopted the terrorist narrative about Israel. When Hamas militants in Gaza launched hundreds of rockets and mortars into Israel earlier this month, and Israel responded with airstrikes, Tlaib accused Israel of targeting “Palestinian children and families.”

When will the world stop dehumanizing our Palestinian people who just want to be free? Headlines like this & framing it in this way just feeds into the continued lack of responsibility on Israel who unjustly oppress & target Palestinian children and families. #FreePalestine https://t.co/p3X3j8WtwM — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) May 5, 2019

Another way of putting it is that Tlaib thinks Israeli self-defense is terrorism, which has always been the justification for violence against Jews in the Middle East.

Her choice of words here isn’t accidental, just as her commentary on the Holocaust wasn’t as entirely as incoherent as it seemed (the fantastical version of history notwithstanding). The narrative that Israel is unjustly “occupying” Palestine and “oppressing” the Palestinians is commonplace on American college campuses no less than among the Justice Democrats in Congress. It’s the basis of the boycott, divest, and sanction (BDS) movement that a number of left-wing Democrats, including Tlaib and Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, support.

One aspect of this narrative, best articulated in Columbia University historian Rashid Khalidi’s book, “Iron Cage,” is the notion that Palestinians were wrong to have accommodated Jews in the decades leading up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War—what the Palestinians call al nakba, the “catastrophe”—and that they should have fought them instead. This is what Tlaib seems to be referring to when she says the Palestinians “lost their land and some lost their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity, their existence in many ways… all of it was in the name of trying to create a safe haven for Jews.”

Much has been made of Omar’s anti-Semitic remarks that almost drew a formal censure from Democratic leaders in the House earlier this year. But Tlaib’s anti-Semitism is much more dangerous than Omar’s. Whereas Omar seems to be repeating left-wing shibboleths without fully understanding what she’s saying, resulting in her having to issue multiple apologies, Tlaib knows exactly what she’s saying.

That’s why she’s doubled down on her Holocaust comments instead of issuing an apology or trying to clarify what she means. In this case, a lack of clarity serves her purpose well. It allows her, no less than Democratic leaders, to deflect criticism by claiming her words are being taken “out of context” while couching her views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in an incoherent historical commentary.

But the proper context for these remarks is only too obvious, and it leads to the equally obvious conclusion that Tlaib’s views on Israel more or less align with those of Hamas and Hezbollah, groups that also oppose a two-state solution.

"At Democrats’ Behest, Terrorist-Friendly Imam Gives Prayer In Congress","Last week, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D–CA) introduced Texas-based imam Omar Suleiman to deliver the noon prayer in the House of Representatives. The imam had been invited by Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D–TX).

But the choice was far from benign. Suleiman has a long history of advocating for the destruction of the state of Israel, home to half of the world’s Jews. In 2014, he posted on Twitter celebrating a possible Third Intifada. For those unfamiliar with the nature of recent intifadas, they generally are marked by a series of terror attacks against Israeli civilians, goaded on by the terrorist group Hamas.

Unsurprisingly, Suleiman has also expressed support for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, sharing a video on his Facebook in 2015 that compared Israelis to Nazis. He has also referred to Zionists as “enemies of God.”

Suleiman’s social media activity is not confined to support for the destruction of the Jewish state. Suleiman has also posted at least one image in support of the Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood, an organization Sen. Ted Cruz and others have fought to designate as a terrorist group for its interest in establishing sharia under the auspices of a global caliphate. The Trump administration is in the process of making that terrorist designation. The Muslim Brotherhood has various offshoots throughout the Muslim world, including Hamas, the terrorist group that seeks genocide against the Jews and violently oppresses Palestinian Arabs living in the Gaza Strip.

This is the individual Pelosi decided was appropriate to introduce to deliver the noon prayer. Whether the invitation was the result of a deliberate choice or merely “failed vetting,” Democrats’ continued fraternization with those advocating for the destruction of the world’s only Jewish state speaks volumes about the far left’s capacity to swallow the party.

As Rep. Lee Zeldin (R–NY) pointed out following Suleiman’s prayer, with regards to anti-Semitism, “You should be more sensitive to it, not less sensitive. You’re seeing a desensitizing right now that is hugely dangerous if that takes over more and more of the Democratic Party.”

As I have written several times in the past, criticism of Israeli policy is a healthy exercise; advocating for the eradication of an entire country is not. The recent invocation Suleiman delivered reveals much of the left’s willingness to normalize a radical position, one that favors the destruction of one of our strongest allies.

I will not call anti-Zionism a “political position,” because I don’t believe an ideology that resurrects Nazi imagery should be granted legitimacy. Meanwhile, House Democrats are seeking to do just that.

The Corbynization of much of the American left has occurred with particular alacrity following the induction of freshmen Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D–MI), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D–NY), and Ilhan Omar (D–MN), but it has been given the leeway to foment under Pelosi. The left continues to offer a safe haven for those who spew vitriolic hate towards the Jewish state, all while lecturing Americans about the perils of anti-Semitism. This reeks of the utmost hypocrisy.

How To Make Sure Terrorists Like John Walker Lindh Don't Stay A Threat,"The May 23 release from federal prison of John Walker Lindh, the so-called “American Taliban” captured on a smoking Afghanistan battlefield right after 9/11, put as much chill in the air as the unchaining of serial killers Ted Bundy or Charles Manson would.

His release into American society amid reports that Lindh had, during his 17-year penance behind bars in Indiana, preserved his commitment to violent Islamist jihad, raised an obvious question: What have American homeland security and law enforcement done to ensure Lindh won’t use his newfound freedom to act on his religious commitment to kill infidels?

The unfortunate answer is that America is pretty much at the mercy of released former (or formerly incarcerated, at least) terrorists. I know this from my government experience with this very issue as a homeland security intelligence practitioner in Texas, where a significant number of individuals convicted as a result of terrorism investigations served their proscribed time and were released.

Here are some takeaways from my experience:

A majority of terrorism convictions after 9/11 landed prison sentences of less than 10 years, so Lindh is far from the first to be released into society—only one of the most publicly prominent.

Despite years of such releases, neither the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, nor any government agency, systematically tracks or studies terrorism recidivism so that risk can be assessed and programs implemented to reduce it. Therefore, no one really knows how many have recommitted or, among those who have, what the consequences have been.

Once terrorist convicts are released, neither the FBI nor the Department of Homeland Security have the legal footing to expend resources to surveil or otherwise track them without criminal predicate or probable cause.

Federal parole officers are currently the only (and best-positioned) law enforcement officers to monitor for the potentially criminal behavior of released terrorist convicts often serving some years on “supervised release,” or court-ordered probation. Violations of probation terms can mean a return to prison for the convict, and even justify a fresh FBI counterterrorism investigation. However, most federal parole officers are overworked and overburdened with non-terrorist convicts and are not equipped to look at their terrorist convicts in any concerted way, even if some do out of conscience.

Beyond federal parole officers, no other law enforcement agencies are informed that terrorist convicts are being released into their jurisdictions.

Is Recidivism a Problem for Once-Incarcerated Terrorists?

According to one 2017 count by George Washington University, 450 people of an average age of 27 are currently incarcerated for terrorism-related crimes, serving an average of 13 years in prison. (Many people had already served their times and gained release before that count took place, so those numbers might be artificially low.)

It may well be that the recidivism risk is fairly low or moderate, but it’s hard to say. Any effort to count is hobbled by the fact that no government agency has systematically paid attention to terrorist recidivism or apparently thought much about mechanisms to monitor convicts post-release in a way that would provide meaningful intelligence in a lawful manner.

A decade after 9/11, one Naval Postgraduate School researcher attempted an “extensive” effort to assess the threat and to identify locations of released terrorist convicts. In his master’s degree thesis “Freed: Ripples of the Convicted and Released Terrorist in America,” Michael A. Brown came away with “an evidentiary black hole.” He had no choice but to conclude that “we do not know if convicted or released terrorists present a threat,” that there was no defined entity responsible for convicted and released terrorists, and that convicted terrorists are treated no differently than most convicted criminals after they are released.

It should go without saying that past behavior is not always an indicator of future behavior. Knee-jerk assumptions about an unquantified danger are not warranted. Those released who have served their legal obligations to pay for their crimes have a right to reset as productive citizens, unmolested by any unusual law enforcement pressure. Some convicted terrorists will have learned their lessons or unwound their religious zeal for the jihad behind bars.

A good number who are foreign nationals will be deported as soon as they finish their terms, so no problem for the homeland there. Others are providing considerable assistance to counterterror investigations, such as some of the Lackawanna Six. Still others, if they do recommit, might do so with money and material rather than bombs and bloodshed.

On the other hand, we know that some former terrorism prisoners recommit in other parts of the world with plenty of bombs and bloodshed—and in the United States. In 2017, a report by The Washington Institute concluded that the Bureau of Prisons fields no terrorism disengagement programs inside its facilities, meaning local communities have no idea whether they are receiving a die-hard or reformed terrorist.

Do We Have Any Reliable Data?

The most studied and reliable recidivism data involving terrorist detainees involves those released from the U.S. military’s Guantanamo Bay base, often to third-country rehabilitation programs. As of 2012, at the height of President Barack Obama’s effort to empty the facility of terrorists captured abroad, about a third of the 676 former detainees did so or were suspected of “reengaging,” according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Some convicted terrorists in the United States have recommitted and landed back in prison, even if all that is publicly known about these is purely anecdotal. For instance, Garland, Texas attacker and Islamic State sympathizer Elton Simpson was convicted in 2010 of lying to FBI agents conducting a counterterror investigation into his plans to join the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab. He was given three years’ probation and released, as we are well aware now, to go on to die in the Texas attack.

Georgia resident Abdelghani Meskini, convicted as a co-conspirator in the December 1999 Millennium Bombing plot, was released in 2005. But he was re-incarcerated in 2010 for purchasing an AK-47-style rifle after conducting research on al-Qaida recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki, local U.S. military installations, gun stores, and the November 2009 Fort Hood, Texas, shootings, according to court records from the second case. Thankfully, we won’t ever know how much blood he might have shed.

But we do know in the case of Seattle, Washington, resident Ali Mohammad Brown. He went on a jihad-inspired murder spree that claimed four victims across the country in 2014 and 2015, after a 2005 conviction on bank fraud charges related to a scheme to fund al-Shabab, for which he served time in federal prison. Authorities had lost track of Brown in the years since his release.

So we know recidivism is happening and can happen, especially with convicts less publicly known than Lindh, who will no doubt have eyes on him in some form.

What to Do about Lingering Terrorist Threats

Since the question is raised in so public a fashion with Lindh’s release, America’s homeland security enterprise may be more open to suggestions as to how to reduce risk. Agencies should do these things right away, at least:

Conduct a comprehensive government study, preferably headed by the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice, quantifying how many recidivists are in custody and how they ended up back behind bars, as well as to account for the number of released inmates who did not re-offend after five years.

Require the U.S. Probation Officer corps to systematically account for terrorist convicts it supervises and establish requirements for intelligence collection above and beyond the regimen of monitoring ordinary criminals, to meet the much-different needs of FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces. Probation officers should be given access to additional resources for this effort to include the intelligence analysts of other agencies and classified data systems. One consideration is to draw on the resources of local fusion centers.

Establish a mechanism to alert local community law enforcement when a terrorist convict is to be released, especially those still showing interest in violence during their last months in prison, and ensure that each remains on the U.S. terrorism watch list.

It’s almost certain that however Lindh is monitored will be ad hoc. The time has long since passed for ad hoc approaches to counterterrorism as more and more Lindhs get released into our communities.

Whether The Media Adores Intel Agencies Depends On Who’s President,"Media’s heart and soul is partisanship. When journalists appeal to principle, they are faking a moral identity for the sake of their political agenda.

Consider The Daily Beast’s attack last weekend upon a private citizen. They investigated and shamed him just because he shared a slowed-down video excerpt of Democratic Party leader Nancy Pelosi (which you can slow down yourself). The journalist who attacked this private citizen is a known felon.

Bad faith underlies much news reporting, not just occasional abuses like this one. For example, the media’s attitude toward government accountability hinges upon the current president’s party affiliation. Specifically, contrast media’s present opposition to investigating intelligence agencies for spying on Americans versus their decades-long persecution of intelligence agencies for interrogating foreign terrorists.

Today, media weep crocodile tears for intelligence agencies. They accuse the attorney general of politicizing intelligence. They bemoan agency morale. They say lives are at stake. They claim it is an abuse of power and a threat to national security for the president to declassify public records about intelligence agencies spying on Americans. They call the investigation a corrupt propaganda exercise and “an escalation of the president’s yearslong assault on the intelligence community.”

Yet media are the undisputed champions of corrupt propaganda and of waging such “yearslong assaults.” For most of this century, they demonized American intelligence agents for waterboarding foreign terrorists in pursuit of information. Media called them “torturers” and compared them to Japanese war criminals. They urged President Obama to criminally prosecute elected officials, civil servants, lawyers, and even medical doctors at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

Few accused President Obama of threatening national security when the president declassified top-secret documents about CIA interrogation methods. And few mourned agency morale when the president imprisoned a CIA whistle-blower who hadn’t even done the waterboarding.

Why was the news media unconcerned about intelligence workers’ morale under Presidents Bush and Obama? And why is the news media more upset about intelligence agents abusing foreign terrorists than about intelligence agents abusing American citizens?

The difference, of course, is partisan. These media supported President Obama, a Democrat, even when the president condemned intelligence agencies over their treatment of foreign terrorists. And they attack President Trump, a Republican, even when the president investigates the intelligence agencies over its treatment of Americans.

Likewise, under President Bush, a Republican, media hated the CIA’s interrogation program, while under President Obama, media were nonchalant about the president’s “kill list.” The president bombed foreign terrorists and their families—even targeting a U.S. citizen teenager—instead of merely capturing and interrogating them.

To be sure, President Obama was correct to kill terrorists in defense of the United States. Accordingly, President Obama should not have chastised Americans who interrogated these same people for that same purpose under President Bush. It is absurd to support bombing suspected terrorists off a “kill list” but object to waterboarding suspected terrorists in pursuit of information.

U.S. intelligence agents risked their lives and freedom to capture and interrogate terrorists. We owe these agents our gratitude. And we owe nothing to al-Qaeda terrorists our government has killed or interrogated: not even a word of apology or regret, however insincere.

But, of course, the American people deserve to know what’s being done in their name. Hence the value of the whistle-blower who confirmed that the CIA waterboarded foreign terrorists in pursuit of information. President Obama thanked this whistle-blower by throwing him in jail; President Trump should pardon him, instead.

Punishing intelligence agents for protecting America from actual foreign terrorists, and for informing Americans about it, is peak ingratitude. It’s also dangerous. When intelligence agents choose to bomb terrorists, or merely interview them instead of capturing and exhaustively interrogating them, then it becomes slightly easier for terrorists to compartmentalize their most valuable information: the information they might only forfeit at their wits’ end, if at all. Information gathered under the CIA’s interrogation programs even contributed to the intelligence that led the United States to Osama bin Laden.

Intelligence agencies’ worst misconduct under this interrogation program was to spy on the Democrats in Congress who were investigating it. CIA agents read Senate emails. The CIA used a fake identity to gain access to Senate computers. CIA agents also sent false information to the Justice Department, hoping that it would result in criminal indictments. CIA Director John Brennan falsely denied the affair.

Regardless, since such spying happened under President Obama, few called for Brennan’s resignation—let alone for impeaching the president. After all, it wasn’t a partisan issue, but merely an ethical one, so it was easy to ignore.

The fruits of that ignorance are obvious. Before spying on Congress, President Obama’s administration had first gotten away with targeting grassroots activists through the Internal Revenue Service. After jailing the CIA whistleblower, the Obama administration also scapegoated and imprisoned a YouTuber, punishing his free speech. Then the White House spied on Congress again, targeting opponents of its nuclear giveaway to Iran, and spying on American supporters of Israel more generally.

Eventually the Obama administration spied on the Republican presidential campaign under fake pretenses while excusing actual criminality by the Democratic candidate. Weaponizing the government against its political opponents had become a yearslong habit. And when Obama’s FBI failed to rig the 2016 presidential election, their “insurance policy“ targeted the new president-elect and his transition team instead, fishing for an impeachment referral.

We do not have a constitutional republic if federal police censor, surveil, entrap, and imprison dissenters, then insubordinate themselves to successive presidents. But not everyone wants a constitutional republic. Hence the media’s apparent yearning for a one-party system of government and its penchant for punishing thought crime among private citizens. Although we cannot force the media to genuinely appreciate civil liberties or attempt objectivity in news reporting, we can at least call them out when they fake it.

The Iran Deal Echo Chamber's Lies Prove Trump Is Right To Renegotiate,"The latest act of brazen aggression in the Gulf of Oman has once again put the spotlight on the debate about the Trump administration’s policy toward Iran. The attack on two oil tankers, reportedly by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, removed doubt that Tehran is hoping to inflame the fears of Americans and Europeans that President Donald Trump’s efforts to pressure Iran into re-negotiating the nuclear deal it concluded with the Obama administration is leading inevitably to war.

But to understand how the West found itself essentially being blackmailed by the world’s leading state sponsor of terror, it is necessary to go back to how the deal Trump scrapped was both sold to the American public and defended afterward.

The Obama Administration’s Web of Lies

Last week, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations reported that the Obama administration gave Iran access to U.S. banks to convert $5.7 billion in assets. This came after then Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew promised Congress that the Iranians would not be allowed to use the U.S. financial system. Only a few months after Lew and his aides made that pledge, his department issued a license authorizing the conversion of Iranian assets and encouraged American banks to take part in the scheme.

The Senate report also reveals that the Obama administration helped encourage foreign banks to aid the Iranians, then promised those involved that they need fear nothing more than a wrist slap when they violated U.S. sanctions.

We already knew about other deceptions involved in passing the nuclear deal. There were the side deals on inspections that weakened the already shaky monitoring of Iran’s nuclear program and were hidden from Congress. And then there was the infamous flight of a U.S. plane to Tehran loaded with $400 million in foreign currency as ransom payments, as well as two further flights containing $1.3 billion in cash.

Letting Terrorists Off to Protect Other Terrorists

The administration also quashed a federal drug probe into $1 billion per year in narcotics smuggling operated by Hezbollah in Latin America. We didn’t learn about that until it was revealed in a Politico Magazine expose in December 2017.

Nor was the Obama administration the only government telling lies about Iran to safeguard the nuclear deal. Last week, Britain’s Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that in 2015, Hezbollah operatives were caught stockpiling explosives in London. The Iranian-backed terrorist group had more than three tons of ammonium nitrate, the same bomb ingredients used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.

Thankfully, the bomb factory was discovered before Tehran’s agents could perpetrate another mass murder. But the one person arrested in connection with the plot was never charged and ultimately released. Just as important, the British public and members of Parliament, who were then debating whether to ban Hezbollah as a terror organization, was never informed of what had happened.

Why? The Iran nuclear deal had just been implemented a few months earlier and then Prime Minister David Cameron and then Home Minister Theresa May, who was in charge of security matters in the U.K., were more concerned with not implicating Tehran in threats to the West than in telling the truth about its role in international terrorism.

But as far as most of the anti-Trump “resistance” or its cheerleaders in the mainstream media are concerned, all we’ve heard about the London Hezbollah plot, the Treasury Department’s lies, and the other stories are crickets.

Yes, This Still Matters Today

Still, some would ask why any of this matters now? Obama’s been out of office for years. The same is true from Cameron, and May is about to join him in retirement.

But the efforts by Obama and our European allies to deceive the world both about what they were doing to appease the Iranians and Iran’s involvement in international terrorism and crime are not ancient history or irrelevant efforts to chip away at the reputation of Trump’s predecessor. To the contrary, they matter very much to the discussion about the efforts to tighten sanctions on Iran and to force it to renegotiate the nuclear deal.

That is important because the pact not only provided Tehran a financial windfall that helped them finance Hezbollah and other terrorist groups, but it also gave the Islamist regime a path to an eventual nuclear weapon once the agreement expires in 2025.

The lies told by Obama, Lew, Secretary of State John Kerry, Energy Secretary Ernest Moritz, and Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes (the latter two promised “anytime, anywhere” inspections of Iranian sites that never happened) about Iran was a dismal chapter in American political history. But those deceptions should also inform our discussion of whether their legacy achievement should be preserved, especially when the Iran regime is using terrorism to try to intimidate the West to keep doing business with it.

The Iran Deal Made the World Worse Off

President Obama said the deal gave Iran a chance to “get right with the world.” But instead it gave Iran a green light to step up its support of terror, allowing it to launch a war in Yemen and to aid terror groups that have missiles aimed at Israeli cities, as part of its ambition for regional hegemony.

Democrats and other Obama apologists and Trump critics say the deal still did what it set out to do by preventing Iran from going nuclear. But that, too, was a lie since the deal allowed Tehran to keep its most advanced technology and gave it a path to a weapon once the sunset clauses kicked in.

Obama’s failure in the negotiations made it imperative for his successors to correct his mistakes and to force Iran back to the table, where it must be stripped of its nuclear options and ability to fund terror. Trump has, to the chagrin of Obama’s old media “echo chamber,” made real progress toward that end with re-imposed sanctions that have brought Iran’s economy to a standstill, starved terrorists like Hezbollah of funds, and prevented the Europeans from giving it a way to evade them.

Democratic Presidential Candidates Still Clueless

So when nearly every Democratic presidential candidate vows to bring the United States back into the nuclear deal and lift the sanctions, they are not only planning to empower and enrich Iran, they are also, in effect, owning the lies that were the foundation of Obama’s effort to sell it to the American people. When Democrats like South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg misrepresent the pact with Iran as a victory for U.S. policy, he is following in the footsteps of Rhodes and others who misrepresented it from beginning until now.

To declare, as Buttigieg did last week in a foreign policy speech, that Trump’s policy of calling Iran’s bluff and forcing it to finally surrender its nuclear ambitions and terror funding is a prescription for endless war not only would grant the ayatollahs an undeserved victory but also further embolden the same people allegedly blowing up tankers in the Gulf of Oman. As Trump has proved, the choice here is not the false one offered by Obama between appeasement and war, but one of surrender or sanctions backed up by the threat of force that can achieve American goals without undue bloodshed.

If we don’t hear much about efforts to stifle the truth for the sake of bolstering the rogue regime in Tehran, it’s because Obama’s old media allies and his Democratic heirs are no more interested in the truth about the deal or Iran now that Trump’s pressure is succeeding than they were a few years ago. Yet it is precisely the truth about Iranian activities and Obama’s deceptions that can help us understand why Trump’s effort to scrap the deal is correct.

Federal Prosecutor Confirms Ratcliffe Role In Holy Land Foundation Case,"A former federal prosecutor involved in the terrorism financing trial against the Holy Land Foundation confirmed to The Federalist today that Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, whom President Donald Trump has said he intends to nominate as director of national intelligence, did receive a special appointment as part of the case.

“John was appointed to look into allegations of potential misconduct involving a juror and one or more of the defendants in that case,” Nathan Garrett, a formal federal prosecutor who worked on the trial team, told The Federalist Tuesday morning. “John is a stellar lawyer, experienced national security prosecutor and leader, and a man of the highest character.”

ABC News alleged in an article that Ratcliffe “misrepresented” and “embellished” his role in the case, even suggesting that he was not involved with it at all.

“ABC News could find no public court records that connect Ratcliffe to either of the two trials for the case,” the article claimed. “Former officials directly involved in the decade-long Holy Land Foundation investigation could not recall Ratcliffe having any role, and four former defense attorneys who served on the cases told ABC News on Monday they had no recollection of Ratcliffe being involved with any of the proceedings that resulted in the convictions of their clients.”

Garrett, who is listed on the federal court docket for the Holy Land Foundation case as one of the prosecutors of record representing the United States, told The Federalist that ABC News never contacted him for comment prior to publishing its article.

“No,” he responded when asked directly whether anyone from ABC News contacted him about its story.

He also noted it is not surprising that Ratcliffe’s role would not have been public at the time, given the sensitive nature of terrorism cases.

“I served as a ‘terrorism prosecutor’ before and after 9/11, and 98% of the work in that arena never saw the light of day,” Garrett said. “Folks like John were thrust into what had traditionally been an intelligence community-only environment and expected to engage and provide leadership and perspective as those matters progressed.”

“It was trial by fire, and he handled it exceedingly well, albeit outside of the public eye,” Garrett said.

The former federal prosecutor and FBI special agent also offered a personal endorsement of Ratcliffe’s nomination and confirmation as director of national intelligence.

“In my 20 years in the business, there’s no one I believe more capable of this position than John,” he said.

On July 28, Trump announced via Twitter that he intended to nominate Ratcliffe to replace former Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., as director of national intelligence following Coats’ retirement on Aug. 15.

Ratcliffe has drawn the ire of left-wing conspiracy theorists who have for years claimed, without evidence, that Trump treasonously colluded with the Russian government to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who was appointed as special counsel in May of 2017 to investigate allegations of treasonous Russian collusion, found there was no collusion or conspiracy with Russians to steal the 2016 elections.

Ratcliffe has repeatedly said the American public deserves to know who was behind the conspiracy theory and whether they weaponized false information to spy on American citizens in the heat of a political campaign.

A spokeswoman for Ratcliffe’s congressional office also confirmed Ratcliffe’s role in the Holy Land Foundation case.

“Shortly following a declared mistrial in a terrorism financing prosecution, United States v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, et al. in the Northern District of Texas on Oct. 22, 2007, a Justice Department order appointed U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas John Ratcliffe to investigate issues related to the outcome of the Holy Land case,” she told The Federalist.

“Department of Justice records will confirm that as both chief of anti-terrorism and national security for the Eastern District of Texas and as U.S. attorney, John Ratcliffe opened, managed, and supervised numerous domestic and international terrorism-related cases.”",https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/30/former-federal-prosecutor-confirms-rep-john-ratcliffes-role-in-holy-land-foundation-case/,2019-07-30
"No, Anti-Terrorism Hasn’t Hurt Investigations Of White Supremacists","AUSTIN, Texas — Earlier this summer, I testified before a U.S. House subcommittee on “FBI efforts to combat an increasing threat of white supremacy and white extremism.” My expertise is that of a former counterterrorism intelligence manager for the Texas Department of Public Safety, where for nearly a decade (2009-2018) my team of analysts worked on domestic and international terrorism matters with the FBI as part of one of the nation’s largest multi-agency fusion centers.

The House Democrats of the Oversight and Reform Committee came to the hearing with a narrative: that white nationalist President Donald Trump had suppressed national investigative efforts that would hurt his friends and supporters in the white supremacy movement.

I testified to a contrary experience in Texas coordinating intelligence with our state criminal investigative agents, who were assigned to all five of the state’s FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, usually to domestic terrorism squads working on problems that included violent white supremacy, black identity nationalism, and the anarchist Antifa movement.

“Neither we nor the FBI ever dismissed the domestic extremist threat or violent white supremacists, as some suggest, but faced them at every turn during my service,” I testified, in part. “I personally saw to it that some of my analysts were always dedicated to this threat problem. What I can tell you from my experience is that our collaborative arrangements remained in place after the 2016 election. At the line level, we created intelligence, passed information to the FBI on the e-Guardian system or in person, and filled their requests for their case needs. Good things happened as a result.”

I stand by that. In the aftermath of this past weekend’s mass shootings, another form of the narrative is finding purchase: that strong post-9/11 efforts to counter Islamist terrorism are politically and racially inequitable compared to the weak, suppressed efforts to counter violent white nationalism.

As the editorial board of The New York Times put it Sunday, “There are serious questions about how the United States has approached Islamic extremism, but if even a degree of that vigilance and unity of effort was put toward white nationalism, we’d be safer.”

Assessments like this belie a surprising ignorance of the fact that homeland security legislation, appropriations, and response were structured after 9/11 to address problem sets that are so mutually exclusive that they have and always will require separate approaches. This is the very definition of a false comparison that should stand corrected as the nation lurches forward in any public discussion. It cannot be farther from true that violent Islam received a disproportionate attention at the high cost of allowing domestic forms of violent extremism to flourish.

Take the Islamist threat. Because violent political Islamism emanates from a global, internationalist set of actors and ideologies, often in foreign locales, a multi-piece toolkit was required to help the FBI counter it as the designated lead agency. Unlike forms of domestic extremism, working to disrupt Islamist terrorism requires both a deep home and away game. The FBI cannot do it without CIA spies, National Security Agency signals intelligence operations, troop deployments, armed drones, and global tracking of human suspects and money.

Consider what it might take to counter al-Qaeda plans to send operatives from Afghan training camps to hijack planes in America, or to disrupt ISIS operatives moving across multiple borders on mass-casualty attack missions in Europe, or to counter the highly effective online recruitment of Americans who travel abroad and join foreign groups of killers in foreign countries with plans to return home, perhaps indoctrinated to commit acts of terror. Legislation and vast inter-agency intelligence-sharing reforms after 9/11 were necessary to marry this very unique American response to an equally unique threat.

By contrast, violent white supremacy of the sort we saw on tragic display in El Paso is largely a law enforcement problem confined to within the United States and its territories, with far less of a global dimension. While a shooter may take “inspiration” from manifestos and chatter posted online or acts seen on the news, like the mosque massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, these kinds of crimes and plots tend to be entirely local self-propelled affairs conducted by lone offenders.

Much has been said, for instance, about the online format “8chan” as a platform for spreading incitements to violence among white racist extremists (the site has been closed since El Paso). But law enforcement agencies already have the means to watch sites like this, and other sites that traffic in narcotics and stolen property, for that tricky moment when free speech becomes illegal incitement or provides probable cause indicators.

Lone offender racists in the United States are not deployed from places abroad that must be controlled and monitored as with international jihadist terrorism. For that reason, domestic terrorism plots require an almost exclusively domestic law enforcement response by the FBI, local sheriff’s offices, and state police agencies like the one I used to work for in Texas.

CIA officers and military forces are not even statutorily allowed to operate in a law enforcement capacity within U.S. territory, nor can the NSA, spy satellites, or armed drones be enjoined in domestic enforcement action next to your local sheriff’s deputy. The USA Patriot Act did formalize a domestic terrorism definition (another of many) and allow for the FBI and DHS to identify potentially violent domestic groups and movements as intelligence and enforcement priorities, at least internally. Domestic extremists to include violent white nationalists can be placed on terror watch lists as a means to occasionally track their movements and activities.

But not much new legislation, such as a standalone Domestic Terrorism Statute, was ever necessary to mount a counterattack on violent white nationalism, since all of the necessary component parts—cops, prosecutors, and criminal statutes that carry high punishments, such as for murder and hate crimes—have long been in place.

Critics of President Trump may feel a strong compulsion to argue that his excess hatred of Islam and affection for white supremacy drove policy toward a break for the white nationalists. But their thinking is flawed by gaps in basic knowledge of how homeland security is structured to deal with both problems in the unique ways that are necessary.

This is not to say that American law enforcement can’t pivot to meet a growing threat with greater resources and attention. As I testified to Congress in June, “The number of racially motivated criminal events is now higher than what we were used to. A pivot is necessary to reverse the trend.”

However, inequality of effort certainly did not contribute to El Paso. Self-propelled lone offenders who use simple tactics in their attacks are notoriously difficult for law enforcement to detect, or to detect in time to lawfully intervene.

The threat from violent Islamism remains in play, despite other faulty comparisons that are often made to fraudulently downplay it, such as the current favorite of comparing the death toll from Islamist-motivated attacks to those caused by domestic supremacists. Properly diagnosing threats requires not death tolls but reporting the total numbers of thwarted attacks that might have resulted in deaths. And the FBI has tallied hundreds of prosecutions related to the Islamist terror threat.

To divert from efforts to disrupt Islamist attacks by the hundreds no doubt will result in lost lives one day, as it did before 9/11. In any case, whether to prioritize violent Islamism or white nationalism is not an either-or proposition. This is a resourced country that certainly can and should do both jobs separately and well.

It’s Time To Acknowledge That Qatar Is A State Sponsor of Terrorism,"Qatar boasts the world’s second-largest gross domestic product per capita. The wealthy oil emirate operates Qatar Airways, one of the world’s largest airlines. It hosts one of the world’s most influential state-sponsored news sources, Al Jazeera, and maintains significant influence in higher American education, donating more than $1.5 billion to some of America’s most well-known universities: the University of Michigan, the University of North Carolina, Northwestern, Texas A&M, and Cornell.

For all its “contributions,” however, Qatar also has a dark side. It openly supports and harbors terrorists to a disproportionate and unparalleled degree for its size. Qatar’s actions prompted President Trump to recognize Qatar’s terror funding as being “on [a] very high level.”

Despite this recognition, American administrations, even those as critical as Trump’s, have sidestepped the truth about this terrorism-sponsoring country. Instead, they have tended to celebrate the tens of billions of dollars that Qatar spends on American military and commercial equipment, as well as Qatar’s hospitality in allowing the stationing of thousands of U.S. troops.

Regardless of its economic and military incentives, Qatar has long challenged American security interests, sustaining Hamas and other terrorist groups. In response to this reality, the State Department must finally designate Qatar as a state-sponsor of terror, as it has done for others that have “repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.”

First and foremost, Qatar’s ties to Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group that avows Israel’s destruction, are overwhelming. As one of Hamas’s largest funders, Qatar has provided the terrorist organization more than $1.1 billion since 2012. While Qatar often justifies its funding as humanitarian, the course of its funding, as well as the current emir’s statements, suggest different true motives.

Qatar’s emir refuses to regard Hamas as a terrorist organization and supported Hamas on the record. During a CNN interview, Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani proclaimed, “Qatar supports ‘all Palestinian people. We believe Hamas is a very important part of the Palestinian people.’” Considering its support for Hamas, Qatar has often digressed from its supposed humanitarian cause, having explicitly funded the Hamas hierarchy.

Although they were fortunately intercepted by U.S. officials, in 2014, Qatar sent funds to sponsor the salaries of 44,000 Hamas employees. In 2016, Qatar again funded Hamas employee salaries, which Hamas’s Senior Leader—Ismail Haniyeh—wanted to use to fund the group’s military wing: the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades. Between 2001-2014 alone, the Qassam Brigades faction indiscriminately ambushed Israel with more than 17,000 missiles.

The harsh truth is that Qatar has sought to fund members of Hamas as recently as 2019. At this point, Qatar has a long track record of sponsoring Hamas employees and the cash flow necessary to sustain Hamas’s bureaucracy and foundation.

Just as Qatar has embraced Hamas abroad, it has also welcomed Hamas within its borders, offering the group protection. Since 2012, Hamas has harbored Khaled Meshaal, the former chief of Hamas’s political bureau, and one of Hamas’s most high-profile members.

Furthermore, Qatar has allowed Hamas to convene at some of the most high-profile hotels in Doha, it’s capital city. In 2015, Khaled Meshaal hosted a press conference at the Four Seasons, and in 2017, Hamas unveiled its new charter at a conference at the Sheraton. Within its very own borders, Qatar has permitted a terrorist organization to organize and campaign in broad daylight.

The Qatari government has empowered and endorsed Hamas’s agenda by publishing full-blown Hamas conferences and speeches on its state-owned, state-funded network: Al-Jazeera. All you have to do to verify this is search Al-Jazeera Mubasher (Al-Jazeera Live), a YouTube channel through which Al-Jazeera has streamed coverage of Hamas conferences and speeches.

Al-Jazeera has shared coverage ranging from a vigil for the founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine—a Leninist-Marxist terror group notorious for plane hijackings and murder—to a full interview of a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

Just as Qatar has provided safe-haven and funding for Hamas, it has done the same for other organizations classified as terrorist organizations either in America or abroad. Despite being regarded as the inspiration for Hamas—and named a terrorist group by Bahrain, Egypt, Russia, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE—the Muslim Brotherhood has received more than $1 billion from the Qatari government.

Qatar has also harbored 20 high-ranking members of the Afghani Taliban and sponsored Ahrar al-Sham, a Syrian, Salafist militia that has previously fought alongside the terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusrah. Furthermore, in 2017, Qatar paid $360 million to free two hostages captured by Kata’ib Hezbollah—an Iranian Shi’ite terrorist organization notorious for ambushing American troops in Iraq. While these organizations are not directly affiliated to Hamas, a trend prevails: Qatar’s proactive support for terrorist groups.

Qatar’s ties to terrorism are long-established. By harboring and bankrolling some of the world’s most notorious terrorist groups, Qatar has become, by any reasonable definition, a state-sponsor of terrorism. It’s time for America and the rest of the world to recognize the magnitude to which Qatar threatens global security and to designate Qatar accordingly.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/15/qatar-state-sponsor-terrorism/,2019-08-15
"Media Won’t Report Tlaib, Omar’s Israel Trip Was Thru Pro-Terrorist Group","Amid last week’s debate over whether Israel should have issued waivers to Democratic Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, and allowed them to promote the anti-Israel boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement from within Israel, two scandals went largely unreported. The first scandal is that Tlaib and Omar’s trip was planned by the antisemitic, pro-terror Miftah organization. The second scandal was the establishment media’s whitewashing of the first scandal.

It fell to the Elder of Ziyon blog to remind everyone on Twitter that in 2013, Miftah published a blood libel against Jews. The term “blood libel” has been applied in other contexts in recent years, but Miftah claimed Jews have murdered Christian children to use their blood for baking matzos at Passover.

Historically, blood libels resulted in pogroms, including in England, Poland, and Russia; they contributed to the expulsion of Jews from England from 1290 to 1657. Jews were tried. Confessions were extracted by torture. When Miftah published its lie, the final blood-libel trial of a Jew in Western history was only 100 years past. When their essay was publicized, Miftah first tried to attack those who exposed them, then apologized—but only in English, not in Arabic.

Miftah also re-published (and later deleted) a column titled “Who Rules America: The Alien Grip on Our News and Entertainment Media Must Be Broken.” Vox’s Jane Coaston (one of a few exceptions among the media last week) noted the original source was National Vanguard, a neo-Nazi group founded by members of the National Alliance—once the best financed and organized white nationalist groups in America. The group’s founder, William Pierce, authored “The Turner Diaries,” a book that inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

The essay Miftah reprinted asserted in part: “The Jew-controlled entertainment media have taken the lead in persuading a whole generation that homosexuality is a normal and acceptable way of life; that there is nothing at all wrong with White women dating or marrying Black men, or with White men marrying Asian women; that all races are inherently equal in ability and character — except that the character of the White race is suspect because of a history of oppressing other races; and that any effort by Whites at racial self-preservation is reprehensible.”

Given its antisemitism, it is not surprising Miftah also has supported Palestinian terrorism against Israel. In a 2017 interview, Miftah founder and chairwoman Hanan Ashrawi defended such attacks, stating they “are seen by the people as resistance. And you cannot somehow adopt the language of either the international community or the occupier by describing anybody who resists as terrorist (sic).” Miftah also described one of the first female Palestinian suicide bombers as “the beginning of a string of Palestinian women dedicated to sacrificing their lives for the cause.”

In reporting on Israel’s exclusion of Tlaib and Omar, The New York Times described Miftah only as “an organization headed by a longtime Palestinian lawmaker.” The Times editorial board called Miftah a group “that promotes ‘global awareness and knowledge of Palestinian realities.’”

The Times, after publishing an antisemitic cartoon in its international edition a few months ago, editorialized it is a “dangerous mistake“ to dismiss antisemitism as a fringe element in society, but on Miftah, Tlaib, and Omar the paper continues to fall painfully short of “unblinking journalism and the clear editorial expression of its values.” Or its values seem to require a certain amount of blinking.

Other media outlets fared no better. The Washington Post called Miftah “a nonprofit organization headed by Palestinian lawmaker and longtime peace negotiator Hanan Ashrawi.” The Los Angeles Times editorialized that “[t]he only disgrace here is Trump’s behavior” in encouraging Israel to exclude Tlaib and Omar, noting in passing “[t]he trip of the two congresswomen was being arranged by Miftah, a nonprofit organization headed by a Palestinian lawmaker.” CNN’s story avoids mentioning Miftah altogether.

Arguably the worst coverage appeared in Politico’s “Playbook” column. Politico actually highlighted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s statement characterizing Miftah as “an avid supporter of BDS, and among whose members are those who have expressed support for terrorism against Israel.” But Politico played this as a “gotcha” because Israel allowed a Miftah-sponsored group of congressmen into Israel in 2016. Indeed, Politico’s Brad Sherman tweeted: “Israel allowed a Miftah trip in 2016 when it was a group of 5 Dem male members,” as if there were some sex discrimination at work.

The Politico item leaves out a few things. First, as Jerusalem Post Senior Contributing Editor Lahav Harkov responded, “The law to bar boycott advocates wasn’t on the books in 2016, which you could have found out with a quick google search.” Sherman dismissed the criticism: “Yes, but Netanyahu took issue with Miftah in addition to its support of BDS.”

Given the controversy surrounding Israel’s decision to exclude Tlaib and Omar legally, it is frankly absurd to suggest Netanyahu should have made the 2016 trip an issue when he lacked the legal power to stop it. But the Politico article is even worse than that.

In 2016, Miftah invited more than 70 members of Congress, of whom only five accepted. And while Politico hyperlinks to their itineraries, the column omits mentioning they met with Shawan Jabarin. He is identified in the itineraries in his capacity as director of the Palestinian “human rights” organization Al Haq, which advocates for the anti-Israel boycott.

Jabarin is also an alleged long-time activist for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a designated terrorist organization in the United States, Canada, and European Union. He was convicted in 1985 of recruiting for the PFLP. When he was detained in 1994, Israel claimed he “had not discontinued his terrorist involvement and maintains his position in the leadership of the PFLP.” Jordan cited similar security concerns in barring him from entry in 2003.

Of the four current congressmen on that 2016 Miftah trip, Rep. Marc Pocan was one of the 16 votes (along with Tlaib and Omar) against a July resolution condemning BDS. Another, Rep. Hank Johnson, abstained from that vote; he previously had to apologize for likening Israeli settlers to termites.

A third, Rep. Dan Kildee, has defended Omar’s dual-loyalty smears. In context, the 2016 Miftah trip looks much less like a “gotcha” of Netanyahu than a milestone on the path to Israel passing the law allowing them to exclude BDS advocates, particularly those affiliating with Miftah.

Beyond Miftah, Omar, and Tlaib, the same media whitewash occurs regarding the antisemitic BDS movement. Omar Barghouti, co-founder of the movement, compares Israel to the Nazis, claims Israeli soldiers shoot Palestinian children “for sport,” denies that Jews are one of the indigenous peoples of the region and have no right to self-determination—sometimes all in the same speech. The basic history of the movement and its leaders will be found nowhere in the BDS explainer published by The New York Times, perhaps because the paper recently published a wildly dishonest op-ed by Barghouti himself.

The establishment press must be getting quite a crick in its collective neck from having to look away so often from the antisemitic elements of the left, including within the Democratic Party. It is a case where biased journalism slouches into bad citizenship.

The Corbynization of Britain’s Labour Party happened in large part because the local media tended to ignore it. The left vehemently disagrees, but when you read the account of Josh Glancy, the New York correspondent for The Sunday Times of London, it is difficult to miss how much denial within the media aided Corbyn until it was too late.

Allowing antisemitism to fester within the Democratic Party and defending obviously antisemitic Democrats is bad for the country. And looking at the current struggles of the Labour Party, it is likely to be toxic for Democrats most of all. Even a biased press corps ought to recognize that much.

‘The Squad’ Co-Sponsors Bill Claiming Israel Tortures Children,"Many Americans now know that Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar—two members of “the squad” of far-left congresswomen so much in the news—were recently barred from traveling to Israel to agitate for the anti-Israel boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement. Fewer know all four members of “the squad,” including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, have co-sponsored a bill that accuses the Jewish state of torturing children. Fewer still know the claims made in the bill originate mostly from a group that could be described as the propaganda arm of a terrorist organization.

The so-called “Promoting Human Rights for Palestinian Children Living Under Israeli Military Occupation Act“ was re-introduced in the House by Rep. Betty McCollum, whose congressional district neighbors Omar’s in Minnesota. Until recently, McCollum was considered a supporter of Israel, but a critic of its government.

In February, however, she condemned “[t]he right-wing, extremist government of Benjamin Netanyahu and its apartheid-like policies,” adding “there are now members of Congress who are not willing to ignore the Israeli government’s destructive actions because they are afraid of losing an election.”

McCollum’s invective prompted Mark Mellman of the Democratic Majority for Israel to respond that Netanyahu “came to office in a fair and democratic election in which every Arab citizen of Israel had the same right to vote as any Jewish citizen.” Mellman added that “by suggesting that Jews have disproportionate influence on U.S. elections, the Congresswoman exploits an anti-Semitic trope widely used by far right forces from Czarism to fascism.”

McCollum’s bill, while not directly exploiting the anti-Semitic trope of blood libel, trades on the accusation that Israel treats non-Jewish children cruelly and inhumanely. The bill claims Palestinian children detained by Israeli defense forces suffer torture and physical violence, are deprived of lawyers and parents, not informed of their legal rights, and so on.

It ultimately aims to prohibit “U.S. assistance to Israel from being used to support the military detention, interrogation, or ill-treatment of Palestinian children in violation of international humanitarian law.” As federal law already bars U.S. aid to foreign security forces who commit gross human rights violations, the bill is an exercise in singling out the Jewish state.

The accusations presented as “findings” in the bill are cribbed—occasionally verbatim—from inaccurate claims made by several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that lead BDS campaigns in the United States and abroad. The bill’s claims largely come from Defense for Children International-Palestine (DCI-P). Historically, DCI-P officials, employees, and board members have had links to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which is considered to be a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union, and Canada.

The PFLP has a long record of terror attacks, dating back to the Lod Airport massacre, which killed 28 people in 1968. The PFLP may be best known for the 1976 hijacking of an Air France plane, which was ended by the Israeli raid on Entebbe Airport. In 1980, PFLP attacked a kibbutz, seizing a nursery and murdering a two-year-old. Since 2000, PFLP has executed more than a dozen suicide bombings, shootings, stabbings and even ax attacks, notably in the 2014 Jerusalem synagogue massacre that killed four and injured seven.

Shawan Jabarin, a member of DCI-P’s board from 2007-14, was convicted in 1985 for recruiting and arranging training for members for the PFLP. Mahmoud Jiddah, a DCI-P board member from 2012-16, was imprisoned for 17 years after launching grenade attacks against Israeli civilians in 1968; he is also alleged to be a member of PFLP. Mary Rock, elected to the board in 2014, was a PFLP candidate for the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006.

Nasser Ibrahim, a president of DCI-P’s General Assembly, was the former editor of the PFLP’s weekly news publication. Riyad Arar, a director of DCI-P’s Child Protection Program, addressed a December 2014 PFLP memorial event for a group member who was killed “while engaging in a demonstration confronting the occupation forces with stones and Molotov cocktails.” And this is far from a complete list of ties between DCI-P personnel and PFLP—ties that caused Citibank and Arab Bank PLC to stop accepting funds for donation to DCI-P.

NGO Monitor has published a point-by-point rebuttal to the claims made by DCI-P and other groups that are incorporated into McCollum’s bill. For example, the bill relies on claims of physical violence against minors collected by DCI-P, when “very few actual complaints are either submitted to the appropriate Israeli civilian or military authorities or raised in court, and even fewer are found to be justified. In practice, the claims are made based on anonymous complainants ‘interviewed’ by DCI-P staffers.” McCollum’s bill also attempts to pass off accusations made by DCI-P as findings of the U.S. State Department.

Missing from the bill, and the DCI-P propaganda on which it is based, is the history of Palestinian terror groups using children to carry out suicide bombings and stabbings, or paying teenagers to die in border riots. The omission is glaring in light of a DCI-P program director admitting on television that Palestinian minors commit terror attacks to enhance their societal status.

If the real concern were how Palestinian children are treated, DCI-P would not blame Israel for Hamas training Palestinan youth to kidnap soldiers, use weapons, and infiltrate Israel though tunnels. And members of Congress would not express concern for Palestinian children only as a cudgel against the Jewish state.

The discriminatory smears would be bad enough, but there’s more. McCollum’s bill also seeks to appropriate $19 million every year for “nongovernmental organizations from the United States, Israel, or the Occupied Palestinian Territory” to “monitor” these alleged abuses.

No wonder anti-Israel NGOs like DCI-P, the American Friends Service Committee, Jewish Voice for Peace, Center for Constitutional Rights, and the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights (the American umbrella group of the BDS movement) have endorsed the bill. It is almost as if they wrote it.

The good news is that the bill has been referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, where it will likely die over the objections of committee member Omar. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a co-chair of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee and close ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has withdrawn her co-sponsorship of the bill, which she claims was given by mistake.

DeLauro told The Intercept she opposes the bill because it “seeks to single out Israel for criticism, and seeks to appropriate money to investigate, document, and report only on Israeli abuses.” That McCollum’s bill retains the co-sponsorship of “the squad” is a reminder that the Corbynization of the Democratic Party continues, even after Congress overwhelmingly condemned the BDS movement.

Rashida Tlaib Blames Israel For Terrorist Attack That Killed Israeli Teen,"On Saturday evening, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., tweeted her sadness about the terrorist bombing that took the life of 17-year-old Israeli Rina Shnerb. Shnerb was hiking with her brother and father at the Ein Bubin Spring in the West Bank on August 23 when a bomb was “triggered remotely when [Rina’s] family approached it.” Rina’s brother and father were injured in the attack.

Palestinian-American Tlaib’s tweet took a rapid shift from emotional outpouring to launching guilt at Israel: “More than ever,” she wrote, “we need to support nonviolent approaches to ending the Israeli occupation and guaranteeing equal rights for all. Extremism that puts innocent lives at risk moves us no closer to peace.”

As did the organization whose statement she retweeted, Tlaib implied that policies of the Jewish state of Israel were somehow to blame for the heinous actions of terrorists who detonated a bomb. It was hardly a surprising turn of events for the freshman representative, who often uses her public bullhorn to spread anti-Israel propaganda and bad Holocaust history.

Terrorist organization Hamas called the bombing “proof of the vitality and bravery of the Palestinian people.” According to the Israel Defense Forces, Palestinians celebrated Rina’s death by passing out candies.

August Has Been a Deadly Month

Perhaps Tlaib is not aware that Shnerb’s murder was only the most recent attack against Israelis in what has been a deadly month for America’s ally. Israel and its policies are no more to blame for the death of Shnerb than they are for this month’s series of cowardly attacks.

On August 7, 18-year-old yeshiva student Dvir Sorek was stabbed to death by two Palestinian men in the Etzion settlement in the West Bank. According to the Israeli army, the two men may have attempted to kidnap Sorek, and killed him in their vehicle before throwing him onto the street. When Sorek’s body was discovered, he was still clutching the books he had just purchased in Jerusalem. They were meant to be gifts for his teachers.

After Sorek’s death, the Palestinian Authority (PA) passed out candy in celebration, while leaders called Sorek’s murder “‘a heroic operation’ and ‘a natural response to the Israeli occupation’s crimes.’” Visible during Sorek’s solemn funeral service was a display of fireworks from Palestinians celebrating Sorek’s death in a nearby village.

On August 11, Tisha B’Av, a Jewish fast day, coincided with Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, leading to a confrontation at the al-Aqsa Mosque, also known as the Temple Mount, in Jerusalem’s Old City. After an Eid al-Adha prayer, thousands of Muslims moved toward the Mughrabi Gate, the only gate non-Muslims may use to approach the Temple Mount, and began “throwing rocks and other objects at police.”

Israeli police used “dispersal means,” including tear gas, to respond to the riot, injuring 61 Muslims involved. Four members of the Israeli police were also wounded during the event. Contrary to fact, the spokesman of the PA President Mahmoud Abbas claimed that Israeli police had “storm[ed] the al-Aqsa Mosque and act[ed] aggressively against worshippers.”

On August 15, video captured a horrific terror attack near the Shalshelet Gate in the Old City, in which two Palestinian teens ran towards an Israeli police officer and began to stab him. Other officers at the scene fired on the teens, killing one. The second attacker was sent to the hospital, as was the officer, who had sustained a chest wound.

On August 16, near the Elazar settlement in the West Bank, a Palestinian Fatah member who had previously been jailed for acts of terror rammed a stolen car into two Israeli siblings. The 17-year-old brother, who suffered a fractured skull, underwent neurosurgery, and was sedated and on a respirator the day after the attack. His 19-year-old sister experienced injuries to her limbs.

Blame the Palestinian Authority’s ‘Pay for Slay’

If Tlaib is concerned about the impetus of the act of terror that killed Shnerb, she should look first to the PA, which offers incredible monetary incentives to Palestinians who launch such despicable terrorist attacks on Israelis.

In a policy known as “pay for slay,” the PA motivates attacks against Israeli “occupiers” by paying the perpetrators and their families a monthly stipend. “The more egregious the crime,” according to an op-ed from The Hill, “the more you get paid. Campsites, schools, clinics are named after so-called martyrs who kill innocent Jews.”

Every year, the PA pays out more than $330 million, or 7 percent of its budget, to those who attack Israelis. These funds, as explained in a January 2019 Washington Examiner op-ed, are distributed to “approximately 10,500 imprisoned and released prisoners and some 37,500 families of martyrs and injured.” In comparison, the PA’s welfare budget of $214 million is distributed between “118,000 households: a much larger group subsisting on a much smaller budget.”

In his description of the motivators for “pay for slay,” Army Lt. Col. Charles Faint mentions the 2004 law providing these payments. According to this law, the funds are provided for those “participating in the struggle against the occupation,” as they are “an integral part of the fabric of the Arab-Palestinian society.” Faint notes that “struggles” can involve anything “from throwing rocks to murdering American tourists.”

Here Faint refers to American Taylor Force, a Vanderbilt University student and former Army officer who was stabbed to death in Jaffa in 2016 while visiting Israel with his fellow graduate students. A West Bank political group referred to Force’s killer as “a ‘heroic martyr,’ and instituted payments to his family.”

Prior to 2018, Faint states the United States distributed around $300 million to the PA each year. With the passage of the Taylor Force Act in March 2018, all U.S. aid to the PA, except for some humanitarian funds, will cease until “pay for slay” is discontinued. Other countries, such as Australia and Israel, have followed suit.

Even as donor countries considered pulling funds from the PA, however, Abbas defended “pay for slay,” saying the program fulfilled “a social responsibility to look after innocent people affected by the incarceration or killing of their loved ones.”

Other Lies Tlaib Spreads about Israel

On Saturday, Tlaib called for a state that would guarantee “equal rights for all.” The 120-member body of the Knesset, Israel’s House of Representatives, includes 5 LGBTQ members, 12 non-Jews, and 29 women.

In comparison, earlier this month, the PA “banned LGBTQ organizations from operating in the West Bank,” stating LGBTQ events “go against and infringe upon the higher principles and values of Palestinian society.” While a Palestinian news agency claimed in 2018 that a single member of the Palestinian National Council, Uri Davis, is Jewish, Davis converted back to Islam in 2008.

Once considered fringe and hateful beliefs, Tlaib’s statements now get unprecedented air time and are becoming normalized.

Tlaib regularly makes false and dangerous allegations about Israel, like remarking on the country’s alleged “racism and…international human rights violations,” likening Israel to “the apartheid in South Africa,” and conflating Palestinians’ fight against Israel with the American fight for civil rights.

Once considered fringe and hateful beliefs, Tlaib’s statements now get unprecedented air time and are becoming normalized. Countering such drivel with facts seems to be a full-time occupation. Luckily, groups like the Anti-Defamation League methodically and factually counter these types of flawed allegations so Americans can readily educate themselves about the types and varieties of antisemitic attacks launched at our ally with increasing force and regularity.

While Tlaib’s sorrow about Shnerb’s death appears real, the representative must recognize how the falsehoods she spreads help to delegitimize, demonize, and disenfranchise the Jewish state of Israel. The words she uses to blame Israel for the actions of terrorists are not unlike the words of those who claim Israel is the aggressor while paying terrorists handsomely to conduct attacks against innocent Israelis.

If our congresswoman continues to offer a shallow, one-sided truths about the Israel-Palestine conflict and fails to address the PA’s “pay to slay” laws, or the cult of “heroic martyrdom” granted to those who kill Israelis, then it is the duty of every American who supports Israel to learn the truth and speak up loudly against Tlaib’s emotionally charged lies.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/27/rashida-tlaib-blames-israel-terrorist-attack-killed-israeli-teen/,2019-08-27
CAIR Research Director Previously Praised NGO With Jihadist Ties,"The research director for the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), Abbas Barzegar, has a history of publicly supporting a Turkish nonprofit organization that “has provided financial, logistical and political support for jihadists,” according to The Investigative Project on Terrorism.

What makes Barzegar’s praise of Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH) particularly noteworthy is that he is the head author of CAIR’s 2019 report on Islamophobia, titled “Hijacked by Hate: American Philanthropy and the Islamophobia Network.” In other words, he has been accusing U.S. nonprofits of Islamophobia while publicly endorsing a group that, according to the former chief of counter-terrorism in Turkey, has furnished material support to jihadists.

It is unclear whether Barzegar was either ignorant of IHH’s role or knew but did not care. When approached by IJT for comment, Barzegar did not respond.

In an op-ed for The Washington Post in 2015, Barzegar claimed that IHH was on the “front lines” in Syria, assisting tens of thousands of Syrian refugees heading towards Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan. He even presented IHH as ideal candidates for becoming “ideological gatekeepers” within the war-torn region, arguing they were capable of performing more than simply “routine aid work.”

These claims could not be farther from the truth. IHH is hardly the organization Barzegar depicted to WaPo readers. It is instead a group that has done a reasonable job of hiding its jihadist affiliations. However, the mask occasionally slips, as in 2014, when the centrist Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported that Turkish police had discovered weaponry disguised as aid in IHH trucks headed for Islamic rebels in Syria.

Or as in 2006, when a confidential U.S. State Department cable released by WikiLeaks expressed that IHH was “suspected by some of international terrorism financing… In 1997 local officers at IHH’s Istanbul headquarters were arrested after a raid by security forces uncovered firearms, explosives and bomb-making instructions.” The confidential cable also expounded upon the fact that IHH had co-organized the funeral for Chechen militant and State Department-designated terrorist Shamil Basayev.

Former chief of the Counter-Terrorism and Operations Division of the Turkish National Police (2010-2012) and now assistant professor at DeSales University Ahmet Yayla described IHH’s role in providing material support for terrorists. In an interview with Medium, Yayla admitted, “I was indirectly involved early on in the counter-terrorism investigations into IHH.”

Yayla continued, “The leader of the IHH was arrested as a result of these investigations at the time, due to the evidence we had obtained that the group is behind much of the support to ISIS. IHH have provided weapons and ammunition to many jihadist groups in Syria, not just ISIS.”

If Yayla’s claims are true, they indicate IHH was a pass-through entity for Turkish President Recep Erdogan to provide support to rebel groups in Syria—indeed, an NGO can provide a benign cover for more sinister activities. Yayla revealed in the same interview that when support wasn’t being furnished by IHH, it was instead being provided by the Turkish state National Intelligence Organization (MIT), a longarm of Erdogan. As he told to me when I asked him about the Erdogan-IHH connection, “Erdogan uses IHH as a tong in supporting those terrorist organizations and as a cover for his dirty work.”

Unsurprisingly, both Germany and the Netherlands have designated IHH a terrorist organization due to its continuous financial support of Hamas, the Sunni fundamentalist group currently controlling the Gaza Strip. Despite almost 90 senators asking President Obama in 2014 to consider designating the group a terrorist organization, IHH has yet to be classified as such in the United States, although its support of Hamas continues.

As Yayla emphasized to me, “IHH for sure supports or has supported AQ affiliates and ISIS, and any American person or entity interacting with this organization should think twice because IHH’s affiliation with those terrorist organizations is well known and documented.”

All this suggests IHH is a far-cry from the supposed model NGO that Barzegar has presented it as. Although it is theoretically possible that Barzegar did not know of IHH’s role, it is highly unlikely, given his role at CAIR and the general field of research in which he supposedly specializes.

The fact that Barzegar conducts research for CAIR while praising those who materially support jihadists is a troubling phenomenon, but points to a larger problem within the field of NGOs. The IHH conundrum reveals the capacity of organizations to be repackaged as supposedly benign NGOs and then lauded internationally to an unsuspecting audience.

Yayla posits it could go deeper than that. In the case of CAIR, there is a real and tangible friendship between the director of CAIR, Nihad Awad, and Erdogan. Thus, Yayla expressed to me, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Barzegar mimics the same friendliness towards the Erdogan regime that his boss displays. This mimicry may include running cover for the Erdogan regime when its reputation enters hot water on the international stage. Yayla continued, ” I know some people left CAIR because of their interactions and support [of] Erdogan.”

Given all the work that CAIR supposedly does on behalf of the Muslim community in America, Yayla’s final note to me seemed particular poignant and brave: “It is..honest Muslims’ duty to counter such organizations and be vigilant about their activities [because] if we don’t stand up against terror, we become hypocrites; which is worse than disbelief, according to Quran.”

Tlaib Poses For Pictures With Anti-Israel Group That Endorses Terrorism,"Last weekend, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) chatted and posed for pictures in Dallas with members of the Palestine Youth Movement (PYM), a group that has voiced support for terrorism, reported the Washington Free Beacon earlier today.

PYM endorses all forms of resistance to Israel, “whether by pen or gun.” PYM members have also called for the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers, and hosted a student event shouting “long-live the intifada.”

A poll a few years ago of Palestinians found approximately half believe the goal of intifada is to end the existence of Israel, which was re-established after World War II and publicly recognized as the homeland of the Jewish people. The international community acknowledged the importance of the Jewish homeland, not just historically, but also a safe haven to protect Jews from another mass murder as minorities within other countries.

PYM also sponsors the “Ghassan Kanafani Scholarship.” Kanafani was a leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) which is defined as a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department and Treasury.

“Kanafani dedicated his life to the Palestinian struggle both through his work with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) as well as his writing,” the PYM scholarship details. This is only one example of how PYM has endorsed terrorist activities.

Tlaib has repeatedly come under fire for antisemitic comments. She has also talked about the “calm feeling” she gets when thinking about how the Palestinian-Arabs treated Jews fleeing the Holocaust. They slaughtered them, but Tlaib tried to present it as if they welcomed them.

While it is not shocking that Tlaib has involvement with Palestinian organizations, it is disturbing to know that a sitting congresswoman poses for pictures with a group that endorses terrorism.

Don't Believe These Myths About Ending The 18-Year War In Afghanistan,"Zalmay Khalilzad, the Trump administration’s chief negotiator with the Taliban, has endured a lot of pressure in the last week. Former U.S. ambassadors, Fox News pundits, and think tank analysts alike have denounced his draft agreement in full without knowing what is in the final document.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s advisers have already expressed that the terms of the accord “need serious debate and revision.” Words such as “surrender,” “defeat,” and “abandonment” are being tossed in the air as if the United States has an obligation to serve as the Afghan government’s defenders in perpetuity.

Khalilzad and his boss, President Trump, will feel even more heat as additional details become available to the public. Trump’s cancellation on September 7 of a direct meeting between himself, the Taliban, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is a blinking red light that the president is increasingly experiencing second-thoughts about the entire process. So it is as good a time as any to reexamine the usual myths that will resurface in editorials and television segments over the ensuing weeks as opponents try to tank any agreement that could conclude U.S. involvement in this 18-year war.

Myth 1: The U.S. Is Signing Its Own Defeat

Career Ambassador Ryan Crocker and others have categorized a negotiated withdrawal from Afghanistan as a humiliating retreat à la Vietnam, 1973. The argument is meant to strike a chord in American policymakers who are concerned with defending their reputations in the history books and wary of being on the wrong side of the Beltway-fueled “Who lost Afghanistan?” debate.

But using the word “defeat” and “Afghanistan” in the same sentence is based on emotion rather than fact. In reality, the United States achieved its sole national security objective in the South Asian country as far back as early 2002, when a combination of U.S. air power, intelligence assets, and special operations forces in coordination with anti-Taliban militias swept the Taliban from Kabul, obliterated al-Qaeda’s terrorist infrastructure, and forced Osama Bin Laden into hiding.

To characterize withdrawal now as “losing” the war is a simplistic and inaccurate narrative, which totally loses sight of the central reason the United States used military force in Afghanistan in the first place: to punish the organization responsible for 9/11 and send a message to anyone who would even think about partnering with such a group in the future.

Myth 2: The Taliban Will Welcome Al-Qaeda Back

A core principle of the emerging deal is a Taliban commitment to prevent terrorist groups from using territory under its control to plan and launch attacks against the American people. Many people in Washington don’t buy the premise. The Taliban and al-Qaeda, they argue, are deeply linked after more than 20 years of cooperation. Moreover, the thinking goes, the Taliban is fundamentally untrustworthy, which suggests it would be the height of folly to take Taliban promises seriously.

While it is true the Taliban has no interest in negotiating peace with a government in Kabul they label as a foreign proxy, the Taliban of 2019 is not the Taliban of 2001, and the Taliban-AQ nexus has always been far more complicated and acrimonious than analysts in the West understand. The Taliban regime was never especially thrilled to have Bin Laden planning attacks from Afghan soil, particularly when the target was a superpower that could rain hell and fury on Afghanistan at will.

Mullah Mohammed Omar and his lieutenants learned this lesson the hard way. In the years since the Taliban lost its emirate, fighters and officials alike have spoken of their regret for letting Bin Laden treat Taliban-controlled Afghanistan as his personal terrorist fiefdom.

With this history in mind, one can make a persuasive case that the Taliban has an incentive to avoid committing similar mistakes and to keep their distance from al-Qaeda. Having experienced the wrath of the U.S. military and the collapse of its former government, current Taliban leadership will think twice before reverting to the prior arrangement. The Taliban knowing now what it didn’t then, can anyone say with a straight face that its leaders would make the same exact choices again?

Myth 3: If U.S. Troops Leave, Afghanistan Will Be a Terrorist Playground Again

Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump both wanted to extricate the United States from an expensive and directionless war that has long lost its purpose. But both ended up backtracking on those campaign pledges due to poor advice from their military advisers, a belief that stronger military pressure would force the Taliban into more concessions, and a fear of what would happen in Afghanistan once Washington cut its losses.

However, assuming a post-U.S. Afghanistan would descend into a cauldron of terrorism, in which al-Qaeda and the Islamic State run wild, is a bad assumption to make — not necessarily because it is silly, but because this hypothesis discounts the actions of regional powers who have as much of a security interest in keeping terrorist groups in check as the United States does.

Russia, Pakistan, India, Iran, and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia have plenty of differences, but they agree in not wanting to see Afghanistan become a place where enemies of the state can easily plan operations against them. Believing a U.S. troop departure will translate into a boon for terrorists ignores the interests of Afghanistan’s neighbors, all of whom will work to prevent such a development.

After 18 years, thousands of casualties, and a price tag that could be as high as $1 trillion, the United States has done all it can in Afghanistan. Instead of finding excuses to stay, it’s time to come home.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/09/dont-believe-tired-myths-ending-18-year-war-afghanistan/,2019-09-09
What San Francisco's Labeling Of The NRA Means For America,"On Tuesday, San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors unanimously declared the National Rifle Association to be a “domestic terrorist organization” and urged the city to re-evaluate its financial commitments to organizations that conduct business with the interest group.

City leaders labeled the gun rights group that represents nearly five million members a “terrorist” group in response to several mass shootings that took place this summer, including one that took place at a food festival in Gilroy, California killing three people just south of San Francisco.

“The National Rifle Association musters its considerable wealth and organizational strength to promote gun ownership and incite gun owners to acts of violence,” the supervisors declared in the resolution. “The National Rifle Association spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence, and…through its advocacy has armed those individuals who would and have committed acts of terrorism.”

The board of supervisors continued in the resolution to recommend that the city assess its financial relationships with companies that work with the NRA, and urged other cities, states, and the federal government to do the same.

The NRA has been vilified by Democratic politicians and elites in the wake of nearly every mass shooting as wrongly responsible for killing sprees by crazy people. But San Francisco’s declaration of the gun-advocacy group as a “domestic terrorist” organization has taken this vilification to new heights.

In declaring the NRA a “domestic terrorist group,” San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors have shed further light on where extreme politics have taken the country. Rather than engaging in a productive dialogue on gun violence, San Francisco’s city leaders have instead declared their political opponents are something worse than enemies: “domestic terrorists.” This is a gross mischaracterization of an organization of more than five million people and illustrates a growing culture of contempt destroying American civility.

“Terrorism” is defined as “the systemic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective.” In order to be a terrorist organization, then, the NRA would need to be encouraging violent attacks on U.S. citizens with the purpose of harnessing fear to promote its mission. Certainly, the NRA is no terrorist group.

While San Francisco leaders label the law-abiding citizens of the NRA as terrorists, will they do the same with Antifa? Antifa certainly fits the criteria of a domestic terrorist group, launching violent attacks on its opponents and journalists to harness fear against President Donald Trump and pursue a far-left political agenda.

Here’s a video of Antifa attacking conservative journalist Andy Ngo at a protest in Portland, Oregon:

Ngo was more than a little “roughed up.” Ngo suffered a traumatic brain injury from the assault.

Here is another video of Antifa violently attacking opponents:

Is Antifa not worth condemnation as a terrorist group?

San Francisco’s demonization of the NRA showcases the cancer that is contempt in American politics, where even leaders are seemingly incapable of engaging in civil dialogue and instead use extreme labels to characterize their opponents.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/09/san-franciscos-declaration-nra-terrorist-group-says-america-today/,2019-09-09
NRA Sues San Francisco For Labeling It A 'Terrorist Organization',"The National Rifle Association filed a lawsuit against San Francisco Monday for branding the gun rights group as a “domestic terrorist organization” and for recommending that the city re-evaluate its financial obligations with organizations that conduct business with the lobbying group.

The NRA alleges in the lawsuit that San Francisco is violating its rights to free speech and is inappropriately impeding on its mission by attempting to “blacklist anyone linked to the NRA,” according to the New York Times.

San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution last week labeling the NRA as a “domestic terrorist” group, arguing that the interest group representing 5 million people is seeking to spread gun violence through propaganda.

“This action is an assault on all advocacy organizations across the country,” said William A. Brewer III, an attorney for the NRA, in a statement. “There can be no place in our society for this manner of behavior by government officials. Fortunately, the NRA, like all U.S. citizens, is protected by the First Amendment.”

The resolution was passed after several summer mass shootings including one at a food festival just south of San Francisco in Gilroy, California, that claimed the lives of three people.

San Francisco Supervisor Catherine Stefani, an attorney who introduced the measure on July 30 after the Gilroy shooting, said she expects the lawsuit to go nowhere.

“It’s a resolution, it’s not an ordinance, it’s nonbinding,” Stefani told the New York Times. “They misspend their members’ dues for their personal gain, they have pending investigations against them, and they continue to perpetuate a culture of sick and pervasive gun violence in this country. Their time is up.”

The resolution passed by one of the nation’s largest cities showcases where extreme politics have taken the country, as political opponents have demonized those on the other side by branding them as perpetuators of evil.

Through labeling a group of nearly 5 million Americans a “terrorist organization,” city leaders have further exposed a dark undercurrent sweeping through American politics to bleed out what is left of American civility.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/09/10/nra-sues-san-francisco-declaring-group-terrorist-organization/,2019-09-10
"First Border-Crossing Terrorist Is On Trial, And The Media Won't Cover It","Many who have professionally worried, as did former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, that violent jihadists might illegally cross the United States’ southern border are often sanctimoniously challenged with this: “Name a single U.S. border-crossing immigrant asylum-seeker who ever committed a terrorist attack.”

Introducing Abdulahi Hasan Sharif of Somalia.

In 2011, Sharif had himself smuggled from Somalia through Brazil and Central America. Then he entered the United States over the Mexico-California border and claimed asylum. Sharif went on to Canada, where he allegedly conducted a double vehicle-ramming and stabbing rampage in 2017 in Edmonton, Alberta, that severely injured a police officer and four other people. He was carrying an Islamic State flag in one of the ramming vehicles.

Those who paid attention to this case were too few and far between ever to mention Sharif a year ago when President Trump provoked a denialist media backlash by claiming the border was vulnerable to violent jihadists migrating from distant Muslim-majority countries.

The 32-year-old Sharif is now on public trial in Canada, facing 11 counts of attempted murder, aggravated assault, and dangerous driving. While he occupies a consequential homeland security pedestal of first border-crosser to conduct a jihadi attack in North America, his backstory remains largely unexcavated for learnable lessons to U.S. homeland security. That may or may not change in the coming weeks of a trial.

That Islamic extremists would infiltrate the United States through the southern border is a prospect that professional homeland security authorities have taken seriously since 9/11. Agencies have long invested in countering the perceived border threat. For instance, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations agents are deployed throughout Latin America to disrupt smuggling networks that specialize in transporting foreign citizens from Muslim-majority countries such as Somalia into the United States.

The government labels such migrants “special interest aliens” so they can be flagged to ostensibly undergo enhanced security screenings, such as threat assessment interviews, to which Spanish-speaking people are not subject. As I said during recent field reporting on the migrant trails in Panama and Costa Rica, travelers on U.S. terrorism watch lists have been apprehended at the border or en route in recent years. Perhaps because as many as 20 such suspects a year were caught in various American security nets, none had yet been able to attack in North America – until Sharif.

Trump’s notion that something like this could happen outraged the usual suspects as baseless fearmongering even though dozens of Islamist terrorists successfully snuck over Europe’s external borders while posing as asylum-seeking refugees and these terrorists committed attacks across the continent, such as the devastating attacks in Paris and Brussels. Beyond Sharif, Europe offered much proof of concept.

The full story has yet to be plumbed to learn more about how Sharif got through the American cordon, what his motives and intentions were when he entered California through Mexico, and whether opportunities were missed to interdict him prior to the Edmonton attack.

What We Do and Don’t Know

On Sept. 30, 2017, Sharif allegedly drove a vehicle into an Edmonton police officer outside Alberta’s Commonwealth Stadium during a local championship soccer match. Sharif got out of the car and allegedly stabbed the officer before running away. An ISIS flag was found inside the car.

A few hours later, Sharif showed up in downtown Edmonton driving a rented U-Haul cube truck, which he allegedly used to run over four citizens, per incitement propaganda from overseas Islamist extremist groups. The truck overturned after a dramatic chase, and Sharif was arrested. All of his victims survived.

It soon emerged in Canadian Press reporting that Sharif had been smuggled to the Mexico-California border on July 12, 2011. According to reporting by Jonny Wakefield of the Edmonton Journal, Sharif left Somalia in 2008 and traveled through Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Namibia, and Angola before flying to Brazil. (See interactive route map here.) Once in Brazil, Sharif worked at a chicken-processing plant before hiring smugglers to help him continue on to Mexico.

Sharif crossed over from Tijuana to the San Ysidro Port of Entry and claimed asylum. For reasons unknown, U.S. immigration Judge Carmene Depaolo in San Diego, only a month or so later, ordered Sharif to be deported to Somalia instead of granting him asylum. Was Sharif caught lying? Did investigators find derogatory intelligence about him somewhere? Or did Sharif abandon his asylum claim so he could be legally clear to seek status in Canada?

Whatever the case, deportation never happened because no civil authority in Somalia had developed enough to accept deportees from the United States. And because various U.S. court rulings and policies didn’t allow for such stateless people to be indefinitely detained, Sharif was released on an order of supervision. He was supposed to report to ICE regularly but failed to show up on Jan. 24, 2012, because he was in Canada by then, according to Wakefield’s reporting.

Wakefield learned Sharif traveled to Buffalo, New York, and with help from a refugee support group called Vive La Casa, he crossed into Fort Erie, Ontario, on Jan. 9, 2012, and filed a refugee claim that was granted later that year. Canadian immigration officials said database checks uncovered no information about Sharif that raised red flags, a usual finding with Somalis because no records exist on most citizens in that anarchic country. Likewise, Wakefield cited ICE saying Sharif had been found to have “no criminal history,” records of which would not exist.

Within 36 months of entering Canada, though, in 2015, Sharif was on the radar of Canadian intelligence agencies for espousing extremist Islamist views that included genocidal beliefs related to Islamist teachings. The RCMP’s Integrated National Security Enforcement Team found cause to interview Sharif that year. Assistant Commissioner Marlin Degrand told the Toronto Star there was insufficient evidence to charge him at the time.

Questions Worth Asking and Answering

How thoroughly did ICE screen Sharif when he was in custody after crossing the U.S. border?

Did any intelligence failures occur in which Sharif’s background, motives, and connections to U.S.-designated terrorist groups could have been discovered?

What became of Sharif’s American asylum claim?

Did Canada’s immigration services know about Sharif’s deportation order and seek information about that or the fact that Sharif was violating his supervised release terms when he entered Canada?

Sharif spelled his name differently on his Canadian documents than on U.S. documents. Did this matter in some way?

Given that Somalis generally had no government-issued identification of any sort in 2011, how did Sharif obtain the identification documents and visas necessary to clear various customs checkpoints during his journey from Africa to Brazil?

When did Sharif radicalize? Was it before he entered California in 2011 or when Canadian intelligence flagged him for espousing genocidal beliefs in 2015?

One U.S. Committee Demanded an Investigation

In October 2018, during its final hours under Republican control, the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., issued a letter formally requesting that DHS’s Office of Inspector General investigate the Sharif case because “it appears there has been no comprehensive study of the incident.” There’s been no word on whether DHS OIG ever took up the committee’s request.

The committee wanted to know, for instance, how well DHS was vetting special interest aliens for potential terrorism connections (in line with ICE policy to do so), how often such migrants committed asylum fraud and were prosecuted, and how many were released early on bonds before they could undergo threat assessment interviews.

The committee cited a 2011 OIG report (the same year Sharif crossed into California) and a follow-up 2018 OIG report that showed ICE was neither screening nor checking databases for all aliens from countries of national security concern, which would include Somalia.

“The Committee is deeply concerned the vulnerabilities existing in 2011, which allowed this individual to enter, be released, and transit through the U.S. may still exist today,” Gowdy wrote.

What Next?

Alberta prosecutors never charged Sharif under terrorism statutes. Thanks to issues of relevance, it seems unlikely the trial in Edmonton will reveal the kind of information pertinent to American national security and, perhaps, not even to Canadian security.

Prosecutors will be interested mainly in proving that Sharif was behind the wheel of the two vehicles and was the one who stabbed the police officer. A publication ban has blanketed the proceedings, preventing local journalists from reporting anything not in actual court testimony.

The most certain way for America to get the information it needs to protect and serve is for DHS OIG to go forward on the House committee’s request for investigation — or, of course, a full-court investigation by one of our country’s leading media outlets.

Yet no one should expect any coverage of this case from American media, probably because writing about Sharif would require them to emphatically acknowledge a terrorist actually did cross the border and attack. Not to mention that Trump, after all the media ridicule, was correct in saying that potential terrorists have crossed that border and could again.

10 Questions To Ask About Trump’s Removal Of Troops From Syria,"The U.S. foreign policy establishment has gone into meltdown mode since President Trump announced last week a withdrawal of several dozen troops from a corridor in northern Syria. American forces had been there since 2014, joined with a Kurdish splinter group to fight the notorious Sunni Arab terrorist organization, the Islamic State (ISIS).

Trump made his decision after a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but it was a long time coming. The Turks have been critical of U.S. support for an armed Kurdish organization they have considered the country’s most serious national security threat for five years. Trump’s move then should be seen in the context of his efforts to undo Obama administration policies, particularly its initiative to tilt away from traditional U.S. allies, like Turkey, and toward the Islamic Republic of Iran.

The bipartisan anti-Trump din (amplified by prominent GOP lawmakers) denouncing the withdrawal has obscured not only Obama’s disastrous 2014 decision to team with a terrorist organization at war with a NATO member but also basic facts about the ongoing conflict, the region, and the significant actors. The following ten questions are designed to illuminate the central issues for U.S. policy.

1. Who Are ‘the Kurds’?

The Kurds are an ethnic minority spread across the Middle East, from Syria in the West, through Turkey and Iraq, to Iran in the east, and further divided into various political groupings. America’s longtime ally among the Kurds is the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, comprising the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The KRG’s Peshmerga militia has fought alongside U.S. troops in Iraq.

But the present uproar is about an entirely different Kurdish political institution, which the Obama administration tapped in 2014 to fight ISIS—that’s the Democratic Union Party (PYD) with its military wing, the People’s Protection Units (YPG). This is the Syrian franchise of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a Marxist outfit that has been at war with Turkey since 1984. The PKK is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths and is listed by the U.S. State Department, European Union, and Turkey as a terrorist organization.

After Obama administration officials counseled YPG leadership to camouflage the group’s roots in the PKK, they rebranded themselves as the Syrian Democratic Forces. The promise of U.S. arms and funds brought Arabs under the SDF banner, but the organization’s command structure is dominated by the PKK.

2. Why Does Erdogan Hate the Kurds?

Former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen recently told an audience in Chicago that “Turkey’s leadership, Erdogan in particular… would kill every Kurd they possibly could and they’d label them all PKK.”

That’s nonsense. Turkey has Kurdish partners, like the U.S.-allied KDP in northern Iraq. There are between 10 to 15 million Kurds living in Turkey, many of whom support Erdogan. Turks are divided along many lines—the urban middle-class, for instance, tends to support secular political parties, while more traditional Turks prefer Erdogan’s Islamist party—but are unified regarding the terrorist organization the Obama administration armed, trained, and funded, the PKK.

Most American commentators, including Mullen, seem unaware that Erdogan has done more than any other Turkish leader to seek peace with the PKK. When he embarked on a peace process with its leadership in 2012, he came under heavy criticism from the left and right. The ceasefire ended in 2015 when the PKK killed four Turkish policemen.

3. Don’t the Kurds Deserve Their Own State?

There are between 30 and 40 million Kurds in Western Asia inhabiting enclaves in Syria, Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. With the post-World War I dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, there were proposals for Kurdish statehood, but the reason there is no Kurdish state and will likely never be one is not due to the world’s indifference. Rather, it is because of geopolitics.

The Kurdish region as a whole (a.k.a Kurdistan) is land-locked with two major powers on its borders, Turkey and Iran. These former empires have dominated Middle Eastern politics for thousands of years and shaped those of the smaller ethnic groups and tribes around them, including the Kurds.

That’s partly why the Kurds, as a whole, do not have a coherent national project. Power politics demands that smaller polities orient themselves according to the larger powers in whose shadow they live. The less powerful seek patronage from the stronger, to protect themselves and to advance their interests against those of their closest rivals, often from their own community.

Thus, Kurdish factions typically align themselves with one or the other major regional power, Iran or Turkey. The KDP in Iraq, for instance, has ties to Turkey and its rival the PUK has ties to Iran, and fought each other in the mid-‘90s. The PKK’s Syrian franchise is suspected of assassinating Kurdish rivals and refuses a power-sharing arrangement similar to that of the Iraqi Kurds.

It is not the role of foreign governments, including the United States, to formulate a coherent national project on behalf of the Kurds, especially since it would require U.S. troops to enforce it against internal dissent and perhaps civil war, while redrawing regional borders to eliminate historical geopolitical entities, like Turkey.

Even U.S. support for a PKK mini-state in northern Syria would require a permanent U.S. deployment to protect it not only from Turkey but also Arab forces, while Kurdish terrorists chipped away at the geographical integrity and political sovereignty of a NATO member.

4. Does Trump’s Turn Against the PKK Make the U.S. an Unreliable Ally?

Sen. Mitt Romney and others say Trump betrayed the Kurds and thus shows that the United States can’t be trusted as an ally. That’s nonsense. There is no sub-state actor in the world that does not envy the PKK for the gifts Washington showered on it and dream they may someday enjoy the same munificence.

The world long ago accustomed itself to the fact that for all its fine rhetoric the United States, like every other country, pursues its own interests, often subject to the political winds governing the White House. Further, allies and adversaries alike know that no matter what the Americans say about staying the course, one day they will cross one ocean or the other to return home. The game is to get as much as possible from them before they leave.

In this respect, the PKK succeeded beyond its wildest dreams. President Obama, then Trump, armed and funded its efforts to carve out an autonomous zone in northern Syria, for the purpose of building a statelet on the Turkish border to serve as a platform for the group’s long-running war against Ankara. Trump’s withdrawal should now encourage the PKK to end its war and return to the peace process initiated by Erdogan.

5. Didn’t Trump’s Withdrawal help Russia, Iran, and Assad?

Sen. Marco Rubio and others contend that the withdrawal hinders the United States from contesting Iran and its allies. The Pentagon, however, has shown little interest in such a campaign. The Pentagon perceives its vital interest in the Middle East, Africa, and Central and South Asia to be ongoing counterterrorism operations against Sunni fighters, like ISIS.

The PKK has been aligned with anti-U.S. and revolutionary leftist forces since its inception in the mid-1970s.

To conduct those operations, the United States needs the permission of the forces at its back, which in Syria and Iraq is Iran. Of course, if DOD turned on the Iranians it would not only forfeit Tehran’s permission to continue shooting at Sunnis, it would also put the United States in the middle of a shooting war with a nation-state. On the latter, Trump and the Pentagon see eye to eye.

Some policymakers, analysts, and journalists fear the withdrawal pushed our one-time Syrian Kurdish partners into the arms of the Iranian axis. But the PKK has been aligned with anti-U.S. and revolutionary leftist forces since its inception in the mid-1970s. The reasons are ideological and geopolitical.

“Iran influences the PKK because the PKK is based on the Iranian border,” as one PKK official put it. “When you fight a party, you have to find support from some other party.”

Because the PKK is at war with Turkey, it is positioned alongside the Iranian axis. The PKK has been aligned with Moscow and Damascus for decades. Russia, says Erdogan, has armed the PKK throughout the current Syrian conflict. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s father Hafez supported the PKK and even sheltered its founder, Abdullah Ocalan, until Turkey threatened to invade in 1999 and Assad sent him packing. The CIA helped Turkish intelligence capture Ocalan in Kenya.

Trump’s withdrawal did not force the PKK into the arms of the Iranian axis. It merely clarified its historical geostrategic position—which the Obama administration had intentionally obscured.

6. Wasn’t Trump Taking Orders from Erdogan to Withdraw?

For reasons explained above, Erdogan has been complaining about U.S. support of the PKK since Obama first tethered U.S. interests to those of a terror organization. Trump promised the Turkish president several times he would withdraw troops, as recently as January, and finally acted. The decision may help mend U.S.-Turkish relations, which have been badly damaged the last few years, partly because of Erdogan and partly because of U.S. policymakers.

Obama’s signal foreign policy initiative was realigning U.S. policy with Iran’s interests.

The United States not only teamed with the organization Ankara sees as its major security threat, it also shelters Fetullah Gulen, the leader of a cult-like religious and educational movement widely believed to be responsible for a failed July 2016 coup that left more than 300 dead.

Gulen has been living in the Pennsylvania mountains since 1999. His application for permanent resident status was rejected by George W. Bush administration immigration officials, a decision overturned by a federal court. Ankara wants him returned so it can put him on trial, but Washington believes the Turks have not provided enough evidence to extradite a U.S. green-card holder.

But it is the Syrian conflict that has most tested U.S.-Turkey relations. For Erdogan, it represents another direct threat to the stability of Turkey, now host to more than three million Syrian refugees. For a time, it appeared to Erdogan that the United States agreed with him that Assad was a problem. But Obama had other ideas.

Obama’s signal foreign policy initiative was realigning U.S. policy with Iran’s interests. That meant downgrading relations with traditional U.S. allies, especially Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, and privileging Iran. The mechanism designed to clinch realignment was the nuclear deal, which simply incentivized the Iranians to hold off on completing a bomb until Obama left office.

To get the Iranians to accept his offer of friendship and more than $100 billion in sanctions relief, Obama acknowledged, as he put it, Iranian “equities” in Syria, meaning Assad and Iran’s Lebanese partner, Hezbollah. Rather than jeopardize realignment, Obama protected Assad, which came at the expense of traditional American allies, including Turkey.

7. Is Erdogan Really a U.S. Ally?

Under Erdogan, Turkey, a NATO member since 1952, has of late often been a very difficult U.S. partner. To take only the most recent example, last year Ankara pushed an intelligence operation designed to damage Trump’s relations with another U.S. Middle East ally. After a team of Saudi operatives killed Saudi national Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, Erdogan used the murder as a platform to embarrass Riyadh, with the ultimate goal of forcing Saudi crown prince and Trump ally Mohamed bin Salman from power.

To contain Iran, Turkey is an essential partner.

Erdogan has also caused problems for another key U.S. ally, Israel. Before Erdogan, Ankara and Jerusalem enjoyed a strategic relationship. For the time being at least, Erdogan has destroyed that alliance, choosing instead to support Israel’s foes, like Hamas, even giving sanctuary to at least one senior Hamas official directly responsible for terror attacks on Israeli civilians.

Israel rightly considers Erdogan an enemy, and Saudi Arabia sees him as an irritant or worse. But as the superpower partner, the United States has to manage a larger regional file, which happens to touch directly on Israeli and Saudi vital interests. Jerusalem and Riyadh agree that their main problem is Iran.

By getting out of the nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposing sanctions on the Islamic Republic, Trump showed that he, too, sees the Iranians as the major threat to regional and global instability. To contain Iran, Turkey is an essential partner. With the second-largest army in NATO, a major airbase at Incirlik, and naval bases on key waterways, Washington needs Ankara to carry part of that load—especially to avoid, as Trump has promised, sending more troops to the Middle East.

8. Isn’t the Anti-ISIS Campaign the U.S.’s Vital Interest in the Middle East?

Sen. Mitch McConnell says if ISIS is “permitted to regroup and establish havens, they will bring terror to our shores.” If so, the failure of leadership is not Trump’s alone but must be shared by lawmakers, including senior GOP officials like McConnell, who will then have failed to ensure the security of our maritime and other borders.

According to the Department of Defense, keeping Americans safe at home requires granting visas to foreign nationals from terror zones whose identities cannot be verified.

The Pentagon may see fighting ISIS as its vital interest, but the group is not a strategic threat to the United States. Many policymakers see the anti-ISIS campaign as a political chip to be used in the event of terrorist attacks at home. An attack attributed to or inspired by ISIS would expose any administration to catastrophic political fallout. The anti-ISIS campaign abroad gives evidence, should any attack occur at home, that the White House had been pursuing terrorist threats aggressively.

As former Pentagon chief James Mattis told Trump when the president complained about deploying so many troops abroad, “Sir, we’re doing it to prevent a bomb from going off in Times Square.”

But the first line of defense against attacks at home is home defenses. During the second intifada, for instance, Israel built a separation barrier as it sent forces beyond the wall to fight terror. By contrast, the national security establishment’s support for Trump’s border wall and travel ban is mixed, at best.

The Pentagon, for instance, compelled the White House to remove Iraq from the travel ban list. Senior officials reasoned that the United States needed the support of its Iraqi partners to fight ISIS. That is, according to the Department of Defense, keeping Americans safe at home requires granting visas to foreign nationals from terror zones whose identities cannot be verified.

When the national security bureaucracies and Democratic and Republican lawmakers give Trump’s border security initiatives their full support, they’ll show their priority is not an endless counterterror campaign abroad but keeping Americans safe at home.

9. Why Did Obama Partner with the PKK?

If ISIS isn’t a strategic threat, why did Obama partner with a terrorist group to fight it? Trump’s predecessor became politically vulnerable when, after he withdrew from Iraq, ISIS began to expand its sway across the region in a campaign that included the slaughter of minority populations and the murder of two American journalists.

Obama partnered with a terror group as part of a larger initiative to align U.S. interests with those of a state sponsor of terror.

The Obama administration further saw the anti-ISIS operation as an opportunity to advance its larger strategy: integrating U.S. and Iranian interests.

In Iraq, the Obama administration had an easy solution at hand—it worked with the army, under command of the Iranian-allied central government, and the Iranian-backed People’s Mobilization Forces. The anti-ISIS campaign was often just cover for a war of revenge against Iraq’s Sunni community. Sunnis who fought against Iraq’s Iranian-backed security architecture were designated as extremists—i.e., ISIS—and targeted by U.S. forces in coordination with Iranian proxies.

Syria was trickier. Obama could not openly work with an Assad regime murdering civilians on an industrial scale. The catch was to identify a proxy force that would target neither Assad’s nor Iranian forces. The PKK was ideal. It was not going to fight Assad and it was at war with Turkey. Thus, arming the PKK would tie Erdogan down and distract him from pursuing Ankara’s primary interest—containing the regime in Damascus.

Obama didn’t team with the PKK to fight another terror group. Rather, he partnered with a terror group as part of a larger initiative to align U.S. interests with those of a state sponsor of terror, Iran.

10. How Could the U.S. Foreign Policy Establishment Get It So Wrong?

It’s not hard to see why Democrats and their allied media attacked Trump. The president pulled the plug on an Obama initiative to integrate American and Iranian interests. Why Republican lawmakers and the GOP’s institutional infrastructure also went after Trump is more distressing.

Trump’s decision highlights the incoherence of his critics, who appear to believe that backing a Marxist splinter group aligned with the anti-American, pro-Iranian axis in its war against a NATO ally is sound policy. Trump also deserves credit for taking on the Pentagon.

In the three years it took to extricate U.S. troops from the fiasco in northern Syria that Obama designed, Trump must have seen that the Swamp’s center of gravity is not the intelligence community that continues to plot against him, but the world’s most influential bureaucracy.

The Defense Department fought withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Syria because the anti-ISIS campaign helps feed the Beltway.

The Defense Department fought withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Syria because the anti-ISIS campaign helps feed the Beltway—the defense industry and the various other agencies, contractors, and nongovernmental organizations whose missions are shaped by an open-ended campaign abroad to fight Sunni Arab irregulars—that is, ISIS and anyone Iran and its proxies designate as ISIS.

Trump simply saw U.S. support for the PKK for what it was: America fighting and paying to advance the interests of someone else, in this case U.S. adversaries, like Iran, Assad, and Russia. The complaint of Trump critics that the withdrawal will, conversely, benefit all warring sides—Iran and ISIS, Ankara and Moscow, etc.—is impossible to reconcile with the logic of conflict.

That Trump’s withdrawal showed more strategic clarity than the foreign policy establishment is hardly surprising. He ran against Washington’s post-9/11 foreign policies in the Middle East, in particular novelty items like Bush’s freedom agenda and Obama’s Iran deal.

From Trump’s perspective, those policies defined the divide between the Beltway bubble and the rest of the U.S. public that saw no wisdom in enriching an Iranian regime at war or spending American lives and money to promote democracy in places like Iraq, Lebanon, or the Palestinian territories where elections were certain to empower anti-American forces.

Partnering with a terrorist faction of a sub-state actor at war with a NATO member is in the same category of objectively foolhardy and self-defeating policies. That many Republicans appear to have learned nothing in the last 19 years and chose to join Democrats in protest against the withdrawal shows that the divide is much more profound than even Trump had imagined. It is not only the American public from which the Beltway establishment is separated, but reality.

Washington Post Writes Glowing Obituary For World’s Most Brutal Terrorist,"President Donald Trump announced the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Sunday morning in an address to the nation after a Saturday night raid in northwest Syria.

“He died like a dog, he died like a coward,” Trump said.

Baghdadi’s death marks the execution of the world’s most dangerous terrorist since Osama Bin Laden’s killing in 2011. Baghdadi, the founder of the Islamic State, otherwise known as “ISIS” or “ISIL,” oversaw the extrajudicial killings of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig and Muadh al-Kasasbeh capturing international attention in addition to the slaughtering of hundreds more.

The obituary from the Washington Post however, framed one of the world’s most brutal terrorists as an “austere religious scholar.”

“Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State, dies at 48,” read the initial published headline from one of America’s leading newspapers.

The headline published was actually the second headline picked by the paper, which at first read, “Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Islamic State’s ‘terrorist-in-chief,’ dies at 48.”

https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1188473675894284289?s=20

The headline has since been changed to “Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, extremist leader of Islamic State, dies at 48.”

While the Post eventually made the headline somewhat better, though they were spot-on the first time, the obituary still reads remarkably well-disposed touting the ISIS leader’s academic credentials and career building his vast terrorist empire responsible for torturing countless innocent people.

The Post, after chronicling Baghdadi’s rise to power, waited until the 40th paragraph of the obituary to mention Baghdadi was also a serial rapist for much of the last decade.

“Later, former hostages would reveal that Mr. Baghdadi also kept a number of personal sex slaves during his years as the Islamic State’s leader, including slain American hostage Kayla Mueller and a number of captured Yazidi women. U.S. officials corroborated the accounts,” the Post wrote.",https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/27/washington-post-writes-glowing-obituary-for-worlds-most-dangerous-terrorist/,2019-10-27
"The Washington Post’s Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Week","Considering the current state of our media class, cataloging a single newspaper’s patterns of journalistic malpractice is a seemingly pointless task. And yet, when a publication claims to be the purveyor of preventing our democracy from dying in darkness, the importance of cataloging its very dark week becomes imperative — you know, for democracy’s sake.

Here’s how the Washington Post’s banner week in bad journalism went down.

Sunday

It started on Sunday with a bizarre obituary for the world’s most wanted terrorist, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Someone decided the original headline that labeled Baghdadi a “terrorist-in-chief” needed to be sugar-coated and changed to “austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State.”

Social media exploded with similar versions of satirical headlines announcing the deaths of infamous historical figures, including the vegetarian Adolf Hitler and noted traveler Genghis Khan. A spokesperson for the paper, Kristine Coratti Kelly, later tweeted, “Regarding our al-Baghdadi obituary, the headline should never have read that way and we changed it quickly.” The headline was amended again to “extremist leader.”

""Jeffrey Dahmer, connoisseur of exotic and locally sourced meats, dies at 34"" #WaPoDeathNotices pic.twitter.com/tkJWf0iLcY — Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) October 27, 2019

Nevertheless, the sympathetic portrayal of the ISIS founder remained in the first paragraph of the obituary.

When Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took the reins of the Islamic State of Iraq in 2010, few had heard of the organization or its new leader, then an austere religious scholar with wire-frame glasses and no known aptitude for fighting and killing.

It’s still unclear what the Post is referring to when it says “scholar.” Baghdadi graduated from Saddam Hussein’s “Saddam University,” a propaganda program for radicalizing Islamists, but is not an author or scholar of any works other than ISIS recruitment videos.

Monday

On Monday, the judge who previously threw out Covington Catholic teen Nick Sandmann’s $250 million defamation lawsuit against the Washington Post reversed course and reinstated the case after reviewing an amended complaint.

The Post, which thought it was off the hook for its misreporting, will now enter the discovery phase, where it will likely be forced to hand over internal communications on its reporting of Sandmann and his classmates at the March for Life in January.

Senior Contributor at The Federalist Margot Cleveland explained how the presiding judge is reconsidering the Post’s decision to run with the unverified account of Native American elder Nathan Phillips and to portray Sandmann as a smirking, MAGA-hat-wearing racist.

Judge Bertelsman then noted that after giving “this matter careful review,” he had decided that Sandmann sufficiently alleged a claim for defamation against the Post based on the statements identified as “Statements 10, 11, and 33,” “to the extent that these three statements state that plaintiff ‘blocked’ Nathan Phillips and ‘would not allow him to retreat.’” All three statements consisted of the Washington Post repeating Phillips’s fabled encounter with Sandmann. In what was identified as Statement 10, the Washington Post wrote: “It was getting ugly, and I was thinking: ‘I’ve got to find myself an exit out of this situation and finish my song at the Lincoln Memorial,’ Phillips recalled.”

Later that day, Washington Post opinion writer Max Boot churned out another offensive terrorist take, insinuating blowing up three children with a suicide vest proves ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was not a coward.

“Trump could not possibly have heard ‘whimpering and crying’ on the overhead imagery because there was no audio, and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pointedly refused to confirm those details. The assertion that Baghdadi died as a coward was, in any case, contradicted by the fact that rather than be captured, he blew himself up,” Boot wrote.

The Washington Post was forced to issue a correction after backlash from people pointing out just how far Boot will go, evidently to the point of praising a terrorist, just to oppose any successes of President Trump.

“An earlier version of this column included a sentence questioning whether Trump was right to call Baghdadi a coward because he blew himself up,” the paper said. “The line was removed because it unintentionally conveyed the impression that I considered Baghdadi courageous.”

Tuesday

On Tuesday, Washington Post editors, who love to write about the importance of a free press and the First Amendment, green-lighted an op-ed calling for government censorship via hate speech laws.

https://twitter.com/HashtagGriswold/status/1189255557405917184

Richard Stengel, a former editor of Time magazine who then went to work in the Obama administration, writes that the “underpinning of the First Amendment was engineered for a simpler era,” and warned against the “damaging” impact of hate speech.

And as if one bizarre op-ed wasn’t enough for Tuesday, the Post also published a piece by Democrat Lanny Davis and Republican Anthony Scaramucci arguing for the impeachment of Trump without a Senate trial.

If such public announcements of open-mindedness by at least 20 Republican jurors do not occur within a month or so after the House impeachment resolution, then we suggest a Senate trial would be a waste of time and unwise.

Forget evidence and due process, that’s just a waste of time!

Wednesday

On Wednesday, the Post’s “conservative” columnist Jennifer Rubin took a beatdown from CBS News journalist Jan Crawford on Twitter after Rubin tried to smart off with disparaging comments about Trump’s judicial nominees.

Rubin tweeted HuffPost links digging up something Judge Neomi Rao wrote in college.

Whats your point here? Are you saying 46-yr-old Neomi Rao lacks experience to be a judge because of something she wrote when she was in college at Yale 25 years ago? That’s your standard for experience? https://t.co/rCXMUHyXD5 — Jan Crawford (@JanCBS) October 31, 2019

Of course, Rubin proclaimed Justice Elena Kagan was an exception to the rule, but Crawford swiftly put an end to her ludicrous argument:

Haha. Nope. You’re not doing that straw man crap with me. I said it was wrong to paint all these judges with a broad brush as unqualified, wrong to say Republicans don’t take judges seriously. That is factual and something everyone should be aware of https://t.co/KV5gpPaeDD — Jan Crawford (@JanCBS) October 31, 2019

Thursday

A top National Security Council official, Tim Morrison, who listened to President Donald Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky, testified in front of Congress on Thursday. But that morning, ahead of the testimony, senior political reporter Aaron Blake reported that Morrison would confirm acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor’s account that Trump appeared to seek a quid pro quo.

https://twitter.com/AaronBlake/status/1189895999143194624

In fact, the opposite happened. Morrison noted the multiple false assertions made by Taylor, and testified that he never thought anything illegal was discussed on the phone call.

Another headline from the Post on Thursday read, “Trump judicial nominee cries over scathing letter from American Bar Association.” The story was about how a judicial nominee for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, Lawrence VanDyke, got choked up in his hearing when senators asked him about a disparaging letter written by the chair of an ABA committee.

https://twitter.com/conncarroll/status/1189868589060411394?s=19

The story explained concerns with the letter from both Republican and Democratic senators about the origins of the ABA letter. The ABA’s evaluator, Montana Attorney Marcia Davenport, has a history of politically opposing VanDyke. Judicial Crisis Network’s Carrie Severino points out, “A search of Montana’s campaign electronic reporting system shows that in 2014 Davenport contributed $150 to Michael Wheat, VanDyke’s opponent when he ran for a seat on the Montana Supreme Court.”

The Post’s report did not name Davenport until the very last paragraph.

Lastly, the Post did not want to get left out of Thursday’s action in which the entire White House press corps committed to debunking the “doctored” photo Trump tweeted of the Special Forces dog that chased down terrorist al-Baghdadi.

https://twitter.com/AlexHortonTX/status/1189633693738029056

Without this deep dive, the American people would have been led astray to believe Trump was draping a medal of honor around the German Shepherd’s neck.

There is simply no way to take the media seriously when they fact-check obvious jokes. No one thinks Trump actually gave a medal to a dog. No one actually thinks Allie Stuckey interviewed AOC. No one actually believes the Babylon Bee is non-satire. https://t.co/2hFfkpBwC6 — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) October 31, 2019

Friday

Finally, to top its banner week off, the Post ran a glitzy profile of Congressman Adam Schiff in the “Style” section, fawning over how his dreams of becoming a screenplay writer have transitioned into becoming “the chief storyteller of this drama-filled political moment.”

He’s in charge of calling witnesses, taking depositions and subpoenaing documents. More than that, it’s his job to stitch it all together into a believable, easy-to-follow narrative. Imagine the pitch meeting: It’s like “The Manchurian Candidate,” except the president has heel spurs. It’s “The Godfather” meets “Borat.”

Of course Schiff is more than a storyteller. He’s a corrupt liar and has been spinning his stories of collusion on CNN for three years now, and more recently has even implicated himself in his own web of lies.

Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, told The Federalist, “Schiff is using his authority as a chairman presiding over an impeachment inquiry to prevent the investigation and discovery of facts about his own actions or the actions of his staff.”

Unfortunately, the facts are too convenient for reporter Ben Terris, who writes, “Political storytelling is often more like writing a movie script than laying out an exhaustive account of known knowns and known unknowns.”

Terris catalogs the hate aimed at Schiff from Republican members and conservative media outlets, but leaves out any reasons Schiff might be hated. He instead focuses on painting Schiff as a character from “The Big Lebowski” and interviewing Schiff’s mentors about his screenplays.

There was the Holocaust-era screenplay the congressman wrote, called “Remnant.” There was “Minotaur,” the courtroom drama with this mysterious plot: While a jury deliberates a gruesome murder, and with the suspect locked away, someone commits an identical crime. And when Schiff was getting deeper and deeper into the world of intelligence in Congress, he worked on a spy thriller.

It’s understandable why some journalists would want to misconstrue facts, make knowingly deceptive omissions, write columns defending terrorists, or start tweetstorms about topics they have little knowledge of but plenty of bias to project, but it’s unclear why Washington Post journalists would participate in such antics with the fate of democracy on the line. Here’s to trying again next week.

Update: This article originally stated that a story about judicial nominee Lawrence VanDyke left out information regarding an ABA letter that a political opponent of VanDyke contributed to. The story did include this information.

Smuggler Trafficked Six People From Terrorist Hotbed Over U.S. Border,"Often lost in the discussion of hundreds of thousands of Central Americans pouring over the southern border is that migrants from Muslim-majority countries where Islamist terrorist groups operate arrive among them almost every day. The corporate media hates talking about this. But most border-crossers show up without any identification and little vetting, giving rise to U.S. national security efforts to stifle this human traffic for fear of terrorist infiltration, a threat about which I have written extensively.

Every so often, smugglers of migrants from countries of national security concern — known in government parlance as “special interest aliens” — are caught and brought to American justice. Such was the case last week, when a federal judge in a Del Rio, Texas, courtroom empty of news reporters sentenced a Mexico-based Jordanian smuggler named Moayad Heider Mohammad Aldairi to three years in the federal penitentiary on a guilty plea.

His case is interesting because it briefly illuminates a fascinating kind of American counterterrorism-immigration operation reporters must do acrobatic yoga to avoid covering. The Aldairi case also demonstrates why this exotic sort of human smuggling presents a national security threat to the homeland and has spawned James Bondian foreign efforts to take other Aldairis offline.

Who Were the Yemenis Aldairi Smuggled?

Before a complex, multinational Immigration and Customs Enforcement-Homeland Security Investigations dragnet snagged Aldairi last year at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, he ran a business that in 2017 smuggled over the Mexico-Texas border at least six Yemenis for whom he was charged. He likely brought in many more than that.

That at least six unknown and unvetted Yemenis were smuggled over the Texas border from Mexico should be a recognizable problem on its face, although it’s often denied as perfectly innocent immigration that nativist right-wingers baselessly play up. Yemen is embroiled in a civil war in which one major armed faction, which controlled sizable chunks of territory, is al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

Throughout the 2018 prosecution of Aldairi, U.S. prosecutors wouldn’t say whether any of the Yemenis that Aldairi smuggled through Latin America were part of al-Qaeda or their victims. But San Antonio Express-News reporter Guillermo Contreras reported this spring that “law enforcement sources” told the newspaper “some of the six Yemenis” that successfully crossed into Texas were on the U.S. terror watch list. Federal law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the investigation have told me the same.

Where they are today and how serious a threat the Yemenis posed is only narrowly known, although my sources told me that at least three of the six remain inside the United States. I’m guessing those would be cooperating witnesses against Aldairi and that one or more of the other three were the terror suspects.

Special Interest Alien Smugglers Are Sophisticated

They would hardly be the first known or suspected terrorists to have reached the U.S. southern border. It’s a fairly regular occurrence, and that’s why special interest alien smuggling worries homeland security officials on a nonpartisan basis, as evidenced by President Barack Obama’s most senior appointees taking strong action to shut it down in 2016. Watch-listed suspects and those not watch-listed arrive annually among at least several thousand special interest aliens (SIAs) who show up every year at the southern border.

Aldairi is typical of SIA smugglers in that they are pretty sophisticated internationalists not easily replaceable when taken offline. He is a Jordanian national with dual Mexican citizenship, dual residencies, and multiple languages. In addition to Arabic, Aldairi spoke Russian, Spanish, and English.

Prior court prosecutions of SIA smugglers show many hold dual citizenships, are multilingual, and have managed to corrupt government bureaucrats in key locations. This combination of skillsets is necessary to run intercontinental smuggling businesses that require air travel and crossing potentially dozens of borders over vast distances and time frames. So when American authorities take out one of these guys, not too many replacements are in line to take over.

Aldairi was fairly clever in ways we should expect. For example, he provided hard hats and reflective yellow vests to his Yemeni clients so they would look like construction workers who belonged on the Texas side of the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass.

U.S. Homeland Security Agencies Are Targeting the Threat

U.S. homeland security agencies have so seriously regarded illicit migration to U.S. land borders from Muslim-majority countries that after 9/11, the U.S. government passed legislation that required smuggling interdiction programs to take out people like Aldairi. One of the main efforts to reduce the threat was the deployment of ICE-Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI) all over Latin America, backed by the intelligence efforts of other outfits, such as the U.S. Southern Command. That’s who got Aldairi.

The last year has been particularly good for ICE-HSI doing this work, although you wouldn’t know it from corporate reporting. The most recent damage was doled out when Brazilian federal police in Sao Paulo rolled up three notorious smugglers: a Somali, an Algerian, and an Iranian based in Brazil.

They were responsible for transporting immigrants from countries of national security concern to the U.S. southern border for years, including, according to Brazilian media, “two Somalis arrested by the US police over suspected terrorism.” Hence the homeland security importance of targeting special interest alien smuggling networks such as these. Some others include:

Two Mexico-based Bangladeshi smugglers who worked closely with co-conspirators in Brazil and beyond to smuggle in large numbers of Bangladeshis, one of the most prevalent nationalities being moved over the U.S. border. One smuggler worked at the Guatemala border, while the other was based in northern Mexico. On Thursday, the Department of Justice announced the arrest of a third co-conspirator in Brazil who fed migrants to a conveyor belt that constantly moved South Asians through Central America and Mexico.

A former Afghan interpreter for the U.S. Army, New Jersey resident Mujeeb Rahman Saify, was charged with crimes related to him facilitating the smuggling of at least two other Afghans to the Texas border, one of whom chose to enter this way because he had been terminated from Army service “for being a security risk based on his association with a foreign intelligence service.” Both of the smuggled Afghans actually made it over the Texas border.

A Brazil-based Somali smuggler, Mohamed Abdi Siyad, a.k.a. “Hassan,” was accused in a criminal complaint of transporting many dozens of Somalis and other Horn of Africa migrants — Islamic extremists potentially among them — from Africa through Latin America and on to both the California and Texas borders. Hassan reportedly is not in U.S. custody yet, but because of the ICE-HSI pressure, he is out of service in Brazil and the subject of an extradition process to retrieve him from Canada (probably a long story there).

A notorious Costa Rican smuggler known as “Mama Africa,” who I’m told worked with the Brazilian smugglers and Hassan, was finally arrested after years of moving migrants from Muslim-majority nations as an important link in the smuggling chain. She and her family and associates moved migrants regarded as higher risk to Honduras by boat, then to Guatemala and Mexico.

The Aldairi Case Is a Win for U.S. Counterterrorism

It’s unclear why U.S. prosecutors threaded the needle around Aldairi’s smuggling of watch-listed Yemenis into Texas; U.S. Attorney John Bash of the Western District of Texas declined an interview request. They could have sought a more serious material support charge or threw a terrorism enhancement request to the judge. Soon Aldairi will be a free man, probably back in Mexico with his wife and son in Monterrey in a couple of years with time served.

But still, this is a win for our side in counterterrorism, and it’s not just me saying why.

In a prepared DOJ press release, Bash showed he does understand what this was about. “This case vividly illustrates how border security is a key component of national security,” he said in the release. “We simply must know the identities of every individual crossing our southern border, particularly those who are nationals of countries where terrorist organizations operate freely.”

2020 Dems Are Silent After Terrorists Fire Hundreds Of Rockets On Israel,"Over the past three days, our closest ally in the Middle East has endured a barrage of rockets from its Islamic jihadist neighbors in Gaza, resulting in the closing of Tel Aviv schools for the first time since 1990. In the early hours of Tuesday morning in Shajaiyah in Gaza City, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) assassinated Baha Abu al-Ata, a top commander of the Gaza terror group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a strike which has resulted in violent retaliatory measures against Israel on the part of the PIJ.

Though Hamas is the terrorist organization currently exercising political control over Gaza, their absolute hold over the region has been more tenuous in recent years. And the Iran-backed PIJ has capitalized on this weakening of power, rising to fill the resulting power vacuum from Hamas’ decline.

Yet, despite the hundreds of rockets launched at civilian centers throughout the southern part of Israel, only four of the top 10 2020 Democratic contenders bothered to comment—former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Kamala Harris (who commented only when approached), Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Notably absent were frontrunners Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT).

Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist threats. It is intolerable that Israeli civilians live their lives under the constant fear of rocket attacks. That's why our administration was such a strong supporter of Israel's life-saving Iron Dome. https://t.co/aQOUdKZqq7 — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) November 12, 2019

I strongly condemn the rocket attacks on the citizens of southern and central Israel. Israel has a right to defend itself against acts of terror that set back any progress towards peace and will only serve to inflame the humanitarian situation in Gaza. — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) November 13, 2019

The irony of this silence from top primary contenders such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-VT., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA., is that they have no problem rustling up commentary on Israel when it is to lecture Israel on its immigration policy or to challenge Israel’s understanding of its own territorial claims.

Indeed, many of the Democratic contenders expressed public anger at Israel’s denial of entry to Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-MI., and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-MN., who were refused admittance under Israel’s Entry into Israel Law due to their BDS activities (which included the proposal of a pro-BDS bill in U.S. Congress). Though Israel’s decision was largely the result of adhering to laws already in place, public chastising on the part of the Left was swift and severe.

Democrats prefer to discuss Israel only when they can condemn Israel. When the matter involves terrorists threatening Israeli lives, these usually outspoken Democratic leaders are strangely mute. If they are so invested in Israel’s future, as they would like audiences to believe through their perpetual criticism of Israeli policy, why are they so stunningly silent now? Furthermore, isn’t it possible that the very policies they routinely criticize are the result of complex factors, like nearby terrorist factions launching hundreds of rockets, and that it would behoove them to acknowledge such attacks like the current one? Apparently, no.

In July, after Elizabeth Warren hired a pro-Hamas, anti-Israel aide named Max Berger and remained unabashedly mum about her decision, it became obvious that the far-Left’s hatred of Israel (and of really anything professing Enlightenment values) had begun to infect the upper echelons of the Democratic Party. The argument made at the time largely holds true in the current moment, as well.

Warren’s failure to comment on Berger’s support for anti-Semitic terrorists reveals a watershed moment in Warren’s campaign. To speak is an act, but in the world of campaigns, to remain silent may require equal deliberation. It seems here is no exception. It is likely Warren sees an opportunity to remain silent about Berger as a way of offering tacit support to the far-left, anti-Israel progressives of her base…[S]he is able to shore up support from radical anti-Israel groups by simply saying nothing.

The silence of Democratic leaders speaks volumes about where the more progressive elements of the party are today, given that ignoring hundreds of terrorist rockets raining down on our strongest ally likely takes some effort. It seems both Warren and Sanders have found ducktaping themselves to be a fruitful endeavor—it endears them to their anti-Israel (and for some, anti-Semitic) base in a way that nothing else could.

If Trump Designates Cartels As Terrorists He Should Go To War With Them,"In an interview posted online Tuesday, President Trump said he would designate Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, marking a major shift in U.S. policy toward Mexico, where cartels now exercise effective control of much of the country.

In the interview, with former Fox News has Bill O’Reilly, Trump said his administration has been working on the designation for the last 90 days, well before the massacre of nine American women and children on November 4 by cartel gunmen in the Mexican state of Sonora, not far from the U.S. border. The victims, some as young as eight months old, were members of the LeBaron family, a Mormon community that’s lived and farmed in northern Mexico for decades. One woman was shot point blank as she begged for her children’s lives.

The brazen killings, along with the spectacular defeat of a detachment of Mexican National Guard troops by heavily armed Sinaloa cartel forces in the city of Culiacan in October, have brought increased public attention to violence in Mexico’s and the country’s descent into cartel wardlordlism. Homicides have been at record high the last two years, and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has no real plan to combat the cartels or deal with the violence, instead he repeats his facile campaign slogan of “hugs, not bullets.”

Trump’s designation comes just as lawmakers in Washington, D.C. are waking up to the reality that Mexico is in crisis. On Monday, Sens. Ben Sasse and Mike Lee sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and FBI Director Christopher Wray urging them to level sanctions on the Mexican drug cartels responsible for the massacre.

“While we wait for these butchers to be identified and brought to justice,” the senators wrote, they want the Trump administration to “consider the full and creative use of existing sanction authority” in these departments, citing sanction authority currently authorized under the Kingpin Act and the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.

This is a slightly different approach than the one proposed by House Republicans like Rep. Chip Roy, who in March introduced a bill that would designate drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. The freshman congressman, who represents a Texas district not far from the U.S.-Mexico border, has been outspoken about the need to secure the southwest border and combat powerful cartels that Roy says have “operational control” over the border.

Although the bill languished after Roy introduced it, the killing of the American family by cartel gunmen has renewed interest in the proposal. Roy recently told The Daily Caller that there’s been “significant interest” in the bill, which has been adding co-sponsors in recent weeks. And just this week, the LeBaron family launched an official White House petition to designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, as well as a website to raise awareness about the deteriorating conditions in Mexico.

It’s Going to Take More Than Sanctions

Trump, along with Lee, Sasse, and Roy all have the right idea, and it’s certainly worth considering both sanctions on individuals and an official designation of cartels as foreign terrorist organizations as initial steps. But whatever the policies are, the goal should be to send a message to the cartels and the Mexican government that killing any Americans in Mexico will come at a very high cost. That might mean sanctions and freezing U.S. assets of certain cartel-connected businessman and government officials in Mexico, but it could also mean something more robust.

If we’re going to treat cartels like terrorist groups, then there’s no reason not to go after their leaders and networks just as we go after ISIS and al-Qaeda. Unilateral, no-permission special forces raids into Pakistan and Syria took out Osama bin Laden and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and similar capture-or-kill missions could be launched into northern Mexico against the cartels responsible for the LeBaron massacre. Such a move, while certain to provoke international outrage, would nevertheless send a clear message to the cartels that killing Americans isn’t worth it.

Currently, the FBI is assisting Mexican authorities in their investigation of the killings, at Mexico’s request. But let’s be honest: cartel crimes almost always go unpunished in Mexico, where less than 15 percent of murder cases are ever even brought to court. The Mexican government’s investigation will almost certainly come to nothing, with or without FBI involvement.

To be sure, going to war directly with the cartels would be a major foreign policy and national security undertaking, and it would come with considerable risk. But what’s certain is that the status quo in Mexico is untenable. Whether treating Mexican drug cartels like terrorist groups takes the form of sanctioning them or going to war with them, the United States can no longer ignore them.

Dem Presidential Hopefuls Meet With Terrorist-Run Pay-To-Slay Group,"“There’s no other conference like this,” the Coalition for Civil Freedoms (CCF) claimed ahead of its ninth annual Family Conference and Lobby Day in Washington D.C. last month. You can say that again.

CCF is a legal advocacy and support group founded by a convicted terrorist that functions as a de facto “martyrs fund” for American jihadists and their families. Would-be suicide bombers, terrorism financiers, and jihadist recruiters can rest easy knowing that CCF will pay their prison commissary and provide for their families should they end up on the wrong side of the law.

However, this “pay-to-slay” program doesn’t seem to alarm a handful of U.S. lawmakers and their staff — including the office of Democratic presidential frontrunner Sen. Elizabeth Warren — who welcomed CCF to Capitol Hill on October 28 and lent a sympathetic ear to this terrorist fan club and lobby group.

CCF spent three days grooming terrorist next-of-kin on how to effectively lobby Congress, before parading this delegation through the Capitol Building to meet with U.S. lawmakers and propose legislation. The Entrapment and Government Overreach (EGO) Rel͏i͏ef Act would deprive law enforcement of some of the most effective prosecutorial tools at their disposal, effectively prohibiting the use of undercover informants and decriminalizing material support for terrorism.

But that’s not the worst of it. “If the EGO bill passes, it may be possible to bring many, if not most, preemptive cases back into court to be reevaluated under the new standards imposed by EGO,” said Leena Al-Arian, CCF associate director and the daughter of CCF founder and President Sami Al-Arian.

Al-Arian has a personal stake in reversing terrorism convictions. He pleaded guilty in 2006 to conspiring “to make or receive contributions of funds, goods or services to or for the benefit of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a Specially Designated Terrorist.” The former University of South Florida professor was later deported to Turkey, where he gave a speech in a 2018 calling the United States “our enemy.” Qatar, which consistently offers a haven to terrorist leaders from Hamas and the Taliban, continues to provide the elder Al-Arian a platform to demonize Israel and the West.

Although Al-Arian couldn’t join his daughter in Washington, authorities temporarily released accused Hamas leader Abdelhaleem Ashqar from house arrest so he could attend the CCF function. Ashqar was accused of being “a critical communication conduit for the Hamas enterprise,” and a 1993 FBI raid of his apartment turned up “a treasure trove of Hamas-related documents.” He served 11 years in prison for refusing to testify before a grand jury subpoena regarding Hamas activities in the United States, a sign of his continued loyalty to the foreign terrorist organization.

Other family members attended the lobby on behalf of their imprisoned loved ones. CCF coordinator Ashley Young, sister to former Metro Transit Police Officer Nicholas Young, was a part of the delegation. Her brother was sentenced to 15 years in prison for sending prepaid phone cards that he believed ISIS would use for jihadist recruitment.

Terrorism is a family affair for CCF board member Hawa Wehelie, who also attended the conference and lobby. Her brother, Yusuf Wehelie, was sentenced in 2017 to 10 years in prison for illegally transporting high-powered weapons. Her father was fired as an FBI linguist and charged with interfering in an investigation involving Al Shabaab militants, and another brother was placed on a no-fly list in 2010 for making suspicious trips to Yemen.

Besides Warren’s office, CCF met with North Carolina Rep. David Price (D) and possibly a handful of other lawmakers. Based on social media pictures, it appears that the Islamist coalition engaged with Sens. Dick Durbin (D-IL), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Roy Blunt (R-MO), or members of their staff. Another presidential hopeful, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), was photographed in June with CCF activists, who provided him a copy of their EGO bill.

This bipartisan group didn’t need to research terrorism case law to understand with whom they were consorting. CCF is composed of various Islamist factions that are demonstrably tied to jihadist organizations.

For instance, the Florida branch of the Council on American Islamic Relations is perhaps the most radical chapter of a nationwide extremist group acknowledged in civil court as a “terrorist supporting front organization.” In 2014, its Florida members held a pro-Hamas rally outside the Israeli consulate in Miami, where attendees shouted: “We are Hamas!” and “Hamas kicked your -ss!”

The Islamic Circle of North America’s (ICNA) Council for Social Justice also falls under the CCF umbrella. ICNA is the chief U.S. proxy to the violent South Asian Islamist movement, Jamaat-e-Islami, and one of its branches openly coordinated with Lashkar-e-Taiba, the terror group behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

Another CCF subgroup, the Aafia Foundation, is solely committed to the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a former FBI most wanted terrorist widely known as “Lady Al Qaeda.” In seeking to secure her release, CCF is united in common cause with ISIS and the Taliban, which have bartered unsuccessfully to exchange Siddiqui for U.S. hostages.

Family members left to pick up the pieces following terrorism prosecutions have only one person to blame for their present circumstances: the convicted. But that’s not the way that CCF tells it, and far too many senior lawmakers are apparently willing to listen.

Ironically, Blunt co-sponsored the Taylor Force Act, a bill passed in 2018 that denies funding to the Palestinian Authority until it stops “paying monetary rewards to terrorists and their families.” It is time to demand the same from pay-to-slay groups at home.

Why Trump Should Not Designate Mexican Cartels As Terrorists,"President Trump’s surprise revelation last week to talk show host Bill O’Reilly that he had moved to designate Mexican drug cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) begs some hard questions. For the last few months, President Trump explained, the proposal has been going through a process of consideration, probably the U.S. State Department’s six-steps for FTO designation, so it’s not official yet. That’s good, because someone needs to hit the pause button on this.

The designation of cartels as terrorists a la the Islamic State and al-Qaeda portends a dramatic restructuring of the American counterterrorism enterprise built after 9/11 to suppress Islamic jihadist groups. How adding a highly populous new class of “terrorists” to the workload would be done without creating Attention Deficit Disorder for the war on Islamic terrorism is never explained. This whole endeavor should be put up for some public comment until it is.

Depending on which and how many of the nine major cartels are designated—and no one is saying—a massive new layer of “Mexican terrorists” would potentially divert resources and investigative attention from currently designated Islamic terrorist FTOs, which, unlike the cartels, actually aspire to kill as many Americans as possible on American soil.

No deep thinking, proposals, or analyses have accompanied the often emotional designation calls of recent years, the latest fueled by the Sinaloa cartel’s early November slaughter of nine dual-citizenship American women and children inside Mexico. Designating Mexican cartels on a par with ISIS comes off right now as logistically problematic, devoid of national security justification, and a redundant distraction from the Islamist terror threat.

A Legal Mismatch

First, it helps to know that Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows the U.S. secretary of State to designate FTOs if an organization is 1. Foreign; 2. Engages in terrorist activity defined as “politically motivated” and targets “noncombatants,” and 3. Pursues activities that threaten the security of U.S. nationals or U.S. national security.

For groups deemed to fit that bill, agencies like the FBI, U.S. Attorney General’s Office, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the U.S. Treasury Department could freeze cash and assets, prosecute people for “material support” of terrorism, and bar or remove from the country non-citizens associated with FTOs.

Designation proponents don’t have to work hard to show that Mexico’s cartels certainly look and act like ISIS with tactics to control drug trafficking routes over the U.S. border. Proponents argue the violence is political in that it coerces Mexican state, local, and federal government to leave the trafficking business alone. They argue that cartels threaten American national security by providing the drugs that kill tens of thousands of Americans and that an eventual Mexican state failure portends dystopian effects on the United States.

Most of these arguments are weakly supported. Take the assertion that Mexican cartels have the required political or ideological motive. That’s a very far stretch; academics who study cartels mostly agree that profit is at the motivation for all their violence, including acts against office-holders and candidates. No similar acrobatics are necessary for Islamic terror organizations, which openly state that their motivating ideology is to destroy the United States and enslave the survivors.

It would certainly be entertaining to see who might step forward with a legal challenge at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on this one. But even if, at President Trump’s insistence, the State Department somehow shoe-horns the cartels into the statutorily necessary ideological definition, there’s another legal problem in need of a shoe-horn: that Mexican drug cartels threaten U.S. national security.

Questionable as a U.S. National Security Threat

The cartels do not threaten U.S. national security much, certainly not in the directed way that Islamic terrorist organizations do.

Yes, the murdered Mormon families were U.S. citizens, but the place of their killings (75 miles south of the U.S. southern border) drives home the point that most garish cartel massacres do not occur on U.S. soil. The vast majority of the dead are Mexicans on Mexican turf. Mexico’s nonstop massacres do not create the intolerable feeling of threat among average American citizens living in America.

Only a fractionally small number of Americans are killed and kidnapped inside Mexican territory and sometimes on the U.S. side, although some are hardly random “noncombatants.” Mexican cartels have never dedicated themselves to any strategy to destroy America or to randomly kill its people in, say, a Minneapolis shopping mall or at the Dallas Cowboys stadium. Furious, all-night gun battles may rage and bodies hang from bridges but almost always, almost scrupulously so, inside Mexico.

Cleveland, Ohio need not worry. That’s because cartels know that it is in their revenue interest to avoid provoking the ire of the general U.S. population, no doubt aware that American ire has inspired harsh reactions such U.S. military invasions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. That would be bad for business.

One of the most cited national security justifications for FTO designation is the opioid crisis and drug overdose deaths. But this supposition falls apart on examination. While Islamic terrorist groups would no doubt purposefully drug masses of Americans to death, Mexican cartels want them alive and paying. A prosperous United States is the most vital source of continuing wealth accumulation for cartels.

American drug consumers do not fit the definition of innocent noncombatants who do nothing contributing to their overdose deaths; they willingly buy the drug cartels’ supply. Their deaths are more akin to suicides. Any argument that this voluntary transactional circumstance presents a national security threat on the order of World Trade Center Tower destruction and vehicle-ramming attacks on New York bike paths can’t really be taken seriously.

Lastly, Mexico has been “failing” as a state for 20 years and is likely to remain fragile, weak, and coopted so far as it suits the cartel drug industry, but intact enough to still imperfectly provide basic services to most of its population and to remain a U.S. trading partner for the foreseeable future. The cartels have never expressed interest in overthrowing the central government and running the country. Mexican cartels only hope to coopt Mexico’s government institutions enough to keep drugs flowing, guided by a simple motive no more aspirational than accumulating cash.

I agree with most experts that Mexico is fragile and the potential effects of state failure are similar to those of Venezuela, which propelled waves of desperate people into neighboring countries and damaging trading partners. But the question of Mexico’s imminent demise, and even what the effects would be for the United States, has been in running debate for 20 years of terrible behavior by cartels that, again, have shown no interest in seizing Mexico’s central government and running the country.

I’ve seen no analytical prognoses as to whether FTO designation presents some kind of panacea that would weaken the highly adaptable cartels enough to forestall state failures they do not want. Without serious study of cause and effect, FTO designation is left to look like a feel-good political shot in the arm, albeit one that may severely and needlessly set back proven counterterrorism efforts against violent Islamists.

Watering Down the Soup

For counterterrorism work, potentially anyone who associates with a designated terrorist organization is potentially subject to, for instance, placement on terrorism watch and no-fly lists. All of literally tens of thousands of people worldwide who participate in the cartel industry would become subject to U.S. material support for terror investigations, asset freeze processes, questioning at airports and border inspection stations, and new ICE operational priorities to hunt down deportable Mexican cartel terrorists.

It’s never been clear outside of law enforcement intelligence circles how many people work directly for Mexico’s cartels, but there were nine major ones as of this summer, according to the Congressional Research Service. Former Texas Department of Public Safety Captain Jaeson Jones, who collected intelligence on the cartels for years, estimated that just the Sinaloa cartel probably fields close to 35,000 employees. Probably tens of thousands more work for all the cartels just in Mexico, he said, in operations, security, and logistics. But this wouldn’t include thousands more who work for American transnational gangs that move cartel product from the border to the U.S. interior, or the street-level Crips and Bloods gang members who do the distribution.

The problem is that, absent some thoughtful scoping, human resources planning, and burden-sharing plans, an FTO designation of one or more cartels could easily crash the American counterterrorism system, or spread personnel too thin to effectively work either problem.

Mexico’s National Security Problem to Fix

The Mexican cartels qualify for what is known in business and homeland security as a “wicked problem,” meaning it may well be impossible to solve. That does not mean governments should ever give up trying to manage, contain, and reduce wicked problems like drunken driving, pedophilia, domestic abuse, and vice of every kind.

American law enforcement already does much to help Mexico combat the cartels under the Kingpin Act, and Transnational Criminal Organization designations, which allow for financial disruption and the use of other American tools. The United States provides military and intelligence assistance to the Mexicans, an important, working extradition treaty, and significant security aid. The DEA is active and present helping the Mexicans with major drug investigations.

But this is Mexico’s national security problem to fix, not an American one. The United States should continue programs to strengthen Mexico’s central government and contain cartel violence on Mexican territory, and make business harder for them with President Trump’s wall.

The sometimes shrill insistences that each new gun battle, outrageous atrocity, or U.S. opioid suicide imminently threaten U.S. national security do not calm the waters necessary for good policy formulation that leave American counterterrorism undisturbed.

The London Terrorist Attack Shows Rehabilitative Justice Doesn’t Work,"The British police force was severely cut under prime ministers Tony Blair and David Cameron, the British version of the liberal-neocon duopoly who, just like their American counterparts, believed in the transformative nature of justice. Transform they did, although not criminals and terrorists. Instead they transformed their countries for worse. The British police force is kneecapped by its own ruling class, the product of its new woke elite, complete with crackpot theories and activist impulses.

The U.K. death penalty was removed due to the liberal empire. Police patrols were de-sexed — mom and dad duos, as some Brits call them. Now U.K. police are represented by a middle-aged, overweight, balding man and a plump woman in comical fluorescent jackets, looking more like road repair workmen than law enforcement officers, standing on street corners looking bored as they do their daily hours. In police stations, woke officers are more interested in checking mean tweets and dancing during LGBT parades than in catching criminals.

Civilians Are Taking the Law Into Their Own Hands

But that’s not all. Even when the specialized police force actually properly works, like this time when it took only five minutes from reporting time to take down a terrorist, it is kneecapped.

Consider this latest case. The terrorist Usman Khan was caught and docked after he planned a mass murder in the London Stock Exchange in 2012. The punishment was hideously lenient, even from the beginning. The total jail sentence was 16 years. Yet halfway through the sentence, he was released by activist judges who, given their enormous wisdom, decided an electronic tag could control this maniac.

Think about that for a moment. A violent and emotionally stunted man, radicalized by an ideology that promises martyrdom for mass murder, was thought to be controllable with only an ankle tag to monitor his movements, by our judges, who live in guarded mansions. Naturally, when this man fled his house, got a giant knife, and started indiscriminately stabbing people on the London Bridge, members of the public were left to stop a terrorist with a fire extinguisher and a pub-door decoration of a Narwhal tusk.

During a similar attack in the same place, another random Londoner took on a knife-wielding terrorist with pub chairs and bare fists. The official London police policy for civilians during a terror attack is to run and hide. It is increasingly clear that Londoners refuse to likewise run and hide. They are also increasingly taking the law into their own hands against street muggers and criminal gangs.

Rehabilitative Justice Doesn’t Work

Almost like clockwork, leftist media started warning against a “knee-jerk” reaction in the wake of the Friday terrorist attack. A war of words broke out between a Conservative minister and her Labour counterpart regarding who was responsible for the early-release legislation, with the Labour MP falling on the side of “rehabilitation.”

That is the crux of the problem. Modern Western law enforcement and academic theories behind it tilt heavily toward rehabilitative justice instead of a classical and orthodox punitive deterrence — almost so much, it verges on utopia. Led by leftist professors and academics with flawed research and biased conclusions, churned out like gospel truth by sympathetic urban liberal journalists, and enforced by law enforcement officers and hyper-liberal activist judges, for more than 40 years our society has been slowly but surely transformed from within.

This applies not only to terrorism, which is numerically at its lowest. The root cause of favoring rehabilitation over deterrence has taken a toll. Every medium of propaganda from mass media, to films, to music, has glamorized crime and criminals, who are always helpless victims of social injustice and structural inequality, just one reform away from being Nelson Mandela.

Case in point, the terror apologizers in the U.K., called CAGE, have systematically blamed all terror attacks on persecution of Muslims. They’re a British version of the Southern Poverty Law Center, if you like.

Criminal Justice Must Be Punitive

This is unsustainable. Chris Phillips, a former head of the U.K. national counterterrorism security office, was quoted in The Guardian, of all places, saying:

The criminal justice system needs to look at itself. We’re letting people out of prison, we’re convicting people for very, very serious offences and then they are releasing them back into society when they are still radicalised. So how on earth can we ever ask our police services and our security services to keep us safe? I’ve said it a few times today, we’re playing Russian roulette with people’s lives, letting convicted, known, radicalised Jihadi criminals walk about our streets.

Unfortunately, nothing will change unless heads start rolling. The common people in both the U.K. and the U.S. don’t care about harebrained schemes. Most people want the government to do minimum: govern, provide security and safety, and maintain the public works and streets. Fewer advertisement bans, fewer plastic straw bans, and more severe punishments for habitual offenders.

But our elite classes — from academics, to bleeding-heart nonprofit organizations and politicians, to activist judges — don’t get to feel the pain of their idealistic utopian theories. There is no accountability.

They are not facing the brunt of stupid misadventure in Mesopotamia. They are not getting murdered in random gang violence in the streets of South London, or walking through the diarrhea-, vomit-, blood-, and syringe-filled streets of San Francisco. Like modern versions of Marie-Louise Thérèse of Savoy-Carignan, they are sowing the seeds of populist uprisings.

U.K.'s Jeremy Corbyn Has A Long History Of Openly Supporting Terrorists,"In an interview on Sunday with Sky News, U.K. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn stated that convicted terrorists should “not necessarily” serve out the entirety of their prison terms. His statement comes on the heels of Friday’s terror attack on London Bridge, in which two Brits were stabbed to death by a convicted terrorist who had been released early from prison.

Corbyn’s softness towards terrorism should surprise no one, at least not those who have been paying attention to his unnervingly friendly attitude towards extremists over the past several decades (one Twitter user created a lengthy list). Corbyn is the quintessential terrorist sympathizer, harboring a particular, yet unsurprising, penchant for the antisemitic ones who usually find a safe haven within the anti-Zionist movement.

In the early 2000s, Corbyn led a campaign advocating for the release of two terrorists convicted for their roles in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish charity and the Israeli embassy in London. Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami, each jailed for 20 years, were found guilty of “conspiring to cause explosions in the United Kingdom” in December of 1996.

While both admitted to possessing the five pounds of explosives and three handguns in a storage unit, the pair insisted that the materials were not intended for use in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, during their trial, Botmeh and Alami, both engineers, admitted to testing homemade explosives in England’s Peak District in order to send information back to Palestinians living in the Palestinian territories.

In addition to advocating for lighter sentences for convicted terrorist conspirators, Corbyn has also used softened language when speaking of terrorist groups. In 2009, at a meeting held by the anti-war group Stop the War Coalition, Corbyn referred to members of Hamas and Hezbollah, two groups designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the U.S. State Department, as “friends.” He then proceeded to chastise the Israelis for not permitting members of Hamas to fly to the United Kingdom to meet with members of Parliament.

“Tomorrow it will be my pleasure and honor to host an event in Parliament where our friends from Hezbollah will be speaking.” Corbyn said. He continued. “I’ve also invited friends from Hamas to come and speak, as well. Unfortunately, the Israelis would not allow them to travel here, so it’s only going to be friends from Hezbollah.” He has both defended the statement and regretted it, although given his general attitude towards terrorists—as this article will demonstrate—the regret is likely minimal.

Corbyn’s open affinity for such terrorists was part of a larger pattern. That same year, Corbyn invited Arab extremist Dyab Abou Jahjah to speak at an event for Stop the War Coalition. After his 2009 visit, Jahjah was banned from entering the United Kingdom.

Although Jahjah has been “normalized” in some intellectual circles, he has made several objectively terrible statements, often lauding violence. Two months after the 9/11 terror attacks, Jahjah labeled the al-Qaeda terrorists “criminals” but then proceeded to allege that he and other Muslims had experienced a “sweet revenge feeling” after the attack on the Twin Towers. In 2003, when commenting on the war in Iraq, he told the Flemish newspaper Het Laaste Nieuws, “I consider every death of an American, British or Dutch soldier as a victory.”

Unsurprisingly, just two years ago, Jahjah was fired from a Belgian newspaper for applauding a terror attack in Jerusalem by a Palestinian who plowed a truck through a crowd of Israeli soldiers. It was later revealed that the driver was a supporter of the Islamic state.

In addition to portraying himself as a friend to terrorists, Corbyn has made several attempts to intellectualize their violent rhetoric. In 2012, Corbyn sat on a panel at a conference in Doha, Qatar alongside several Palestinian terrorists who had been convicted of murder and then released by Israel in exchange for a captured soldier. Corbyn later referred to “their contribution” to the conference as “fascinating and electrifying.” In attendance at the conference was Husam Badran, the former leader of Hamas’ military wing and mastermind of several terrorist attacks in which dozens of Israelis were killed during the Second Intifada.

Corbyn speaks at terrorist sympathizers’ rallies, too. That same year, Corbyn’s voice pounded thunderously through the speakers at the pro-Hezbollah, pro-Iran Al Quds Day March, an event held in a number of cities around the world in which participants advocate for the destruction of Israel via the “liberation” of the land from the “infidels.”

The rallies have been infamous for providing a safe haven not only to rabid antisemites but to supporters of the Iranian terrorist proxy, Hezbollah (although there is often much crossover between the two groups). It’s worth noting that earlier this year, the U.K. Parliament voted to ban the entirety of Hezbollah, thus allowing for the confiscation of Hezbollah paraphernalia at such events as Al Quds, following a resolution that eliminated the distinction between Hezbollah’s alleged military and political wings.

Corbyn’s association with Al Quds Day is not merely a passing fad. In 2016, Corbyn attended a book launch hosted by the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC), the same squad that organizes Al Quds Day rallies. In addition to overseeing such distasteful events, IHRC is also the same group that “gave its ‘Islamophobe of the Year’ award to the murdered staff of Charlie Hebdo — two months after they were butchered — and whose Genocide Memorial Day is deliberately timed to undermine Holocaust Memorial Day,” according to the Vice President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Mari van der Zyl.

In one of Corbyn’s most infamous terrorist-sympathizing events, he appeared at a ceremony in Tunisia honoring the Palestinian-Arab terrorists who carried out the 1972 Munich terror attack, where 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were viciously slaughtered. In an act that can only be described as heinous, Corbyn laid a wreath on the grave of one of the terrorists and, in the face of widespread condemnation, delivered no apology.

What is perhaps most frightening about the vignettes described above is that they provide only a brief snapshot of the depth to which Corbyn fraternizes with terrorists. There are many more.

Indeed, in most of these stories Corbyn demonstrates a wholly discomfiting admiration for murderous figures who feel no compunction in celebrating death. He calls such terrorists “friends,” speaks at their rallies, intellectualizes their violent hatred, and lays wreaths on their graves. If this type of behavior is not disqualifying for becoming prime minister of the United Kingdom, frankly, I am unsure what is.

How A Small Group Of Americans Exposed Terrorism In Boston,"A conspiracy conceals its bad behavior behind allegations its opponents are crazed “conspiracy theorists.” Reporters expend column inches denouncing and denying facts revealed by the very investigative reporting that they refused to do themselves. Respected establishment organizations side against their own base rather than address the growing concerns of those who made them influential.

Given the theme, you will be forgiven if you assume this is the story of the post-2016 political and media environment. But Terror in the Cradle of Liberty by Ilya I. Feoktistov has nothing to do with the current climate of Washington D.C in the age of President Donald Trump.

Instead, Feoktistov is the executive director of the Americans for Peace and Tolerance (APT), a Boston area nonprofit organization founded to investigate threats to civil society, a group founded by his mentor Charles Jacobs, a long-time Jewish activist who played a central role in efforts to combat slavery in Africa, particularly Sudan. Jacobs eventually played a leading role in the David Project, a Boston-area Jewish group fighting anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism.

The story of how they came to be involved in investigating Islamic extremist cells in Boston, as told in Terror in the Cradle of Liberty: How Boston Became a Center for Islamic Extremism is really three stories in one.

Firstly, it is the story of Jacobs, Feoktistov, and a small coterie of Boston activists who, while chasing a seemingly pedestrian story of a “sweetheart land deal” between the Boston government and a local city mosque, The Islamic Society of Boston, stumbled into a radical network that would foster more than one dozen terrorists in the past two decades, including the notorious Boston Marathon bombers, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

Secondly, it is the story of the Boston media which ignored them, then later smeared them as conspiracy theorists and kooks even while Boston became known as a hub for Islamic terrorism.

Finally, it is the story of the capitulation of the leadership of the Boston Jewish community, which not only declined to listen to warnings about their interfaith partners at the Islamic Society of Boston, but instead targeted Jacobs and his team for derision and exclusion for daring to raise questions.

An Unethical Land Scam

To sketch the background of the story as broadly as possible, in 2002 a Boston philanthropist named Bill Sapers learned that the city government’s Boston Redevelopment Authority had undertaken to sell a piece of property in the depressed Roxbury neighborhood to the Islamic Society of Boston Mosque at a substantially reduced price. After unsuccessfully attempting to find out the logic behind the sweetheart deal, Sapers persuaded a freelance reporter named Tamar Morad to investigate. Morad presented her findings in an article to the Boston Globe, but the Globe refused to publish the story.

A year later, a Boston Herald piece would finally reveal many of the same facts Morad had uncovered in the story the Boston Globe had squashed. These included that one of the members of the Boston Redevelopment Authority that had approved the land sale, Ali Salaam, had close ties to the mosque. But perhaps more shockingly, the Herald revealed that the mosque leadership was chock full of those with extremist ties.

It was founded by one Abdurrahman Alamoudi, an influential Muslim leader who was under indictment (at the time; now convicted) on terrorism-related charges and had made public statements of support for terrorist groups. He would later be described by the Treasury Department as a leading al-Qaeda fundraiser. Other extremist connections for the mosque included ISB Trustees Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, better known as the spiritual mentor of the Muslim Brotherhood and for his authorization of Hamas suicide bombings, and Osama Kandil, who would be identified as a leading Muslim Brotherhood figure.

The Boston Herald also identified the man responsible for raising money for the mosque’s land purchase, Treasurer Walid Fitaihi, as the publisher of virulently anti-Jewish screeds throughout the Arab press. One example, quoted by Feoktistov in the book, notes that the Jews

…have perpetrated the worst of evils and they have brought the worst corruption to the earth… They have incurred Allah’s wrath and they have been afflicted with misery. That is because they continuously reject the Signs of Allah and were after slaying the Prophets… and this resulted from their disobedience and their habit of transgression.

While Fitaihi’s sentiments were nothing out of the ordinary for much of the Middle East, that they came from a fixture of Boston’s interfaith circles and a frequent participant in the Islamic Society of Boston’s outreach efforts to Jewish community leaders made him a centerpiece of the controversy. It was this rank antisemitism, and the risk that it was being spread to Boston’s Muslim youth, that motivated Jacobs to join the fight.

Jacobs and his team soon formed Citizens for Peace and Tolerance (which would eventually become APT), a group of Jewish, Christian, atheist, and even Muslim leaders concerned about the ISB’s extremist connections and its unethical land scam.

The Boston Herald’s continuing exposure of ISB kicked off a wave of public outrage. The BRA/ISB land deal now faced a legal challenge on First Amendment grounds, and elected officials were demanding an investigation. Everything seemed to be going swimmingly. A media investigation led to public outcry resulting in action by legislative officials and judicial review. It all looked like the very picture of American democracy, with its many built-in protections against corruption.

To quote former DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano about another terror-related matter, “the system worked.” But it didn’t work for long.

Sued Into Silence

By October 2004, the Boston Globe, those same brave media firefighters who attempted to smother the ISB corruption story in its crib, did a softball interview with ISB and wrote an editorial declaring that, whatever its roots, ISB was a “moderating mosque.” Then in May 2005, ISB hit back hard, launching lawsuits against the Boston Herald for defamation.

Those lawsuits would be expanded to include Fox 25 News, and eventually, Bill Sapers, Citizens for Peace and Tolerance, the David Project, as well as long-time investigator of American jihadist networks Steve Emerson and his Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT), which had stepped in to assist.

The goal of the lawsuit was simple. Shut down any critical reporting of ISB. Feoktistov demonstrates this with a quote from Nabeel Khudairi, a leader of the Islamic Council of New England, which was an Islamist controlled umbrella group over New England mosques.

“If FOX is being sued for this story,” Khudairi wrote, “it stands to reason that they will be prevented from reporting on the story further while the case is in court.”

It worked. Both Fox 25 and the Boston Herald retreated in disarray as their lawyers instructed them to cease reporting on the Islamic Society until the case was resolved.

I’ve seen this dynamic at work in other places. During the infamous Holy Land Foundation Trial for example, the local Dallas Morning News was the leading provider of coverage of how the country’s largest Islamic charity had been exposed by the federal government as a terrorist fundraising operation.

But after a lawsuit, the Morning News was so neutered it routinely turned over its editorial page to officials from the very groups it once critically reported on, and who had sued them into silence. As Todd Bensman, who covered parts of the Holy Land Foundation story for the Morning News notes:

It was a very effective lawsuit in terms of controlling coverage and clamping the coverage down. The paper just really rolled over, very timid and frightened about the whole thing. They just wanted it to go away.

Nor has this occurred just in what has derisively been called “the establishment media.” Even conservative online publications have increasingly balked at covering stories that involve domestic Islamist groups, who are notoriously litigious. Some have declined to publish articles because they have been threatened with suits, while others have pulled articles from their sites at the first sign of a lawyer’s letter despite ample sourcing for every relevant fact.

Frankly, who can blame them? Given the financial pressures on today’s media, who has the time or inclination to fight a malicious prosecution whose only goal is cost you money and drag you though the mud? While many were unaware, this silencing strategy received one of its first real test runs in Boston during the ISB controversy.

The second hammer blow came as elements of the Jewish community not only refused to back up their colleagues at the David Project and the Citizens for Peace and Tolerance, but actively took sides against them. Feoktistov summarizes the betrayal with a quote from Steven Cohen of Citizens for Peace and Tolerance:

The fact that the suit was brought was troublesome, the way the courts dealt with it was troublesome, the way the press dealt with it was upsetting, but most upsetting of all was the way the Jewish community of Boston reacted to this lawsuit – and in particular the leadership of the Jewish community.

Instead of looking at the data, community leaders retreated behind interfaith buzzwords and their history of “relationships” with ISB’s leaders. Feoktistov describes one rabbi CPT spoke to as claiming that to even look at APT’s evidence of ISB’s bad behavior was itself ipso facto bigotry.

Feoktistov dedicates much of the book to, at times almost obsessively, detailing the refusals of various Boston Jewish leaders to listen to warnings as more and more examples of ISB’s extremism came to light. This is also where, somewhat understandably, Feoktistov drops the measured tone with which he relates the ties of various New England Islamist leaders to terror and extremism. There is a certain irony in being able to calmly relate a Boston imam’s ties to the deadly terror group Laskar-e-Taiba but being unable to hide one’s disgust for the failures of those who were supposed to be on your side.

While Feoktistov’s outrage comes through loud in clear, Jacobs perhaps cuts deeper in summing up the struggles with Boston Jewish leadership in the ISB fight. In his description of one Jewish philanthropic leader Feoktistov quotes Jacobs delivering ultimate left-handed compliment, “[He] was a fine peacetime leader…”

Perhaps one response to what happened here is best expressed by paraphrasing “The Godfather’s” Sonny Corleone, “If only we had a wartime consigliere, we wouldn’t be in this shape.” This sentiment of frustration will certainly resonate with Americans in a wide variety of political battles waged in the past decades, and not just ones over Islamic extremism. Those who have grown powerful and successful claiming to represent their constituencies never quite seemed willing to go to the mattresses when it mattered the most.

Local Crime

Just when things seemed perhaps at their darkest in the ISB lawsuit, there was an unexpected change of fortunes. The suit entered the discovery phase, which the mosque’s leadership apparently hadn’t expected. Now they were on the hook to produce boxes and boxes of records, emails, and other correspondence regarding their organization, leadership, and especially banking information and fundraising methods.

After the risk of sanctions for failure to disclose and for attempting to delete and hide emails, the ISB leadership eventually was forced to turn over a treasure trove of documentation to Jacobs and his team. The mosque eventually agreed to dismiss the case, in part to stop the bleeding of compromising materials.

Terror in the Cradle of Liberty’s narrative breaks down a bit in the second half of the book, as Feoktistov takes the opportunity to share vignettes shaped around the data acquired in the ISB lawsuit and what it revealed about Boston’s Islamist underbelly.

By way of full disclosure, the community of qualified researchers and activists focused on the Islamist networks in the United States can probably be counted on one hand. I have known Feoktistov professionally for most of our careers, as we came up through the ranks in this very niche area at roughly the same time. We have traded sources and data on shared research targets. I have always found him serious and competent as an open-source researcher, with a knack for finding interesting connections and uncovering documents.

I have also personally researched or written about many of the incidents he recounts in his book. Thus while as a reader I found the semi-autobiographical style of Terror in the Cradle of Liberty where Feoktistov relates events he personally witnessed to be entertaining, I found myself frustrated that at least the review copy of the book lacked any kind of footnotes or endnotes which, as a researcher, would have been invaluable.

This section of the book is also likely to be very challenging for someone who has not been a student of domestic Islamist activities in the United States. While Feoktistov does an admirable job relating various landmark events such as the previously mentioned Holy Land Foundation trial – which led to the publication by the U.S. government of tranches of documents from the U.S. Muslim Brotherhood’s archive – substantial digressions are required to explain the intricacies of this network to the uninitiated and how it factored into the expose of the Boston network.

Some charts would have been helpful to readers in keeping track of the reappearance of multiple and often confusing names. Useful works for those seeking to get up to speed before reading Terror in the Cradle of Liberty include former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy’s The Grand Jihad, or for the visually inclined Steve Emerson’s documentary video, The Grand Deception.

While his summaries of these larger cases are completely adequate, Feoktistov’s writing is best when he stays close to home and focuses on the network in Boston, which is no surprise given his firsthand access to the ISB documents that came out of the lawsuit. For this reason the section, “Battle for the Soul of a Mosque,” on how the terrorist-supporters seized control of the previously moderate Islamic Council of New England, is especially worth reading closely, as are the sections on Boston’s ruling jihadi queen bee, Aafia Siddiqui, and on the early development of the Tsarnaev brothers.

Of particular interest is Feoktistov’s treatment of the murders of three Jewish men, Brendan Mess, Erik Weissman, and Rafi Teken. How many Americans are aware that it is now widely believed by law enforcement that before he took his place as a Boston Marathon bomber, Tamerlan Tsarnaev killed and nearly beheaded three Jewish men, before sprinkling money and drugs over their bodies? What could have been prevented if Tsarnaev had been stopped earlier, on what appeared at first glance as a mere “local crime story?”

Moderate Muslims

Another salient point in Feoktistov’s book, and which should play a major role in his concluding exhortation for Americans to examine and repel the extremist networks in their own hometowns, is his focus on how moderate Muslims affected the ISB story. Feoktistov emphasizes the key role played by Sheikh Ahmed Subhy Mansour, a reformist theologian and former Al-Azhar University professor, and he acknowledges “many thanks and great honor” due “Rashid,” an informant who provided information about the radical mosque for APT’s investigations.

Feoktistov’s willingness to do this is important. As someone whose day job involves working with local activists concerned about Islamic extremism in their communities, I’ve realized a segment of the population finds it increasingly difficult to accept that there are any such thing as “moderate” or “reformer” Muslims worth working with.

Partially this is understandable, given how interfaith groups like those Feoktistov excoriates in Terror in the Cradle of Liberty have repeatedly chosen to award the title “moderate” to those who are anything but. To be effective, and to truly counter radicals like those who took over the Islamic Council of New England, requires being able to work with those within the American Muslim community, and with people of good will of all stripes, to oppose moves by extremists. APT’s experience in Boston demonstrates that, and if their experience is to be replicated in other hometowns across America, it will be necessary for people to learn from the example APT set.

It is perhaps unlikely that Terror in the Cradle of Liberty will make much of a splash, even in the relatively small corner of the conservative media that remains open or interested in matters of Islamic extremism. It’s unlikely to play the role Muslim Mafia (by investigative journalist Paul Sperry and researcher David Gaubatz) did when it first came out, in part because of the championing by then-Rep. Sue Myrick (R-NC). In part, this is because the country seems to have moved on.

In the age of Trump there is likely a limited audience for hearing that America’s problem with domestic Islamic extremism has not been defeated, despite the successful destruction of the Islamic State. This is even more unfortunate, because what Terror in the Cradle of Liberty has to say about the cowardice of our press and elected and community leaders is perhaps even more relevant than what it has to say about terror in the city of Boston.

Dems Hate Trump More Than They Hate Terrorists Who Kill Americans,"A U.S. airstrike killed the world’s most violent and deadliest terrorist of the last 20 years on Thursday night, but in the eyes of 2020 Democratic candidates and lefty celebrities, the only important takeaway from this American victory is that President Trump is bad.

Trump’s authorization of the killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guard terrorist leader Qasem Soleimani is a vindication for the thousands of wounded veterans, many with missing limbs from Soleimani’s IED attacks, and the families of U.S. servicemembers Soleimani killed. Soleimani approved the Tuesday attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and was plotting to kill more Americans. He was a central connection between Iran and terrorist organizations, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas. Yet some Democrats find it difficult to celebrate his death.

Despite the fact that Soleimani’s death will save American lives, Sen. Cory Booker said on MSNBC it is Trump who is “making the world less of a safe place.” Within an hour of the news of Soleimani’s death on Thursday, Booker appeared on CNN asserting that Trump, “has had really a failure in his Iranian policy.”

Although it was President Obama who shipped $150 billion in cash to Iran, emboldening terrorists like Soleimani, Booker is convinced that under the Trump administration, “Iran has become more influential and more dangerous.”

Democratic presdiential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, released a statement bemoaning the “serious questions about how this decision was made.”

Statement from @PeteButtigieg on killing of Qassim Soleimani: pic.twitter.com/9k2tSEiPu6 — Chris Meagher (@chrismeagher) January 3, 2020

From the sound of Buttigieg’s promise to “ask the hard questions” as president, it seems as if he might have bypassed killing Soleimani given the chance, thus allowing the potential deaths of more Americans at Soleimani’s hands.

Additionally, Buttigieg insinuates that Trump’s decision without congressional authority was unlawful. This is false. As David French pointed out on Twitter, because American troops are lawfully in Iraq, the airstrike was duly authorized, justified, and in no need of congressional authorization.

Democratic presidential candidates and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders also bypassed this opportunity to praise Trump for the successful take-out of the world’s most dangerous terrorist, and instead focused only on ginning up concern that Trump has started World War III in Iran.

In a tweet, Warren wailed, “Now he’s assassinated a senior foreign military official,” as if this was the assignation of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and not of a terrorist who was actively targeting the United States and has himself authorized an act of war against the United States in supporting the attack on a U.S. embassy.

Donald Trump ripped up an Iran nuclear deal that was working. He’s repeatedly escalated tensions. Now he’s assassinated a senior foreign military official. He’s been marching toward war with Iran since his first days in office—but the American people won’t stand for it. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 3, 2020

Sanders opted to ignore the news of the drone strike completely, and to instead talk about his past anti-war protests and to assure his supporters he would prevent the non-existent war in Iran.

I was right about Vietnam. I was right about Iraq. I will do everything in my power to prevent a war with Iran. I apologize to no one. pic.twitter.com/Lna3oBZMKB — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 3, 2020

Watching Sanders’ Senate Hall video, one would think Trump had indeed just declared war in Iran. In fact, just the opposite is true. As Daniel McCarthy writes in The Spectator, “Donald Trump was elected to put Washington’s emphasis back on the well-being of Americans, rather than on the imperial politics of the Middle East. A war with Iran would be a betrayal of his mandate — a war that would lead to other wars and more prolonged occupation of the region.” A targeted retaliatory strike is not the same as war. It could in fact prevent it by raising the stakes to Iran’s continued challenge to U.S. interests.

Former Vice President Joe Biden also released a statement full of false claims.

My statement on the killing of Qassem Soleimani. pic.twitter.com/4Q9tlLAYFB — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 3, 2020

Biden says Trump owes Americans a “strategy and plan to keep safe our troops and embassy personnel.” This is odd considering the killing of Soleimani will quite literally save the lives of troops and Americans in the embassies Soleimani had planned attacks on. In comparison, the Obama-Biden administration responded to attacks on a U.S. embassy and the death of a U.S. ambassador by lying about what had happened and arresting a YouTuber who after imprisonment ended up in a homeless shelter for exercising his free speech.

Biden claims Trump’s goal of deterring future attacks from Iran “certainly will have the opposite effect.” As John Davidson writes in The Federalist, “Trump hasn’t started a war with Iran. Rather, it means the United States has recognized and responded to a conflict that’s been going on for some time now, and that Iran has fueled. If anything, the Suleimani strike might well prevent the outbreak of a new Mideast war that was looking increasingly inevitable after eight years of the Obama administration’s feckless foreign policy.”

Another 2020 Democrat candidate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, falsely claimed Trump had acted without congressional authority.

Not only did Democrats dismiss the fact that no man on earth was more directly responsible for the deaths of American soldiers, I would be remiss to leave out the outspoken leftist celebrities who undoubtedly had never heard of Qasem Soleimani before Thursday. In a puzzling tweet featuring an Iranian flag with emojis on it, actress Rose McGowen said Americans are actually the ones “being held hostage by a terrorist regime.”

“Thanks a lot, d–khead,” McGowan wrote to Trump in another tweet.

Actor John Cusack tweeted the insightful analysis that attacking Iran is bad because the country is “not like anywhere else.”

Trump in full fascist 101 mode-,steal and lie – untill there’s nothing left and start a war –

He’s so idiotic he doesn’t know he just attacked Iran

And that’s not like anywhere else — John Cusack (@johncusack) January 3, 2020

Reactions from Democrats were more than predictable, given how Trump Derrangment Syndrome has plagued their minds since 2016. But when American lives have clearly been saved and other lives already lost are clearly avenged by this terrorist’s death, it’s disappointing that not one Democrat could give the Trump administration some credit without fear-mongering about World War III.

Trump Derangement Prevents Media From Praising Trump For Iranian Terrorist Soleimani’s Demise,"According to reports confirmed by both the Pentagon and the Iranian government, Major General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force within Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), was killed in an attack by US Forces on Baghdad airport Friday morning. Soleimani was Iran’s top commander and arguably the second-most powerful man within the regime, behind Ayatollah Khamenei. You would suspect that Soleimani’s death, or the death of any terrorist commander, would be received with cautious optimism. But in the case of our media and their mindless antipathy to Trump, such expectations must be suspended.

It would be hard to overstate the significance of Soleimani’s death. As the Pentagon announced following his death, he and his Quds Force “were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more.” Soleimani orchestrated the recent attacks on U.S. bases within Iraq, including the one on December 27 in which an American contractor was killed. Soleimani also greenlighted the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad this past week, which involved the defacement of the compound at the hands of Iran-backed protesters and Iraqi militias.

It’s worth noting that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo designated the IRGC a foreign terrorist organization last year, the group joining the infamous ranks of nearly 70 others, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and ISIS. “The IRGC is the Iranian government’s primary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign,” Trump stated.

The IRGC, through highly specialized and secretive Quds Force, offers massive support to terrorists globally in the form of material aid, training, technology transfer, guidance, and direction, thus ensuring that Iran remains the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. In no short order, the IRGC continues to prop up its Islamic Revolution terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East, including but not limited to, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Kata’ib Hezbollah in Iraq, and Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza.

According to the State Department, Soleimani’s Quds Forces plotted a terrorist attack against the Saudi Arabian Ambassador on American soil in 2011 that was luckily foiled. And in 2018, Iran and the IRGC were found liable in U.S. federal court for the 1996 Khobar Towers Bombing which resulted in the loss of 19 American lives. In recent years, it is no surprise that many countries have encountered and thwarted terrorist plots orchestrated by IRGC.

Given the indisputable terrorist activities of IRGC, with Soleimani at the helm, it would seem that celebrating his death would come naturally, in the same way that commentators on both sides of the aisle expressed relief and joy that Osama bin Laden had finally been captured and killed in 2011. According to the Pentagon, at the time of his death, Soleimani was in the process of planning future attacks on Americans diplomats and service members currently in the region, his death being treated as a means of foiling those plans and possibly deterring future ones from taking shape.

But reactions to the killing from media talking heads were predictably pathetic, given that they immediately assume the direct opposite of Trump’s position on any given issue, no matter the level of intellectual gymnastics such maneuvers require.

Unsurprisingly, Trump’s targeted killing of the terrorist leader has been deemed a litany of unseemly adjectives, including “reckless” and “incoherent.” Perhaps the most breathtakingly stupid reaction has been the notion that this attack somehow represented the first strike or an “act of war,” as if Iran and its proxies had not been targeting U.S. bases, seizing control of oil tankers, and laying siege on our embassy in Baghdad these last few months.

foreign policy specialists now bracing for US-Iran war after killing of Soleimani former Bush national security official Richard Haass: “If US behind the strike, then Iran will almost certainly go after US personnel in Iraq and elsewhere. This could spread and escalate fast” — John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) January 3, 2020

Imagine the Iranian government assassinated Mike Pompeo with a drone, at the direction of the president, and called it self defense. That’s exactly what the US did by killing Soleimani — an act of war. The only difference is Iran’s self defense claims would be more legitimate. — Emma Vigeland (@EmmaVigeland) January 3, 2020

But there’s been a strange movement within the media to humanize the terrorist Soleimani. The Washington Post issued an alert last night, labeling the Iranian commander to be “Iran’s most revered military leader,” a far, ahistorical cry from the facts, which indicate that much of Iran is hugely upset with the regime’s expansionist and violent aims. Any reporter with knowledge of the region would recognize that there is a tremendous divide between the ambitions of Iran’s mullahs and the desires of the Iranian people.

The Washington Post was not alone. In the wee hours of Friday morning, a New York Times journalist tweeted a video of Soleimani reading poetry “about friends departing & him being left behind.” A former writer at the Intercept, Vice, and Salon compared the killing of Soleimani to the killing of Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Captain America “all in one.”

A CBS report on Friday referred to the Soleimani as both a “revered figure” and a “war hero.”

Given the geopolitical complexity of the region, reactions to Soleimani’s death demand nuance. But before any analysis can begin, we should as a society be able to agree that his death was justifiable. During the Obama years, our foreign policy was structured on placating terrorists in some fashion, so much so that Obama tipped off the Iranians to an Israeli plot to kill Soleimani years ago. Given, inter alia, Trump’s partial withdrawal from the Iran Deal, the FTO designation of the IRGC, and the recent killing of Soleimani, that approach seems to no longer be the case.

As Michael Doran writes, “The decision to kill Mr. Suleimani represents the final demise of Mr. Obama’s Middle East strategy, which sought to realign American interests with those of Iran.” It seems the media is not only mourning the death of Soleimani, but the death of Obama’s legacy, a reaction which may explain their incoherent and emotionally fueled “analysis.” Determining what comes next is important. But acknowledging that a purely evil person was killed—and offering due credit to the Trump administration for his death—should not be so categorically challenging.

"Bernie Sanders Condemns Terrorist’s Execution, Chastises Trump","Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders condemned the killing of Iran’s Qassim Soleimani Friday and reminded voters of his record voting against previous U.S. military interventions, including the war in Iraq.

“Let us not forget that when Trump took office, we had a nuclear agreement with Iran, negotiated by the Obama administration along with our closest allies,” Sanders said at a campaign event in Iowa. “The wise course would have been to stick with that nuclear agreement, enforce its provisions, and use that diplomatic channel.”

The Iran deal sent the world’s largest state sponsor of terror billions of American dollars and weakened inspections of the regime’s nuclear weapons program. The deal also made it more likely the terrorist regime would ultimately get nuclear weapons and enabled a dramatic increase in its world terrorism activities.

“Trump ignored the advice of his own security officials, and listened to right-wing extremists, some of whom were exactly the same people who got us into the war in Iraq in the first place,” Sanders charged. He didn’t make clear whether as president he would exact any price on foreign enemies who kill Americans, Trump’s stated rationale for the strike.

Sander’s criticism of President Donald Trump’s actions on Iran come as the senator leads in New Hampshire and holds a close second place in Iowa, the first two contest states of the Democratic primary.

According to Real Clear Politics’ latest aggregate of polls, Sanders is pulling 20 percent support in Iowa compared to former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s 22. In New Hampshire, Sanders leads the crowded field with 19 percent while Buttigieg garners nearly 18.

Trump ordered the take-out of Soleimani, Iran’s most senior general of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, Thursday following an Iranian-affiliated militia storming the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.

Soleimani, 62, was the world’s most dangerous terrorist responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans. He served as the head of the Quds Force since 1988. His death has spiked tensions between the United States and Iran that have already risen to new heights following a series of events including the attack on the American embassy earlier this week.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/04/bernie-sanders-condemns-terrorists-execution-chastises-trump-advisers-as-right-wing-extremists/,2020-01-04
"Joe Biden Assisted Terrorist Soleimani, Warned Against Killing Bin Laden","As vice president, Joe Biden made foreign political decisions that helped terrorist leader Quasem Soleimani form an Iranian-friendly government in Iraq. Biden also warned President Barack Obama against raiding, and inevitably killing, Osama bin Laden in 2011. The record shows that Biden made foreign policy decisions that cut in favor of international terrorists.

According to a 2013 New Yorker profile, Biden played a pivotal role in pushing the United States out of Iraq and handing over power to Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism. According to the profile, Biden called the pro-American Iraqi politician Ayad Allawi to ask he stop trying to form a government. This left space for Soleimani to ensure an Iranian-backed politician took control of the Iraqi government.

After the U.S. military killed Soleimani, Biden released a statement claiming Soleimani’s death was a “hugely escalatory move in an already dangerous region.”

“President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox, and he owes the American people an explanation of the strategy and plan to keep safe our troops and embassy personnel,” Biden said.

My statement on the killing of Qassem Soleimani. pic.twitter.com/4Q9tlLAYFB — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 3, 2020

Soleimani’s rise to power in the Middle East was aided by the Obama administration’s disastrous “Iran Nuclear Deal,” as well as Biden’s assistance for Soleimani’s Iranian power in Iraq, Syria, and other Middle Eastern countries.

This is not the only example of Biden’s horrible decision making in the Middle East. In 2011, Obama assembled a team in the White House Situation Room to make a final decision on whether to launch a raid against what intelligence believed was Osama bin Laden.

“Mr. President, my suggestion is, don’t go,” Biden said as he recounted the bin Laden raid. The raid was incredibly successful and led to the death of bin Laden, the al-Quaeda leader and mastermind behind 9/11. Biden touted his record against the bid Laden raid, then, in 2015 flip-flopped his stance and said he advised Obama to “go with his gut.”

On CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Biden contradicted himself on the moment he told Obama not to act on the bin Laden raid. Instead, he changed the narrative, claiming he told Obama to take more precautionary steps.

“In order to give the president the leeway he needed, I said, ‘Mr. President, there’s one more thing we can do.’ … One more pass to see if it was bin Laden. I said, ‘You should do that, and there’d still be time to have the raid, but that’s what I would do,” Biden said.

He continued by claiming he privately told Obama to follow his instincts.

In 2012, Obama undercut Biden’s shifting story during a presidential debate against Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Obama made it clear Biden had opposed the bin Laden raid.

“Even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did,” Obama said to Romney.

Biden’s foreign policy plans seem to cut in favor of terrorists, whether it be leaving room for Soleimani to influence power in Iraq, or leaving bin Laden alive. It’s clear Biden’s compass on foreign policy is flawed and he is attempting to conceal his poor judgment.

The Fundamental Question Is: Why Is America Still In The Middle East?,"D.C. is all worked up over the killing of Qasem Soleimani, Iran’s top military operator. Democrats, driven by anti-Trump madness, have taken to eulogizing Soleimani. That’s insane. Meanwhile, D.C. Republicans are ecstatic about the killing.

Soleimani certainly deserved it. During the heyday of the Shiite uprising in Iraq, his forces were responsible for bombs that killed countless American servicemembers. It’s good that he is dead.

Soleimani was hit because Iranian proxies were behind recent attacks in Iraq, including one that killed an American contractor. The White House hopes this will warn Iran that America means business, and that Iran will cease its meddling in Iraq and stand down. Middle America hopes this is exactly what happens.

But D.C.’s hysteria is dangerous. The strike wasn’t necessarily wrong, but the president must tread carefully. Too much of D.C. wants him not to.

One side is too often blinded by a hysteria about the president that precludes a rational discussion. The other side has extreme hawkishness on Iran that the American people don’t match. People can celebrate Soleimani’s death, but many of the hawks in D.C. hope there’s more to come, and will push for it.

The Middle East’s Reality

Shiite Muslim Iran is next door to Iraq, of which 60 percent is Shiite. Some on Twitter posted videos of Iraqis celebrating in the streets about the Soleimani strike. Except these Iraqis are likely Sunnis, who make up around 30 percent of Iraq’s population. Much of the Shiite portion is furious at Soleimani’s death.

America is on a sectarian landmine. The big picture in the Middle East is that Shia Muslims and Sunni Muslims are locked in a 1,400 year-old civil war between the two main branches of Islam. What America has been doing in the Middle East for the last two decades, wittingly or not, is taking sides in this civil war, which could last a thousand more years. If America is sucked into open war with Iran, we would be explicitly taking a side in this religious war. But taking a side is a false choice, especially given America’s newfound energy independence.

Iran is an evil regime, but the United States’s allies in the Middle East—including Saudi Arabia and Qatar—are all unsavory Sunni countries. Iran has not chiefly funded an organization that did mass beheadings, raped Yazidis, and drowned Christians. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization member Turkey have. Beltway types talk about Iran being the number-one state sponsor of terror, when all the terror groups Americans have heard of—including al Qaeda and ISIS—are Sunni, and associated with our Sunni allies.

Pundits are comparing Soleimani to Osama bin Laden. But there’s a big difference between Soleimani’s brand of terror, which operated within the rationale of the Shiite Iranian state, and the Sunni Muslim terror of Osama bin Laden.

Iraq borders Iran to its west. The country that borders Iran to its east is Afghanistan. In other words, Iran is surrounded by U.S. troops. When Shiite Soleimani committed the evil act of funding Shiite militias in Iraq with bombs and weapons, which killed U.S. troops, it was the Iranian state’s way of imposing costs on America’s presence next door.

This isn’t making apology for the evil Iran regime. But ditching nuance, and not understanding the motivation of one’s enemy, is a recipe for getting thousands of American young men killed in a “s—thole country.” That’s unacceptable.

A pundit actually said that Iran would prove how irrational it was when it struck back, likely via proxies. But a country that feels encircled, like a wild animal, usually tries to retaliate. We must be prepared for that, and prepare tough responses that don’t lead to all-out war.

In the next few weeks, it is even possible that Iran responds through its Shia militia proxies with attacks on U.S. troops. That would force the United States to up the ante. The D.C. crowd would cheer, as war with Iran became more of a reality.

But war with Iran is fundamentally a D.C. craze. It isn’t in the interest of America, or normal Americans. The connected blue checks on Twitter, or the pundits talking to the camera on Fox News, won’t see their kids or neighbors fight, relatively speaking. Middle America would disproportionately bear the cost, as it always does.

DC Has a Track Record of Stupid Wars

Eggheads sitting in a cushy office came up with plans to overthrow dictators like Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, only to create power vacuums that resulted in violence and increased sectarian strife. They talk about a Shiite crescent—meaning Iran controlling land from Iran to Syria—but they made this possible with the overthrow of Saddam.

The same crowd was desperate to join our Sunni Muslim “allies” to overthrow Syrian semi-Shia dictator Bashar al-Assad. What followed was human misery on a massive scale. Meanwhile, America turned a blind eye to Gulf allies like Saudi Arabia arming jihadists, including al-Qaeda and its affiliates. D.C. spent $1 billion a year arming “moderate rebels” in Syria, who were to fight the Assad regime. The program was wildly unsuccessful, and ended up arming jihadists.

The CIA helped countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar get western weapons into Syria, many of which ended up in the arms of radical jihadists. All the “Benghazi” stuff you used to hear about, including the presence of Americans in Libya, and the fact that those Americans were relatively unguarded, was possibly because the CIA was running a “rat-line” of weapons into Syria. Even the rise of the despicable Islamic State, or ISIS, was heavily aided by the large cache of Saudi and U.S.-supplied weapons floating around in Syria and Iraq.

Why Is America Still in the Middle East?

The worst part about these interventions is when America wrecks something, it owns it. We’ve been in Iraq more or less since 2003. We are still in Syria, even though President Trump saw extreme bipartisan and media criticism for moving a few hundred troops out of one area.

Americans now understand America has a Hotel California foreign policy.

We’ve been in Afghanistan nearly 20 years, even though the Taliban currently controls the same area of land that it did a decade ago. Our servicemembers in Afghanistan are forced to defend warlords and Afghan security forces who practice child rape.

All told, we’ve spent $6.4 trillion in Middle East wars and the war on terror. Americans now understand America has a Hotel California foreign policy. People in D.C. get us in places, and while we can check out any time we like, we can never leave.

The real question is: why is America still in Iraq, or the Middle East at all? Yes, America pulling out would cause uncertainty and increased violence. But it’s likely remaining in the Middle East is making things worse, emboldening bad actors on both sides of the Sunni-Shia divide. That doesn’t mean America is the bad guy, or doesn’t provide short-term stability, but sometimes short-term stability is undesirable, and breeds long-term instability.

Besides, these are not our fights. Trying to control the entire Middle East is neither possible nor a U.S. national security interest.

End the Washington Cesspool

Too often, people in D.C. make money from the messes they create. They get the contracts, the foreign policy prognosticating gigs, and the book and speaking tours. Normal America gets a higher national debt and even more strained national budget. And it’s our sons, daughters, brothers, cousins, and friends who go fight D.C.’s stupid wars.

As pundits and bureaucrats rotate from think tank job to government job and back again, how does this not affect policy?

After all these years of failure, the conservative party in America—containing pundits and politicians who will quickly claim they can’t do much about Normal America’s ills—is still perfectly happy to intervene in countries that most Americans can’t find on a map. The last time this worked was World War II, and maybe Korea. We’ve had many wars and interventions since that time.

Meanwhile, Normal America has all sorts of unaddressed problems: low wages for working males, single mothers yearning for happiness, dilapidated towns, abortion, crime, drugs, and hurting children.

Besides realigning U.S. military priorities, one solution to this misalignment of priorities is strict reporting laws and enforcement for foreign money. Too many of Washington’s pundits and think tanks take money from Saudi Arabia or Qatar, for example. The influential Brookings Institution receives all sorts of money from Qatar. As pundits and bureaucrats rotate from think tank job to government job and back again, how does this not affect policy?

Most importantly, America must get completely out of Iraq, and the Middle East. America won’t be around forever. You can count on that. But the longer we stay in the Middle East, the more we hasten the day that America ceases to exist. Or, worse, becomes unrecognizable from the good and just place it should be.

Watch Elizabeth Warren Struggle To Answer Whether Soleimani Was A Terrorist,"On ABC’s “The View” Tuesday, co-host Meghan McCain asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, why she altered a statement initially calling Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Gen. Qasem Soleimani a murderer, then flip-flopped to call his death an “assassination.”

“I don’t understand the flip flop. I don’t understand why it was so hard to call him a terrorist, and I would just like you to explain,” McCain said.

Warren tip-toed around the question until McCain pushed Warren by asking, “so, do you think he’s a terrorist?”

“He’s part of a group that’s been designated as terrorists,” Warren said.

“So, he’s not a terrorist?” McCain asked.

“Of course he is,” Warren said. “He’s part of a group that our federal government has designated as a terrorist.”

After the White House announced they had successfully killed Soelimani, Warren issued a statement calling Soleimani a “murderer” who was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans.

Soleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans. But this reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict. Our priority must be to avoid another costly war. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 3, 2020

She then issued another statement criticizing President Trump for the assassination of a foreign military official.

Donald Trump ripped up an Iran nuclear deal that was working. He’s repeatedly escalated tensions. Now he’s assassinated a senior foreign military official. He’s been marching toward war with Iran since his first days in office—but the American people won’t stand for it. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 3, 2020

It’s worth noting that Soleimani wasn’t just “part of a group” as Warren emphasized repeatedly. He was the leader of the Quds Force, a unit in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and a brutal one at that. When Warren says Soleimani was “part of a group,” that’s like saying Osama bin Laden was just part of al-Qaeda because al-Qaeda is designated as a terrorist organization.

If Warren wasn’t as protected and beloved by the media as she is as a 2020 candidate, journalists would have already pressed her on her squeamish rhetoric. You don’t have t support Trump or even agree with him to admit Soleimani was a terrorist.

"Pandering To The Left, Democrats Are Repeating The Mistakes Of 2016","Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren struggled to answer a simple question from Meghan McCain about whether she thinks Qassem Suleimani, the slain leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps’ Quds Force, was a terrorist.

A simple question, really. By any reasonable definition, Suleimani was definitely a terrorist. As commander of the Quds Force, his entire job was to foment terrorism and support armed insurgencies outside Iran. Quds Force operatives have carried out numerous terrorist attacks over the years and are active today in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and the Palestinian territories.

No wonder the United States designated the IRGC, including the Quds Force, as a terrorist group last year. Suleimani was not only the leader of Quds, he was the architect of all the things it did to deserve being designated a terrorist group. So yes, he was definitely a terrorist.

Yet Warren could barely bring herself to admit this. Pressed by McCain, who had to ask three times, all Warren could muster was a mealy mouthed acknowledgment that he was “part of a group” that the federal government has designated a terrorist organization, which is like saying Adolf Hitler was part of a group that temporarily occupied Europe.

The exchange captured everything Democrats haven’t learned since the last election. Donald Trump swept away the entire GOP primary field in 2016 partly because of his willingness to speak plainly about issues like the Iraq War, trade, and immigration—even if they went against the views of the Republican establishment or appeared to be at odds with the GOP base. When Trump lambasted the decision to invade Iraq during a primary debate in early 2016, for example, calling the war a “big, fat mistake” and blaming it on George W. Bush, he was saying out loud what most Americans by then had concluded but no other Republican would say—certainly not Jeb Bush, who was left fumbling.

The lesson of 2016, then, is that if you’re running for the Democratic nomination in 2020 and Trump takes out a major terrorist, just say it’s a good thing but look, Trump doesn’t have a broader strategy to deal with Iran, or he isn’t consistent on foreign policy, or it’s not that big of a deal compared to his impeachment—say anything, just don’t hem and haw and downplay what a bad guy Suleimani was because you want to score political points with the radical left wing of your party.

That is, don’t do what Warren did. Warren’s kowtowing to the left is what prompted McCain’s question to begin with. After the Suleimani strike, Warren issued a statement calling him a “murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans.” That got her in trouble with the left (because heaven forfend killing a bad guy like Suleimani might make Trump look good) so she issued a second statement, calling Suleimani a “senior foreign military official” whom Trump “assassinated.”

This is precisely the sort of pandering that no one took seriously in 2016 when Hillary Clinton suddenly reversed a number of long-held views in a shameless attempt to win over Bernie Sanders’s supporters. She repudiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she had previously called the “gold standard” of trade deals. She apologized for her support for the Iraq War, saying she “got it wrong.” She disavowed any connection to a criminal justice system shaped above all by her husband’s policies, calling for an end to the “era of mass incarceration.”

All of this was calculated to appease the Democratic Party’s left wing, and Democrats are doing the same thing as we head into the 2020 cycle. Joe Biden has had to backtrack or renounce much of his 40-year career in public office, on everything from criminal justice to school busing to federal funding for abortion. Not only can Biden not decide how much of his record to defend, he appears to be willing to fundamentally change his entire conception of civil rights.

Just about the only Democratic candidate who has been consistent is Sanders, whose views have more or less remained unchanged since the 1970s. Setting aside the folly of his socialist ideology, Sanders can at least credibly say, as he did four years ago, that what you see is what you get. Sure, it’s crazy that Sanders compared the killing of Suleimani to Russian President Vladimir Putin “assassinating dissidents,” but he really means it

He has that much in common with Trump, whose appeal in 2016 was largely based on the fact that he wasn’t a politician, couldn’t be bought by special interests, and had been saying the same things for years. If the other Democratic candidates don’t figure this out, and quickly, they’ll find themselves in the position of erstwhile GOP frontrunners of 2016, and Sanders will be the nominee.

Time's Iran Guide For Parents Refuses To Call Soleimani A Terrorist,"Time Magazine’s “Time for Kids” publication issued a guide Tuesday for parents on how to talk with their children about the situation unfolding in Iran riddled with biased omissions.

The legacy outlet first refers to Qasem Soleimani, the recently slain Iranian general responsible for hundreds of American deaths, as a “top military leader in Iran,” rather than a terrorist. In the next line, the guide explains that President Donald Trump took action on Soleimani simply because Trump said Soleimani was a terrorist.

The official position of the United States government however, declares the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which includes the Quds Force run by Soleimani, a terrorist organization.

In the same paragraph, the magazine for kids also notes that “an Iraqi leader was also killed,” minimizing the significance of their execution. The Iraqi leader? Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the founder of the terror group Kataeb Hezbollah, which killed an American contractor and injured four service members in Iraq late last month.

When describing the animosity between the two nations, Time’s guide mentions the 1979 hostage crisis where Iran took captive 52 Americans for 444 days, before focusing solely on Trump pulling out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimplementing sanctions on the Middle East country. Never mind Iran killing hundreds of Americans, undermining the landmark nuclear deal by building weapons of mass destruction anyway, financing terror, and threatening U.S. allies.

Trump approved the execution of Soleimani last week, pushing tensions between the two countries to reach new heights following several days of funeral processions. Iran retaliated Tuesday with strikes on U.S. missile bases in Iraq.

Since Soleimani’s death, Democrats have criticized Trump’s decision to kill the world’s most dangerous terrorist as reckless, denouncing the president’s actions out of fear of igniting another war in the Middle East.

U.S. forces are now on high alert for further Iranian retaliation in the aftermath of Soleimani’s death, and the White House has made clear that it will respond to whatever Iran does. U.S. intelligence officials reportedly told CNN that the Pentagon is concerned of an “imminent” attack after Iranian forces have moved weapons and military equipment in the region.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon Tuesday that while the United States was not looking for a war, it is “prepared to finish one.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/08/time-magazines-iran-guide-for-parents-refuses-to-call-soleimani-a-terrorist/,2020-01-08
Six Times The Mainstream Media Completely Botched Iran Coverage,"Viewers and readers of mainstream media outlets this week might assume America is on the brink of World War III. Of course, that couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, President Trump’s actions in Iran proved to be critical in re-establishing American deterrence.

Nevertheless, journalists and mainstream media outlets did their best to conjure reports of apocalyptic, World World III level threats, and to place blame for their causes at the feet of Trump.

Here are five times, just this week, the mainstream media completely botched the coverage of both Trump’s work in Iran and the killing of terrorist Quds force leader Qasem Soleimani.

1. Calling Soleimani’s Death An “Assassination”

In 2011, when Obama took out al-Queda terrorist Osama bin Laden, his death was celebrated in the United States. After all, he was the mastermind behind the horrific 9/11 attacks in New York City. But, in 2020, when Trump took out Quds force terrorist leader Soleimani, the New York Times decided to deem his death as an “assassination.”

The Boston Globe published an op-ed making the case that the US killed bin Laden, but assassinated Soleimani.

2. Soleimani Was A “Revered Military Figure.”

According to the Washington Post, the best way to label the brutal terrorist Soleimani is to highlight his military ranking. The Washington Post referred to Soleimani as a “revered military figure.”

The New Yorker published a eulogy reflecting on the violent terrorist days as a strapping, young bodybuilder.

“Sulemani, a flamboyant former construction worker and bodybuilder with snowy white hair, a dapper beard and arching salt-and-pepper eyebrows, gained notice during the eight-year war with Iraq, in the nineteen eighties,” the New Yorker reads.

3. U.S. Coverage Runs With Propaganda From Iranian State-Run Media

Mainstream media coverage highlighted commentary from Democrats who called what Trump did to Soleimani an “act of war” despite military intelligence of attacks that Soleimani was planning against the US. Media parroted this talking point, saying that Trump is escalating an already tense situation into war. This talking point come from the authoritarian, government-run news media in Iran.

Media reports shared the Iranian narrative that Iranian citizens were saddened by the death of Soleimani. NBC News showcased the “huge crowds” that turned out to allegedly mourn Soleimani’s death. CNN also reported, “crowds swarm[ed] Tehran to mourn slain Iran military leader Soleimani.” These reports conveniently omit the fact that most of this crowd was forced to attend Soleimani’s mourning.

One Iranian journalist, Masih Alinejad wrote that the government forced students and officials to attending Soleimani’s funeral by busing students in and ordering businesses closed. “According to videos sent to me by people inside the country, the authorities are making little kids write essays praising the fallen commander. First-graders who didn’t know how to write were encouraged to cry for Soleimani.”

4. World War III Is Looming

CBN News reported, the U.S.-Iran showdown has left some wondering, will we have World War III? In fact, the media’s affect on U.S. citizens was so prominent that the Selective Service’s website actually crashed.

“Due to the spread of misinformation, our website is experiencing high traffic volumes at this time. If you are attempting to register or verify registration, please check back later today as we are working to resolve this issue,” the Selective Service Twitter account said.

5. Media Reported Iraq Government Voted To Expel U.S. Troops

Media outlets reported that the Iraqi government voted to expel United States troops from Iraq.

“On Friday, Iraq’s caretaker prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said that he had asked U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to send a delegation to Iraq that could establish a plan for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country,” reported the Washington Post.

In reality, Iraq’s prime minister resigned in December due to Iraqi protests stating the Mahdi government was controlled by Iran. The majority in the Iraqi government is Shiite controlled, and considered anti-American, where as the minority Sunni and Kurd populations have a more favorable sentiment towards U.S. troops. The Sunni and Kurd MPs in the Iraqi government actually boycotted the vote designed to expel U.S. troops.

The vote was also non-binding, but that wasn’t fitting to the mainstream media narrative, which left that fact often omitted.

6. MSNBC Falsely Reported American Casualties

After the U.S. killed Soleimani, Iran responded by firing ballistic missiles at Iraqi air bases which housed U.S. troops. There were no American or Iraqi casualties from these missiles. This didn’t stop MSNBC from falsely reporting Iranian propaganda that 30 Americans were killed from the missiles.

“Iran’s state media is claiming that 30 U.S. solider have been killed in this attack,” said MSNBC’s Ali Arouzi.

No Senate Democrat Joins Praise Of U.S. Military For Soleimani's Death,"With the support of 42 other GOP senators, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a resolution yesterday afternoon to commend the president for ordering “successful operations” in Iranian terrorist Qassam Soleimani’s death and to honor the members of U.S. military and intelligence agencies who aided in the targeted killing of “a terrorist responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people across the Middle East, including 603 US service members.”

Cruz hoped partisan divisions would be sufficiently and temporarily suppressed for the sake of commending the administration for destroying the mastermind behind the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. However, not one Democratic senator could marshal the courage to co-sponsor the resolution with him.

Indeed, Cruz purposely analogized the resolution to the one introduced in 2011 honoring those who ordered and assisted in the killing of Osama bin Laden. Senate Resolution 159 was introduced by Sen. Harry Reid (D-CA) just three days after U.S. forces killed bin Laden under President Obama in May 2011. That resolution was sponsored by the entire Senate, serving as an emphatic symbol of the chamber’s capacity for bipartisan statements — at least when they praise Democrats.

Cruz’s resolution is deliberately modeled after the language used in Reid’s resolution. Indeed, a side-by-side comparison of S. Resolution 159 and Cruz’s Soleimani resolution indicates that the main method for penning Cruz’s resolution was substituting words, swapping the crimes of bin Laden for the crimes of Soleimani and subbing Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) for al-Qaeda.

Both resolutions emphasize the importance of “bringing terrorists to justice” through “defeating, disrupting, and dismantling” the respective organizations of bin Laden and Soleimani.” But most importantly, both offered unequivocal praise for the intelligence community, the U.S. Armed Forces, and the president.

Cruz’s resolution arrives at a critical time, when the Democrats seem overwhelmingly poisoned by partisanship — to the staggering point that they have struggled to even refer to Soleimani as a terrorist, despite his leadership role in a group formally designated a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) by the U.S. State Department. Nothing symbolizes this disturbing recalcitrance more than the fact that Cruz could not convince one Democrat to co-sponsor the Soleimani resolution with him. Compare this objectively pathetic response to the one Reid managed to muster, which resulted in the entire Senate sponsoring the resolution.

Commending those who killed a terrorist responsible for the loss of hundreds of American lives should not be a controversial endeavor, and Cruz’s choice to lift words directly from S. Resolution 159 represents a substantial attempt to keep this venture as non-partisan as possible. Regardless, congressional records reveal that 26 Democratic senators sponsored Reid’s resolution against bin Laden but opted not to sponsor Cruz’s resolution against Soleimani. Meanwhile, the entire Senate GOP sponsored Reid’s resolution and most of the current Senate GOP sponsored Cruz’s.

This disparity in voting records tells a story about the state of the modern Democratic Party and how partisan hackery has eroded its moral compass. Given the two resolutions employed the same language and were both directed at a purely evil contributor to myriad murders, it’s difficult to generate any rational conclusion as to why not one Democrat could gather the moral fortitude to sponsor the resolution.

Yet we know precisely why those 26 Democrats abstained from joining Cruz’s resolution. They hate Trump more than they find inherent moral value in destroying evil, and it’s becoming increasingly apparent that these are the actions of deeply unserious people. Cruz likely was testing how far the Democrats would allow their detestation of Trump to cloud their ability to celebrate the demonstrable Good and condemn the objective Bad. Apparently, quite a bit.

But why should we express surprise or consternation? One Democratic member of Congress explained the Iranian confrontation to a Washington Post reporter, uttering, “You need two crazy leaders to start a war, and fortunately, Iran doesn’t have one.” Yes, this elected member of Congress believes there is a moral equivalency between a regime that hangs gay people from cranes, forces women to don specific clothing, and slaughters thousands globally each year via proxy terror groups. It’s simply psychotic.

Even a mere glimpse of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) giggling as her fellow representative discussed those Soleimani killed provides a peripheral data point of how Senate Democrats’ rot seems to unsurprisingly apply to the other chamber, as well. It’s certainly and thankfully not every Democrat who exercises such morally bankrupt logic, but the theatrics seem to emanate from unfortunately the most visible and vocal.

With the death of Soleimani, Senate Democrats had an opportunity to locate the objective Bad but explicitly chose not to. For all their cries of “Orange man bad!” and analogies comparing Trump to Stalin or Hitler, it seems they are demonstrably challenged and utterly incompetent at identifying what genuinely constitutes “bad.” In the same way House Democrats bemoaned condemning antisemitism explicitly, it seems Senate Democrats can’t muster the courage to despise a terrorist more than they despise Trump.

"If These 2020 Dems Were President, Terrorist Qasem Soleimani Would Still Be Alive","Three 2020 Democratic candidates said killing Iranian terrorist leader Qasem Soleimani was the wrong call by President Donald Trump during the eighth round of Democratic debates. Pete Buttigeig, Joe Biden, and Bernie Sanders all said if they were president, they would not have ordered the strike on Quds Force leader Soleimani.

“Given what you know about Soleimani, if your national security team came to you with an opportunity to strike, would Soleimani have been dead, or would he still be alive under your presidency?” ABC anchor and debate moderator David Muir asked Buttigieg.

“In the situation that we saw with President Trump’s decision, there is no evidence that that made our country safer,” Buttigieg said.

In contrast, Sanders called the killing of a brutal terrorist leader an “assassination.” Sanders also said killing Soleimani or other terrorists the U.S. doesn’t like leads to world anarchy.

“You cannot go around saying, ‘You’re a bad guy, we’re gonna assassinate you.’ And then you’re gonna have, if that happens, you’re opening the door to internationally anarchy,” Sanders said.

Wow. Bernie Sanders just called the killing of Soleimani an “assassination” Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of thousands of incident people, including U.S. soldiers. I’m glad our President took him out! Bernie is disgusting. RT! https://t.co/FizS3EpKqm — Ryan Fournier (@RyanAFournier) February 8, 2020

Finally, Muir posed the question to Biden, who said he would not have ordered the strike on Soleimani because the terrorist leader was not an imminent threat.

“The Obama administration was aware of the threat Soleimani posed, so was the Bush administration before. I’m asking tonight, as commander in chief, though, would you have ordered the strike?” Muir asked Biden.

“No, and the reason I wouldn’t have ordered the strike — there’s no evidence yet of imminent threat that was going to come from him,” Biden said.

A Domestic Terrorism Law Would Create More Problems Than It Solves,"Would a federal domestic terrorism law do much to solve violent extremism here at home? There’s now a push underway to enact legislation to that effect, with a New York Times feature story trumpeting the effort necessary to suppress the new threat of “white supremacy.”

The Times relies on a new report by the New Jersey office of Homeland Security and Preparedness that equates “White Supremacists” with “Homegrown Violent Extremists” as equally “high”-level threats.

Homegrown Violent Extremism is the preferred DHS euphemism for jihadist terrorists whose ties to a specific terror group cannot be established. Ironically, the report goes on to list the groups with whose ideology the so-called HVEs align, including al-Qaeda and Islamic State, as “Low” threats. The FBI investigates HVEs under the rubric of international terrorism for this reason.

Federal law differentiates international terrorism, committed by members of designated foreign groups or by American nationals in league with these foreign groups, and domestic terrorism, when there is no such foreign link.

While some states have domestic terrorism legislation, the laws almost always require the commission of a violent crime before authorities can legally intervene. This means prosecutors can often do little to preempt attacks when perpetrators are discovered, except to file relatively minor weapons charges. There is no similar legislation at the federal level. So we have the pattern of “known wolves” whom authorities had identified but were powerless to stop before a mass shooting or terrorist attack.

In comparison, membership in a designated foreign terrorist organization is itself a crime, and acts of material support (including raising money, engaging in propaganda and the like) are also felonies and can be aggressively prosecuted. Could domestic groups be similarly proscribed, as many on both right and left have argued?

Getting Bad Guys Without Crushing American Rights

The answer is not as easy as common sense would have us believe. Challenges hinder drawing up domestic terrorism legislation in a nation founded on liberty. Yet the early American founders dealt with two severe and violent rebellions—Shay’s Rebellion in Massachusetts and the Whiskey Rebellion in and around western Pennsylvania—and suppressed both unapologetically. Clearly the duly elected representatives of the people, acting with just authority, need not suffer the whims of domestic factions that would use or threaten violence to achieve political aims.

How does one rightfully draw distinctions between domestic factions with seditious intent, and the people jealously guarding their rights? When the government utilizes seemingly vague terms like “Anti-Government” in its rubric, it raises genuine concerns from citizens. How ought the government to determine who is, and who is not, a threat?

In foreign terrorism, this is relatively easy. Any attempt by foreign entities to overthrow the government or the Constitution, or forcefully impose foreign law, is de facto illegitimate. Current U.S. immigration regulations provide guidelines:

The officer will review an applicant’s record and testimony during the interview on the naturalization application to determine whether he or she was ever a member of or in any way associated (either directly or indirectly) with: The Communist Party; any other totalitarian party; or a terrorist organization. Current and previous membership in these organizations may indicate a lack of attachment to the Constitution and an indication that the applicant is not well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.

Recently a U.S. judge ruled that al-Qaeda operative Iyam Faris, an immigrant from Pakistan, would be stripped of his American citizenship. The government argued that Faris lied on immigration papers before becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1999 and that his terrorist affiliations demonstrated a lack of commitment to the U.S. Constitution.

Foreigners who become citizens must swear a commitment to the Constitution as a condition of naturalization. Such commitment for natural-born citizens is presumed. But by what means do security agencies make a distinction between a patriot with a healthy distrust of the government and a dangerous proponent of national socialism, Communism, or radical Islam?

What Does It Mean to Support the Constitution?

Most of us have a moral sense that allows us to understand these fundamental differences. In a Hill article arguing for domestic terrorism legislation, Seamus Hughes and Jon Lewis cite the case of Christopher Hasson, the white supremacist arrested with a stockpile of arms, as the best example of the domestic threat.

It seems reasonable that Hasson would fail this key test about defending the Constitution. Obviously, native-born citizens cannot be stripped of their American citizenship. But the language of the constitutional loyalty test does provide a framework for understanding why George Washington is rightfully regarded as a freedom fighter and Hasson as a domestic terrorist.

Historically, this was not so controversial. The U.S. government took strong action to disrupt and destroy the Ku Klux Klan, Black Panthers, and Weather Underground precisely because they understood the groups, by their ideological nature and their behavior, represented threats to the Constitution. The FBI first targeted the KKK in 1915, not because of terrorism, but because of its subversive ideology.

Our government and its security and law enforcement agencies are empowered to act against threats in fulfilment of their obligation to defend the Constitution from all enemies, “foreign and domestic.” But doing so requires understanding the ideological motivations of those that threaten.

What Motivates a ‘Violent Extremist,’ Anyway?

Today we use the term “violent extremist,” which contains a circular logic. A person is considered an “extremist” if he is able or willing to engage in violence in support of his views, yet his motivation for violence is presumed to be his fervent beliefs. Are views extreme because they are violent? Or are they violent because they are extreme?

This formulation makes the intensity of belief the determining factor for whether an individual or group should be of interest to law enforcement, rather than the degree to which their beliefs are incompatible with constitutional governance.

Politicization within the very services committed to protect the nation against terrorism has ruined what had been a common-sense approach.

Politicization within the very services committed to protect the nation against terrorism has ruined what had been a common-sense approach. In 2009, a Department of Homeland Security report on “Right-Wing Extremism” raised an uproar after it was found to have identified Second Amendment supporters and military veterans among potential extremists. The report outraged conservatives, including legislators, who observed that it drew far too wide a net that targeted people holding positions well within the American constitutional norm.

DHS eventually withdrew the report. The author of the document, Daryl Johnson, later wrote a series for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), and the SPLC’s Mark Potok wrote the foreword to Johnson’s book.

This is a good example of how politicization has corrupted institutions of trust. The SPLC has received millions of dollars in donations for deliberately stretching and obscuring the definition of threats for decades. SPLC and its sympathizers increasingly draw little distinction between threats on which there is widespread agreement, and regular, if conservative, participants in the political process, ranging from the Alliance Defending Freedom to the Family Research Council.

Partisan groups like the SPLC labeled tens of thousands of law-abiding Americans supporting the Second Amendment in Richmond, Virginia as “far-right extremists.” Virginia’s governor used the claimed presence of “extremists” as an excuse to invoke a legally questionable “state of emergency” in an effort to disrupt the protest, further exacerbating tensions with Virginia citizens seeking to exercise constitutional rights.

Ignoring Ideological Content Is a Problem

Labeling one’s political opponents as “extremists,” thereby implying they deserve the full power of governmental scrutiny and even arrest, is ripe for abuse. Without “commitment to the Constitution” as a limiting principle, any group that fervently believes in its position can be labeled an “extremist.”

Before we enact any legislation, the president and Congress must rebuild trust in American institutions.

The federal government, wedded to the content-neutral “violent extremism” narrative, finds itself increasingly incapable of analyzing the ideological and doctrinal makeup of threats, including of Islamists, Antifa, national socialists, black nationalists, or white supremacist groups, that pull at the country’s fabric. There is the ever-present temptation to include among “extremists” those with legitimate constitutional concerns.

Despite what intemperate civil libertarians might argue, there is nothing precluding the establishment of a federal domestic terrorism law. Such a law may indeed be fruitful and necessary.

But recent scandals involving not just a few bad actors at the top, but politicized careerists who engage in partisanship even while claiming to be impartial professionals have substantially weakened the public’s trust of the intelligence and law enforcement bureaucracy. Indeed, their misconduct causes reasonable people to question those officials’ commitment to upholding their oaths to the Constitution.

Before we enact any legislation, the president and Congress must rebuild trust in American institutions. They must act against the current politicized culture and insist our intelligence and law enforcement agencies reorient their understanding of domestic threats to one in accord with the country’s first principles.

Middle Eastern Leaders Are Moving Towards A New And Better Eras,"Confident, pro-American powers in the Middle East stand closer to “real peace” than perhaps at any time in history.

For the last several years, I’ve written enthusiastically about shifting political trends in the Middle East, and how they have manifested massive regional changes in religion, diplomacy, and culture. The most significant: The determined turn away by most Gulf states from Islamism and the Muslim Brotherhood; their warming, gradual normalization with Israel; and the emergence of a new, energetic, and pro-American nationalism across the region. While these three trends are intertwined, they are distinct.

States like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates now understand that the Brotherhood’s mischief-making abroad is of a piece with the threats to their domestic rule. They likewise recognize they’re better off with a strong Israel than without one, especially as they face a shared threat in Iran.

These geopolitical concerns have opened the door to mutual problem-solving on a variety of issues, from technology to finance. Buoyed by younger, charismatic leaders like Mohammed bin Salman (Saudi Arabia’s MBS) and Mohammed bin Zayed (the UAE’s MBZ), the Islamic identity cemented by the War on Terror is being eclipsed by optimistic national pride and embrace of social reforms.

Critically, these developments have emerged organically. No master negotiator or scores of external lobbyists and spinmeisters—the professional “peace processors”—have contrived them. Nor has the United States or any other superpower decreed from above.

It’s Stumbling Sometimes, But It’s Progress

While the normalization trajectory is positive, it inevitably suffers from two steps forward and one step back. This shouldn’t be surprising. When dealing with autonomous nations and millions of people’s personal, professional, financial, and diplomatic motivations, it’s the trend line and the underlying strategic interests that are important. These missteps shouldn’t be glossed over, but put into proper perspective.

More than any other country, United Arab Emirates deserves credit for waging war on Islamists at home and weakening their power abroad, including in the West, where groups like the Muslim Brotherhood now have their strongest foothold. Similarly, no other Arab country has committed itself officially to religious tolerance. People of all faiths feel welcome in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and the ruling bin Zayed family lead possibly the most forward-thinking monarchy in the world on co-existence.

That’s not to say there haven’t been mistakes. An embarrassing one involves both the Emirates and Egypt—which, since the ascent of President al-Sisi, has potently combatted the Brotherhood.

Last year, to great fanfare, Pope Francis visited Abu Dhabi and signed a joint statement to foster a “culture of mutual respect” between Catholics and Muslims. Like so many interfaith texts, the “Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together” was vaporous, breaking neither philosophical nor religious ground. It urged Catholics and Muslims to “rediscover the values of peace, justice, goodness, beauty, human fraternity and coexistence … and to promote them everywhere.”

The optics mattered more. Both the church and the Emirates aimed to present an image of harmony between believers of their faiths, even if aspirational.

A Stumbling Block to Faith

Pope Francis’s Islamic counterpart, however, was more than a little problematic. Representing the Islamic faith under the auspices of the Emirates’ event was Ahmad al-Tayyeb, the grand imam of the legendary al-Azhar University in Cairo. In Islamic scholarship and jurisprudence, al-Azhar carries tremendous weight; no other institution in Sunni Islam enjoys comparable reputation or authority. While the new nationalism is eclipsing Islamism in the Arabian Gulf, al-Azhar remains a powerful institution.

It is to al-Azhar’s credibility that the Emirates appealed when they selected al-Tayyeb to represent world Muslims. They chose poorly. Upon al-Tayyeb’s return to Cairo—only four days after meeting Pope Francis and touting coexistence, fraternity, and peace—the grand imam hosted leaders of the Palestinian terror group Hamas. Al-Azhar welcomed Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, who infamously denounced the 2011 U.S. raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan, saying: “We condemn the assassination and the killing of an Arab holy warrior.”

Al-Tayyeb assumed his position in 2010, months prior to the Arab Spring. He was appointed by former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. He was seen as a regime loyalist and a foe of the Muslim Brotherhood. That antipathy to the Brotherhood, it seems, only extended as far as the university campus. From its founding until today, Hamas considers itself the branch of the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine.

Jew Hatred Is a Major Impediment to Progress

Considering his public display of affection for the leaders of the antisemitic terror group, it shouldn’t be surprising that al-Tayyeb hates Jews. In 2013, al-Tayyeb made clear that he believes Jews are the eternal villain of Islamic history. “Since the inception of Islam 1,400 years ago, we have been suffering from Jewish and Zionist interference in Muslim affairs. This is a cause of great distress for the Muslims.”

In another television interview, the Grand Imam rejected the distinction between the Jewish people and Israel. “Recognizing that Judaism is one thing different than Zionism and that Jews are one thing and Israel is another one is all not true,” he said. For good measure, he added: “Antisemitism is a lie and doesn’t exist. People around the world don’t believe it anymore.”

Al-Tayyeb has a unique definition of terrorism and its causes. At a conference in 2014, he explained: “The American veto [at the United Nations] with regard to the Zionist-Palestinian conflict, for example, is the most important reason for international terrorism, and for supporting it or even for participating in it in one form or another, despite the authors of such veto state, describing the victim of terrorism as being the [origin of] terrorism.”

Al-Tayyeb and al-Azhar under his leadership have faced withering fire from groups within Egypt as well. In a 2016 report, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies blasted al-Tayyeb’s credibility as an authentic voice for religious pluralism, noting that he “claims there is no contradiction between upholding the principle of religious freedom and sanctioning the killing of citizens simply for changing their religious beliefs.”

Three years before al-Tayyeb’s back-to-back photo ops with the pope and Hamas terror leaders, the 2016 report concluded, “Al-Azhar adopts two contradictory discourses, a relatively open-minded discourse directed abroad, and another sanctioning violent extremism intended for domestic consumption.”

The voices of prominent clerics are important because they can reinforce or undermine perceptions and eliminate or encourage distrust. As Gulf states advance normalization with Israel, their promotion of clerics or religious figures with antisemitic, anti-Zionist, or pro-Islamist views are, to put it mildly, counterproductive.

This isn’t merely an issue for the Jewish State; Americans, too, are sensitive toward antisemitism and see the defense of groups like Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood as poisonous. Promoting moderate, western-friendly clerics and Muslim religious leaders should be more than public relations. It makes strategic sense as well.

Religious Tolerance Is Necessary to Move Forward

The Emirates should be applauded for its efforts in fostering the values of comity, affection, and co-existence between religious faiths, especially in a region where such tolerance has been rare. The recently announced Abrahamic House of Fraternity on Saadiyat Island near Abu Dhabi is a remarkable first-ever construction of a large church, mosque, and synagogue in one complex.

“The UAE has people from the Jewish faith, the Christian faith and, of course, the Muslim faith,” Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, chairman of the UAE’s Department of Culture and Tourism, told the media. “We are creating a place where they can practice their religion freely and learn from each other.” These efforts are authentic and, for the West’s Jews and Christians, both welcome and heart-warming.

But the Emirate’s leaders—and indeed, Saudi Arabia’s and Egypt’s—should not mistake high-profile interfaith happenings for the substantial progress toward peace that can result only from shared strategic interests as nation-states. In the real world, far away from the “peace processors” in luxury seaside resorts or European capitals, economic, military, technological interests are the glue binding relationships between countries. As political entities, nations are far more powerful peace partners.

It’s critical that the Arab world’s interfaith efforts are more than PR directed abroad. The trends toward and authentic peace and normalization in the Middle East today are between nations, rather than amorphous concepts like “civilizations,” which lead to little tangible, political results. As such, they can survive the occasional mistake, oversight, or misstep. And they will survive the poor choice of spokesmen such as al-Tayyeb for the interfaith cause.

Will The Taliban Uphold Its End Of The Afghanistan Deal?,"After almost 19 years of war, the United States has successfully negotiated a peace agreement with the Taliban, setting up an eventual total withdrawal of American and coalition military forces in 14 months, so long as the Taliban holds up their end of the bargain. The full text of the agreement makes clear the desired end state is indeed a full-stop U.S. exit from the war:

The United States is committed to withdraw from Afghanistan all military forces of the United States, its allies, and Coalition partners, including all non-diplomatic civilian personnel, private security contractors, trainers, advisors, and supporting services personnel within fourteen (14) months following announcement of this agreement…

It further states, in the first 135 days of the agreement: “They will reduce the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan to eight thousand six hundred (8,600) and proportionally bring reduction in the number of its allies and Coalition forces.”

The 8,600 number has been floated for some time, initially implied as an enduring presence to facilitate counter-terrorism operations in the jihadist-infested country while reducing the overall scope of the mission. But, as the agreement makes clear, the United States and its allies are indeed looking for the exits. If all goes to plan, U.S. and coalition forces will completely vacate Afghanistan by spring 2021.

While it may be too early for optimism, it is not too early to say this is a major milestone. Since the beginning of his campaign, President Donald Trump has constantly pledged to end America’s “endless wars.” He spent the first three years of administration largely failing to do so, even escalating the effort in Afghanistan in August 2017.

His attempts, most notably the bid to withdraw troops from eastern Syria, have been haphazard and poorly coordinated, and lacked the energy and focus necessary to make big decisions stick. But here we are, at an agreement with the Taliban, something neither the Bush nor Obama administrations achieved in their combined 16 years of presiding over the conflict.

The Moment We’ve Been Waiting For?

The deal also comes a few months after proposed peace talks at Camp David were scuttled in September upon the death of an American soldier. Since the start of the administration, the United States had ramped up the air war on the Taliban, dropping 7,423 weapons on Afghanistan in 2019. These numbers rival the ordnance expenditures of the 2010 – ’11 “surge” era of the Obama administration. Following the cessation of talks in September, the United States continued to strike the Taliban through the new year, until a seven-day period of reduced violence to facilitate talks between the two sides.

Is this the moment we have been waiting for? Or is it too good to be true? For the agreement to hold up, the Taliban must, above all else, “not allow any of its members, other individuals or groups, including al-Qa’ida, to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies.” This is, of course, the billion-dollar question behind the agreement: can the Taliban be trusted to not permit terrorists to use the country as a safe haven?

It’s a largely irrelevant question, however, since the safe haven argument is a myth. As the Cato Institute’s John Glaser and John Mueller explained last summer:

…the notion that terrorists need a lot of space and privacy to hatch plots of substantial magnitude in the West has been repeatedly undermined by tragic terrorist attacks in Madrid in 2004, London in 2005, Paris in 2015, and Brussels and Istanbul in 2016. None of the attackers in those incidents operated from a safe haven, nor were their plans coordinated by a group within a safe haven.

While most of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 received training in Afghanistan, much of their planning and preparation took place in the United States and Germany, including flight training. Ultimately, the decisive factor in the success of 9/11, like most terror attacks, came down to their ability to infiltrate and live freely in the country they sought to devastate.

Terrorists’ ‘Havens’ Are Their Hosts

Terrorists are also highly mobile and not beholden to any particular territory. For example, both Taliban-friendly groups like al-Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)-friendly militants operate just over the border in northwest Pakistan. It’s in this sector of Pakistan, a supposed ally, where the United States has long waged a shadow war against these groups, highlighted by the mission that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011. The U.S counterterror mission in Central Asia long ago shifted east to Pakistan; the fight in Afghanistan has become all about nation-building and defeating the Taliban.

That said, the Taliban would certainly welcome a U.S. departure, incentivizing their compliance with the terms of the agreement. Even if the Taliban were not in full compliance with the agreement, a “spiritual” compliance would more than suffice.

What U.S. policymakers most fear is another terrorist attack on U.S. soil, the sort which precipitated the initial military intervention in October 2001. If America does not suffer a terror attack whose origins can be traced back to Afghanistan, policymakers would much rather adhere to the deal, regardless of whether the Taliban fulfilled every obligation to the letter.

The Next Time the Taliban Attacks

This leaves the question of what happens when the last U.S. soldier departs Afghanistan for good. Will the Taliban return to harboring terrorists bent on attacking the American homeland? What will be the U.S. response? Will a response even be feasible without a military presence in Central Asia? What will become of America’s covert war in northwest Pakistan?

The same rules apply: if another terrorist attack does not occur within the United States or allied countries that can be traced back to Afghanistan, American policymakers will find it much easier to stick to the script and stay away. The American public has largely tuned out Afghanistan, and the dearth of media coverage is unfortunate, but it is likely any re-escalation of the war will have negative political repercussions. Likewise, the Taliban do not want to see American troops on Afghan soil ever again and are more concerned with seizing power in Kabul than they are attacking the United States.

This certainly does not prevent terrorists from taking refuge in Afghanistan, of course. The ability to deny terrorists safe haven and prevent attacks is in large part outside the Taliban’s control, since there exists territory they do not control and the movement is quite fractured. But as long as the United States maintains an “I’ll be back” posture, demonstrated with cruise missile strikes on Afghanistan in 1998 and the air/sea/special operations effort in the early part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the Taliban will do all it can to prevent an American return.

What Happens to Afghanistan Next

What will become of Afghanistan itself? The agreement does not explicitly associate withdrawal with rapprochement between the government in Kabul and the Taliban, but Secretary of Defense Mark Esper seemed to do just that in a Washington Post op-ed, writing, “If progress stalls, then our drawdown likely will be suspended, as well.” Will the door to renewed involvement remain forever open?

During the 14-month duration of the agreement, the United States needs to be able to defer any notion that Afghanistan will collapse until after the 2020 election.

Perhaps, but this may also be mere posturing. Given the Taliban does not view the Kabul government as legitimate, the likelihood of any lasting peace between the two sides is unlikely, a fact Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley conceded. Thus, tying withdrawal to the success of intra-Afghan talks is likely a way of saying, “We won’t abandon you.”

During the 14-month duration of the agreement, the United States needs to be able to defer any notion that Afghanistan will collapse until after the 2020 election and the total withdrawal is complete. Suicide bombings and terrorism, which remain likely, can upset that delicate balance.

The situation is reminiscent of 1972, another election year, when the Nixon administration negotiated with North Vietnam to end America’s involvement in Southeast Asia. Bombing of the North had resumed earlier in the year following a three-and-a-half-year cessation. In the fall, negotiations appeared to have made progress, with National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger announcing, “Peace is at hand.”

This aided Nixon in winning a landslide victory in November, but peace talks faltered in December, leading to one final bombing blitz on North Vietnam, forcing the latter back to the bargaining table. A final agreement was signed at the Paris Peace Accords in January 1973, finally ending America’s role in the war.

The lesson of Vietnam is not that history repeats itself, but that there is a long way to go before America’s involvement in Afghanistan finally ends. Afghanistan’s salvation is outside American control, so the goal is to create the “decent interval” necessary to distance ourselves from the consequences of withdrawal. Afghanistan may be doomed to fall to the Taliban without U.S. support, but the United States cannot bring deliverance upon Afghanistan either. Sooner or later, the American intervention will outlive its usefulness.

After 19 years of blood, sweat, and tears, perhaps the time has come to let it be.

Media Ignores Muslim Extremists' Plans To Us Coronavirus For Terror,"Breathless reporting that neo-Nazis and white supremacists intend to use coronavirus as a weapon is spreading through the corporate media faster than the virus itself. Yet the media practiced its own “social distancing” from a similar story a few weeks earlier, about a New York-based Muslim Brotherhood member who videotaped himself urging people to infect police and military members with the virus.

According to the report from ABC News, members of law enforcement in New York City received an alert from the FBI regarding reports that: “‘Members of extremist groups are encouraging one another to spread the virus, if contracted, through bodily fluids and personal interactions.’ The FBI alert, which went out on Thursday, told local police agencies that extremists want their followers to try to use spray bottles to spread bodily fluids to cops on the street. The extremists are also directing followers to spread the disease to Jews by going ‘any place they may be congregated, to include markets, political offices, businesses and places of worship.’”

While nothing quoted in the ABC News report specifically mentions white supremacists as the focus of the FBI alert despite the headline, other reporting does seem to confirm the story. Yahoo News cited a Federal Protective Service memo that noted, “White Racially Motivated Violent Extremists have recently commented on the coronavirus stating that it is an ‘OBLIGATION’ to spread it should any of them contract the virus.” Racially Motivated Violent Extremists is an ambiguous term adopted by the FBI to refer to all forms of racist extremism after blowback from members of Congress forced the law enforcement agency to abandon the term “Black Identity Extremists.”

On March 16, nearly a week prior to the ABC News story, the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) reported on a New York-based Muslim Brotherhood member, Bahgat Saber, who urged any Egyptian with coronavirus to deliberately spread the disease to Egyptian military, police, and political figures. Saber also stated he would personally spread it to the Egyptian Consulate in New York, if he were to be infected.

In contrast to the ABC news report about white supremacists, which relies on leaked quotes from a single law enforcement alert, MEMRI provides video evidence of Saber making his remarks. Yet they were not covered in the mainstream media, while only a handful of few conservative and Jewish outlets mentioned the story. The website Algemeiner very responsibly covered both stories, however, noting, “Neo-Nazi and Islamist extremists have found another common cause” in spreading the virus.

The potential of bioterrorism is a genuine concern, and needs to be taken seriously, regardless of the source. In practice, however, the federal government does not have a sterling record of success with bioterror investigations.

In 1998, the FBI arrested Larry Wayne Harris, a reported member of the Aryan Nation White supremacist group, for an alleged plot to spread anthrax in New York City based on boasts he’d allegedly made that were reported to the Bureau. But the case collapsed at trial, when what the FBI believed to be anthrax turned out to be anthrax vaccine.

An Anti-Defamation League report on extremism and bioterrorism notes that Harris was actually obsessed with the notion of preventing, not causing, a bioterror attack and suffered from fantastical delusions. At the time, Sen. Chuck Grassley called the case an example of the FBI “crying wolf.”

The bureau was similarly embarrassed in 2001, after it tried and failed to pin the 2001 anthrax attacks on scientist Steven Hatfill, who eventually won a $5.8 million settlement from the government for their behavior, which included leaks to the media. The federal government later claimed the attacks were carried out by scientist Bruce Ivins, although the allegations were never proven in court after Ivins committed suicide before he could be charged.

Subsequent media investigations raised doubts about Ivins’s culpability as well. The FBI’s mishandling of the 2001 anthrax case became an element of reporting during the Robert Mueller special counsel investigation, when Bureau critics pointed out that both Mueller and James Comey had played a role in the botched case. In both cases the stories were breathlessly reported by a willing media that took FBI leaks at face value.

It is important that significant terror threats, including bioterrorism, be thoroughly investigated. However, one should be wary of leaked reports, which do not provide the total perspective of the likelihood of the threat.

Extremists of all stripes routinely discuss potential plots that they have neither the capability nor the willingness to carry out. While the media and some politicians will continue to make white supremacists the singular domestic terror focus, law enforcement should take a more measured approach.

How Socialists Like Black Lives Matter Weaponize Fears Of Loneliness,"Black Lives Matter is a Marxist scam. As with all totalitarian ploys, BLM uses your natural fear of social rejection to force conformity and compliance with its goals. If we buy into it, we have a lot to lose, including all individual liberties—freedom of speech, of thought, and especially the right to a private life and private relationships.

The BLM goal should be obvious by now: conjure up enough blind conformity to create the illusion of unanimous support. Support for what? The uncontroversial slogan that black lives matter is just a tool to draw you in emotionally to its broader and more destructive agenda.

Read the BLM website and you’ll find lots of Marxist agendas like ending constitutional self-governance (under the guise of “sustainable transformation”) and taking over law enforcement to abolish the rule of law (“defund the police”). It’s anti-Christian and anti-free markets. It’s committed to “disrupting” the nuclear family and replacing it with collectivist forms of child-rearing. Its endgame is typical of Marxism: a power grab stoked by the illusion of mass approval through street theater.

When we get sucked in to the vortex of BLM’s mass delusions, whether out of a sense of guilt or ignorance, the results are predictable. Forced confessions. Struggle sessions. The suppression of speech. Stoking of resentments. Accusations of thought crimes. Toppling historical monuments. Civilizational breakdown. Meddling in private life, especially family.

So, what’s the secret of creating enough woke conformity to get to such an anti-thought point? How does a well-organized band of power-craving elitists get people to surrender the right to speak their own minds? To open the door to giving collectivist elites the raw power they crave?

I’ll use the terms socialism and Marxism somewhat interchangeably. Marxists tend to refer to themselves as socialists, even if some socialists claim they aren’t Marxists. All are collectivists, though, with the same patterns and tendencies and agendas, some harder than others, depending on their “state of evolution.”

Weaponizing the Fear of Loneliness

The threat of ostracism is a primal and universal human terror, and thus an extremely powerful weapon, especially when mobs enforce it. Tyrants have always been in the business of cultivating the terror of social rejection in order to control people and amass power. Sadly, most people are not consciously aware of these dynamics, and are therefore vulnerable to succumbing.

The terror of abandonment is built into our social DNA because human beings cannot survive in isolation. What we see today is a psychological operation that plays on that fear through identity politics, peer-modelling, and social contagion.

First, the propaganda media conjures up images of unanimity with a false BLM narrative. Then, anyone who doesn’t buy in is smeared as a racist, at great risk of losing his or her job, status, livelihood, and now even family. It’s designed to induce everyone to cave in to that primal fear of social isolation and submit to the power elites. Once society reaches a tipping point where everyone blindly succumbs, then the power grab begins, and game over.

Emotional Blackmail Is Common to Identity Politics

Emotional blackmail seems to be an inherent tactic of Marxist activists as well as today’s cult of wokeness. We can now see how BLM applies that tool to the daily lives of its “allies.”

The author of a recent New York Times op-ed writes that he fears for his life when he goes out because he’s black. He’s irritated with texts of sympathy he receives from white allies because he finds their support for BLM inadequate.

The essay, titled “I Don’t Need ‘Love’ Texts From My White Friends,” offers a prescription for proving their love: threaten to ostracize any loved ones who don’t get with the program. His exact words: “Text: to your relatives and loved ones telling them you will not be visiting them or answering phone calls until they take significant action in supporting black lives either through protest or financial contributions.”

Here’s a key Twitter thread on it:

https://twitter.com/jonkay/status/1269226833511399426

Repeat After Me… Repeat After Me…

Cult experts have a term for this practice of meddling in relationships: predatory alienation. It’s a form of relational aggression, straight out of Cults 101. BLM offers us other examples of mass compliance reminiscent of Jonestown.

A creepy Maoist-styled struggle session recently took place in the affluent suburb of Bethesda, Maryland where a large crowd theatrically recited a mass confession of collective white guilt. They also promised to proselytize (i.e., “educate”) others, leading likely to performing emotional blackmail when deemed necessary.

We’ve also seen spectacles of police officers, and even uniformed military personnel, “taking the knee” in obedience to mobs. Corporate America from Amazon to Zoom has also drunk the Kool-Aid in fear. Even supposed Republicans like Mitt Romney and George W. Bush publicly support BLM’s false claim that America is a “systemically” racist nation. Maybe you now have family and friends who harangue you, threatening—overtly or tacitly—to shun you if you don’t get with their program.

Americans should have enough sense to know that such shameful acts of submission to mobs are not about race, police brutality, or healing. They are about shifting power from the rule of law to a socialist elite who intend lawless dominion over everyone once in power. Their false narratives exploit George Floyd’s death as a trigger to stir up fear and loathing (in the name of love) in order to gain and consolidate power.

Socialism Weaponizes Loneliness to Control People

The emotional manipulation we’re seeing by Black Lives Matter reflects socialism’s long pattern of isolating individuals and controlling their relationships. We can see it in socialism’s history, in its policies, and especially in its tactics.

Abolishing family and religion are both old socialist rallying cries. A big part of socialism’s history is its war on those primary institutions through which our most intimate relationships and our unique identities are formed. We become isolated and weakened, and more easily controlled, when separated from them. That’s the idea.

Socialist dictators like Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedog, Pol Pot, and Adolf Hitler were dedicated to the destruction of all private life, insisting that loyalty belonged only to them. That’s why the death toll of socialist systems is more than 100 million.

Whatever else socialists say they promote—equality, justice, free stuff—they have one goal: placing too much power in the hands of too few people. To undermine the power of individuals, they undermine their private relationships. That’s exactly what just about every socialist policy has done, including no-fault divorce, welfare dependency, and abortion, which wreak havoc on the family.

The victims of this brokenness naturally feel alienated. Yet they still have a need to belong to something. Socialists feed that appetite with pseudo-communities, such as contrived collectives, mobs, and, yes, its wokeness cult.

Groupthink and Imposed Isolation Are a Vicious Cycle

The mob mindset is a trap, a form of mental solitary confinement, an ironic form of mind rape. Why? Because mobs of wokeness do not allow for anyone to express an original thought to another human being without the risk of being smeared and isolated.

As people invest in groupthink to remain in the herd, they end up spiraling even deeper into the mental isolation, cutting off normal conversation. They soon become “triggered” by other points of view. BLM activists have not only taken full advantage of the fear of loneliness already inherent in our culture. They also seem intent in perpetuating the fear by stoking more divisions within private relationships.

Political correctness and identity politics have long been used as tools of agitation designed to instill groupthink and stir up that threat of loneliness. Political correctness works by inducing self-censorship, cutting off conversation and the exchange of ideas, which might lead to friendship.

People with politically incorrect ideas often confide they feel completely alone. Identity politics works by forcing people to focus only on a collective identity and collective guilt while erasing each of us as unique individuals. Both are alienating. Both empower bad actors.

Most of us have never had a chance to learn the history of how blind conformity breeds terror, and vice versa. Abject conformity led to the hellscapes of Stalin’s reign of terror, of Hitler’s Germany. Those who submit to false confessions of “white guilt” can just as easily submit to such regimes because the psychological mechanism is the same: seeking the social approval they crave and avoiding the social rejection they fear.

In the end, weaponized loneliness is the fuel of socialism, as well as hardcore socialist organizations, including BLM. Recognizing and rejecting this scam is the only way to begin coming together as whole human beings.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/15/how-socialists-like-black-lives-matter-weaponize-our-fears-of-loneliness/,2020-06-15
Media Publish Kinder Obituary Of Terrorist Than Of The President's Brother,"President Trump’s younger brother, Robert Trump, died Saturday evening. In any normal circumstance, the death of the president’s brother ought to elicit respectful sympathy from all. However, we now live in a time when corporate media uses a man’s obituary to criticize his family’s politics.

Regardless of one’s politics, we should all be able to agree that these publications ought not use an obituary for the sole purpose of political commentary. The obituaries from The New York Times, Washington Post, and Associated Press were far more interested in attacking the president than in actual remembrance of a man who died.

Good lord, the @nytimes couldn't step off of its Trump bashing even when reporting on the death of his brother. https://t.co/TN9aRc35dl Sad. — Margot Cleveland (@ProfMJCleveland) August 16, 2020

The New York Times spent a disproportionately large portion of their obituary focusing on what President Trump had been doing on the days leading up to Robert’s death, as if to imply a lack of care. The details of a press conference and the length of the president’s hospital visit are laid out as lurid details highlighting a facial apathy, more akin to gossip than remembrance.

Annie Karni, who wrote the obituary, framed much of the story around any wedges possible between Robert and Donald, highlighting their tensions, differences, and fights both personal and professional, as far back as childhood. When presenting a quote from the president about his relationship with his brother, Karni referenced a period of estrangement between the pair as a fact check to undermine the credibility of a familial relationship.

The article reads: “‘I have a wonderful brother,’ the president said on Friday during a news conference at the White House before departing to visit him. ‘We’ve had a great relationship for a long time, from Day 1, a long time ago.’ In fact, the two were estranged for years, before Mr. Trump’s run for the White House.”

This hyper-focus on using the obituary to attack the president seeps aggressively through the piece. Any praise given to Robert is immediately juxtaposed with negative comparisons against Donald.

The Washington Post published a far more inflammatory and negative headline for the obituary for an American businessman than for the head of ISIS. The Post came under fire last fall for a disturbingly glowing obituary of the Islamic State leader whose development of the terrorist group was charted like the rise of a noble king or general, only making passing references to his brutality until the 40th paragraph.

Robert Trump’s two-paragraph obituary is no better than its negative headline, focusing exclusively on Robert Trump’s political support for his brother and his lawsuit against his niece, Mary Trump, over the contents of her recent book criticizing her family. To the Washington Post, a terrorist deserves contextualization and praise, but an innocent American can be reduced to proximity to a controversial politician and a familial struggle.

It turns out this was from @AP wire service. pic.twitter.com/hMxSct7iBj — Cameron Cawthorne (@Cam_Cawthorne) August 16, 2020

The Associated Press used the opening sentence of its eulogy to praise the late Trump while criticizing his brother in an unnecessary reference. The article goes on and on to contrast the brothers, presenting Robert as the kind and good sibling compared to Donald’s charismatic but brash callousness. His goodness is presented entirely in opposition to the left’s perception of the president’s lack of such positive qualities.

Alongside the politicized headlines and articles, Twitter saw #wrongtrump trend in the United States. It spent time as the second most popular trend of the evening, just behind the hashtag for a UFC fight. The vicious and cruel hashtag was meant to express dismay, not at Robert Trump’s death, but that it had not been the president who passed away.

EXCLUSIVE: DHS Secretary Says Antifa Meets Terrorist Group Definition,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf offered a harsh evaluation of the anarchist group Antifa Wednesday, declaring that in certain capacities, the left-wing group “absolutely” meets the standards worthy of condemnation as a “domestic terrorist group.”

“I think what we see with them individually targeting law enforcement, individually targeting certain officials for certain reasons, that is the definition of domestic terrorism,” Wolf told The Federalist, going on to explain, however, that the group’s decentralized nature makes it difficult for law enforcement to offer effective surveillance and widespread prosecution.

“The issue with Antifa,” Wolf explained, “it’s not just one singular group. It’s a loosely knit organization that’s very hard to define, very hard to define who’s a part of it.”

Wolf pointed to the FBI conducting several ongoing investigations into the group to greater understand its underpinnings. That could benefit law enforcement agencies nationwide grappling with intensifying violence as major U.S. cities suffer under a historic moment of civil unrest.

While Wolf, who was officially nominated Tuesday to fill the post he currently serves in an “acting” capacity, characterized Antifa as a domestic terrorist group in some cases, the DHS’s mission lies primarily with protecting federal agents and property. That includes Portland, where rioters held a federal courthouse under siege in skirmishes between militant anarchists firing mortar-style fireworks and the police defending government buildings. In July alone, Wolf told congressional lawmakers earlier this month, more than 100 federal law enforcement agents sustained 277 injuries in Portland, nearly half of which were eye injuries from lasers that can cause permanent blindness.

As the nation sees the beginning of a second wave of violent protests terrorizing its major cities in Kenosha and Minneapolis this week, Portland demonstrators surpassed their 90th day of consecutive domestic attacks Tuesday, three months after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Legal records recently surfaced showing Floyd had overdose levels of Fentanyl in his blood when he died.

Wolf emphasized Wednesday that while the Trump administration is offering support to state and local law enforcement agencies being overrun by the inner-city mobs, it’s ultimately up to those state and local governments to restore public safety and keep the peace. In the meantime, Wolf said, “individuals have a right to protect themselves and their businesses and what they’ve worked all their life to build.”

“Fault lies with those local leaders and those local law enforcement of not doing their job,” said the acting secretary. “This country is about rule of law, and we need the police to step up any time we have criminal riots and looting occur. Law enforcement needs to step in, restore that rule of law so that private citizens don’t have to do this or that, you don’t have counter-protests that become violent. That only happens in the absence of rule of law.”",https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/27/exclusive-homeland-security-secretary-says-antifa-absolutely-meet-definition-of-domestic-terrorist-group/,2020-08-27
DNC Spokeswoman: Kenosha Shooter Member Of 'Domestic Terror Group',"Democratic Party War Room Senior Spokesperson Lily Adams characterized the shooter charged with first-degree murder last week amid violent riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin as a member of a “domestic terror group.”

The young man, Kyle Rittenhouse, and his legal team say he shot in self-defense as armed rioters chased and threatened to shoot him. His lawyers say Rittenhouse was in Kenosha helping a friend defend his business from rioters and arson because police failed to do so.

Adams’ characterization came in response to a question about how Democrats can claim President Donald Trump is “fomenting” the violence in major cities taken captive by anarchic militants when the White House has repeatedly offered to send in federal troops to restore public safety.

White House Press Secretary “Kayleigh McEnany was asked today during a White House press briefing if she would denounce the violent act that was committed by a right-wing, looked like domestic terror group, where he shot protestors and is now being charged with murder, and she would not,” Adams said.

Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old Illinois resident, has been charged with multiple felonies. He claims he shot to protect himself as rioters struck and aimed a gun at him while he lay on the ground. Although reports found him to be a pro-police Trump supporter, he has not been proven to be linked to any domestic terror group, nor is there any evidence he is a “white supremacist,” as others have charged.

Adams is not the only one to describe Rittenhouse this way while defending the rioters. Last week, Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley did the same on Twitter.

“A 17 year old white supremacist domestic terrorist drove across state lines, armed with an AR 15,” Pressley wrote. “He shot and killed two people who had assembled to affirm the value, dignity, and worth of Black lives.”

Why Foreign Nations Seeking Freedom Love Trump’s Foreign Policy,"In parts of the world where people are fighting for their lives and liberty against authoritarianism, the view of Donald Trump’s presidency is positive. Pro-democracy Hong Kongers and Taiwanese have come out strongly in support of a second term for President Trump.

A recent op-ed published in Apple Daily, the publication of prominent Hong Kong democracy activist and opponent of China’s crackdown Jimmy Lai, argued that Hong Kongers should hope for Trump’s re-election.

Treating China like the Nazis in history, joining forces with English-speaking countries and Japan are the main course, the real deal. Neighbors like the Philippines and Vietnam, or going as far as the Czech Republic and Norway, countries have noticed that there is an obvious change in the situation, and they have, one by one, stood up against the ‘Strong Country.’

The Taiwan Solidarity Union urged Taiwanese-Americans to vote for Trump’s re-election. “From the many policies implemented by his administration that benefit Taiwan and boost bilateral relations, it is very clear that Trump has been the most Taiwan-friendly U.S. leader since World War II,” said interim Chairwoman Chou Ni-an.

This praise might seem curious considering Trump’s reputation as a transactionalist and his hesitation to constantly and forcefully use the bully pulpit to condemn authoritarianism and cheer the spread of democracy. This has led the president’s political opponents to assail him for eroding America’s “standing” on the world stage and for ambivalence toward American “values.”

How does one square this with the sentiments of the Hong Kongers and Taiwanese? Trump’s instincts go against the last three decades of American foreign policy. He is, to put it mildly, unsympathetic to the leftist internationalist vision of a supranational-managed, borderless global order. His advisers over the last four years have taken his instincts to develop a coherent view of international relations, one that better grapples with the reality that rough adversaries are threatening to weaken and even invade democratic nations.

Exit Poor International Agreements

First, Trump’s foreign policy is premised on the reality that nation-states — not international organizations or supranational terror organizations — are the primary actors in the world. To better position the United States militarily and economically, Trump has yanked it from certain international agreements and treaties that were either irredeemably flawed from the start or that no longer served their original purpose.

We exited the Iran deal, which dangerously enriched the Islamic republic; we left the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, on which Russia was cheating, and now we are freed to deploy missiles previously prohibited in the Asian theater to deter China; and Trump diplomats are wisely refusing to automatically extend the flawed New START Treaty, unless Russia makes changes that will increase trust and stability. Likewise, the United States is no longer participating in the dishonest and corrupt World Health Organization nor the Israel-bashing United Nations Human Rights Council.

Bolster Military Advantages

Second, the Trump administration holds that the United States must maintain, and in some areas regain, the military advantage over our most dangerous adversaries. U.S. hard power — and the economic power that enables it — are necessary to compete with the most powerful foes. Without a robust, modernized military, diplomacy will be feeble and ineffective.

In the last four years, the Trump administration has sought to undo the negative effects of President Barack Obama’s defense cuts and to prioritize major powers rather than terrorist groups in the Middle East as the most important threats to U.S. security. The Trump budget, while still not sufficient to meet its stated requirements, sought to right those deficiencies. It has made investments to recapitalize aging weapons platforms, greatly valued and adapted America’s nuclear deterrent, and has emphasized the need to regain the lead in advanced technologies, including hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, microelectronics, and 5G.

Call Out China’s Threat

Third, the Trump administration has ushered in a seismic shift in U.S.-China relations by identifying the Chinese Communist Party-led China — not nonstate terrorist actors — as the primary threat to America’s security and way of life. President Bill Clinton’s dewy-eyed idealism ushered in China’s permanent normal trade relations, effectively backing Beijing’s bid to join the World Trade Organization.

The new approach has upended decades of eager U.S. engagement with China that was sapping the United States of its sovereignty, economic horsepower, technological supremacy, and strategic military dominance. Under Trump, the United States has cracked down on Chinese economic espionage, shut down the den of spies that was the Chinese consulate in Houston, gone after U.S. tech companies Attorney General William Barr has called “pawns of Chinese influence,” and stopped issuing visas to students with connections to the People’s Liberation Army.

China’s behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has turbo-charged the Trump administration’s and ally efforts to cooperatively deter Chinese aggression. The United States is working to foster a more formal alliance bloc in Asia, beginning with the Quad, which is the United States, India, Australia, and Japan.

While keeping expectations reasonable, and initial goals modest about the developments toward a more formal alliance in Asia, Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun recently said, “And so at its core, what the Quad is is a combination of democracies. But I think what also illuminates those four parties is a sense of responsibility and willingness to uphold the responsibilities, to extend the benefits of democracy, extend the benefits of economic development, and extend the benefits of security throughout the region.”

He went on to praise other regional allies South Korea, Vietnam, and New Zealand. Strengthening these bonds is necessary to contain and deter China. The United States must still lead but cannot do it alone.

The tip of the spear in deterring Chinese military aggression is bolstering Taiwan. It does not take much imagination to see that China’s swallowing up of Hong Kong could also happen there. To protect Taiwan and deter aggression, the Trump administration has been working to bolster diplomatic cover and military strength for democratic Taiwan. Just this month, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar visited the island country, making him the highest-level U.S. official to visit Taiwan since formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Taiwan were severed in 1979 in deference to China.

Isolate Iran, Strengthen Israel

Fourth, the Trump administration has taken a different tack in the Middle East. Rather than seeking engagement with Iran through the nuclear deal, with the hope that it would bring a political liberalization (we have heard this before), it has sought to isolate Iran economically and diplomatically, while strengthening Israel.

This approach has yielded positive results. Following the law rather than using a waiver as every preceding American president has, Trump moved the U.S. embassy to the Israeli capital of Jerusalem and recognized the Golan Heights as Israeli territory.

None of these bold moves brought the sky crashing down. On the contrary, the United Arab Emirates and Israel have normalized relations, a breathtaking development. Days later, Kosovo said it will recognize Israel, Serbia will move its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, and Kosovo and Serbia will normalize economic relations.

Despite a strong desire to narrow the scope of mission in the Middle East, the Trump administration has been willing to employ military force — and ferociously. Trump amended the rules of engagement, empowering the military to lead coalition efforts to destroy the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. At the president’s direction, our warfighters hunted down and killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and killed terrorist mastermind Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian major general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

An often-overlooked event was when the U.S. military annihilated more than 100 Russian mercenaries threatening to attack U.S. and coalition forces. Defending the standard that chemical weapons must never be normalized and warrant punishment, Trump directed the launch of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Syria in retaliation for Bashar al-Assad’s gross and barbaric use of chemical weapons.

Maintain Strong Sovereign Allies

Fifth, the Trump administration has promoted strong sovereign allies. Even if the United States fights to regain the strategic advantage militarily and pulls away from China economically, we cannot deter and contain China alone. The United States cannot deter Russia alone, nor can we ensure terrorist groups do not destabilize nations across the Middle East and Africa without the help of partners. We must have cooperation and support from strong, sovereign democratic allies and partners who broadly share our mores and prefer open democratic systems to closed, opaque, authoritarian, and often imperialistic ones.

That means Trump has publicly and harshly criticized North Atlantic Treaty Organization members who, while rich, do not invest sufficiently in collective defense. The result has been greater commitments to collective defense. Much to the consternation of those who would like to insist Trump is weakening the alliance, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Trump’s approach has had a positive effect.

“We agreed to do more to step up — and now we see the results,” Stoltenberg said. “By the end of next year, NATO allies will add $100 billion extra toward defense. … So we see some real money and some real results. And we see that the clear message from President Donald Trump is having an impact.”

It isn’t just about money, either. Trump has lambasted Germany’s decision to pursue the Nord Stream 2, which strengthens Russia, and ordered U.S. forces to draw down from Germany. But many of those troops will move to other nations, including Poland, which is on the front lines of Russian revanchist expansion and has shown a willingness to make the needed investments and right policies to defend itself. Trump said of the move to strengthen U.S. defense cooperation with Poland, “I think it sends a very strong signal to Russia.” Indeed, it does.

Disrupt in Order to Achieve

Despite the successes of the new approach, there have been shortcomings. As mentioned above, while certain allies are eager to see Trump re-elected, others, especially in Western Europe, are less so. The U.S. decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran deal will likely continue to frustrate them. Still, anti-terrorism efforts, as well as deterring major powers China and Russia and trying to split their growing alliance against the West, will require diplomatic heavy-lifting.

After a first term of public criticisms of some of our allies and strong private collaboration, it’s time to reverse those, move blunt and righteous public criticisms to private conversations, and present a united front in defense of our shared interests to deter our common adversaries. The public criticisms have brought successes, but too much of that runs the risk of damaging efforts that are of greater national importance than financial burden-sharing.

The Trump administration has disrupted international affairs, but that disruption has brought significant achievements. Apart from those achievements, less powerful democratic peoples would have far less hope of surviving the rise of China and other authoritarian nations.

Building on those successes will require knowing what they are and how the United States was able to spur them along. To do that will require looking at the policy and the results of the administration’s efforts, as others in Hong Kong and Taiwan have done.

"Trump Secures Third Historic Middle East Peace Deal, This Time With Sudan","Sudan will be removed from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list and will begin a partnership with the United States and Israel, President Donald Trump announced on Friday.

“HUGE win today for the United States and for peace in the world. Sudan has agreed to a peace and normalization agreement with Israel! With the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, that’s THREE Arab countries to have done so in only a matter of weeks. More will follow!” he tweeted.

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1319683876046934016?s=20

The agreement comes just weeks after Trump secured two other historic peace deals in the Middle East through the signing of The Abraham Accords with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, which established full diplomatic relations of the countries with Israel. These deals facilitated by the Trump Administration are meant to bring “stability, security, and prosperity” in the region.

“This move will improve regional security and unlock new opportunities for the people of Sudan, Israel, the Middle East, and Africa,” the joint statement released by the White House said.

Trump granted Sudan’s removal from the terrorism list after the nation paid “$335 million to compensate American victims of past terror attacks and their families.” Removal from the list now allows the country to access “international loans and aid.”

According to the statement, Sudanese Chairman of the Sovereignty Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, all joined Trump to “discuss Sudan’s historic progress towards democracy and opportunities to advance peace in the region” in a “bold and visionary approach.”

“This is one of the great days in the history of Sudan,” Trump said, noting that Israel and Sudan have been in a state of war for decades.

In addition to normalizing relations and ending “belligerence between their nations,” Israel and Sudan have also agreed to begin trade and cooperation negotiations with each other and will work together on advancing “peace in the region.”

While Sudan previously lived under a “brutal dictatorship,” the statement notes that the country has recently seen significant progress in “combating terrorism, building its democratic institutions, and improving its relations with its neighbors.” This in turn granted the nation the opportunity to work with the U.S. to “restore Sudan’s sovereign immunity and to engage its international partners to reduce Sudan’s debt burdens.”

The deal, which would deepen Sudan’s engagement with the West, follows Trump’s conditional agreement this week to remove the North African nation from the list of state sponsors of terrorism if it pays compensation to American victims of terror attacks.

“Israel also committed to working with their partners to support the people of Sudan in strengthening their democracy, improving food security, countering terrorism and extremism, and tapping into their economic potential,” the statement declared.

“It is a new world,” Netanyahu said on the phone with reporters in the Oval Office. “We are cooperating with everyone. Building a better future for all of us.”

Trump also signaled his intent to continue negotiating deals with other Middle East countries, saying there are at least five others, including Saudi Arabia, that want in.

7 Leftist Threats Political Terror Is Coming Whether Trump Wins Or Not,"Many leftists have directed some deeply disturbing rhetoric at conservatives and Trump supporters in recent months, claiming President Trump’s bombast is responsible for the political polarization of today’s America. This is pure nonsense.

Sure, Trump talks about MS-13 as “animals,” Antifa as “thugs,” and Hillary Clinton as crooked enough to “be in jail.” His supporters know his presentation to be a bombastic and theatrical schtick, but he never threatens any group of voters.

By contrast, some ominous tones, even homicidal and terrorist tones, are coming from the mainstream left. Increasingly, through mainstream media and Big Tech, high-profile leftists are speaking openly about violence to be inflicted on Trump and all his supporters.

I’m not talking specifically about the Antifa and Black Lives Matter street violence we’ve seen in places like Denver and Portland, which includes outright murders of Trump supporters. I’m referring here to voices that normalize and promote open terror against any freedom-respecting person who has different views from those blessed by left-wing leaders, media, and Big Tech. Seven examples are included below.

1. A Think Tank Guy Should Meet…A Firing Squad

First, in a chilling Twitter incident, agitator Nils Gilman called for the execution of journalist and former Trump adviser Michael Anton. Gilman publicly stated, “Michael Anton is the Robert Brasillach of our times and deserves the same fate.” Brasillach was a Nazi collaborator in France whose fate was execution by firing squad. Neither Gilman nor Twitter took down the tweet, despite many protests, including a public letter of grave concern from the Claremont Institute, where Anton is a senior fellow.

Michael Anton is the Robert Brasillach of our times and deserves the same fate https://t.co/eJNOF49qTa — Nils Gilman (@nils_gilman) September 21, 2020

Gilman is head of the George Soros-funded Berggruen Institute and a co-founder of the “Transition Integrity Project,” which war-gamed the ouster of Trump from office regardless of whether he wins re-election. Anton’s crime, in Gilman’s mind, was publishing an article about Gilman’s project in the American Mind, titled “The Coming Coup.”

Why is Gilman’s Sept. 21 death threat against Anton still up on Twitter an entire month later? Will it remain up after the election?

2. Shoot This CEO For Not being Woke Enough

Second, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo objected to the company Coinbase’s decision to ease up on forcing employees to engage in social justice agendas such as critical race theory. Costolo accused Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong of being among the “me-first capitalists” who would be the first lined up and “shot in the revolution.”

Costolo, who has 1.5 million Twitter followers, added that he would “happily provide video commentary” of the executions. The tweet has disappeared, although there is no mention of it being deleted. One response comes with a screenshot though:

Did you ever apologize for this? Would like to take you seriously… but this kind of talk is so abhorrent to me: pic.twitter.com/zaJ8fqc2D5 — Auggernaut (@augustinbralley) October 6, 2020

3. If Trump Loses, His Supporters Remain ‘An Existential Threat’

Third, if the Democrats take over the reins of power — in an election, a coup, or a bought-and-paid-for “color revolution” — what happens to those who have supported Trump?

Take a look at this Aug. 1 Salon article, which argues that even if Biden wins, Trumpism “will survive the election and continue to be an existential threat.” Author Paul Rosenberg examines the arguments in writings by John Feffer and other anti-Trump pundits who believe there is a lot of work to be done to force the “de-trumpification” of America. They compare Trump supporters to Nazis or the Baathists of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and describe America under Trump as a “pathocracy.”

Rosenberg cites Feffer, who says the solution is “to drain the swamp Trump created, bring criminal charges against the former president and his key followers, and launch a serious campaign to change the hearts and minds of Americans who have been drawn to this president’s agenda.” He even brings up the Nuremberg trials as instructive, trials that resulted in death sentences for 37 Nazis.

That isn’t good enough, however, according to Feffer. It’s important to go after “low-level participants” to root out Trumpism. It recommends enforcing this changing of “hearts and minds” so that there is “an attitudinal shift that could lead to lasting transformation.” This is not a far cry from re-education camps and coercive thought reform.

The formula appears to be threefold and on a large scale, “the scale on which we need to be thinking,” according to the Salon article. First, divide the so-called redeemable Trump supporters from those intent on keeping America great. Second, send those who are problematic to virtual education camps. Third, stomp out all the ideas the power elites don’t like.

In the same vein, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who has 1 million Twitter followers, recommended that a “Truth and Reconciliation Commission” be established to rid the nation of Trumpism.

When this nightmare is over, we need a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It would erase Trump’s lies, comfort those who have been harmed by his hatefulness, and name every official, politician, executive, and media mogul whose greed and cowardice enabled this catastrophe. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) October 17, 2020

4. Prosecute Everyone Who Supported Trump

Fourth, former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann recently ranted that everyone associated with Trump, including his enablers and supporters, must be “prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society.” To many, Olbermann might seem to be a has-been, but he has nearly 1 million Twitter followers. He represents the viewpoint of many in the propaganda media that control more than 90 percent of the megaphones. Olbermann referred to Trump supporters as “maggots” who needed to be chased from the stage.

5. Trump Supporters ‘Must Be Eradicated From Society’

Fifth, on Aug. 4, 2019, a supposed religious scholar and CNN contributor Reza Aslan announced on Twitter — a tweet still up as of Oct. 22 — that all Trump supporters “must be eradicated from society” along with Trump, and that there is “no longer any room for nuance.” Aslan has nearly 300,000 followers.

His extremely defamatory and threatening tweet reads verbatim: “The President is a white nationalist terror leader. His supporters — ALL OF THEM — are by definition white nationalist terror supporters. The MAGA hat is a KKK hood. And his evil, racist scourge must be eradicated from society.”

After today there is no longer any room for nuance. The President is a white nationalist terror leader. His supporters – ALL OF THEM – are by definition white nationalist terror supporters. The MAGA hat is a KKK hood. And this evil, racist scourge must be eradicated from society. — Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) August 4, 2019

6. Openly Attacking Members of Congress

Sixth, the organized violence against guests at the Republican National Convention as they left the White House in August showed new levels of open hostility against the right. Most notably, the mob swarmed Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and his wife, who were convinced they would have been severely injured or killed if there were no police presence.

This represents a ramping up of the Antifa and Black Lives Matter attempt to normalize extreme violence against any perceived political opponent. Agitators even set up a mock guillotine on the spot with an effigy of Trump in it.

7. Plots to Dox Political Opponents

Seventh, the left is now using doxing tools to invite widespread targeting of Trump voters. A recently unveiled database called “The Media Manipulation Casebook” is described as a means of gathering personal information that exposes anonymous Trump supporters. NBC News reporter Brandy Zadrozny appears to use it to find “addresses, property records … even Amazon wish lists” that can be a “goldmine for learning about what a person reads, buys, and wants.”

At the same time, open-source materials, such as donations tracked by the Federal Election Commission, are being used to invite the targeting of Trump donors, either by name or address on a hostile site. The information can be used much like the Southern Poverty Law Center’s “hate map,” which triggered the attempted murders at the Family Research Council and the GOP baseball practice.

Terror Is Predictably Increasing

Examples of hostilities toward Trump supporters abound. Many are connected to the potential for violence should Trump win re-election. As the examples above show, however, the threat of terror is even greater should he lose. If Democrats gain control of the White House and other branches, the left has spoken openly of their intent to punish a huge swath of Americans with a program that threatens to cancel them, impose thought-reform programs on them, and worse.

How far will this go? Members of the domestic terror organization Weather Underground, headed up by 1960s radical Bill Ayers, explained some 50 years ago that when “the revolution” came, a lot of Americans would have to be located to education camps. This sounds eerily like what Reich and others are now proposing after they oust Trump. Weather Underground members said that those who didn’t comply despite re-education, which they estimated would include about 25 million Americans, would have to be eradicated, as in killed.

Of course, that could never happen here, right? Just remember that history is littered with societies filled with decent, normal people who descended into chaos and murder, often incited by propaganda from a heavily controlled media. However unlikely this seems, we must pay close attention to these patterns so we don’t repeat some of the darkest days of history.",https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/26/7-open-leftist-threats-that-political-terror-is-coming-to-america-whether-trump-wins-or-not/,2020-10-26
Trump Admin Stops Iran From Sending Terrorists More Guns And Oil,"Multiple U.S. federal agencies are taking action against Iran for illegally transferring weapons and oil to “countries that pose grave threats to the security and stability of their regions.”

The U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil complaint on Thursday requesting the forfeit of Iranian missiles and weaponry obtained by the U.S. Navy.

“Iran continues to be a leading state sponsor of terrorism and a worldwide destabilizing force,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said during a press conference on Thursday. “These actions represent the government’s largest-ever civil seizures of fuel and weapons from Iran.”

The weapons in question — more than a hundred anti-tank, surface-to-air, and land-attack cruise missiles, as well as parts for other missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles — were reportedly shipped in from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a foreign terrorist organization, to militant groups in Yemen in a “sophisticated scheme.” They were first seized by the U.S. Navy Central Command (NAVCENT) off “two flagless vessels” in the Arabian Sea in late 2019 and early 2020.

This is the second complaint of its kind from the DOJ, with the first filed in late August over seizing fuel on its way to Venezuela from Iran, and is part of a “larger investigation of an Iranian weapons smuggling network responsible for the arms shipments.”

The fuel, more than a million barrels of illicit Iranian petroleum, was reportedly seized earlier on its way to Venezuela on “four foreign-flagged oil tankers” and sold by the U.S. to a third party after a District Court issued a warrant in August allowing for the seizure of the cargo. The “tens of millions of dollars” from the sale will be granted to the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund when the case concludes.

These increasing “potentially deadly” actions such as these weapons transfers by Iran have spurred the U.S. Departments of State and Treasury to sanction at least 11 entities and 5 individuals, entities, and their executives in Singapore and in Hong Kong relating to Iran’s petrochemical exports.

On Monday, the Trump administration announced they will slap Iran with more sanctions as well for illegally giving weapons and oil to terrorist groups and countries that threaten the security of their regions. These sanctions, State Department’s Special Representative for Iran and Venezuela Elliott Abrams explained, are supposed to prevent the Iranian regime from accumulating money, which they often distribute to terrorist groups and organizations.

“The purpose is to reduce the amounts available to the Iranian regime for all of the malicious activities that are undertaken,” Abrams said. “Particularly, things like support for terrorist groups and intervention in Yemen. That’s a critical goal, and the other is to pressure the regime into a negotiation.”

“In our view, that should be a comprehensive negotiation that deals with, not only with nuclear issues but also Iran’s malicious behavior in the region and Iran’s missile program,” Abrams added. “We’re building up a lot of leverage.”

In late August, the Trump administration issued a snapback of Iranian sanctions after Iran repeatedly continued to violate President Obama’s Iran nuclear deal, or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) established in 2015 by increasing uranium production levels and accumulating large amounts of “heavy water,” both used in the production and manufacturing of nuclear weapons.

Democrat Wants To Put Josh Hawley And Ted Cruz On The No-Fly List,"The Democrat chair of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security wants Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley put on the federal “No Fly” list due to the “actions they participated in” when the U.S. Capitol was ransacked by Trump supporters on Jan. 6.

When asked by SiriusXM host Joe Madison whether the no-fly sanction should be applied if Cruz and Hawley are found liable for the capitol unrest, House Homeland Security Committee Chair Rep. Bennie G. Thompson said, “There’s no question about it.”

“There’s no exemption for being put on the no-fly list,” said Thompson. “Even a member of Congress that commits a crime, you know, they’re expelled from the body. There are ethics charges that can be brought against those individuals. And people are looking at all of this.”

Cruz and Hawley did not participate in any violent “actions.” The senators have both publicly condemned any rioting that occurred on Jan. 6. Democrats are angry because Hawley and Cruz led a legal objection to counting some Electoral College votes. For wanting to ensure the integrity of U.S. elections, Democrats are calling for the senators to resign or be removed from office.

Hawley and Cruz have been smeared by the left as violent insurrectionists and threats to our democracy. President-elect Joe Biden last Friday called Hawley and Cruz Nazis who should be “flat beaten the next time they run.”

Really sad. At a time of deep national division, President-elect Biden’s choice to call his political opponents literal Nazis does nothing to bring us together or promote healing. This kind of vicious partisan rhetoric only tears our country apart. https://t.co/YMMepv1OhV — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 8, 2021

Following the capitol riot, Simon and Schuster said last Thursday that it has canceled the publication of Hawley’s upcoming book “The Tyranny of Big Tech.”

My statement on the woke mob at @simonschuster pic.twitter.com/pDxtZvz5J0 — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) January 7, 2021

Thompson is leading the charge to punish all the rioters who entered the capitol. “First of all, these folks, in my opinion, can be classified as domestic terrorists because of the actions they participated in on Wednesday,” said Thompson. “Now under normal circumstances international terrorists are out on no-fly lists. These are domestic terrorists–same thing. A terrorist is a terrorist, no matter who you are.”

Apparently, however, it does matter who you are. The Mississippi representative never characterized the Black Lives Matter and Antifa thugs, who looted and vandalized American cities all summer including the U.S. capitol, resulting in mass chaos, destruction, insurance payouts of up to $2 billion, and the death of at least 30 people, as “terrorists.” Nor did he rally to have the left-wing rioters placed on the no-fly list. Actually, he publicly supported them.

Democrats Are Framing Americans As Terrorists To Erase Our Rights,"Democrats have moved swiftly to use the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol mayhem to push for a frightening expansion of federal surveillance and police powers under their sole control for two years, smearing anyone who voted for Donald Trump as a potential terrorist. Joe Biden himself called the Capitol protesters “domestic terrorists” and “insurrectionists” and said his administration will prioritize legislation to increase federal crackdowns on what Democrats consider to be “domestic terrorists.”

The main problem with that is that Democrats openly link Republican Party affiliation and mainstream conservative ideas to “domestic terrorism,” “extremism,” “white supremacy,” and other evils. To the left vanguard of the party that Biden’s administration is marching behind in both personnel and policy, simply supporting lower taxes and believing that “hard work can help you get ahead” is enough to mark you a “racist” and “white supremacist.” These redefined “racists” and “white supremacists” now face increased FBI surveillance, discrimination in military and other careers, suspension of their right to own guns lawfully based only on another person complaining they are a “threat,” public harassment and smears, government and business pressure campaigns and investigations, and more.

As usual, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been a canary in the coalmine. The New Yorker went on Instagram on Jan. 12 to hysterically claim that she felt endangered in a safe room during the Capitol anarchy because Republican members of Congress were also there. She baselessly accused them of being violent “white supremacists” solely due to their political affiliation. This is as stupid as claiming the average Democrat is an arson risk simply because she vocalized support this summer for Black Lives Matter.

This was followed by other Democrat members of Congress being given massive media platforms to accuse their Republican colleagues of showing rioters how to find and hurt them in the days before the latest Capitol violence erupted. Their only evidence was seeing Republican members of Congress in the halls of their own workplace with what turned out to be family members, including children.

Today @RepCohen went on CNN and spread lies about me to further a left-wing conspiracy theory targeting me and my family. The only people I have ever had in the Capitol with me are my young children, husband, mom, aunt and uncle. I guess having a big family is a scandal now. — Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) January 18, 2021

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hysterically claimed, also without offering any evidence, that Republican members of Congress might bring guns to Biden’s inauguration ceremony. Democrats demanded up to 25,000 National Guard troops to fortify Washington, DC over Biden’s inauguration, on the pretext, fed by an unreliable FBI leak and now proven false, that “armed” “huge uprising[s]” were planned for all 50 state capitols. That didn’t happen, and even the initial “evidence” for this wild claim was never very strong from the get-go. (Good job, FBI.)

Illinois Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, did his best to scare Americans into Democrats’ other, other plans to undermine our freedoms by claiming on NPR — again, wildly and citing precisely zero evidence, and with no pushback from the NPR host –“what happened on January 6, this past Wednesday, might not be the end of the insurrection but the beginning.”

Democrats also claimed the riots showed Trump was too dangerous to be trusted with the nation’s nuclear codes or as commander in chief, with Pelosi amazingly reaching out to military leaders to encourage insubordination to their elected civilian commander in chief. Well, he’s out of office today, and no nukes have been deployed.

The latest turn of this wild stampede into expanding the corrupt federal surveillance state Democrats and Republicans launched after 9/11 is Democrats’ terrifying decision to start removing people from military positions based on politics. “Are you now, or have you ever been a Trump supporter?” is the question this all seems to be asking, from the very party that has gone ballistic since the 1950s over the federal apparatus using this question to deny actual Communists positions of U.S. state power.

This is the first step toward the politicization of military enlisted personnel and junior officers. It is how one-party regimes are created. https://t.co/uGhAdcaFZi — J Michael Waller (@JMichaelWaller) January 18, 2021

During the quite legitimate red scare of the 1950s and continuing to this day, the U.S. left has openly provided aid and support to Communists and Communist sympathizers. The Democrat Party is right now appointing actual Communist sympathizers and enablers to key federal positions while imposing pro-leftist ideological tests on members of the U.S. military!

That’s not all. Leftists are now openly calling for the FBI to place spies within conservative groups, and surveil Americans not only through the National Security Agency’s ongoing, uncurtailed, and warrant-less mass phone and internet surveillance of all American citizens at all times, but also through human informants.

NBC is calling for the FBI to spy on and insert confidential informants into conservative groups https://t.co/qaxXLp1a6U — AmericaFest Poso (@JackPosobiec) January 18, 2021

Does this ring a bell to anyone? Well, if you just lived through the past four years, it certainly should. It is all giving eerie flashbacks to the spying operation run on the Trump campaign that extended into the Trump presidency.

Known as Russiagate or Spygate, this involved federal intelligence and investigative agencies including the FBI, CIA, NSA, and Department of Justice being used by Biden, President Obama, and other high-ranking federal officials — some of whom, such as Susan Rice, are back for the Biden administration — weaponizing political disagreement to spy on their political opponents. They lied to federal courts to get warrants based on false information to harass and hobble the living daylights out of Trump and make him completely unable to function in the office he was elected to.

This sort of thing will end American self-government. It permits unelected bureaucrats to choose what voters will hear about any political candidate they want. It allows them to essentially dox their unfavored candidates, and hide the failings of their favored candidates. Some people might call that election-rigging. Hm, which election did we see that happening in recently?

And now Democrats want to perpetrate Spygate not “only” on Republican candidates for president and God knows what other positions, but also on me and you. Snitch culture, meet surveillance state.

Meanwhile, for any of you who doubt that Dems are 100% planning the total importation of the War on Terror onto US soil to be used domestically, just listen to NBC's Jeremy Bash (formerly of Obama's CIA & Pentagon, needless to say). Just hear the words:https://t.co/urqwUb3YTv — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) January 18, 2021

Those of you who think this is crazy talk need to look at the Spygate evidence that has barely managed to eke out over the past four years, in the face of brutal attempts to keep it hidden, to understand how endlessly evil and corrupt these people are. Now reflect on the fact that they have all that power they abused back, with no negative consequences whatsoever of having abused it before.

Reflect on what Lois Lerner did with the Internal Revenue Service, for pete’s sake, using a paper-pushing agency to persecute Tea Party groups simply for being conservative. Then reflect that all these people certainly fit the test for assessing whether someone has or will commit a crime: They have the motive, the means, and the opportunity.

Also recall what Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer publicly said, and other intelligence leaders reinforced, about Trump going after intelligence agencies’ abuses of power: “Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,” Schumer told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow in 2017.

It’s these people who want even more power. They believe Trump’s supporters must be “cleansed” and “mentally deprogrammed.” Don’t be fooled by the cover story about “domestic insurrections.” As civil rights groups are pointing out, those crimes can already be firmly prosecuted under many existing laws. These new laws Democrats want have another purpose.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/01/20/democrats-are-framing-americans-as-domestic-terrorists-so-they-can-do-to-us-what-they-did-to-trump-in-spygate/,2021-01-20
"No, We Shouldn’t Launch A ‘War On Terror’ Against Trump Voters","The occupation of West Virginia is going to be a sight to see.

Following the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, some pundits and members of the national security state have been demanding a new war on terror. This time, however, the targets will be Americans. To take a representative example, Kevin Carroll writes in the Washington Examiner, “We ruthlessly hunted down foreign terrorists after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and must do the same to their domestic equivalents.”

But the Capitol riot was not equivalent to the horror of 9/11, except to those eager for an excuse to unleash the national security apparatus on their fellow Americans.

Those who broke into the Capitol and attacked the police guarding it were largely a disorganized rabble, sprinkled with a few instigators who planned for violence. Their behavior was deluded and wicked, but it was not the equivalent of al-Qaida bringing down the Twin Towers, blowing a hole in the Pentagon, and murdering nearly 3,000 Americans. Frankly, it’s nothing short of grotesque to pretend the situations are equivalent.

Furthermore, even if the situations were similar, launching a War on Terror 2.0 against American citizens would be unnecessary. Law enforcement has been diligently tracking down and arresting those who participated in the rioting.

Washington D.C. has been occupied by thousands of National Guard troops and a multitude of physical security barriers have been erected. Donald Trump has been impeached (again), left the White House as scheduled, and will soon be on trial in the Senate, to potentially be banned from ever returning to office. Thankfully, the predicted follow-up violence has not occurred.

In short, the problem is being solved. But solved problems don’t expand budgets, increase power and provide opportunities to punish one’s enemies. Those require a continued threat of insurgency, sedition, and terrorism. Thus, Carroll concludes, “We defeated al Qaeda and can do the same to the fascist thugs who attacked our democracy last month. But only if we take similar hard measures against the enemy within.”

Setting aside the dubious claim that al-Qaida is defeated (rather than merely diminished), it is would be tyrannical insanity to bring the aggressive, Constitution-bereft, oft-blundering tactics of the War on Terror to American soil. Yet that is the logical conclusion of Carroll’s argument — invading West Virginia, waterboarding good old boys in Alabama, and drone-striking weddings in Oklahoma.

Carroll is unwilling, at least in print, to draw out the obvious conclusions of his calls for launching a new, domestic war on terror. Indeed, there is a striking gap between his apocalyptic rhetoric about the supposed threat and his actual proposals to address it.

He mostly pushes for expansions of the national security apparatus into American life and local government. For instance, he suggests the government “make fire and police departments that receive federal grants have their members sign commitments not to engage in acts to overthrow the government. Prosecute any who subsequently violate their oaths.”

This is superfluous, insofar as it is already illegal to try to overthrow the government. The purpose of such a proposal is not to stop or punish domestic terrorists but to further subsume state and local authorities into the national security state.

If Carroll is serious about ferreting out threats to the constitutional order, he could start with himself. He urges the government to “use the supremacy of federal law to ban ‘militias’ beyond the National Guard” even though the federal government is constitutionally prohibited from doing so. Carroll does not seem to have taken his oath to “support and defend” the Constitution very seriously.

Indeed, he and those who share his views do not respect the Constitution. As far as they are concerned, enumerated powers and the Bill of Rights are obstacles to be overcome, not limits to be observed. Spying on Americans, and then lying about it to Congress, is routine for them.

As for democratic government, they enthusiastically subvert efforts by elected officials to direct our nation’s foreign policy. Toward the end of Trump’s presidency, for instance, they openly bragged about lying to the president in order to keep troops in Syria.

They don’t believe in democracy or the rule of law, they believe in their power. The permanent security state that has been setting American policy in Iraq and Afghanistan and Yemen and Syria and all the rest have already wrested huge amounts of control from the elected branches of government. Giving more power, especially over American citizens, to such people is a greater threat to our constitutional government than the idiot rioters who attacked the Capitol.

If the War on Terror 2.0 gets to the “arming the moderates on the ground” stage, however, please ignore these criticisms and put me down as one of the “moderates.” I promise to make good use of the pallets of cash and guns.

Biden’s Domestic War On Terrorism Seeks To Criminalize Political Dissent,"The Biden administration is planning to use the full force of the federal government in pursuit of a new war. Its target? American citizens.

This countering “domestic violent extremism” effort, declared in the wake of the latest Capitol riot, represents the real-world counterpart to the corporate media rhetoric about the need to “deprogram,” “de-ba’athify,” and drone the Deplorables.

If this is a dangerous political witch hunt masquerading as a national security imperative, it should disturb every American. Half of the country could potentially be ensnared as would-be if not actual terrorists.

In a little-discussed Jan. 22 press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki asserted “[the] assault on the Capitol … underscored what we have long known: The rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and growing national security threat.” Consequently, the administration plans a three-part response:

Developing a comprehensive threat assessment, coordinated with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security on domestic violent extremism.

Building “National Security Council capability to focus on countering domestic violent extremism,” including conducting “a policy review effort to determine how the government can share information better about this threat, support efforts to prevent radicalization, disrupt violent extremist networks, and more.”

Coordinating “relevant parts of the federal government to enhance and accelerate efforts to address DVE … an NSC-convened process will focus on addressing evolving threats, radicalization, the role of social media, opportunities to improve information sharing, operational responses, and more.”

In short, the Biden administration plans to turn the institutions and tools used to pursue foreign adversaries on “wrong-thinking” Americans. There are several reasons this is so troubling.

First, it is not clear why such an operation is needed. Contrary to Psaki’s statement, the studies, often conducted by left-leaning organizations, cited by those who claim the threat of non-jihadist “violent extremism” is growing and massive are highly dubious.

If domestic terrorist groups are proliferating in sufficient, size, strength, and number to merit a robust new government response, on the scale of the Global War on Terror — as some are telegraphing — the authorities have not demonstrated it. The administration’s hyping of such threats, and the conversion of Capitol Hill to a warzone, without specific evidence of danger, should only increase our skepticism. It appears politics is trumping the truth.

One can argue that the rush to declare a war on “domestic violent extremism” is one of several logical conclusions of an effort that goes back to the beginning of the Obama presidency, to fear-monger over the threat of “right-wing extremism” and marginalize non-leftists. The resistance fever dream of Trump-as-Führer with his tens of millions of supporters as Brownshirts was seamlessly incorporated into this information operation.

With Trump toppled, the riot among non-leftists provided the catalyst for completing the total war on the true objects of the ruling class’s ire: dissenting Americans. It has concocted a narrative: There is a growing “insurgency” among “domestic violent extremists.” The riot was their 9/11. Consequently, the threat, highlighted by that despicable act, demands not only its own 9/11 Commission, but a war on domestic extremism, particularly “white supremacist extremists.”

The wall-to-wall coverage of a neophyte congresswoman, the portrayal of capitols across the country as under threat, and the Defense secretary’s call for a 60-day stand-down to root out “extremism” in the military following the disturbing political vetting of National Guard troops summoned to Washington for the inauguration all feed this narrative.

One can be forgiven for thinking that a war on “domestic violent extremism” represents an extreme jump from a single event that, while inexcusable, pathetic, and disgraceful, thankfully resulted in less bloodshed and infinitely less destruction than what transpired across the country during the summer of 2020 — and preceded a dramatic spike in violence.

That there is nary a word from the Biden administration about pursuing violent members of Antifa and Black Lives Matter in connection with its countering DVE effort is part of a second major disturbing issue: Just as the Biden administration has not clearly defined the need for such a war, it has not clearly defined its targets. While it is not clear who the Biden administration is targeting, the implication again is non-leftists, potentially writ large.

“Violent extremism” is vague and leftists manipulate language. Hence, one man’s terrorist is another man’s “austere religious scholar”; “hate speech” is violence while physical violence is “mostly peaceful”; and concepts like “colorblindness,” “merit,” and even the classics themselves are considered instruments of white supremacy. Given the zeitgeist, readers of this article may well be a suspected violent supremacist by the left’s standards.

The Biden administration is also adhering to such standards. Based on its rhetoric and earliest executive actions — which emphasized “equity” over “equality” — anti-racism, critical race theory, and the associated panoply of woke progressive pillars are de rigueur within the White House. Under the “progressive-or-bigot” paradigm that flows from this worldview, non-progressives of all colors may well be branded “white supremacists,” “right-wing extremists,” and “domestic violent extremists.”

The third disturbing aspect of the coming domestic war on terror is how it’s poised to threaten our most basic civil rights, beginning with free speech.

Under the new infinitely liberal reading of “incitement to violence,” our political class is calling for Big Tech to further police speech — which is to say, to squelch the First Amendment by proxy. The Biden administration is seemingly on board. Psaki noted the “domestic violent extremism” investigation process would include a National Security Council review of the “role of social media” and promote government “efforts to prevent radicalization.”

It’s also worth noting who is leading this effort, and his political and policy predilections. As Psaki revealed, Joshua Geltzer will be responsible for the “scoping effort.”

During a September 2019 hearing before the House Oversight Committee’s Subcommittees on National Security and Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the former Obama administration National Security Council official and prolific Trump critic called for adopting a “transnational” approach to countering “violent white supremacy.” This included increased terror organization designations, use of the intelligence capabilities of the “international terrorism”-focused National Counterterrorism Center, and tech companies “policing their platforms to remove not just incitement to violence, but also, the ideological foundations that spawn such violence.”

Geltzer was careful to caveat that creating a “domestic analog to the foreign terrorist organization designation regime” might be unconstitutional and that efforts to counter violent white supremacy “must not be used as an excuse for interfering with the lawful expression of political advocacy.” But it is hard to square these seemingly conflicting statements.

In this charged and hysterical political environment, we should be all the more so concerned about the threats to our liberties, particularly of a national security regime with vastly expanded domestic powers. The first role of government is to protect our lives and liberties. The heavy burden is on our leaders to justify infringements on the latter in service of the former.

NBC Analyst Who Urged ISIS Bomb Trump Tower Will Testify On Terrorism,"After wielding fabricated evidence at the recent Senate impeachment trial, Democrats plan to call a conspiracy-obsessed MSNBC Russia-hoaxer who once encouraged ISIS to bomb a Trump Tower to testify in Wednesday’s hearing on “domestic terrorism.”

Malcolm Nance, a left-wing Navy veteran accused of exaggerating his military accomplishments while in the service, will join lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee to discuss the Capitol riots in early January.

“This is my nominee for first ISIS suicide bombing of a Trump property,” Nance wrote in 2017 in a since-deleted tweet with a picture of Trump Tower Istanbul, building credibility among Democrats to offer congressional testimony on domestic terrorism.

https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1364423740595965953?s=20

Identified as an “intelligence expert” by MSNBC, where he works as a contributor, Nance became one the most vocal pundits perpetuating the never-ending Russia hoax to smear President Donald Trump, along with any and all political opponents, as Kremlin assets. In August 2016, Nance flat-out lied on TV, claiming Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein “has a show on Russia Today.” MSNBC’s Joy Reid failed to correct him.

Worse, as independent journalist Glenn Greenwald pointed out in The Intercept in 2018, two years later the network still refused to ever offer a correction, allowing its viewers to believe Stein hosted her own program on the Russian outlet.

In The New Yorker, Nance took aim at Greenwald in 2019, falsely identifying the co-founder of the Intercept as a Fox News contributor while still claiming Trump is a subservient asset of the Russian government. The interview took place even after the release of the Mueller report debunking the Democrats’ four-year Russia conspiracy.

When pressed on his claims contradicting what had been outlined in the Mueller report just several months prior, Nance merely responded, “That’s why it is called analysis.” He went on to cite several books written on the topic entirely refuted by the more than two-year special counsel investigation run with unlimited resources.

Wednesday will mark day two of congressional hearings in the aftermath of the riots at the Capitol building last month. Capitol police testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tuesday, blaming security failures on the day of the attack on other agencies slow to provide additional support.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/02/24/msnbc-contributor-who-encouraged-isis-to-bomb-trump-tower-will-testify-on-domestic-terrorism/,2021-02-24
Berea College Event Says 'Trumpism' Is 'Terrorism At Its Core',"Across the country, purported educational institutions are indoctrinating students with the idea that all white people are racist, implicitly or otherwise. An event at Berea College goes even further to say that supporting Donald Trump is “terrorism” to the “core.”

As reported by The New Guard, Berea College in Kentucky is hosting an event called “White Citizenship as Terrorism: Make America Great Again, Again,” on March 17. The event is being co-sponsored by the college’s Women’s and Gender Non-Conforming Center and the Law, Ethics, and Society group.

Amy L. Brandzel, an assistant professor of women studies at the University of New Mexico, and the author of “Against Citizenship: The Violence of the Normative,” will give a keynote speech on the topic. Brandzel proposes in her divisive book that “citizenship is a violent dehumanizing mechanism that makes the comparative devaluing of human lives see,” and that, “citizenship requires anti-intersectionality, that is, strategies that deny the mutuality and contingency of race, class, gender, sexuality and nation…”

Although being white is not a prerequisite to “citizenship” in the United States, nor should it be, Brandzel is claiming that even being a citizen, and being white, leads to committing violence.

Young America’s Foundation obtained a copy of the flyer for the talk. It states in part:

Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ appears to follow suit by offering a seemingly benign promise to return to America to a previously ‘great’ past. But the offer to ‘Make America Great Again, Again’ requires we refocus on how the last four years of daily tweets and administrative actions redefine whiteness. If terrorism is redefined as the use of violence and threats to create a state of fear toward particular communities and identities, then this is what ‘Trumpism’ is at its core.

While the language stereotyping all white people and Trump supporters as terrorists is certainly shocking, what is less shocking is that Berea College would permit such an event to occur. The school’s website explicitly states that it “stands in solidarity” with the Marxist organization Black Lives Matter, and claims BLM activists were “peacefully demonstrating” against police brutality after the death of George Floyd. Billions in property damage would indicate otherwise.

“Berea College stands in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and those peacefully demonstrating against police brutality across the country and around the world,” it states. “As the first interracial and coeducational college in the slaveholding South in 1855, this moment calls for our support. Our history and our commitments demand it.”

In an article written in June, Berea College President Dr. Lyle Roelofs equated the fight for freedom and equal opportunity of the 1960s civil rights movement with the BLM movement, which seeks wealth redistribution according to race and, as mentioned, inflicted billions of dollars in property damage in this summer’s riots. BLM founder Alicia Garza has called for people to “kill these men and white folks,” among a slew of other racist statements.

Roelofs’ article also calls for racial quotas and affirmative action, outlined in seven bullet points. The piece calls for an “equitable educational community.”

Berea College is guided by eight Great Commitments, among them one that asserts the kinship of all people. Standing in solidarity with Black Lives Matter, the College strives to uphold its commitment to creating an equitable educational community that welcomes, supports and values all members. We invite institutions of higher learning throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the South to join us in our support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The Women’s and Gender Non-Conforming Center which is co-sponsoring the “terrorism” event, describes its mission in part to “encourage students to think about sex and gender intersectionality, and about what it might take to dismantle what bell hooks calls ‘imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy.'” The March newsletter put out by the affiliated Women’s and Gender Studies department claims that “white supremacy motivated the January 6th attacks at the U.S. Capitol.” Since the department evidently does not follow the facts, it would only make sense that it would not follow science as well. The school provides complementarity “pronoun pins” for students to identify their gender to others—as if one cannot know such a thing by simply looking. The Federalist contacted Berea College and was provided the following statement by spokeswoman Abbie Darst on its March 17 event. This planned event by the Women’s and Gender Non-Conforming Center at Berea College has attracted a great deal of attention on social media, and resulted in several emails from concerned persons. To some, the provocative title of the event implies that Berea is not a welcoming place for individuals with differing political views. That is not true. At Berea, we strive to live out our motto: God has made of one blood all peoples of the earth. Berea accepts students off all faiths (or none at all), religious beliefs, ethnicities and political leanings, creating a diverse environment that encourages acceptance, respect and even appreciation across our differences. We encourage open dialog on difficult topics. Racism and white nationalism have been topics of great debate over the past five years. The event planned for next week seeks to confront aspects of the political spectrum that relate to the difficult topic of race in America. While that may cause discomfort, it is a valid and important conversation in this time of political and racial division. It is our hope that these types of conversations will occur across the country. Open, honest dialogue is essential to understanding racism and moving toward an anti-racist society. It’s wildly contradictory that a university can say it “accepts students of all…political leanings” while hosting an event charging half the country with being terrorists because of their political leanings, as well as putting forth that because of someone’s skin color they are inherently racist. This is some of the most insane gaslighting I have ever seen in a university statement. They claim Berea welcomes students of all political leanings and encourages “acceptance” and “respect.” Yet, they’re doubling down on an event that says Trumpism is terrorism. — Kara Zupkus (@kara_kirsten) March 12, 2021 Roelofs did not immediately respond to a request for comment by The Federalist, nor did keynote speaker Brandzel.

Illegal Immigrants On Terrorist Watch List Arrested At Border A Day After Media Accused GOP Of 'Lying',"Customs and Border Protection has arrested at least four people at the U.S.-Mexico border matching names listed in the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database since Oct. 1 of last year, the agency confirmed to Congress on Tuesday. According to Axios, three of the arrestees were from Yemen and one was from Serbia, outnumbering “similar people taken into custody during recent full fiscal years, according to the source.”

The announcement comes just days and even mere hours after multiple corporate media outlets and Democrats denied Republican legislators’ claims that some of the people attempting to cross the border were terrorists.

Shortly after House Minority Leader Republican Kevin McCarthy told reporters in El Paso, Texas, on Monday that Border Patrol was arresting people from the terrorist watch list originating from countries such as “Yemen, Iran, Turkey,” publications clamored to “fact-check” the representative and deny his claims.

“Republicans revive one of Trump’s most notorious immigration lies,” one Vox article stated.

MSNBC alleged that McCarthy “may have gotten ahead of his talking points yesterday” and said that his comments left “reason for skepticism.”

“Democrats Call Bullsh-t on McCarthy’s Claim That Suspected Terrorists Have Been Caught at Mexico Border,” The Daily Beast said.

Axios even claimed in its scoop that “Former President Trump and other conservatives have frequently warned — sometimes inaccurately — about foreign terrorists entering the United States via the southern border,” citing an NBC News “fact-check” of Trump’s former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.

https://twitter.com/Cliff_Sims/status/1371912587789615106?s=20

Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona also challenged McCarthy’s comments, saying he was “pretty sure [McCarthy] is either wrong or lying.”

Even after news broke of the arrests, however, Gallego still refused to back down from his original statement targeting the Republican leader.

“I am the Chairman of the Intelligence & Special Operations Subcommittee. I had a briefing 90 minutes ago. What I can say is that the IC evaluates all threats and reports. What I saw is a far cry from what we got out of the Minority Leader earlier today,” Gallego wrote on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration and the corrupt press continue to deny that there is a crisis at the southern border as federal agencies struggle to handle the record-breaking influx of more than 500 unaccompanied migrant children entering the U.S. daily.

“Migrants are not overrunning U.S. border towns, despite the political rhetoric,” one Washington Post headline recently stated.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki also recently reprimanded reporters for insinuating there is anything more than a “challenge” at the U.S.-Mexico border, blaming Trump for a “dismantled and unprepared system.”

Terrorists Are Crossing America's Borders. Biden Is Making It Worse,"During the 2016 election, one of the major issues the media refused to discuss was the extent to which foreign-born nationals might play a role in jihadist terror attacks on U.S. soil. This was during the height of the debate over the admission of Syrian refugees and against the backdrop of the migrant crisis and subsequent terror attacks in Europe. (Indeed, there are signs the recent mass shooting on a grocery store in Colorado may have been an Islamist terror attack – the shooter was a Syrian refugee who came here as a child and was a U.S. citizen.)

But given that a key plank in Donald Trump’s platform was the insistence on building “a big, beautiful wall” to keep out potential terrorists, among other threats, the last thing the media wanted to do was admit that terrorism was a potential consequence of a porous border. So the media mercilessly mocked and derided claims that foreign terrorists might seek to cross a largely open border as the fever dreams of xenophobic rubes.

The irony was that America’s intelligence and counterterrorism officials were all too aware of the cross-border threat. After 9/11, with bipartisan support, the U.S. government built an expansive covert intelligence system intended to detect and intercept this very real threat. It is worth keeping this backdrop of media silence in mind to contrast against while reading Todd Bensman’s America’s Covert Border War: The Untold Story of the Nation’s Battle to Prevent Jihadist Infiltration.

‘Special Interest Aliens’

Bensman’s background is as a journalist of the old-school, back when the cardinal rule of journalism was to go to the place news happens, then accurately tell people what you learned. He worked the national security beat at regional newspapers like the Dallas Morning News and played a major role in breaking a number of key stories, including the federal investigation of the Holy Land Foundation, which became the largest terrorism finance trial in American history. The Dallas Morning News later bent the knee to Islamist pressure groups angry over Bensman and his fellow investigative journalists’ coverage of the story.

Bensman left journalism to join the Texas Department of Public Safety as a counterterrorism analyst, showing that good reporters really can develop the kind of subject matter expertise that media talking heads often claim but rarely demonstrate. While there, Bensman worked alongside a variety of federal agencies in the state’s fusion center, helping secure the Lone Star state and its long border with Mexico from drug cartels, criminal aliens, and, yes, even terrorists.

Here Bensman was exposed to the interworking of an intelligence system – with U.S. officials stretching from Quito, Ecuador to Washington, D.C. – singularly focused on the task of keeping potential jihadist terrorists from illegally crossing the border. In classic government jargon, the border-crossers of concern were “Special Interest Aliens (SIAs)” from a shifting assortment of countries where the threat of international terrorism was high and cooperation from local governments was limited or non-existent. A recent example is 11 Iranians caught crossing the border into Yuma, Arizona.

Upon leaving government service, Bensman went looking for the story other reporters had ignored, interviewing border security, law enforcement and intelligence officials, smugglers, facilitators, and perhaps most importantly, the Special Interest Aliens themselves, in order to paint a truly comprehensive picture of how these migrants moved across the world in order to take their chance at the border.

Bensman explodes the myth that would-be terrorists have never attempted to cross the southern U.S. border. He relays case after case of individuals with suspected links to terror who didn’t make it through the government’s dragnet:

The number of SIAs who showed up already on US terror watch lists is classified. So-called ‘Known or Suspected Terrorists,’ or KSTs, would be those on the Terrorist Screening Database list (TSDB), the Terrorist Identities DataMart Environment list (TIDE), and the No Fly List. After my departure from government, intelligence community sources agreed to let me report an indication of how frequently KSTs are caught at the southern land border. Between 2012 and 2017, American homeland security discovered that more than one hundred SIAs caught at the American southern border, or by cooperating governments en route, were already on one or more of those terrorism watch lists. About twenty a year when averaged during those years.

Sophists are likely to argue that in the grand scheme of things 20 a year isn’t a statistically significant number given the massive numbers of migrants seeking to cross the border every year. But 20 terrorist migrants would be enough to conduct two of the 2015 Paris Massacre, which killed 130 and changed life in France irrevocably for years to come.

As Bensman is at pains to point out throughout the book, America’s counterterrorism professionals know theirs is a profession with a no-fail standard.

Near and Far Wars

Broadly speaking, the book is divided into two separate elements of the covert effort to keep potential terrorists out, which Bensman calls the “near war” and the “far war.” The “near war” consists of border patrol, law enforcement, and intelligence officials working to identify, interview, and if necessary, deport, Special Interest Aliens who reach or cross the border successfully. Bensman writes:

The rationale was that if common immigrants could reach a land border from terrorist-source countries such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, then so too could terrorist travelers from the same countries. One 2006 National Counterterrorism Center intelligence report characterized the thinking this typical way: ‘Terrorists could try to merge into SIA smuggling pipelines to enter the U.S. clandestinely…. Al Qaeda and other groups sneak across borders in other parts of the world and may try to do so in the US, despite risks of apprehension or residing in the US without proper documentation.’

The so-called “far war” is where Bensman’s reporting really shines, revealing the cat and mouse game played between professional human smugglers and American intelligence, buttressed by Bensman’s personal reporting, and interviews with the smugglers and migrants who make the journey, many of whom are surprisingly open about their methods and motives.

Bensman describes in detail the battles over who can better influence the border security and immigration officials of struggling third-world countries. American intelligence offers organizational funding, training, fancy biometric tracking tools, and the prestige of serving in a special unit to Latin American officers who can create “tripwires” that let the Americans know when a Special Interest Alien raises red flags at a border crossing.

American intelligence can question the migrant in question and, if necessary, lean on the country’s officials to send them back whence they came. But all too often cold, hard cash from smugglers trumps government-to-government cooperation.

The smuggling kingpins against whom the Americans are competing are a fascinating bunch. These men and women have a special knack for the mixture of logistics, linguistics, ingenuity, and management skills needed to run international money-making transport enterprises that rival FedEx and UPS. But the talents and skills required also make them a chokepoint that can be targeted, as Bensman explains:

When SIA kingpins are caught, the organizations they built and solely enable tend to fall apart, at least for a time. Their indispensability and the kind of people they move made them a prime HSI target from the first days after 9/11. Knocking out one of these smugglers was regarded as akin to blowing the bridge in conventional army-on-army warfare.

While one can’t help but come away with the sense that America’s counterterrorism officials have their finger in the dike of the massive populations seeking entry, Bensman does highlight that while the streams of SIAs may seem endless, those with the talent, knowledge, resources and abilities to transport them are indeed a finite bunch and by targeting them for investigation and arrest America’s border security professionals can make a major impact.

Given Bensman’s extensive reporting of intercepted potential threats, and his obvious respect for the substantial cross-border counterterrorism mechanism the U.S. government has built since 9/11, one could be forgiven if one came away from reading America’s Covert Border War with the view of a problem largely well-managed.

But 20 years after 9/11, cracks are developing in a patchwork dam hastily erected. Bensman notes there has never been any significant government-wide audit of the system, which spans multiple agencies and departments. Even basic questions like preferred nomenclature, or agreement as to which countries ought to be inclined on the list of “countries of concern,” are not standardized, and can rapidly become political hot potatoes. Bensman writes:

…the country lists have fluctuated wildly depending on diplomatic and political winds. In August 2011, for instance, a DHS Office of Inspector General report disclosed that Obama administration officials decided the 2003 list was ‘outdated’ and had to be ‘eliminated’ because it was ‘not based on any judgment that the states listed supported, sponsored or encouraged terrorism.’ The Obama administration felt it was time to eliminate the list because ‘many of the states listed are important and committed partners of the United States in countering terrorism.’

Other challenges include a lack of willingness to dedicate the necessary manpower to meet a no-fail standard. While 100 percent of Special Interest Aliens are supposed to be interviewed at the border, Bensman estimates the real number is closer to only a third of all SIAs being interviewed before bonding out to disappear into America’s interior.

Not only that, but even cursory record checks are not always completed. Bensman laments,

It gets worse. Keeping in mind that ICE detention centers are the last possible line of defense before SIAs are released into the nation’s interior on their own recognizance, a 2011 DHS Office of Inspector General audit discovered that ICE wasn’t consistently following DHS policy that it run database checks on all detained SIAs from ‘specially designated countries’ before their release to determine if they were wanted by anyone. That wasn’t done in more than half the 116 cases the auditors randomly checked. A more worrisome finding was that no one checked 100 percent of the time even to find out whether SIAs were on terrorism watch lists. The number of oversights was small, only 3 percent of the cases randomly checked. But as I and the auditors knew, small numbers portend unacceptably grave consequences.

The ‘Biden Effect’

Recent moves by the Biden administration suggest that, rather than address the growing holes in the border net, the Biden administration is inclined to widen them. Within hours of taking office, Biden signed executive orders to terminate successful Trump-era efforts as part of a sop to the Democrat’s left wing, which is virulently anti-enforcement.

The Biden administration is also currently reviewing asylum policies with an eye towards making changes that will make it even easier for asylees to game the system. As Bensman notes in the book, America’s asylum policies are already disturbingly lax, and provide a ready entrance to the United States for anyone who can capably memorize a suitable sob story.

These changes are not lost on the migrants, and a “Biden Effect” is already increasing total migrant flows, which in turn increases the size of the haystack through which counterterrorism officials must sort through for potential terrorist needles.

America’s Covert Border War is a singular contribution to reporting on the nature of America’s post-9/11 efforts to secure the U.S. homeland, and a necessary refutation of a lie by omission that a politicized media has perpetrated upon the American people.

How The Left Is Answering Ibram Kendi’s Call For Racial Strife,"Ibram Xolani Kendi, born Ibram Henry Rogers to a black liberation theology-adhering tax accountant father and health-care business analyst mother, is the Prophet of Wokedom to whom the likes of Twitter’s Jack Dorsey pays $10 million to prove his virtue.

Kendi is a bestselling author across several categories, with an ever-growing list of scholarly credentials and awards. He is ubiquitous in corporate media, on college campuses, and at elite conclaves. Perhaps most significant of all, Kendi’s ideas are permeating the commanding heights of society, trickling into every aspect of American life, and therefore turning him into a transcendent figure.

Kendi’s Ideas Serve Today’s Ruling Class

On the first day of the Biden-Harris presidency, the administration issued an executive order claiming America suffers from systemic racism, manifested in “[e]ntrenched disparities in our laws and public policies, and in our public and private institutions,” and charged the whole of the federal government with “affirmatively advancing equity” (emphasis mine).

Numerous other government and private institutions are following suit. Oakland is testing a program to provide 600 black, indigenous, or otherwise non-white families—and only these families—$500 per month for 18 months. A Boston medical center is implementing a pilot program to offer “preferential care based on race” and “race-explicit interventions.”

Critical race theory, ethnic studies, and a panoply of related teachings such as the 1619 Project version of American history pervade U.S. schools, while their supporters wage a war on merit for diversity and against any teacher who would dare dissent.

More than 100 executives leading major businesses recently came together to discuss ways they could swing their weight to challenge voting legislation, including Georgia’s, that they dishonestly portrayed as discriminatory. It’s just one data point in the continuing trend of corporate America’s race left that accelerated during the post-George Floyd tumult of 2020.

Increasingly the rationale for all leftist policies is “antiracism,” the movement Kendi leads. One example is casting the filibuster as a “Jim Crow relic.” Although its participants may not know it, our ruling class is speaking in Kendian tongue, and aiming to realize his “antiracist” vision.

If America is fated to succumb to Kendiization—a term coined by a colleague that aptly captures our national moment—and live in a world of “antiracism,” it behooves us to examine the views of the man behind it.

What ‘Antiracism’ Proclaims as Gospel

Kendi’s “antiracism” is a Manichean concept, in which the world is bifurcated into racists and anti-racists. “[T]here is no in-between safe space of ‘not racist,’” he says, which fits neatly into the prevailing progressive-or-bigot binary.

How does one define racism and “antiracism”? According to Kendi’s magnum opus, “How To Be an Antiracist,” “Racism is a powerful collection of racist policies that lead to racial inequity and are substantiated by racist ideas.”

Racist policies are “any measure that produces or sustains racial inequity between racial groups.” Kendi cites as examples health-care policies or voter-ID laws that in his telling disproportionately harm minorities. He has said that even something as anodyne as a capital-gains tax cut is racist, since blacks are under-represented in the equity market.

Racial inequity is “when two or more racial groups are not standing on approximately equal footing,” Kendi claims. Kendi cites as an example disparities in homeownership rates between those of different races.

That is, to “antiracists,” equity is not about the rights or opportunities of individuals, but the outcomes of groups. Those outcomes, Kendi claims, are solely attributable to policy. As he writes: “if you believe that groups are equals…the only other explanation to persisting inequity and injustice, is power and policy.”

Racist ideas are not only those that “that suggest[] one racial group is inferior or superior to another racial group in any way,” but those that would challenge the idea that “racist policies” are necessarily the total cause of all “racial inequity,” given that “Antiracist ideas argue that racist policies are the cause of racial inequities.”

In short, it appears you would be charged as a racist if you challenge antiracism—for example, if you suggest that differences in outcomes between different people groups might be explained by anything other than racist policies rooted in racist ideas. You are also being a racist if you “support[] a racist policy”—as Kendi defines it—by your “action or inaction.”

Everything Is ‘Racist’ Now

Here are some other things Kendi deems racist.

— Standardized tests, which he calls “the most effective racist weapon ever devised to objectively degrade Black minds and legally exclude their bodies.” Per Kendi, the notion of any “achievement gap” between different peoples on standardized tests constitutes a “racist idea,” and the tests are to blame.

— Capitalism, which Kendi refers to as a “conjoined twin” of racism. Kendi states that the “origins of capitalism cannot be separated from the origins of racism,” citing colonialism and slavery. He also suggests that capitalism is racist by dubiously questioning if markets were ever level playing fields between the races, and whether blacks could ever compete equally with whites in the marketplace. He concludes: “to truly be antiracist, you also have to truly be anti-capitalist…And in order to truly be anti-capitalist, you have to be antiracist.”

— The broad American desire for a “race-neutral” country, which Kendi describes as “The most threatening racist movement,” and one more dangerous than “the alt right’s unlikely drive for a White ethnostate.”

— Assimilation, given that it is premised on the view that “there is something wrong with another racial group that needs changing or something right with our racial group that doesn’t need changing.” On this last point, one wonders: Does Kendi feel that his efforts to force Americans to assimilate into his desired culture of “antiracism”—one he apparently believes is superior to all others—is racist?

The chilling effect of Kendi’s divisive and reductive philosophy is obvious, although it becomes self-defeating to the extent it waters down the charge of racism. Essentially every person at one time or another will meet Kendi’s definition of racist. After all, if you are not actively working to achieve “antiracist” policy, you are being racist.

Solving Fake Racism With Real Racism

The policy part of Kendi’s “solution” to allegedly pervasive racism is perhaps more chilling. Since, as Kendi writes, “As an anti-racist, when I see racial disparities, I see racism,” the “antiracist” must devote himself to “fixing” these disparities. This “fix” is decidedly not colorblindness and freedom, but open discrimination and tyranny. Kendi asserts:

The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.

He adds: “The defining question is whether the discrimination is creating equity or inequity. If discrimination is creating equity, then it is antiracist. If discrimination is creating inequity, then it is racist…”

What does this look like in practice? Kendi has advocated for a constitutional amendment to enshrine the “the idea that a racial inequity is caused by a racist policy,” establishing a Department of Anti-Racism (DOA) “comprised of formally trained experts on racism and no political appointees,” who would:

Preclear all local, state and federal public policies to ensure they won’t yield racial inequity, monitor those policies, investigate private racist policies when racial inequity surfaces, and monitor public officials for expressions of racist ideas. The DOA would be empowered with disciplinary tools to wield over and against policymakers and public officials who do not voluntarily change their racist policy and ideas.

Such a policy of course would completely erode the liberty and justice our Constitution aims to codify and protect. That might be the point. Under the political system that emerged from our founding documents, different peoples have experienced different outcomes. If liberty and justice are racist, then antiracism demands illiberalism and injustice in pursuit of “equity.”

‘White Terror Is As American as the Stars and Stripes’

This is the call to which the Biden administration is disturbingly responding when it issues an executive order calling again for “Affirmatively advancing equity.” It poses a mortal danger to America. But to the “antiracist,” it constitutes progress given our repugnant past and present—given that, as Kendi notes, “White terror is as American as the Stars and Stripes,” and our nation has been “sort of structured around racial identity, racism, and even white supremacy.”

Such an effort to equalize outcomes, of course, as it has everywhere Communism has been faithfully implemented, would ultimately leave everyone worse off—at each other’s throats, poor, and unsafe. Ironically for Kendi, the man laser-focused on outcomes, in the effort to achieve his “antiracist” vision, only intent seems to matter.

As for the Jack Dorseys of corporate America funding the Woke, whether they are true believers, cowards paying for protection from a social justice shakedown, or cynics thinking endorsing such policies will benefit their bottom line, they will be complicit in ruining the country from which they have so richly benefited if we supplant Kendi-esque “equality” with “equity.”

Israel Defense Forces Take Out Hamas Commander Amid Conflict,"Israel killed a leading Hamas commander in a strike on Tuesday as significant conflict erupts between Israel and Hamas.

“We just killed the commander of the Hamas anti-tank missile unit, Iyad Fathi Faik Sharir,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. “He was in charge of carrying out anti-tank missile attacks on Israel. Our aircraft are currently striking additional terror targets in Gaza.”

The Islamist terrorist group Hamas fired hundreds of rockets into Israel from the Gaza Strip, including targeting Jerusalem. Israel then launched strikes Monday, hitting over 130 Hamas installations, as well as intelligence and weapons manufacturing sites.

“Overnight, in response to continuous rocket fire from the Gaza Strip at Israeli territory, the IDF struck over 130 terror targets belonging to terror organizations in the Gaza Strip,” IDF said in a statement.

“In the first and second stages of the strikes, IDF fighter jets, attack helicopters and aircraft struck weapons manufacturing sites belonging to the Hamas terror organization. In the third stage, targets belonging to the Hamas terror organization and the Islamic Jihad were struck, including: weapons manufacturing sites and military facilities belonging to the Hamas terror organization and the Islamic Jihad. A Hamas battalion commander was also targeted,” IDF said.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., was accused of “stoking tensions” by Israel Ambassador to the U.S. Gilad Erdan.

“Congresswoman @RashidaTlaib maybe you should open your eyes to the whole picture? Islam’s 3rd holiest site is being used to stockpile Molotov cocktails and rocks that are being lobbed at the police and at Jewish worshippers praying at the Western Wall, below the Temple Mount,” Erdan tweeted.

As reported by Axios over the weekend, Israel told the Biden administration to remain on the sidelines of the conflict, citing a lack of trust that the U.S. would help. Israeli officials said Israel’s National Security Advisor Ben Shabbat allegedly instructed the U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan that “international intervention is a reward to the Palestinian rioters and those who back them who were seeking international pressure on Israel.”

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday the U.S. is “deeply concerned about the rocket attacks” Hamas fired after it issued an ultimatum to Israel to remove police from Jerusalem. The Israeli military summoned 5,000 members on reserve to active duty amid Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying Israel will “increase both the intensity of the attacks and the rate of attacks” to combat the terrorists.

Former President Donald Trump reacted to the conflict Tuesday, noting the attacks highlight how the world is becoming “violent” and “unstable” under the Biden presidency.

“Biden’s weakness and lack of support for Israel is leading to new attacks on our allies. America must always stand with Israel and make clear that the Palestinians must end the violence, terror, and rocket attacks, and make clear that the U.S. will always strongly support Israel’s right to defend itself,” Trump said in a statement. “Unbelievably, Democrats also continue to stand by crazed anti-American Rep. Ilhan Omar, and others, who savagely attack Israel while they are under terrorist assault.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/11/israel-defense-forces-take-out-hamas-commander-amid-conflict/,2021-05-11
Biden Fails To Condemn Hamas Terrorist Attacks On Israel,"As the radical Islamist group Hamas terrorizes Israel, launching rockets on Jerusalem Day, President Joe Biden did not directly condemn the group Wednesday after a reporter asked him about the ensuing Middle East conflict.

A reporter asked Biden if he is “concerned” about the conflict. Biden said “Israel has a right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory” but did not go further to call out Hamas as the one doing the terrorizing.

“My national security staff and defense staff has been in constant contact with their counterparts in the Middle East, not just with the Israelis, but also with everyone from the Egyptians, to the Saudis, to the Emirates, etc.,” said Biden. “And I had a conversation with Bibi Netanyahu not too long ago; I’ll be putting out a statement very shortly on that. My expectation and hope is that this will be closing down sooner than later.”

Former President Donald Trump issued a statement Tuesday, calling out Biden for “weakness” and his “lack of support for Israel.”

“When I was in office we were known as the Peace Presidency, because Israel’s adversaries knew that the United States stood strongly with Israel and there would be swift retribution if Israel was attacked,” Trump said. “Under Biden, the world is getting more violent and more unstable because Biden’s weakness and lack of support for Israel is leading to new attacks on our allies.”

Members of “The Squad” have been vocal in opposition to Israel’s sovereignty. Rep. Ilan Omar, D-Minn., tweeted that “Many will tell you Israel has a right to defend itself, to safety and security, but are silent on whether Palestinians have those rights too. Until we can defend the rights of Palestinians just as we do Israelis, we have no leg to stand on when it comes to justice or peace.”

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., urged Israel “to end the occupation” and blamed the free state for defending itself against terrorism.

“@MoveOn urging .@POTUS to address the root causes of violence and force Israel to end the occupation, ease the blockade & put an immediate stop to forcing Palestinians out of their homes. This is what solidarity looks like,” Tlaib said.

Hamas fired more than 1,100 rockets into Tel Aviv, Israel, to which Israel retaliated and killed two leaders in the group. While The Gaza Health Ministry, a designated terrorist group by the U.S. Department of State, claims more than 50 Palestinians were murdered by Israel and more than 300 were wounded, the numbers are unverified. The credibility of a terrorist group’s statistics ought to be duly investigated.

Many of the reported fatalities are individuals considered designated terrorists. Times of Israel reports that some Palestinians who were killed were hit by rockets Hamas fired.

USA Today Editor Says Republicans Are A Greater Threat Than 9,"USA Today Deputy Editorial Page Editor David Mastio authored an op-ed Thursday charging that House Republicans who voted for a change in leadership were a greater threat to the republic than the 9/11 hijackers.

Mastio characterized the recall vote on Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney’s role as Republican conference chair as a singular referendum on President Donald Trump’s claim the November election was stolen, which Mastio decries as “The Big Lie,” a comparison to the Nazi propaganda campaign which led to Holocaust. Cheney’s opponents, therefore, are Trump’s co-conspirators on a mission to overthrow the government.

“As surely as the terrorists of 9/11 wanted to tear down American democracy in 2001, the terrorists of Jan. 6 want to tear down our democracy as well, even as they pose as its defenders,” Mastio wrote. “And unlike the Sept. 11 attackers, they are going to get another chance.”

ICYMI: After ousting Liz Cheney, Republicans prove they're a bigger threat than 9/11 hijackers https://t.co/GdxB3gLKux via @usatoday — David Mastio (@DavidMastio) May 14, 2021

Mastio argued claims the Democrat Party hijacked the election are the source of revolution.

“If our democracy is being stolen, we will rise up in arms,” wrote Mastio. “If I thought our democracy was being stolen, I’d have joined in support of the broader Jan. 6 protests, if not the violence.”

On the contrary, it is these exact kinds of inflammatory claims that breed violence. By Mastio’s own logic, if one truly believes their political opponents are as great a threat as the terrorists who killed almost 3,000 Americans, then the U.S. government ought to wage war. In some respects, U.S. intelligence agencies already have, with double-standards of justice and intrusive dystopian surveillance conducted, even by the Postal Service.

When reached for comment, Susan Page, the Washington bureau chief of USA Today, refused to say whether she disagreed with Mastio’s claim that Republicans who voted against Cheney are worse than 9/11 hijackers who killed 3,000 Americans in the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history. She directed The Federalist to the paper’s public relations department.

A spokesperson for USA Today did not immediately respond to The Federalist’s inquiry.

In 2019, the same editor smearing those with he disagrees with who voted for a change in leadership as domestic terrorists, blacklisted The Federalist from being cited in USA Today pages for accurately reporting on the Russia collusion hoax under the Trump administration.

Cheney was ousted from her number three role in House GOP leadership Wednesday after the Wyoming lawmaker and dedicated Never Trumper continued to undermine the conference and engineer an inner-party civil war to rid the GOP of Trump and Trumpism supported by the base.

"The 3 Biggest Anti-Israel Myths On Social Media, Debunked","Earlier this week, violence flared yet again in Israel. Here in America, the response from our political class was just about as disconnected from reality as one would expect.

To combat the reams of disinformation making their way around social media at the moment, it seems necessary to debunk some of the most frequently cited arguments by anti-Israel activists. With the help of the media, celebrities, and politicians, these myths have become ubiquitous.

Myth 1: Israel Is Committing ‘Terrorism’ in Gaza

On Monday, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., tweeted Israel was committing “an act of terrorism” after the nation conducted airstrikes in Gaza.

Israeli air strikes killing civilians in Gaza is an act of terrorism. Palestinians deserve protection. Unlike Israel, missile defense programs, such as Iron Dome, don’t exist to protect Palestinian civilians. It’s unconscionable to not condemn these attacks on the week of Eid. https://t.co/vWWQfMqBkT — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) May 10, 2021

This claim is not supported by the facts. The only reason that Israel conducted any airstrikes was that the terrorist group in charge of Gaza, Hamas, instigated violence by indiscriminately shooting thousands of missiles into Israel. These rockets were not only aimed at their usual targets in southern Israel, but also civilian centers in Jerusalem and Tel-Aviv. These strikes have hit schools, hospitals, and homes in Israel.

While Hamas’s attacks were aimed at civilians, Israel only intends to strike military targets. Israel destroyed a Hamas military intelligence facility, a weapons manufacturing and storage site, terror tunnels used to kidnap and kill Israelis, and dozens of top terrorist leaders.

Anti-Israel activists are quick to point out that many civilians have also been killed in Israel’s airstrikes. This is true, and it is a tragedy. The reason it is happening, however, shows who the real terrorists are.

While Israel invests in state-of-the-art Iron Dome technology to protect its people from rocket attacks, Hamas puts its people in harm’s way by using them as human shields. While Israel conducts its military activity away from civilian centers, Hamas launches rockets, hides senior officials, and manufactures weapons in heavily populated areas where they know collateral damage will take place. They store rockets in hospitals, schools, and mosques; they shoot rockets off the top of homes.

When Israel responds, they attempt to only hit terrorist targets. They even give notice hours in advance to the people who are in the buildings they are about to strike through phone calls or other means — something that nearly no other army would have the decency to do. But, because Hamas would like their people to remain in harm’s way for photo ops and to stoke Palestinian grievances, innocent lives are tragically taken. The loss of innocent Palestinian life is a strategic goal of terrorist groups like Hamas.

Hamas does not care about Palestinian life at all. The Israeli airstrikes on Gaza could end tomorrow if only Hamas ceased their rocket attacks. Also, of the more than 1,000 rockets launched by them so far, more than 200 fell short of the border between Gaza and Israel, thus exploding in their own territory.

In fact, three Gazan kids were recently killed by a Hamas rocket attack “gone awry.” Moreover, despite the fact Hamas purports to be fighting for the rights of all Palestinians — including those living in Israel — they recently hit an Arab-Israeli town with one of their rockets.

If Hamas wanted to protect Palestinian life, they wouldn’t launch thousands of rockets into population centers; they would not use their own people as human shields; and they would not invest in weapons instead of defense, food, or shelter for their own people.

As writer David French correctly notes, “There is absolutely no equivalence — either in morality or the laws of armed conflict — between firing unaimed rockets directly into civilian population centers and responding with aimed fire at militants hiding in civilian population centers.” One of the two governments in this conflict is a terrorist government, but it is certainly not Israel’s.

Myth 2: Israel Attacked Peaceful Worshippers

Earlier this week, Trevor Noah, the host of “The Daily Show” on Comedy Central, had his say on the violence. In his video, which has more than 2 million views, he accused Israel of conducting an “assault” on Al-Aqsa Mosque.

Those who saw the images and videos of tear gas in and around Al-Aqsa Mosque — one of the holiest sites in Islam — were correct to be horrified. Why that event ever occurred, however, has nothing to do with Israel being hostile towards either freedom of religion in general or the ability of Muslims to pray at Al-Aqsa in particular.

After all, it is Jews who are restricted from praying at the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. Rather, it took place due to Palestinian agitators intentionally using Al-Aqsa as a staging ground for violence in order to generate sympathetic images.

Pictures from inside of Al-Aqsa earlier in the day show piles of rocks being kept there, which were later going to be used to attempt to injure Israeli police. Fireworks and other weapons were being stored in the mosque as well. Pictures of the people inside Al-Aqsa show Palestinians with Hamas headbands on while Hamas flags were also seen flying outside of the mosque itself.

Those who displayed the flag of a terrorist organization and stockpiled weapons inside the mosque were certainly not intending to simply “peacefully pray” that day. Rather, as they were leaving the mosque, they began to whip rocks at Israeli police. It is quite clear that they wanted violence.

That the Israeli police had to respond to the violence in the way they did was a tragedy, but we must not lose sight of why any altercations took place at Al-Aqsa Mosque in the first place. It was intended to be a spectacle, and Western media and leftists ate it up.

At night, a video went viral of Israelis dancing at the Western Wall while a fire at Al-Aqsa Mosque raged. While some dishonestly suggested that the Israelis were celebrating the burning of the mosque, the facts paint a far different picture. The truth is that the mosque was never burning; a few trees on the compound were.

Moreover, those fires were not set by “radical” Israelis or by Israeli police, but by fireworks set off by Palestinians. Lastly, while the Jews at the Western Wall were singing a song that featured gross and racist lyrics, they were not celebrating any sort of “burning” of one of the holiest sites in Islam.

Myth 3: The Conflict Would End if Israel Gave Palestinians a State

Model Bella Hadid recently posted a graphic to her more than 40 million followers asserting the reason there has been no peace is that Israel “denies Palestinians their right to liberation, freedom, and justice.”

It has also been suggested that anger over the evictions of four families from Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem, is responsible for the violence. While this legal dispute going back to the 1970s understandably flared tensions, a more significant reason for the violence is the myth that Israel denies Palestinians the right to self-determination — a myth Hadid amplified.

In truth. the entire Israeli-Palestinian conflict comes down to a basic fact: the Jews want to have a state where they can live in safety and security while the Palestinians will do anything in their power to prevent a Jewish state that is safe and secure. This has been evidenced by the fact Israel has accepted every peace plan offered while the Palestinians have rejected every peace plan offered.

The opportunities for Palestinians to exercise their right to self-determination have been numerous — whether it be the Peel Commission in 1936, the United Nations partition plan in 1948, the Clinton parameters in 2000, or the Olmert offer in 2008. On every one of those occasions, the Jews have implicitly recognized the Palestinian right to a state by accepting a two-state solution, but the reverse has never been the case.

Since 1948, the Palestinian government, along with most other Arab governments, have been hell-bent on destroying the Jewish state. It is for this reason they have launched so many wars of attempted elimination. Today, Palestinian leaders encourage waves of violence in pursuit of the same goal.

Even if they claim that the catalyst is something unique — in this case, the Sheikh Jarrah evictions — the underlying motivations remain the same. There is no world in which more than 1,000 rockets would be justifiably launched into a country because they adjudicated a land dispute unjustly. That is motivated by a more root-level desire to wipe Israel off the map.

In Einat Wilf and Adi Schwartz’s book, “The War of Return,” they point out that the reason for this continuous violence is that many Palestinians truly believe the war of 1948 is not over and that Israel is simply a temporary project. But if both sides can simply accept that the other has a right to live safely in a country of their own, then this conflict would be over.

After all, Israel was able to make peace with Egypt just two years after they said they wanted peace, a fact further bolstered by the openness to peace Israel displayed through the 2020 Abraham Accords. Until Palestinian leaders reach out a hand for peace, however, this tragic cycle of violence will continue.

Biden To Netanyahu: Expect 'Significant De-Escalation' Of Israel-Hamas Conflict,"President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday about the ensuing conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas, reportedly telling Netanyahu, just nine days after Hamas originally launched rockets toward Israel, that he expects tensions will de-escalate. Behind the scenes, the president has nonetheless flirted with antisemitic Democrats such as members of “the squad,” who have called for violence against Israel.

The White House said Biden “had a detailed discussion of the state of events in Gaza, Israel’s progress in degrading the capabilities of Hamas and other terrorist elements, and ongoing diplomatic efforts by regional governments and the United States.” Israel Defense Forces launched an operation called “Guardian of the Walls” to combat the attacks from the terrorists. Thus far, terrorists residing in Palestinian-run areas have launched more than 3,750 rockets, with 500 of them having fallen in Gaza.

“The President conveyed to the Prime Minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire,” the White House said in a statement.

In recent days, the number of rockets being launched toward Israel by Hamas has decreased due to the Israel Defense Force’s success in retaliation. IDF figures indicate that the destruction of tunnels and the killing of hundreds of terrorists has led to an 80 percent decrease in rocket fire.

The Biden administration approved $735 million worth of arms to be sent to Israel on Monday. On Tuesday, Netanyahu ordered the IDF “to continue to strike” in addition to thanking Biden for “serious backing.”

“The directive is to continue to strike at terrorist targets,” Netanyahu said. “We will continue to act as necessary to restore peace and security to all residents of Israel.”

“There is always pressure but, all in all, we are receiving very serious backing, first of all from the U.S. Again, I would like to thank our friend, President Joe Biden, and also the many other countries that have truly taken incredible steps such as flying the Israeli flag over their government buildings,” the prime minister said on Sunday. “We have international backing, and we are using it in our natural right to self-defense, as well.”

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also spoke with Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi. Ashkenazi thanked the United States on Twitter for blocking a United Nations Security Council statement that allegedly was not taking a hard line against Hamas and its terrorist activity.

“I told [Blinken] that [Israel] would continue to act against the terrorists of [Hamas] until peace was restored to the communities in the south & center of the country,” Ashkenazi said. “We thank our good friend, the [United States], for standing with us and giving us her steadfast support.”

Conflict in the Middle East has resulted in policy disagreement between Biden and far-left Democrats. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., has been critical of Biden’s support of Israel and called Netanyahu a “[f]ar right ethnonationalist.” Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., compared Israel defending its homeland from terrorists to South African apartheid on the House floor.

Despite Tlaib’s hostility toward Israel, however, Biden told the congresswoman in Michigan on Tuesday that she is a “fighter” and applauded her leadership.

“Now Rashid [sic] … I want to say to you that I admire your intellect, I admire your passion, and I admire your concern for so many other people,” Biden said to Tlaib on stage. “You’re a fighter, and God thank you for being a fighter.”

Biden later evaded questions about Israel and joked that he would use his truck to run over the reporter who asked them.

Former Vice President Mike Pence called out Biden in an op-ed on Monday, saying the president has displayed “weakness” that led to the Middle East conflict.

“President Biden and congressional Democrats have abandoned unambiguous support for our ally Israel, emboldened our enemies, and turned their back on the policy that yielded historic peace deals in the Middle East,” Pence wrote in National Review.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/19/after-pandering-to-anti-israel-squad-biden-tells-netanyahu-to-expect-a-significant-de-escalation-of-israeli-hamas-conflict/,2021-05-19
Report: Media Company Founded By Obama Officials Encourages Donations To Terror-Linked Group,"Crooked Media, a company founded by former Obama White House officials Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor, encouraged its followers on Twitter to donate to an anti-Semitic organization linked to terrorism in wake of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, a report from the Washington Free Beacon shows.

In the now-deleted tweet, the Democrat-led media group encouraged followers to donate to pro-Palestinian charities including Islamic Relief Worldwide (IRW) which is banned in multiple countries for its ties to terror groups

“Here’s who’s doing great on the ground work to aid the people of Gaza,” Crooked Media wrote. “Support them if you can.”

The tweet was quickly deleted and replaced with a new version excluding the IRW.

IRW claims to be a “faith-inspired humanitarian aid and development agency working to save and transform the lives of some of the world’s most vulnerable people,” but evidence from multiple investigations suggests otherwise. One review by the Gatestone Institute in 2013 found that the organization was actually a “hub for donations from charities accused of links to Al Qaeda and other terror groups.” Israel’s Shin Bet security service in 2014 also claimed it had “incriminating information against IRW” that linked it to terrorist groups which warranted a ban in both Israel and in the West Bank

In addition to being promoted by anti-Israel legislators such as Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who has a long track record of making anti-Semitic statements, IRW was cut off from receiving taxpayer dollars by the U.S. State Department in January after its leaders repeatedly expressed anti-Semitism and sympathised with terrorist groups like Hamas.

MSNBC Rant: Republicans Are Terrorism-Supporting 'White Nationalists',"MSNBC contributor Dean Obeidallah said Sunday all Republicans are white nationalists who defend terrorism.

“In the GOP today, you’re either defending a terrorist or you’re out of the GOP. That’s where they are,” said the host of SiriusXM Progress’ “The Dean Obeidallah Show.” “It’s the party we’re dealing with. They’re not a political party, they’re a white nationalist movement. They’re a fascist threat to our nation. That’s not hyperbolic, that’s academic.”

“We seen black people killed by the police, unarmed..it’s a lynching and then a cover-up…we see the same thing on January 6, it was white terrorism there and a cover-up going on,” Obeidallah said.

He also bounced off host Tiffany Cross to bash Republicans and then lumped all Republicans into a category with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene for “literally defending terrorists.”

“Marjorie Taylor Greene, last month called Black Lives Matter the ‘strongest terrorist threat in America.’ She used that word, ‘strongest terrorist threat in America,'” he said. “In 2018, when Rashida Talib and Ilhan Omar were elected to Congress, she called it an Islamic invasion, but when we literally have a white invasion of our Capitol by white terrorists, she defends them as peaceful protesters, as patriots.”

Obeidallah also urged the “Cross Connection” host and others on the show to stop calling the Capitol riot on January 6 an “insurrection.”

“Call it what it was: terrorism,” he said. “Christopher Wray, the FBI director, said that.”

Obeidallah concluded his rant by calling for Republicans to back the partisan Jan. 6 commission pushed by Democrats and corporate media.

“Let’s put the onus on the GOP to watch them downplay and whitewash terrorism and if they do that, in my view, they are with the terrorists. Is that clear? It has to be black and white; no moral ambiguity. Like after 9/11, we need the same after 1/6,” he said.

Biden Shouldn’t Assume Netanyahu’s Successor Will Be A Pushover,"Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, has fought tooth and nail to hold onto power during a grueling two-year-long electoral standoff with open opponents and sometime-allies denying him the votes to form a stable majority government. But with the prospect of a fifth election in two years, and with it clear that animus for Netanyahu is the sticking point, it appears the logjam is about to be broken.

The decision of Naftali Bennett, the leader of the Yamina Party to the right of Netanyahu’s Likud, to join forces with Yair Lapid, the head of the centrist opposition Yesh Atid Party, has created the likelihood that a “government of change” will be sworn in within the next week. That means that unless he can somehow sabotage that deal at the last minute, after 12 consecutive years as prime minister, Netanyahu will be heading to the opposition benches.

The proposed coalition involves parties of both the right and the left and will rely on the votes of an Arab political party that will remain outside of the government to be sworn in. As such, it’s far from clear whether the Bennett-Lapid alliance can survive for long.

But given the only viable alternative to this scenario is a fifth election and implacable opposition to Netanyahu from a majority of the members of the Knesset, or parliament, it appears Bennett will soon become prime minister as part of a bargain in which he will serve for two years followed by two years of Lapid as the country’s leader.

For many Israelis, this is hard to swallow. Leaving aside the plurality of Israelis that continue to support Netanyahu and his remaining religious party allies, the rest of the electorate is also not entirely pleased with the compromises for both left and right that are obligatory to achieving this outcome. There’s little doubt, however, that President Biden will be among those cheering for the new coalition.

While Biden likes to boast of his long friendship with Netanyahu, there is little love lost between him and the president as well as the rest of the Obama administration alumni that make up his foreign policy team. They rightly viewed Netanyahu as an ally of former President Donald Trump and an implacable foe of their goal of reinstating Barack Obama’s disastrously weak and soon-to-expire nuclear deal with Iran.

President Joe Biden and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken are also seeking to re-establish ties with the Palestinians. President Donald Trump had cut off aid to the Palestinian Authority because of its support for terror as well as its longstanding refusal to make peace with Israel.

Biden has already moved to restore some of that aid even though U.S. law forbids aiding the P.A. so long as it continues to pay convicted terrorists and their families salaries and pensions. In the aftermath of the latest fighting between Israel and the Hamas terrorist organization, Blinken seems also intent on aiding Gaza, something that will inevitably wind up strengthening the strip’s Islamist rulers.

From their point of view, and that of the Democratic Party’s left-wing base, which is increasingly hostile to Israel, Netanyahu’s removal is bound to make it easier to achieve both of their Middle East objectives.

On the surface, that conclusion seems hard to refute. Netanyahu was burdened by all of the baggage he accumulated during his long career. The corruption charges lodged against him may be flimsy but also undermined his authority. Yet it was equally clear that Netanyahu was his country’s most able and experienced statesman, and few would argue that either Bennett or Lapid has his stature or skills as a diplomat and national leader.

Whatever his faults, in Netanyahu’s tenure Israel became both more secure and wealthier as he guided it toward alliances with moderate Arab nations and helped enable its First World “Start-Up Nation” economy to thrive. Indeed, he was coming off a year of unique achievements in expertly handling the coronavirus pandemic and joining the historic Abraham Accords of normalization with Arab and Muslim states.

President Biden, however, would be wrong to either underestimate his successor or to assume that the divided government he’ll lead will be vulnerable to U.S. pressure. The new Israeli coalition will be largely paralyzed on many issues, especially regarding settlements and the peace process. But that’s also because it is predicated on the notion that war and peace issues have been largely decided for the moment.

Indeed, parties of the left and right wouldn’t think of serving with each other had there not been a realization of a consensus that stretches from the moderate left to the right that the PA is no Palestinian peace partner. Similarly, there is an equally broad consensus on the need to stop Iran. Tehran’s aid to terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah comprises a deadly threat to Israel’s security in addition to the existential peril from its quest for nuclear weapons.

While elements of the new coalition will applaud Biden’s dangerous policies, the cabinet will be dominated by those who will largely continue Netanyahu’s policies on both the Iranian and Palestinian fronts. And if, as President Barack Obama and before him Bill Clinton did, Biden tries to intervene by aiding those who would undermine Bennett from the left, that will only make the Israeli right stronger.

Bennett will make history by becoming both the first observant Jew (he wears a kippah) to serve as prime minister as well as the first one who is a child of American immigrants. He knows he will have no future in politics if he is seen as betraying the country’s interests for the sake of office or good relations with Biden, as Netanyahu is already claiming.

The inherent instability of this ramshackle alliance is obvious. But, ironically, the one factor that may ensure its longevity is the certain knowledge that its failure is the only thing that could bring Netanyahu back to power.

Biden’s flirtation with terrorist-funding Palestinians and his obsession with returning to a policy of empowering and enriching Iran gave Hamas and the Palestinian Authority an incentive to gin up the controversies that led to the recent fighting. While Trump left him a stable region that was uniting against Iran and its terrorist allies, Biden’s policy shifts are not so much destroying his predecessor’s legacy as setting the stage for a renewal of violence and chaos.

Rather than planning on aiding Biden’s feckless appeasement of Iran and its terrorist allies, Bennett and Lapid are hoping Netanyahu’s absence will make it easier for them to persuade Biden to change his mind. Should Biden and Blinken ignore their pleas, they’ll find the new Israeli leadership no more likely to accept American decisions that endanger their country than the old one.

‘Domestic Extremism’ Report Targets Democrats’ Political Opponents,"The Biden administration just released a “National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.” It calls for abuses of state power to combine elements of totalitarian government with social and cultural engineering. They decided the Constitution and those pesky old individual liberties won’t stop them from making America the Wokest Place on Earth.

It is such an obvious attempt to try to crush political dissent, you wonder if they thought no one was paying attention. If you aren’t, you need to be, because this is marching orders for a whole-of-government approach to crushing Democrats’ political enemies. They are banking on the natural instinct of most Americans to oppose terrorism by branding some constitutionally protected practices “domestic terror.”

Watch the latest video at foxnews.com

There are legitimate domestic terror threats, and we must treat them seriously. I devote several chapters to this in my new book, “Winning the Second Civil War Without Firing a Shot”: “When does peaceful protest and petitioning the government for redress of grievances become insurrection or sedition? Are the violent acts committed in the current conflict domestic terrorism or an internal insurgency? Those are complicated concepts that unfortunately we are watching play out on the streets of this country.”

Yet the Biden team seems incapable of seeing any domestic terror threats on the political left. Their aim is directly at right-wing groups and causes, which unsurprisingly dovetails perfectly with their goal of remaking our whole country. And they’re not shy about saying so. From the strategy:

That means tackling racism in America. It means protecting Americans from gun violence and mass murders. It means ensuring that we provide early intervention and appropriate care for those who pose a danger to themselves or others. It means ensuring that Americans receive the type of civics education that promotes tolerance and respect for all and investing in policies and programs that foster civic engagement and inspire a shared commitment to American democracy, all the while acknowledging when racism and bigotry have meant that the country fell short of living up to its founding principles.

It reads like a press release from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, not a serious look at the dangers we face. But the left has never seen a “problem” that didn’t need a serious dose of more government control. So, in their usual mode of not letting a crisis go to waste, they are crying havoc and letting slip the dogs of state power. More strategy:

Although the U.S. Government must do everything it can to address enduring challenges like racism and bigotry in America, the Federal Government alone cannot simply ‘solve’ these challenges quickly or on its own. On the other hand, tackling the threat posed by domestic terrorism over the long term demands substantial efforts to confront the racism that feeds into aspects of that threat. We are, therefore, prioritizing efforts to ensure that every component of the government has a role to play in rooting out racism and advancing equity for under–served communities that have far too often been the targets of discrimination and violence. This approach must apply to our efforts to counter domestic terrorism by addressing underlying racism and bigotry.

I don’t want you to think they skip talking about terrorism as they build their brave new world. They are plenty worried about it, and they’re pretty sure they know who the bad guys are: “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists (principally those who promote the superiority of the white race) and militia violent extremists are assessed as presenting the most persistent and lethal threats.”

Discussion of the violence directed at Asian-Americans and Jews by attackers ignores the fact these disproportionately come from black Americans. There is also not a single mention of Black Lives Matter (BLM) after a year-long riot spree that caused an estimated $2 billion in damage, injured thousands of police, and caused dozens of deaths. The Biden team keeps their allies out of the crosshairs.

The massive effort by the FBI and Justice Department to identify and charge, often overcharge, anyone they could tie in any way to the riot at the Capitol was a preview of the lack of equal treatment under the law. BLM and their partners in destruction, Antifa, were allowed to skate while anyone of the wrong political affiliation got a kick through their door by the federales.

Antifa rioters who destroyed property and set fires during the Trump inauguration saw their arrest records expunged. Many of those arrested during the 2020 riots had their charges dropped. Contrast this with the 500-plus arrests and solitary confinement without bail for Capitol rioters.

The Biden domestic terror strategy looks to institutionalize this unequal treatment and shut down the ability of citizens on the political right to exercise many constitutionally guaranteed natural rights. They start with free speech and propose to partner with the tech tyrants to further marginalize or eliminate ideas they dislike or disagree with: “These efforts speak to a broader priority: enhancing faith in government and addressing the extreme polarization, fueled by a crisis of disinformation and misinformation often channeled through social media platforms, which can tear Americans apart and lead some to violence.”

Translation: “Your ideas are dangerous to our ability to aggregate state power, and we are going to shut you down.” Social media companies have been censoring conservative speech very happily, and we’ve been told that’s just fine because they’re private companies. But this is a bold-faced announcement of a public-private partnership to create a National Thought Police.

They are also planning loyalty checks for government jobs and clearances: “Pre–employment background checks and re–investigations for government employees is a critical screening process that must account for all possible terrorist threats. The United States is well served by a diverse workforce, including in the military and Federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement. Those who protect and defend this nation should reflect the nation, including its vast spectrum of experiences and viewpoints.”

This ensures their control of the state security apparatus is not in jeopardy from un-Woke folks. Their lack of concern for exposing these plans should be one of the most concerning things for the rest of us. They think they have the legal right and even a moral requirement to conduct a political and ideological purge.

We have had a plethora of wake-up calls recently, but this is the most blatant plan to move past the Constitution an elected government in this country has ever proposed. We must not let this stand.

GOP Angry After Biden Lifts Iran Sanctions Without Consulting Congress,"Last week, the Biden administration gave Iran what it wanted. Without consulting Congress, the administration lifted sanctions on multiple former Iranian officials and businesses, thereby relaxing U.S. pressure on the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.

Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee weren’t amused. On the contrary, they continue to assert that the administration chose not to consult Congress about the lifted sanctions in order to intentionally bypass legislative oversight. These Republicans are now demanding an explanation.

The State Department announced the sanctions were lifted “as a result of a verified change in status or behavior on the part of the sanctioned parties” and that “[t]hese actions demonstrate [America’s] commitment to lifting sanctions in the event of a change in status or behavior by sanctioned persons.” The Treasury Department echoed this announcement. Meanwhile, the State Department imposed new sanctions on “an Iranian-backed supply network” to the Houthi terrorists in Yemen.

While the Biden administration contends that the lifted sanctions are unrelated to continued negotiations with the Iranian regime in Vienna, Rep. Claudia Tenney and some of her colleagues say the Biden administration is lying. They demand that the State Department share its internal plans.

Tenney and some colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee are so concerned by the Biden administration’s handling of U.S.-Iran relations that they initiated a congressional review on Thursday. The Washington Free Beacon notes this review “could unearth evidence [that] the State Department lifted sanctions as part of a package of concessions meant to appease Iranian officials, as U.S. diplomats negotiate a revamped nuclear agreement with Tehran.”

The Washington Free Beacon proceeds to write that the Biden administration is struggling to productively negotiate with Tehran, leading to potentially desperate measures: “While senior Biden administration officials initially vowed to keep [the Trump administration’s] sanctions in place until Iran agreed to a stricter nuclear agreement, the administration has moved in recent months to relax pressure to keep Iran at the bargaining table.” Moreover, “Talks in Vienna have largely stalled over Iran’s refusal to roll back portions of its nuclear program.”

In the congressional correspondence obtained exclusively by the Washington Free Beacon, Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee address Secretary of State Antony Blinken to “express [their] serious concern” regarding the lifted sanctions. They emphasize that Iran “continues to hold American citizens hostage, expand its nuclear enrichment program, and export terrorism across the region.”

These Republicans remind the Biden administration that it promised to consult Congress about U.S.-Iran policies, but has failed to do so.

In the letter, Republicans also remind the administration that it promised it wouldn’t reward Iran with concessions until the regime came into full compliance with the original 2015 nuclear accord. Today, the regime remains non-compliant and “has … increased its stockpile of enriched uranium to 60%,” which is near the quantity required for an atomic weapon.

Iran also continues to fund regional terrorist groups like Hamas. Iran sanctions have nonetheless been lifted by the Biden administration.

The @StateDept said it would maintain pressure on Iran. Now the Biden Admin is prioritizing sanctions relief for the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. I led a letter to @SecBlinken demanding to know why they lied & failed to notify Congress.https://t.co/3um4eeuGw6 — Congresswoman Tenney (@RepTenney) June 17, 2021



In their congressional correspondence, members of the GOP pose numerous questions of concern to the administration. “Why were committee members not made aware in advance of these high-profile delistings of Iranian targets?” they ask Blinken. “Furthermore, why did you fail to inform either the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of this pending action when you testified before these committees on June 7 and June 8, respectively?”

“Given that Iran continues to support terrorism in the region, expand its nuclear program, and violate U.S. sanctions on exports of oil and petrochemicals, why have the Departments of State and the Treasury made the decision to prioritize the removal of Iranian sanctions violators over other competing priorities?” GOP members add. They demand answers, as well as detailed information concerning any inter-administration discussions about the lifted sanctions.

It frequently takes weeks or even months for sanctions to be reprieved, and the Biden administration’s justifications for expediting the process remain unclear. The Washington Free Beacon notes that members of the GOP “demand the State Department prove these sanctions were not lifted as part of a behind-the-scenes bid to push negotiations over a deal further along.”

Members of the GOP assert “that only a policy of strength and moral clarity toward the brutal regime in Iran will advance America’s interests.” “We already have grave concerns about this [a]dministration’s willingness to chase these terrorist mullahs around the world begging them to reenter a flawed deal,” they write. “Now we are even more concerned that [the administration is] walking back [its] commitment to hold firm on existing sanctions until a new deal is reached and Iran reverses its nuclear program.”

While the House Foreign Affairs Committee probes this issue, the Republican Study Committee has also spearheaded a parallel investigation.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/18/house-republicans-demand-answers-after-biden-admin-lifts-iran-sanctions-without-consulting-congress/,2021-06-18
Democrats Are Turning ‘Homeland Security’ Into A Political Weapon,"When a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence says directly into a camera that fighting terror may now mean arresting members of Congress, the blood sport of politics has been taken to a new and more dangerous level.

Speaking on MSNBC recently, Frank Figliuzzi opined to Chuck Todd that: “Arresting low-level operatives is merely a speed bump, not a road block. In order to really tackle terrorism … and this time domestically … you’ve got to attack and dismantle the command-and-control element of the terrorist group, and unfortunately, and I know this is painful to hear … that may mean people sitting in Congress right now, people in and around the former president.”

""In order to really tackle terrorism … you've got to attack and dismantle the command and control element.” “That may mean people sitting in Congress right now."" pic.twitter.com/Cn6HlTS9Zq — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) June 8, 2021

It is the stuff of banana republics when political opponents are locked up, and this was urged not by a fringe activist on an obscure YouTube channel, but by a former high-ranking U.S. intelligence official on the second-most-watched cable news network, with no gasp from the host. Is this what “homeland security” has become?

Clearly, much has changed since 9/11, when President George W. Bush instituted a new office to “secure the United States from terrorist threats of attacks” that eventually became the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). With a $40 billion budget and more than 240,000 employees, it is now a behemoth eclipsed in size only by the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.

Although established with noble purpose, there is growing evidence that its focus has evolved in a direction those voting for its creation never imagined. Those with the secret clearances and shiny badges are increasingly scrutinizing our homeland, not for external attackers, but our own people.

In his first address to Congress, President Joe Biden cited “white supremacist terrorism” as the “most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today.” This scripted message is being driven by other key Biden administration officials, including Attorney General Merrick Garland, who testified to the Senate Appropriations Committee that: “Domestic violent extremists pose an elevated threat in 2021 and in the FBI’s view, the top domestic violent extremist threat we face comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race.”

Joining him in that assessment was Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the primary official charged with protecting our nation from terror. Neither official mentioned the race riots involving Black Lives Matter and Antifa last year that cost a record $2 billion in estimated insurance losses. Nor did they voice concern over the incessant “death to America” chants from the Middle East, the region that produced the 9/11 attackers. No, suddenly whatever Democrats consider “white supremacy” is our number one security threat.

It would be easy to chalk this phony claim up to mere political rhetoric. After all, racial strife has long been a favorite tool of the Democrat Party, and their calculus has been consistently simple: create more anger to drive voters to the polls. But this isn’t politics as usual. Their comments belie a much deeper and insidious intent, now evidenced by concrete policy actions.

Here’s Who Democrats Consider ‘Domestic Terrorists’

The White House just released its “National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism,” a four-pillared approach to identifying and eliminating domestic violent extremism (DVE) threats. Despite its stated claim of protecting civil liberties, there are clear risks within.

The press release notes that “private sector partners” will be used to identify early threats via “credible non-governmental analysis.” Who are these partners? We don’t know. Perhaps the Southern Poverty Law Center, armed with their list of “hate groups” that has routinely included well-known Christian organizations such as Family Research Council and the American Family Association for their stance on LGBTQ issues. Could Black Lives Matter be a partner in identifying white supremacists?

Will Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg will help out with the plan to “address online terrorist recruitment … through increased information sharing with the technology sector,” offering up lists of radicals who lean the wrong way on Second Amendment rights, abortion, or the integrity of the 2020 election? How exactly will they “foster digital literacy, ” and is that a euphemism for content control?

Will Google help “develop new multilateral solutions to eliminating terrorist content online,” and how will “safeguarding the freedom of online expression” be achieved? Inquiring minds want to know.

Scrutinizing Retired Veterans

The White House also instructs the Department of Defense to incorporate “training for servicemembers separating or retiring from the military” to ensure they aren’t susceptible to recruitment by “violent extremist actors.” Who are these violent groups? Again, they don’t say.

We have a hint, though, as white supremacists and “anti-government or anti-authority violent extremists” are cited as the “two most lethal” threats. Although the only white supremacists most Americans will ever see in action are the ones jumping off a bridge ahead of the Blues Brothers’ speeding car, there’s no doubt which political group generally holds views critical of the government. Conservatives, beware—veterans, in particular.

The press release also references the goal of “stemming the flow of firearms to individuals intending to commit acts of domestic terrorism.” How will we know who is “intending” violence? Could it include those dangerous folks deemed “anti-government,” the ones pissed off about open borders, high taxes, crazy spending, and countless other issues—opinions once covered under the First Amendment? Better think twice before putting that “Don’t Tread on Me” sticker on your truck.

Domestic Surveillance for ‘Domestic Terror’

DHS previously announced a new Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3) that will fit hand in glove with the Biden plan. With help from Big Tech and academics, it will conduct behavioral assessments on American citizens—without their knowledge.

As unbelievably surreal as it sounds, a pattern of political posts on social media, monitored and reported by government contractors, may soon put offenders under federal scrutiny for suspicious activity. As Harsha Panduranga of the Brennan Center for Justice noted: “A lot of these characteristics that we’re talking about are shared by millions and millions of Americans: social isolation, having a grievance, whatever that means … It really could capture broad swaths of the US population.”

Monitoring the U.S. population, searching for those with grievances. It’s hard to imagine a more open door for a Pandora’s box of civil rights violations. At the behest of partisan Democrats, the organization created to protect us all from another 9/11 will now turn its forces and energy on American civilians.

The political inquisition has also been pushed by Democrats in Congress who sought a “January 6 Commission” in the style of the “9/11 Commission” to investigate what they’ve termed an “insurrection.” Federal law enforcement has already pursued every man, woman, and perhaps a few dogs and cats that entered the Capitol that day, with more than 500 arrested thus far under a “shock and awe” approach that has left many confined in maximum security conditions, including some who simply entered the Capitol.

But Democrats wish to craft the image of their political opponents as radicals more dangerous than the Islamic fundamentalists who hijacked four airplanes on 9/11. Senate Republicans were able to kill the bill, but not its ultimate goal. Democrats won’t give up. And they won’t spare any group from ideological scrutiny, not even the military or DHS.

Never Centralize Powers the Left Might Obtain

Surely, none of this was contemplated by President Bush when he signed the legislation making DHS a federal agency. How could he have known that our most powerful law enforcement and intelligence agencies would one day be employed for political purposes? Who would’ve guessed that FBI, CIA, and DNI chiefs empowered to protect our nation would use those powers to attempt to remove a duly elected president with an elaborate hoax?

We’ve had warnings. In 2013, former CIA employee and National Security Agency subcontractor Edward Snowden exposed the NSA’s abuse of powers entrusted to it under the Patriot Act. The agency’s mass surveillance of private citizens and companies was stunning.

Was it all for national security? Not even close. The agents were found spying on their love interests, a tactic affectionally called “LOVEINT.” They also tracked the personal and sexual activities of people they called “radicalizers,” to discredit them.

“Homeland security” has quickly become a system that can neither be trusted to enforce nor obey the law, nor be penalized for its own malfeasance. Its apparently unfireable leaders carry on with impunity, despite perjuring themselves before Congress, falsifying documents for a FISA court, unmasking communications without clear justification, and illegally spying on American citizens without a warrant. Perfect knowledge and unrestrained power have made a dangerous cocktail.

Left Says White Supremacy Is Top Terror Threat — And All Opponents Are White Supremacists,"Hysteria around white supremacy has characterized much of our country’s public debate over the last year, but now instead of simply being the favorite insult of left-wing politicians and the corporate media, “white supremacy” has become public enemy No. 1, according to the Biden administration.

In a White House “fact sheet“ entitled “National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism,” the administration claims that “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists who advocate for the superiority of the white race” are the premier domestic terror threat facing America.

Everyone Is a ‘White Supremacist’

There is no reason to believe, however, that the “white supremacist” moniker will be reserved for those who genuinely believe in ethnic or racial superiority. This term has already been applied so broadly, it’s lost much of its meaning, becoming little more than an overtly politicized slur.

Take, for example, this diagram, which was used in so-called equity training for government schools in Illinois and more recently in Iowa. It asserts that the phrase “Make America Great Again,” paternalism, objecting to “reverse” racism, refusing to accept moral culpability for slavery, denying one’s own white privilege or racism, supporting immigration restriction, and being a “self-appointed white ally” are examples of white supremacy.

LEAKED DOCUMENTS from Iowa School System show Teachers are FORCED to classify ‘Make America Great Again” as a type of “racism"" & “white supremacy.” This is done through MANDATORY Critical Race Theory training FORCED on teachers at taxpayer expense. Trump won Iowa by +9 points pic.twitter.com/6xEuVJpv7g — Benny (@bennyjohnson) June 22, 2021

In a separate instance, elementary school students were taught that perfectionism, individualism, objectivity, and defensiveness were all aspects of white supremacy.

Rhetoric like this has become increasingly common, with critical race theory taking root in government schools and aiming to indict America and especially all white people as inherently and irredeemably racist, with one school in New York categorizing opposition to “white abolition” as “white supremacy.” Even the completely innocuous sentiment “It’s okay to be white” has been branded as a “hate slogan” by the Anti-Defamation League.

As the phrase has been overused to condemn America and the majority of its population, it’s also become so detached from its literal meaning that Vanity Fair has claimed, “White Supremacy Is Not Just for White People.” White supremacy, rather than a clearly identifiable phenomenon, is a convenient insult for the left’s political opponents — and it exposes the left’s twisted worldview.

If white people leave a certain area, they’re engaging in white flight, which is white supremacy, but if they move into a predominantly non-white area, then they’re engaging in gentrification, which is also white supremacy. White people need to “shut up and listen,” (to combat white supremacy, of course) but white silence is violence because it allegedly bolsters white supremacy. If you’re not an ally then you’re supporting white supremacy, but as the above diagram instructs, being a “self-appointed” ally is also an example of white supremacy.

One New York professor even argued that “reproducing white children” contributes to racism while also saying that having multiracial children is problematic if one isn’t working to dismantle “systemic white supremacy.”

White Supremacy Where It Doesn’t Exist

Since genuine acts of white supremacist domestic terrorism are exceedingly rare, with the FBI’s most recent numbers showing that white people are underrepresented among hate crime offenders, the corporate media has resorted to inserting racial motives into situations where they are absent, nakedly manipulating if not outright manufacturing the facts.

After the tragic shooting in Atlanta, Trevor Noah of “The Daily Show” remarked, “The Atlanta shooter blamed a specific race of people for his problems, and then murdered them because of it. If that’s not racism, then the word has no meaning,” while CNN, in a feat of distinctly journalistic hubris, responded to the tragic shooting by arguing that “it is immaterial whether the accused killer in the Atlanta spa shootings admits to a racist motivation” in an article titled, “White supremacy and hate are haunting Asian Americans.”

The director of the FBI said that “it does not appear that the motive was racially motivated,” a conclusion made all the more obvious by the fact that two of the shooter’s victims were white.

Meanwhile, both Noah and CNN have yet to comment on a recent case in which an accused shooter admitted to targeting white men, or an instance in which an alleged member of a black nationalist militia is suspected of shooting a police officer in the head.

But while racially motivated shootings go unnoticed, teenagers smirking at the wrong people is the embodiment of “white patriarchy,” according to some members of the media.

The corporate media rushed to deem the events of Jan. 6 an act of racial violence despite the severe lack of evidence behind the claim, with MSNBC calling it a “last gasp for white supremacy” and the Washington Post writing, “On January 6th came the white supremacists.”

Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed a similar sentiment in a recent hearing when he said he “wants to understand white rage,” implying that white rage was the impetus for the storming of the Capitol, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cited white supremacy as a “root cause” of the storming.

In the absence of real, identifiable white supremacy, the left manufactures it and ascribes supremacist motivations to their opponents, giving the Biden White House justification to devote resources and attention to a drastically overhyped threat while sidestepping real issues such as America’s crime surge.

A Slandering of Conservatives

Left-wing attempts to engage in collective scapegoating have severe consequences for conservatives and anyone else the left has identified as “oppressors.”

Not only has the whole of the GOP been erroneously branded as the party of white nationalism and fascism, but the left’s hatred has extended beyond partisan squabbles, with academics calling whiteness “parasitic,” daydreaming about committing acts of racial violence, and tweeting their support for “white genocide,” all while critical race theory browbeats children into hating themselves and their country.

White supremacy hasn’t been dubbed the top domestic terror threat because it is a serious, widespread danger to our nation. If it were, acts of racial hatred wouldn’t have to be fabricated by the corporate media and multimillion-dollar organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League wouldn’t have time to be concerned with the alleged hate slogan “it’s okay to be white.”

The left has named white supremacy the top terror threat because doing so pathologizes support for basic conservative causes, stirring up fear of racial hatred while being its most dedicated proponents.

Vice News' Tucker Carlson Slam Is A Distraction From The Left's Collusion,"Vice News slammed Fox News’ Tucker Carlson for alleged hypocrisy on Wednesday because the conservative host advocated for cameras in classrooms to dissuade the use of race-based curriculum after calling foul on the National Security Agency for spying on him.

Not only is Vice’s accusation laughable, but it’s also a huge diversion from the alleged NSA spying situation the corrupt media has predictably neglected to cover honestly. More importantly, it’s a petty distraction from what the Tucker NSA ordeal signifies in context: a coordinated effort among Democrats, the media, and the deep state to demonize conservatives. Axios claimed to confirm through anonymous sources Wednesday in “Scoop: Tucker Carlson sought Putin interview at time of spying claim” that “the NSA is denying the targeting of Carlson but is not denying that his communications were incidentally collected.” Wow.

Like many other outlets and top pundits, however, Vice chose to brush off what was at the time the terrifying prospect of the NSA targeting U.S. citizens (and which has since been demonstrably true) to focus on tangential inanities: “Tucker Carlson: don’t spy on me. [A]lso Tucker Carlson: spy on teachers,” Vice tweeted, linking to an article about the Fox News host’s monologue on classroom cams. “Protection from government surveillance, however, apparently doesn’t extend to teachers or the classroom,” the article said.

It’s an intellectually lazy comparison, even for Vice, and The Federalist’s Sean Davis fired back succinctly. “It’s fun when a bunch of morons who pretend to not know the difference between boys and girls also pretend to not know the difference between the government and the people,” he tweeted. Davis’s one sentence is an adequate refutation of the entire article.

https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/1412791322596020229

But the Tucker NSA story is worth more attention than just a run-of-the-mill Vice opinion and a passing Twitter dunk. Paired with other important political context, it’s an apt case study in left-wing collusion. Several seemingly unrelated recent stories about domestic terrorism, emergency exceptions, “white rage,” and Carlson converge into a striking illustration of how the left successfully brands mainstream conservatives as racists and ideological extremists.

Connect the Dots

Rewind for a moment to the middle of last month, when President Joe Biden’s White House put out a “fact sheet” on “National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.” It noted that, on his first day in office, Biden had directed his national security team to focus on domestic terrorism, which the White House said is “the most urgent terrorism threat the United States faces today.”

It then listed “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists who advocate for the superiority of the white race” as the first of two “most lethal elements of today’s domestic terrorism threat.” In other words, it claimed white supremacy is the most deadly aspect of our country’s top terrorism threat.

Pair that with another news item. During a June 23 congressional hearing, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, in addition to echoing lies that the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was somehow fueled by feelings about race, fully embraced the left’s race-centric talking points.

“I want to understand white rage. And I’m white, and I want to understand it,” Milley said, sounding as if his head were lodged squarely in a Robin DiAngelo book.

Carlson addressed Milley’s comments on his show, criticizing the general for being “obsequious” and saying, “Notice he never defined white rage? And we should know what it is. What is white rage?”

It wasn’t long before corporate media heads jumped into the ring, with CNN and others branding Carlson as the definition of white rage.

“You are White rage, Tucker. You are. And you know it,” Russia hoaxer and “Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter tweeted after the segment aired. His CNN co-worker Brianna Keilar echoed the same. “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” tweeted a video calling Tucker a “white supremacist” and “white rage.”

It was just after this that Carlson said on-air that the National Security Agency was spying on him and his team in an effort to sabotage his show, and that he could prove it.

“Yesterday we heard from a whistleblower within the U.S. government who reached out to warn us that the NSA, the National Security Agency, is monitoring our electronic communications and is planning to leak them in an attempt to take this show off the air,” Carlson said on his June 28 show. “The whistleblower, who is in a position to know, repeated back to us information about a story that we are working on that only could have come directly from my texts and emails. … The NSA captured that information without our knowledge.”

Everything’s an Emergency if Your Opponent’s a Terrorist

The NSA delicately wordsmithed a statement denying Carlson’s claim — at least his allegation that they targeted him. The National Security Agency never denied reading the Fox News host’s texts and emails. More concerning, however, is that although the NSA rightly noted it technically cannot target U.S. citizens, it gave itself a massive carveout: emergency exceptions.

“NSA has a foreign intelligence mission. We target foreign powers to generate insights on foreign activities that could harm the United States. With limited exceptions (e.g. an emergency), NSA may not target a US citizen without a court order that explicitly authorizes the targeting,” the agency said in a statement.

A statement from NSA regarding recent allegations: pic.twitter.com/vduE6l6YWg — NSA/CSS (@NSAGov) June 30, 2021

Emergency exceptions? Like, say, perhaps an American citizen who embodies “white rage” or who is a “white supremacist,” which — in case you hadn’t heard — is the biggest terror threat of our time?

We all witnessed the kinds of “emergency exceptions” that justified Democrat leaders ignoring constitutional liberties because of a virus. If you don’t think the “exceptions” bar will be lower for what has been deemed the “most urgent terrorism threat” in the United States, think again.

This is classic left-wing collusion that occurs among Democrat politicos and bureaucrats, their friends in the media, and the deep state. Sometimes they loop in extras — in this case, a political military actor, or on a past occasion, a British spy. Step one: Identify the conservative position. Step two: Hyperbolize and demonize it. Step three: Let the media parrot the false narrative. Step four: Justify state force against “extremist” opponents.

It’s easy to justify breaking the law and seizing power when you can make your rivals out to be domestic terrorists — and that’s exactly what the left is doing to conservatives like you.

"Biden Says Domestic Terrorism Is A Threat, Nominates Domestic Terrorist","From early on, the Biden administration has urged the need to combat “domestic terrorism” and touted a high standard of “ethics.” Joe Biden shot gaping holes in the sincerity and credibility of both goals when he nominated an ethically compromised eco-terrorist, Tracy Stone-Manning, to lead the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which controls nearly 250 million acres of resource-rich federal lands.

The confirmation process has brought to light Stone-Manning’s domestic terrorist past. Some argue it makes her unfit to command the approximately 12 percent of the American landmass BLM controls, access to which is key to countless Western jobs and the region’s economic and cultural vitality.

A History of Domestic Terrorist Exploits

During her years as a graduate student at the University of Montana, Stone-Manning was involved with the eco-terrorist group “Earth First!,” which in 2002 was labeled a “radical group” by the FBI. The group gave rise to the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), an organization the FBI described as a “serious terrorist threat” in the early 2000s.

Earth First! has extensive connections to ecological terrorist movements across the globe. It recently endorsed an attack on logging equipment in Chile, labeling the destruction of “no less than 26 machines” as a “beautiful coordinated attack,” according to the Earth First! Journal. The group also expressed unqualified support for terrorists — dismissed by some in the media as “vandals” — who recently set fire to part of a Tesla factory in Germany.

Closer to home, ELF was responsible for the 1998 arson attacks on ski buildings and equipment in Vail, Colorado. In May 2001, ELF firebombed the office of Toby Bradshaw, a biologist at the University of Washington, to protest his work genetically modifying trees.

More recently, in December 2020, “Earth First!” was scrawled across a natural gas pipeline in Aspen, Colorado, where an “intentional disruption” of gas service left hundreds of households without heat or hot water in the midst of a brutal winter cold snap. That crime remains unsolved, despite the Biden administration’s selective campaign to hunt down and prosecute domestic extremists.

Back in 1989, Stone-Manning directly supported the terrorist group’s tree-spiking activities. Tree spiking involves driving spikes or nails into the trunks of trees before they are cut down. The spikes can splinter upon impact with a logger’s chainsaw or a sawmill blade, sending out shards of flying metal. The aim is to maim or kill lumber industry workers, or damage equipment.

Tree-spiking is a felony in many states across the country, including Oregon, Washington, Indiana, and Maine. Stone-Manning partook in one of these sabotages in 1989 by helping send an anonymous letter to the U.S. Forest Service, threatening “a total of five hundred pounds of spikes measuring 8 to 10 inches” awaited loggers in an Idaho forest where a cutting project was to take place.

Stone-Manning’s apologists may portray the “warning letter” as an act of heroism, suggesting she opposed the action. But the letter in fact was part of the plan, according to her own admission.

The letter wasn’t meant to help forest officials identify spiked trees. Its purpose was to dissuade them from cutting any trees, fearing some were booby-trapped. The letter warned “a lot of people could get hurt” if “you bastards” go ahead with the logging project — obviously a threat, not a helpful heads-up. Stone-Manning wasn’t a whistleblower but a plot participant, who only escaped prosecution by rolling over on her former friend.

Ethics Concerns Plus Lying to Congress

Stone-Manning’s troubled past doesn’t stop at supporting domestic terrorism. In her graduate school thesis, she referred to a human child as an “environmental hazard” and portrayed parents who have more than two kids as environmentally irresponsible. She also argued that livestock grazing on public lands is “destroying the West,” which can’t be welcome news to the many Western ranchers who hold grazing rights on BLM land.

Stone-Manning has been a senior adviser at the National Wildlife Federation, a group with a long history of opposition to critical pieces of energy infrastructure, including pipelines. Putting an anti-drilling zealot in charge of managing the nation’s most energy-rich lands is like hiring a vegan to manage a meat market.

In the ethical concerns department, Stone-Manning received a personal loan from a Montana developer and Democrat party donor while on the payroll of Montana’s U.S. Sen. Jon Tester. Financial disclosure filings put the value of the loan at between $50,000 and $100,000, on which she paid a below-market interest rate of 6 percent.

The American Accountability Foundation, a watchdog group, says the loan may have qualified as an “impermissible gift” under Senate ethics rules, which note “gifts,” including loans, are unacceptable if “there is reason to believe that the gift was provided because of the individual’s [recipient’s] official position.”

Stone-Manning also denied ever having been the target of a federal investigation on a questionnaire submitted to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. But the FBI and the Forest Service, two agencies with federal law enforcement responsibilities, did investigate her (along with several others) in the tree-spiking case.

“It’s clear that Ms. Stone-Manning was intentionally trying to deceive the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming. “She told the committee she had never been the subject of an investigation and yet complained about being investigated in the press. President Biden should withdraw her nomination.”

Earlier this week, Sen. Barrasso published additional questions pressing the nominee for answers on her radical past, the sweetheart loan, and her editing work on an Earth First! newsletter.

Stone-Manning Pick Shows How Radical Biden Is

Although the Biden White House so far is sticking by the nominee, at least publicly, the tide seems to be turning against her.

“No matter how young, no matter how naive, the director of the Bureau of Land Management for the United States of America should not — and I repeat, should not — have ever been involved in eco-terrorism,” said Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, in a floor speech calling on Biden to rethink the appointment.

Barack Obama’s BLM director, Bob Abbey, retracted his endorsement of Stone-Manning’s nomination after the revelations came to light. “The fact that she stood by and allowed this criminal action to take place could have resulted in critical injuries or worse to career public servants who were just performing their duties,” said Abbey.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell formally announced his opposition to Stone-Manning in a strongly worded condemnation on Tuesday, which may be a sign the matter will soon come to a full Senate vote.

Many nominees come with baggage that can slow or stall the process. But Stone-Manning is so far over the weight limit for personal and ideological baggage that this almost has to be a test to see how unqualified a nominee can be and still win Senate approval.

Eco-leftists of Stone-Manning’s ilk would desperately like to portray their fringe ideology as mainstream and respectable. Having one of their own embedded this high up in the federal government would be a good way to do that. That might help explain why the White House is stubbornly sticking with this nominee despite negatives that would sink anyone else.

It’s also possible Stone-Manning’s past was known by White House insiders but not considered damning or troubling enough to disqualify her – showing just how radical Team Biden is.

The president is hypocritically lambasting violent extremism and domestic terror on one hand, while rewarding it on the other by placing a practitioner of both in a position of power and prestige. That sends Americans the message that left-wing extremism and political violence won’t just be tolerated, it will be rewarded, and with a plumb federal appointment. The implications of that reach far beyond the approval or disapproval of this nominee.

"In NYT, Vox Founder Excuses Domestic Terrorism Against Oil Pipelines","Vox Co-founder Ezra Klein excused terrorist bombings of oil pipelines in a column titled “It Seems Odd That We Would Just Let the World Burn.” He opens the column this way:

I spent the weekend reading a book I wasn’t entirely comfortable being seen with in public. Andreas Malm’s ‘How to Blow Up a Pipeline’ is only slightly inaptly named. You won’t find, anywhere inside, instructions on sabotaging energy infrastructure. A truer title would be ‘Why to Blow Up a Pipeline.’ On this, Malm’s case is straightforward: Because nothing else has worked.

The New York Times, which previously claimed that U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton calling for law and order during last year’s summer of rage was an act of violence, published Klein’s excuses for domestic terrorism on Thursday. A Times editor resigned over publishing Cotton’s op-ed.

“Decades of climate activism have gotten millions of people into the streets but they haven’t turned the tide on emissions, or even investments,” Klein noted. This, he writes, explains why people would turn to violent crime over the issue.

Klein also quotes a direct call for violence by the book’s author, Malm: “‘Here is what this movement of millions should do, for a start,’ Malm writes. ‘Announce and enforce the prohibition. Damage and destroy new CO2-emitting devices. Put them out of commission, pick them apart, demolish them, burn them, blow them up. Let the capitalists who keep on investing in the fire know that their properties will be trashed.’”

Klein’s response? Not that bombings are evil and horrifying, but that they’d probably be counterproductive, because they’d motivate people to vote against the environmentalist left. His other concern about domestic terrorism against energy infrastructure, he says, is that the “consequence of a wave of bombings to obliterate energy infrastructure would be to raise the price on energy immediately, all across the world, and the burdens would fall heaviest on the poor.”

“I suspect that human beings will not go extinct from climate change, but I have higher standards than that."" https://t.co/fmgIoq4TEK — Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) July 15, 2021

Klein even explains why it makes sense that someone would bomb crucial U.S. infrastructure such as oil pipelines: because the climate crisis is so dire, and not even its top political advocates are doing enough about it.

He also frighteningly declines to condemn the book author’s suggestion that domestic terrorists kill wealthy people, instead engaging the idea as if it’s completely normal.

“Malm tries, at times, to resolve this tension, suggesting that perhaps the targets could be the yachts of the superrich, but in general he’s talking about pipelines, and pipelines carry the fuels for used Nissans and aged ferries, not just Gulfstream jets,” Klein notes.

“There was no peaceful American Revolution. There were riots and rifles woven into the civil rights movement,” Klein notes. He further notes in the column that “violence is often deployed, even if counterproductively, on behalf of causes far less consequential than the climate crisis.”

Indeed, Klein expresses shock that we don’t see more eco-terrorism: “skepticism of the practical benefits of violence does not fully explain its absence in a movement this vast and with consequences this grave.” He concludes the column by pondering “how to force the political system to do enough, fast enough, to avert mass suffering.”

“I don’t know the answer, or even if there is an answer. Legislative politics is unlikely to suffice under any near-term alignment of power I can foresee — though I dearly hope Congress passes, at the least, the investments and clean energy standards proposed in the American Jobs Plan,” Klein said. “I doubt a wave of bombings would accelerate change, and even if I believed otherwise, who am I to tell others to risk those consequences?”

What The Whitmer Kidnapping Case Reveals About The FBI,"This week included interesting revelations about the FBI’s case against the handful of people charged with plotting to kidnap the governor of Michigan. Of 14 people indicted, five (or more) were working as informants for the FBI.

As Revolver has noted, the five people who seem to be the FBI informants were also the people who seemed to have all the kidnapping ideas and access to all the equipment needed for a paramilitary assault on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s vacation home. At one point, the leadership of the conspiracy met, and three of the five people in that discussion were FBI.

I worked in counterterrorism for more than 10 years, so I understand all the reasons a federal agent would argue this isn’t technically entrapment. The people didn’t know they were surrounded by feds and continued to take overt actions that advanced the fantasy conspiracy, and that’s illegal. Okay, fine.

But this got me thinking about some of the old ISIS and al-Qaeda cases I reviewed when I was helping prosecute terrorists who actually killed people. I remember giving my buddies in the FBI a hard time when they would “win” a domestic terror case and all they had was a kook who had been running his mouth on the internet.

“Your case is weak,” I would tell them, “And why are you wearing a suit? We’re going to be reading in the SCIF again today. It’s the same things we’ve been doing all year.”

At the risk of sounding like Tom Nichols some old man sitting on a porch going on about how hard things were in my day, I’m going to say this: There was a time the FBI caught and prosecuted really dangerous people.

Remember Ramzi Yousef, the guy who bombed the World Trade Center? Now, that’s a real terrorist. He could build bombs and teach others to build them. He would work independently in foreign countries for months on end. He could quietly travel and move money around the world without anyone noticing.

When the FBI secured his conviction, he was airlifted out of the courthouse in lower Manhattan. The agents who caught him were in the helicopter with him. They could easily see the World Trade Center, and one of the agents said to Yousef, “You failed. They’re still standing.”

“I just needed a little more money,” Yousef said.

That’s a real terrorist.

Terrorism, as it turns out, is hard. Recruiting isn’t easy, and finding the right people is difficult. A person who is willing to train, travel, keep secrets, and face a very high chance of dying is not statically all that common.

Getting access to explosives, and knowing how to use them, is technically complicated. You can practice, but if you make a mistake, you’ll blow yourself up. Oh, there’s bomb-making manuals on the internet? Sure, there are. Feel free to try those out. I dare you.

Shooting isn’t all that easy either, and training someone to gun fight—really, seriously gun fight—takes expertise, and time, and a place where you can shoot for hundreds of hours without anyone noticing. Do you know where you could do something like that? Who would teach you how to shoot like that, or fight with knives, or drive a car so you could get away? How would you find that person? How would you vet him to make sure he’s not FBI?

You wouldn’t. Unless you’re a mercenary, you’ve trained with a militia in Africa or Asia, or you’re a SWAT officer or an elite soldier, you wouldn’t know those things, and you wouldn’t know people who know those things. Frankly, most of the people who know those things are dedicated patriots. They’re the good people, and the bad guys won’t share that information easily. They’re secretive and expensive.

So the FBI does the heavy lifting in these cases. The suspects start out by talking about jihad or revolution or overthrowing the government, and someone in their chat group decides he should tell the FBI.

The people the FBI sends in to look at the chats or communicate with the suspects aren’t just a fly on the wall. They offer to help. They offer bombs. They offer direction. They suggest targets.

They tell the suspects they need money for the cause. They ask them when they can fly to Syria or Iraq or wherever.

The Intercept did some marvelous reporting on this in 2017. They noted, quite correctly, that in hundreds and hundreds of cases the FBI and Department of Justice had brought to trial there were no victims of violence, and the FBI informants were the primary driving characters in the fictional worlds the suspects had been caught up in.

In case after case, it’s the FBI that creates the illusion of the ability to do harm. There are no bombs, no ability to launch an attack. There is no group ready to meet and support them, no weapons smugglers, or expert marksmen. There is only the anger of a lonely person screaming into the void of the internet, and the only one who answers that screaming is the FBI.

So what’s interesting about the revelations from this week is not that the FBI is up to some new, clever gambit to combat the wily insurrectionists in our midst. What is interesting is they are right back to pulling the same tricks they used on wannabe al-Qaeda and ISIS dopes for the last 15 years.

Why is the assistant director of the FBI’s Washington Field Office—Anthony D’Antuono, who is heading the investigation into the January 6 riot at the capitol and was previously in charge of the Detroit Field Office—doing these things? He’s never known another way. He had been an FBI agent only three years on 9/11, and all that time he was a forensic accountant. This is how the FBI has run these kinds of investigations his entire career.

The problem is not that we’re going to find out that the January 6 case is going to be full of FBI agents and informants, just like the Whitmer kidnapping case. The problem is we are starting to understand this is standard procedure for counterterrorism. This is a 20-year-old charade the FBI brass has been pulling.

The FBI didn’t let the crisis of 9/11 go to waste—they seized on it to dramatically increase their funding and power. They suddenly took the “lead” on terrorism all over the United States. Before 9/11, they had treated terrorism as an ugly footnote. The people on the USS Cole bombing case remember working out of basement offices, part-time, as al-Qaeda grew more powerful, better funded, and trained hundreds of people in Afghanistan.

Once the FBI was in charge, there were lots of new GS-15 positions, offices to fill, and money to spend—and boy, did they. In 2001, the FBI wanted $1.5 billion for counterterrorism and only got $500 million. In 2002, they asked for $200 million more. In 2003, they asked for $285 more. And so on. The total FBI budget was about $3.5 billion in 2002. It’s more than $10 billion today.

Now, 20 years later, with Osama bin Laden dead and the United States leaving Afghanistan, do we think those GS-15 positions, or those Joint Terrorism Task Forces, or the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force, are going to go away? No. They need work to justify those budgets, and America needs a new enemy.

The difference is that the government has begun to use the tools that were developed to fight a credible foreign threat now to fight against the political opponents of Democrats.

The FBI’s Whitmer Kidnapping Case Looks Like A Potemkin Terror Plot,"Over the past few weeks, there has been a slew of reporting on the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, specifically, the fact that the FBI seems to have played a far more considerable role in it than had previously been reported. BuzzFeed News produced an exposé on the case detailing how the FBI used 12 informants and undercover FBI agents to infiltrate the Wolverine Watchmen militia group, which prosecutors allege planned to kidnap Whitmer in the run-up to the 2020 national elections.

The problem with the case is that it appears the FBI, through informants and undercover agents, hatched the kidnapping plot, served in the key leadership positions of the militia group, trained the militia members in military tactics, actively recruited participants, and funded much of the militia’s activities. Then, when various members of the Watchman militia became uncomfortable with the kidnapping plot, with several quitting, the FBI’s primary informant pushed the plot along, eventually becoming the militia group’s leader.

The Primary Informant’s Story Doesn’t Add Up

The primary informant, known only as Dan, has been identified in court documents as a former U.S. Army Iraq War veteran. Dan reportedly volunteered to the FBI after stumbling across the Wolverine Watchman group on Facebook.

Dan, whom court documents say earned a college degree in criminal justice after his stint in the Army, stated he had previously worked as an executive protection agent and a National Rifle Association firearms instructor, and was a current employee of the U.S. Postal Service (the exact nature of his duties at USPS is not publicly released).

He testified in court that he had been searching for Second Amendment-related Facebook posts to find tactical training opportunities to retain the perishable combat skills he acquired during his tour of duty in Iraq. After viewing the Watchman’s page, he applied for acceptance to their private Facebook group and was admitted after answering a series of vetting questions.

At the time Dan applied for membership with the Watchman militia, in March 2020, the Watchman militia had only a single member with military experience: Joe Morrison, a reserve U.S. Marines mechanic serving part-time with a reserve logistics support group (according to court documents, a second military veteran, Daniel Harris, was recruited into the group five months later, in July 2020). Morrison had no combat arms training beyond boot camp and zero combat experience.

It is puzzling exactly what kind of “tactical training opportunities” Dan, an Iraq War combat veteran, hoped to gain from a ragtag group of largely untrained and inexperienced civilian militia. According to Dan’s testimony, he participated in extensive, months-long, house-to-house warfare in Sadr City during his 14-month rotation in Iraq. The question of why someone with Dan’s combat experience would seek to join the Watchman militia to receive training went unasked and unexamined during depositions and court hearings.

This ‘Plot’ and These ‘Conspirators’ Are a Joke

Federal and state prosecutors in this case have indicted 14 defendants from across the country; not just from Michigan, but from states as far as away as Virginia, Delaware, and South Carolina. Some of the defendants are less than sympathetic characters and have made inflammatory statements in text messages, social media posts, and in front of wired FBI informants who dutifully recorded their every word. Prosecutors repeatedly claimed the defendants are dangerous threats to the public, but they have presented no actual evidence of this beyond the defendants’ inflammatory speech.

The prosecutors’ main claim that the defendants had demonstrated their ability and intent to use explosives in the plot was derived from their laughable attempts to ignite uncompressed black powder during a group training event sponsored by one of the FBI informants—which in itself proved how unskilled and incapable the defendants were in the handling or use of explosives. In fact, the group’s only actual planning with regard to explosives was done by an undercover FBI agent who posed as an explosives expert and black market broker for military-type explosives.

Reading through the court documents, text messages, and transcripts for this case is like listening to the David Allen Coe country song about pickup trucks, single-wide trailers, prison, and being drunk and down and out—in the rain. To the nation’s elite class, the defendants in this case are a collection of flyover America’s pile of broken toys: the surplus population who were left behind in globalization’s destruction of working-class America.

With the help of a strong supply of snitches, the FBI rounded up some unemployed, homeless, mostly alone, and angry loudmouths to build a fantasy football-style display of domestic terrorism fear-porn. The only thing more depressing than realizing middle America is now just a bunch of NPCs in the latest version of “Call of Duty: Rogue National Security State” is that there are likely more of these manufactured cases coming to an America near you.

How Powerlessness Affects a People

In a republic like America, there is a designed tension between the citizen and the state. The citizen, as the individual, is protective of his natural rights, privacy, and liberty, while the state, as the establishment, is ostensibly concerned with the prosperity, safety, and security of the republic as a whole.

Our Constitution was designed to balance the friction between Alexander Hamilton’s “The vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty” and John O’ Sullivan’s “The best government is that which governs least.” When that balance is disrupted, there is political conflict.

The elite and powerful can express their political concerns with big-money donations to politicians and pithy outrage from their blue-check Twitter accounts. The little people, the working-class flotsam and jetsam of America, have to just suck it down. They can vent their frustrations on social media, but no one is listening to them—except for people like Dan and the army of informants employed by the government.

The powerless often cope with their powerlessness through what can only be called LARPing, or live-action role-playing. This and ill-advised braggadocio is a way to feel like they have some control over their lives.

One LARP Faction Against Another

A majority of the defendants in this case were clearly LARPing as revolutionary-style patriots. This was evident when, as the FBI informants and agents pushed the plot along to more dangerous ends, many of the group’s members got cold feet and quit, with some go so far as to move out of state.

In a better America, the FBI would recognize this and dispatch an agent or two to deliver a wake-up call to these LARPers. After all, is the FBI’s purpose in inserting themselves into these types of organizations to avert political violence, or is it to manufacture cases that lead to political headlines and promotions for those agents involved?

Obviously, in America now, it is the latter—and that is the crux of the problem. Essentially, the FBI and its collection of law enforcement partners in the Joint Terrorism Task Forces are also LARPing, as counterterrorism heroes.

For the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces and their army of informants, there is money to be made in counterterrorism inflation. According to the Department of Justice Inspector General, the FBI spends more than $42 million per year on paid informants. Some informants have earned upwards of $4.9 million for their work. In this case, informant Dan earned nearly $55,000 for six months of work, in addition to his U.S. Postal Service salary.

Counterterrorism is hard work. Finding an actual domestic terrorist in a country with very few incidents of domestic terrorism is an even harder task. It appears it is much easier, more profitable, and a much better career move for all involved to create a Potemkin terror plot and then swoop in to play the part of counterterror hero.

The trouble is, while they are wasting valuable time and resources creating shocking headlines, federal agents are ignoring the real threats to Americans, while meddling in and ruining the lives of the most powerless in our society.

A Seven-Day Journey Through The Revolt Against The American People,"(Watch the video for a monologue on this article and a powerful interview with Power The Future’s Daniel Turner on the elites’ war on America.)

Last Friday, a six-year-old girl was shot down in a drive-by in Washington, D.C. while she walked with her parents and her younger sister by a park that hadn’t been taken care of — hadn’t been trimmed, hadn’t even been cleaned up or properly patrolled — by the city in a very long time. Authorities had surrendered the park to addicts and criminals, but the morning after the shooting you can bet the cleaning crews were there. It wasn’t worth salvaging the park for normal citizens who lived there, but it was for the news cameras.

This past Thursday was the six-month anniversary of the Biden administration, and by extension, the six-month anniversary of the demise of the Keystone Pipeline. The Austin American-Statesman fact-checked complaints from now-unemployed workers, claiming the jobs weren’t actually lost — they were just temporarily lost. Forever.

On Wednesday, a Politico story broke down continuing lockdowns by county, party, and then income. It was supposed to show Democrats and Republicans have similar COVID strategies, which is laughable, but it showed something different instead: working-class people are back at work. Many have always been working. And the rich folks? Not so much; but guess who’s calling for more lockdowns? (It’s not the hourly workers.)

On Tuesday, Sen. Joe Manchin said he was comfortable voting for Tracy Stone-Manning to head the Bureau of Land Management. Stone-Manning is a retired eco-terrorist who assisted men who put steel spikes in trees — the kind of steel spikes that nearly killed 23-year-old George Alexander, a mill worker whose jaw was split in half, teeth broken, and face scarred by a spike driven in by a different eco-terrorist.

Last Monday, a federal judge ruled that Indiana University could force its students to either be vaccinated or else to wear a mask at all times — while walking around, while in class, while working out in the gym. A sort of second-class citizen kind of thing.

And over the weekend, corporate media outlets mocked a 34-year-old man who had died of COVID-19. Why? He wasn’t famous, influential, or known beyond his friends, family, colleagues, and community. The reason for stories in the BBC, NBC, The Independent, New York Post, The Daily Beast and many others is he was a conservative Christian who had mocked the vaccine.

So what do these things have in common?

Every single one of them are examples of wealthy, powerful elites making decisions that affect the rest of the country a lot more than they affect their friends. Every single one of them hurts the rest of us; hurts the American people badly. And if it seems like it’s something every single day, it’s because it is.

Filth for Thee, Comfort for Me

Sure, this past week has been embarrassing for D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser: It’s getting increasingly untenable for her to embrace and endorse anti-law-and-order radicals like Black Lives Matter and tolerate crime while governing a city that is awash in blood. But at least she doesn’t have to live in the filth.

Far from it, she literally lives in the furthest corner possible from where the shooting took place, in a nice single-family home in Colonial Village on Rock Creek Park, bordering Silver Spring. It’s so far out of reach of the criminals she’s unleashed on the rest of us that she and her neighbors will never have to see them except from inside the back of their black cars (windows up, of course, to deter panhandlers).

Yes, the Keystone decision hits energy executives in their pockets, but who does it most deeply affect? If it had been built, it would have employed 11,000 people. Instead, it will employ zero. So if you guessed those 11,000 people, you’d have guessed right.

But surely there are other, better jobs, right? Maybe not so much, because for good measure, President Joe Biden blocked all new drilling permits on federal lands.

So how about those awesome green jobs he promised everyone they would get instead? Those have been on their way for more than a decade now, yet somehow they’re always just around the bend — and somehow middle America just keeps hollowing out instead. (It’s all a little less surprising when you realize then-Vice President Joe Biden was the guy in charge of teaching the coal miners how to code after his old boss took the lucrative jobs they’d just held and destroyed them for his friends in Manhattan and L.A.)

And then there are the lockdowns. In those everyone is equal, though some are more equal than others. In a lot of the country, including D.C., teachers still don’t want to go back to work; they say it’s too risky — they might get sick. Best to force your children to rot in front of Chinese Zoom instead.

Of course, if they actually wanted any tips on how to go to work safely, they might ask the nurses or grocery clerks or flight attendants or bartenders or police officers or construction workers or cab drivers or soldiers or cooks or trash collectors or cameramen or janitors or plumbers or warehouse employees or firemen who’ve long been back at work, or never took time off at all. They work to keep this country going, while the elite classes who feed on it like ticks do everything they can to shut it down again.

The top echelons of society don’t know, or they don’t remember, what it’s like to work by the hour — and they don’t care about the people who do.

And who is Tracy Stone-Manning, anyway? After her friends sneaked into the Idaho woods to nail those spikes into trees, she sent a letter to the U.S. Forest Service telling them that 500 pounds of steel had been jammed into trees.

Was this warning to save lives? Was it because she felt guilty about booby traps that could kill or maim working-class men? Of course not. It was all in a bid to intimidate them and stop any more logging there; it’s because while she was OK with wounding or killing them, her lust for destruction was satisfied with simply destroying their jobs.

When she was arrested for her terrorism, Stone-Manning avoided prosecution by rolling over on her terrorist friends and testifying against them. Lucky her; turns out the caged bird does sing.

And now Sen. Joe Manchin — that’s Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, where all those coal jobs used to be before his last president destroyed them — said he’s happy to confirm this confirmed eco-terrorist to literally be in charge of our country’s forests and land management. Seriously. It’s funny how life works out for a lot of retired left-wing terrorists, from Bill Ayers to Angela Davis.

And then there’s the college and university systems. They’re literally battling in court right now (and currently winning) to force you or your children or grandchildren to take an experimental injection in order to protect them from a disease that isn’t a threat to teenagers.

What are the effects this might have long-term? Might it impact young people’s fertility? Hopefully not, but we have no idea because it’s brand new. These are the first MRNA vaccines ever created — just 18 months ago they were entirely theoretical. Even now, while experiments are ongoing these haven’t been approved by the FDA.

Oh, and no one is allowed to ask any questions or raise any concerns about it or they will be silenced by Big Tech and corporate media with the White House loudly cheering them on. Doesn’t matter if you’re a frontline worker or even another scientist — just shut your mouth and take the shot or else. No opinions matter except for the right opinions, according to the right people.

And if you have the wrong opinion, well then you just might deserve to die, like Stephen Harmon, a young Christian man in Los Angeles who publicly professed faith in God until the very end, and who was openly rejected the experimental vaccine. He ended up dying of COVID, a sad end to a young life — and one that vaccine advocates certainly could have carefully and sensitively highlighted to argue he might not have died had he been vaccinated.

That, of course, isn’t what happened. Instead, he was dragged and mocked, just as anyone who resists Tony Fauci is dragged and mocked in death. While doctors, nurses, grocery store employees, and a host of others tending to our health were lauded as “front-line workers” during the pandemic, for example, priests and pastors who tended to our spiritual health were mocked for their faith and dragged publicly in their suffering. How dare they operate outside the narrative.

A Revolt Against The People

Every single one of these positions comes from wealthy, privileged elites.

Every single one of them affects working people hardest by far.

Every single day, more and more Americans are finding their lives held hostage by the ideology of an elite that has the privilege of avoiding nearly all consequences for its own actions.

And it’s everywhere you look. Did you know that in Seattle there have been close to 200 cases of people throwing bricks, rocks, and other debris at motorists from overpasses? That’s just so far this year. Eventually, the attackers will kill somebody, but Seattle isn’t inclined to stop it.

It’s not a mystery what’s happening: No rock-hurling hipster clubs have been discovered on Facebook; no highway Lego sets seized by federal agents. No, the people who are responsible are crazed and drug-addicted street people living in encampments that are clustering beneath the overpasses and in other nearby public parks.

Residents have complained about the camps for months; tolerating them does nothing but make life more dangerous and less healthy. It makes the city uglier. It makes life a little worse for everyone, and a lot worse for people whose only offense is living in a city and state whose leaders don’t care about them.

But the homeless encampments remain untouched because an insane, anti-human ideology is winning out over common decency and good government. It’s winning out because once again, for the people in charge there are no serious consequences: Their home values aren’t the ones at risk, they aren’t the people who have to worry about drugs and crime, their children aren’t being harassed in the streets by perverted sex pests.

It’s the same reason we saw leaders indulge the push last year to defund police departments. The same Minneapolis city council members who voted to abolish their city’s police were getting tens of thousands of dollars for special security around their own homes.

It’s a strange thing, what’s going on in this country. What we are experiencing is a revolt by the rulers against the ruled; the strongest and most able against the weakest and least able to defend themselves. It’s not the kind of thing we’re used to seeing in modern America, but in all humanity — from royal France to Soviet Russia to communist China to the warlords of Africa to the drug lords of Latin America — in all humanity it exists just beneath the surface, when oligarchies rise up and elites control nearly every aspect of our lives.

There’s another strange thing going on here, though, that makes it very different from what we’ve ever seen elsewhere. Our elites don’t just hate us, they hate our country. There’s no patriotism in this strange faux aristocracy. Even the Soviets loved Russia; the Bourbons loved France; the chairmen loved China. Why don’t our leaders love America?

It’s because America — her founding, her peoples, her prosperity, her freedom — does not fit into their new morality. She doesn’t match the code that pushes them further and further, despite outcries from down below.

These experiments — this unbelievable tolerance of crime and drug abuse and public perversion and squalor? They make the powerful feel good about themselves; they demonstrate benevolence; they signal virtue. And in a culture that has banished God, they temporarily ease the pain of separation and make the separated feel like they still serve a higher purpose.

It’s artificial, of course: Just as with the highs of the street addicts and the thrills of youthful violence, it’s a poor substitute. This is why they have to keep pushing and further and will continue to do so — until we the voters stop them.

The Biden Administration’s Extremism Is Fuel For Domestic Unrest,"Recently, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced the White House is working with various social media companies to flag and remove alleged COVID-19 misinformation. Psaki went so far as to suggest that if distributors of “misinformation”—as defined by the administration—were censored from one platform, they should be censored from all platforms. The Biden regime is getting serious about removing your access to the public square—all for your safety and security.

Likewise, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and their big-tech enablers are on the hunt for domestic extremists and general all-around infidels from the church of neo-Marxist globalism. So far they’ve had a fairly easy go of it, rounding up the January 6 protesters, deplatforming the distributors of so-called extremist misinformation, and blacklisting individual citizens who publicly speak against the Biden regime’s ideologies. All of this was made easy because the offending citizens, thinking they had constitutional rights, used digital platforms to challenge questionable claims from our ruling elites, their duplicitous medical “experts,” and the courtesans in the White House and Congress.

Just so we’re on the same sheet of music, because there’s a bunch of protesters sitting in solitary in a DC jail who didn’t get the message: The government is using the social media postings and digital communications of American citizens to target them for speaking against the establishment.

You are now the target of the enormous and deadly mass surveillance and security state you voted for back when you couldn’t have imagined that neo-Marxist elites would gain control of the government. Consider using digital countermeasures to protect yourself. For pointers, see here, here, and here.

Blacklisting for Sport and Profit

Last week, PayPal announced it is partnering with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) to investigate and close accounts the ADL has deemed as belonging to extremists. In February, PayPal had already begun closing accounts flagged by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) for allegedly being associated with “extremists” and “hate” groups. This is the same SPLC that runs a giant hate-grift that funnels donations to private Cayman Islands accounts and blacklists conservative organizations like the Family Research Council and media personalities like Tucker Carlson.

It appears PayPal is setting up a blacklist to deny banking and commercial payment services to individuals and businesses that fall outside woke culture. In an essay by PayPal co-founder David Sacks on Bari Weiss’s Substack, Sacks details the dangers of financial institutions blacklisting businesses and individuals who have been labeled as “extremist” by unaccountable and often partisan private organizations, like the ADL and SPLC. In Sacks’s foreboding words, “Silenced voices and empty stomachs are fuel for the very extremism you claim to oppose.”

In the digital public square, giants such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google have begun working with The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) to identify and remove what they consider extremist online content. Since 2017, the GIFCT has served as a private database of extremist and terrorist online content.

Like many of the post-9/11 NGOs that monitored online terrorist activity, GIFCT started out documenting content created by, or supportive of, al-Qaeda, ISIS, and the Taliban. The GIFCT is now shifting its focus to U.S. domestic extremists and white supremacists—as identified by activist groups like the SPLC. GIFCT is also working with Amazon, Dropbox, Mailchimp, and LinkedIn, to name just a few. What could possibly go wrong here?

Hanlon’s Razor

Those in Washington, DC, whether at the White House or the Capitol building, continuously bombard Americans with scary talk about domestic terrorism and extremism, as if we were living in 2006 Iraq. Last month the White House even unveiled a new domestic counterterrorism strategy to deal with this epidemic of uncooperative subjects. However, these “experts” in DC seem to have forgotten one of the maxims of counterterrorism strategy: Counterterrorism strategy should not produce more terrorism than existed before the strategy was implemented.

Calling the 1/6 non-surrection an attack worse than 9/11 is idiotic. The vast majority of those arrested are charged with misdemeanors yet rotting in jail for months under extreme conditions.

Placing hundreds of sad-sack Trump supporters in pre-trial solitary confinement for misdemeanor trespassing charges, denying access to exculpatory evidence, then delaying their show trials for 12-24 months is not exactly what the Founders had in mind when they ratified the Bill of Rights that contains the Sixth Amendment guarantee to a speedy trial and the ability to face your accuser and the evidence against you. I’m sure the DC judges and federal prosecutors got a good chuckle out of their manipulation of habeus corpus, but we see what they did there.

The FBI instigating and amplifying terror plots, which allows them to ride to the rescue, bag some promotions, justify their enormous budget, and provide their political benefactors scary stories to frighten the public—well, we see that too. Like with arsonist firefighters, however, if you start the fire, it doesn’t count.

Establishment gaslighting and threatening wonky-talk from the Biden regime’s increasingly unhinged national security surrogates is itself becoming a radicalizing agent across much of America. But to the likes of Biden’s Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, is that a bug or a feature?

Hanlon’s Razor states to never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity, and Rice has a long tradition of, well, flawed judgement. Perhaps there is more at play here than Hanlon can account for.

Afraid of Americans

Our national security apparatus—namely, the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, their partners in law enforcement, the U.S. Postal Service (again, why?) and big tech—are busy monitoring social media looking for the next III% patch-wearing dupe they can peg as a dangerous Hawaiian shirt-clad terrorist. This seems like a waste of time.

I doubt a real terrorist is going to publicize his evil plots or conduct operational planning on Instagram or Facebook Messenger. As we plainly saw with the Gov. Gretchen Witmer faux-kidnapping plot, most people on social media talking about violence are LARPers, foreign influence operations, and government informants.

I’m not saying there are not dangerous men and women in America. Absolutely there are. After all, America was founded and made the world’s greatest superpower through the sacrifice of dangerous men and women, but modern versions of these dangerous men and women aren’t on social media jabbering about violence or overthrowing the government.

These dangerous men and women have jobs, they have families to support and mortgages to pay. They’re focused on trying to pay for their kid’s braces or college tuition while keeping an increasingly woke and hostile mob at bay.

They are hard men and women, many of them combat veterans, who are not afraid to do what it takes to protect what is theirs. More importantly, they are not a threat—unless someone makes them one.

The establishment elites are now moving to do exactly that by depriving Americans of their employment, access to financial services, free speech, liberty, and their way of life. You won’t hear these dangerous men and women whining about it or talking tough on social media, but rest assured, they see what these elites are doing.

Targeting Political Opponents

In this country of 330 million people, actual political violence is a statistical anomaly. There just isn’t enough white supremacy or extremist activity to justify the entire bloated domestic terrorism industry of Joint Terrorism Task Forces, Fusion Centers, and “Countering Violent Extremism” NGO contracts. In post-9/11 fear, we incentivized a national security apparatus that now sees traditional Americans as the greatest threat to establishment power—and that’s a problem.

Our national security apparatus desperately needs a threat to justify its existence. The Biden administration has promised them one: dissident America.

Corporate media and various Biden regime surrogates are openly discussing making second-class citizens of the vaccine wary, effectively establishing a medical caste system. Companies are putting on unemployment lines people who won’t take an experimental medical therapy. Others are advocating vaccine mandates for employment, government benefits, and medical care. All while government, corporations, and nonprofits are working to remove citizens’ access to financial, e-commerce, and internet services because of their political beliefs.

If one wanted to create a particularly ferocious enemy out of a normally respectful and amenable segment of the population—an enemy that would aggressively fight back in response to maltreatment, thus providing a pretext for all manner of draconian security measures, budget increases, and “emergency” powers, I can think of no better way than to make them hungry, broke, powerless, and persecuted second-class citizens. One might label this method intentional radicalization.

Radicalization. Sometimes it’s more than just a word. Sometimes, for the tyrant, it’s a strategy.

Border Patrol Chief: Suspected Terrorists Are Crossing U.S. Border At Levels 'Never Seen Before',"Amid a massive surge of migrants at the United States-Mexico border, the outgoing Border Patrol chief told his 19,000 agents prior to retiring over the weekend that known or suspected terrorists are coming into America “at a level we have never seen before.”

“Over and over again, I see other people talk about our mission, your mission, and the context of it being immigration or the current crisis today being an immigration crisis,” Rodney Scott, who retired Saturday, said in a video to employees.

“I firmly believe that it is a national security crisis. Immigration is just a subcomponent of it, and right, now it’s just a cover for massive amounts of smuggling going across the southwest border — to include TSDBs at a level we have never seen before. That’s a real threat,” he said.

The term “TSDB” is a reference to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Terrorist Screening Center Database. The database is used by government agencies and launched after the attacks of September 11, 2001.

Scott’s comments come days after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data from July showed a 20-year record in arrests, more than 212,000, and a 13 percent increase from June. Due to migrants coming into the U.S. from Central America, the Biden administration has yanked over 40 percent of federal agents to assist in processing, custody care, and transport needs.

For the second time this year, CBP chart-makers have had to stretch the x-axis on their graphic, this time to accomodate 200,000+ migrants per month. Blue line is FY2021. pic.twitter.com/Ddkv25uUlJ — Nick Miroff (@NickMiroff) August 12, 2021

“Your peers or you are taking criminals, pedophiles, rapists, murderers, and like I said before, even TSDB alerts off the streets and keeping them safe from America,” the chief said. “Even if we processed several thousand migrants that day and even if thousands of them were allowed into the U.S., you still took those threats off the street, and I think that’s worth it. So please don’t ever undersell how important your mission is.”

This is not the first time the alarm has been sounded about known or suspected terrorists making their way to the U.S. amid the border crisis.

House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy requested the FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) host a briefing for members of Congress in April over “the number of bad actors” who escaped arrest at the border.

In January, CBP officials told congressional leadership in a briefing that four terrorist watchlist members from Yemen and Serbia were arrested at the border.

In leaked audio obtained by Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas acknowledged that the border crisis is “unsustainable.”

“The extent of the challenge should not be understated, but nor should our ability to meet it,” Mayorkas also said.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/16/border-patrol-chief-suspected-terrorists-are-crossing-u-s-border-at-levels-never-seen-before/,2021-08-16
How The Biden Administration Botched The Afghanistan Draw-Down,"As the Biden administration set a specific date for the departure of all U.S. troops in Afghanistan earlier this year, some curious phrases stood out in media reports. Those phrases, constituting a pattern, never really took center stage in the dominant narrative. However, together they painted a picture that last week was painfully revealed.

The Biden administration miserably failed to plan for a post-withdrawal Afghanistan. That can be true, and it can also be true that staying longer with the same posture would not have yielded better long-term prospects for the Afghans once we left. It can also be true that alarming headlines were unavoidable; they are the natural accompaniment to military retreat.

But back in June and July, and even earlier, it was clear that the planning for our post-withdrawal counterterrorism mission was immature. Basics of the scope and scale of our air support to the Afghan government? Even more immature.

Let’s review some of the reporting from that time period, keeping in mind this is coverage from publications no one would consider hostile to the administration.

On June 10, The Hill noted that while the administration assured us of its ability to check the terrorist threat, specifics on the plan for doing so did not yet exist:

…U.S. officials have insisted the military will be able to keep terrorism threats in check through what’s known as over-the-horizon operations, or those launched from outside the country. But plans for exactly how those operations will work and where those troops could be based are still being crafted. The United States does not have any basing agreements with Afghanistan’s neighbors, and various geopolitical concerns, such countries’ relations with Russia, appear to make any such agreements unlikely.

Meanwhile, Department of Defense-friendly publications, often comfortable with rote reporting of lengthy statements from DoD officials, provide a similar impression. On the particulars of our CT strategy, here’s a quote in a Breaking Defense article in June from Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks.

“We’re working through all of that right now. The secretary and the chairman and the CENTCOM commander, among others, are looking at exactly what that idealized capability is,” she said. “We have to take into account regional aspects and allied approaches.”

In the article, it’s clear that essential details remained up in the air barely a month before the United States vacated Bagram. That same article gently hints at a similar status for the finer points of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO’s) continued support to the Afghans, for which, it said, “the details remain sketchy.”

Beyond the lack of information on the counterterrorism mission in the Breaking Defense article, the Biden administration suggests it intended to support the Afghan government and military through a distinct, non-counterterrorism air campaign. The article also noted U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised the United States and its allies would keep funding the Afghanistan Security Forces.

It’s unclear as we reactively bomb the Taliban on their march to victory if that pledge to craft a plan ever materialized into an actual one. One might be skeptical that it did, given that the administration continues to prevaricate as to whether air support will even continue after the end of this month.

The lack of planning created some awkward moments not only with NATO leadership, but also in Biden’s meeting with Afghan leader Ashraf Ghani in late July, barely a month before our formal departure. A Defense One article noted: “None of the questions about how the United States will support the Afghan government after September is likely to be answered when President Biden meets President Ashraf Ghani at the White House on Friday.”

It was obvious then that not only were few details worked out, but that they would remain unresolved as we stumbled towards the exits. Worryingly, that same article highlights the challenges our intelligence platforms will have sustaining in-country networks: “One of the top issues officials still need to figure out is how America can listen for terrorist plots to strike U.S. territory without people on the ground. Defense officials told Congress last month that they do not have a plan to collect intelligence after the withdrawal, and are still working to secure agreements with nearby countries to either allow overflight or host American assets.”

That nugget is critically important because the Biden administration plan to take potshots at terrorist groups from the sky requires networks of sources on the ground willing to work with us. Put very simply, someone has to drop the sensor that guides the drones towards the target. Captured in another Defense One piece, that lack of specifics from DoD on very basic elements of the strategy was enough to alarm a number of members of Congress back in May.

“I feel sorry for you because you’re being asked very specific questions about how you’re going to do things…from an audience that’s incredibly skeptical, that doesn’t believe you can do them,” Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, was quoted as saying in a hearing.

That same round of questioning revealed another unappreciated failure on behalf of the administration. They decoupled the withdrawal timeline from their regional negotiations for a post-withdrawal presence. The Defense One article notes:

[Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, in a hearing] asked officials to commit to not fully withdraw from Afghanistan until access, basing, and overflight agreements are locked in with other countries in the region. But David Helvey, acting assistant defense secretary for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said the withdrawal is separate from the effort to obtain agreements with other nations to keep assets in the area.

One doesn’t have to argue for a perpetual presence to recognize that more aggressively linking our withdrawal to regional agreements on basing, overflight permissions, and other cooperation could have led to more favorable terms for the United States.

To the administration’s credit, they eventually did lock in some of the very elemental details of our approach, even if the results are not comforting. Biden’s team failed to secure basing agreements in any of Afghanistan’s neighbors, but did convince one country to grant us overflight permission for our drones to go after terrorists: Pakistan.

However, those drones and our other aircraft are relegated to taking off from bases far afield in the Middle East, cutting down exponentially on their utility. As for anything but the broadest contours of our air support to the Afghan government, as you can see from the headlines day-to-day, that’s anyone’s guess.

That the decrepit state of planning in the leadup to a known and announced withdrawal deadline persists so late in the game is unforgivable given the lives and treasure expended in Afghanistan. I don’t expect the American people to get deeply invested in the country’s affairs again, nor should we return to the era of color-coded threats and experts on TV spouting the latest acronym for some regional terrorist group.

But given the alarming incompetence of this administration, it is incumbent upon the American people to pay attention to Afghanistan again until a credible plan takes shape. As the twentieth anniversary of 9/11 approaches, we owe ourselves that much.

"While The Left Was Busy Charging Conservatives As Radicals, Afghanistan Fell To Real Terrorists","Stephen Colbert implied to his viewers Monday night that the U.S. would be better off to focus its efforts on fighting the Americans associated with the January 6 Capitol riot than murderous, women-hating terrorists in the Middle East.

“We’ve had troops there for 20 years. They fought, they sacrificed, their family sacrificed so that we wouldn’t have a terrorist attack in America planned in a foreign country. Why should our soldiers be fighting radicals in a civil war in Afghanistan? We’ve got our own on Capitol Hill,” Colbert said, which was met with laughter and applause from the audience.

While Colbert's commentary, as usual, is just warmed-over Pelosi-speak with an invisible veneer of ""comedy,"" it's also revealing about liberalism: They do believe the War on Terror should not end but be transferred to domestic politics, with Trump voters treated like Al Qaeda. https://t.co/jJ9O3j1XJ5 — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) August 17, 2021

Filmmaker Michael Moore, who openly celebrated the decline of white people following the release of census data, also made the faux comparison on Twitter Monday night.

“Their Taliban, our Taliban, everybody’s got a Taliban,” he wrote above the picture depicting Capitol rioters and Middle East terrorists. “They’re at their best when they confiscate the halls of power.”

Their Taliban, our Taliban, everybody’s got a Taliban. They’re at their best when they confiscate the halls of power. pic.twitter.com/Wi8fMSz7nx — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) August 17, 2021

Colbert and Moore do not try to mask their true mission to keep Americans’ focus off of the world and onto domestic political enemies but couldn’t the same be said if you turned their “argument” on its head? While Democrats aided by the corporate media focused on drudging up fake radicalism in the U.S., a global crisis and terrorism unfurled beneath their very noses.

For months, Democrats slandered Republicans as domestic terrorists and insurrectionists who wanted to kill democracy. They orchestrated a second impeachment against former President Donald Trump based on the events on January 6. When that failed, they moved their political sights to the partisan January 6 commission.

The intelligence community made the same mistake. On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security released a National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin stating that “through the remainder of 2021, racially- or ethnically-motivated violent extremists (RMVEs) and anti-government/anti-authority violent extremists will remain a national threat priority for the United States.”

“These extremists may seek to exploit the emergence of COVID-19 variants by viewing the potential re-establishment of public health restrictions across the United States as a rationale to conduct attacks. Pandemic-related stressors have contributed to increased societal strains and tensions, driving several plots by domestic violent extremists, and they may contribute to more violence this year,” the bulletin reads.

Underneath the “national threat priority” is a warning that “foreign terrorist organizations continue efforts to inspire U.S.-based individuals susceptible to violent extremist influences.”

In June, the White House announced in “fact sheet“ about terrorism that classified “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists who advocate for the superiority of the white race” are the top domestic terror threat facing the U.S. today.

No matter how wrong their predictions about violence related to white supremacy were after the Capitol riot, intelligence and security agencies repeatedly issued warnings about potential threats for President Joe Biden’s inauguration, a random day in March, and the Tulsa Race Massacre centennial commemoration events, and more.

During that time frame, intelligence communities were also wrongly predicting that it would take the Taliban at least a few months to take over Afghanistan as opposed to over the one weekend it actually took for the group to regain control.

While the left and our intelligence agencies were busy charging conservatives as radicals, Afghanistan fell to real terrorists and launched the world into yet another global crisis. It’s not fair to American taxpayers that trillions of dollars were spent on propping up a decades-long mission that ultimately crumbled in mere days after Biden’s team failed to execute a strategic exit, but it’s also not fair for Americans to be hounded by the administration and those in power because they don’t hold the same political beliefs the machine demands.",https://thefederalist.com/2021/08/17/while-the-left-was-busy-charging-conservatives-as-radicals-afghanistan-fell-to-real-terrorists/,2021-08-17
"Big Tech Oligarchs Won’t Punish Terrorists, So Who Will?","While corporate media publish stories defending Big Tech’s compliance in allowing terrorists to operate on their sites, others have noted the hypocrisy it takes to ban the leader of a free country from the platform and then turn a blind eye to murderous terrorists who use the technology to accomplish their goals.

Just a few months after Twitter, Facebook, and other Big Tech companies banded together to ban President Donald Trump, more than 40 GOP House members introduced legislation aimed at using sanction law to force Silicon Valley giants to ban foreign terrorist groups from their platform.

At the time, the bill’s cosponsors such as Reps. Andy Barr, Jim Banks, and Joe Wilson made it clear that the double-standard held by tech oligarchs was allowing anti-American groups to spread propaganda and fundraise for their causes without penalty.

“U.S. law gives big tech a free pass to provide platforms to terrorist groups and dictators,” Barr told Fox News in March. “Social media companies should not provide a vehicle for terrorist groups like ISIS to raise money or for dictators like the Ayatollah of Iran to spread propaganda.”

President Trump was kicked off social media, but we have state sponsors of terrorism propagating freely on here.

⁰Thanks to @RepAndyBarr, we have a bill that would fix this double standard and hold Big Tech accountable. https://t.co/ig6uMHr6pY — Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) March 2, 2021

Due to outdated sanctions laws, social media platforms can provide services to terrorists & rogue regimes with American blood on their hands. This is unacceptable & is why I cosponsored this important initiative with 40+ of my @RepublicanStudy colleagues https://t.co/NCxwHSujdh — Joe Wilson (@RepJoeWilson) March 2, 2021

It is unclear, however, if the bill will resurface in light of the Taliban’s recent takeover in Afghanistan.

“It is embarrassing that the same American social media company that banned a sitting U.S. President from its platform is allowing the Taliban spokesman to have an account on their platform to spread propaganda, fundraise and recruit terrorists,” Barr, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told The Federalist. “That is why Congress must immediately pass my legislation to close the loophole allowing for social media companies to circumvent sanctions laws and provide their services to terrorists.”

As it stands now, the bill would “require the president to implement regulation that will treat social media platforms just like the bank and insurance companies — they cannot provide a service to a sanctioned individual or entity.” President Joe Biden’s lack of action and regard for the crisis in Afghanistan, however, raises questions about his and Democrats’ willingness to act in the technology sector.

It also raises questions about whether Big Tech companies would comply with any push to censor or deplatform murderous terrorists who hate Christians and women. Twitter has already decided to give a Taliban spokesman a platform on its website even though the terrorist group continues to ravage Afghanistan.

When asked why Twitter allowed the violent group’s propaganda and misinformation on its website after banning Trump for fears of “further incitement of violence,” a spokesman told The Federalist that the company will not act until it feels its policies have been violated.

“The situation in Afghanistan is rapidly evolving and we’re witnessing people in the country using Twitter to seek help and assistance. Twitter’s top priority is keeping people safe, and we remain vigilant. We will continue to proactively enforce our rules ad review content that may violate Twitter Rules, specifically policies against glorification of violence and platform manipulation and spam,” the statement said.

Facebook, which also took steps to ban Trump in January and keep his ban in place for years, and which uses fake “fact-checks” to filter dissenting information off its site, claims it has a team of people dedicated to monitoring and removing Taliban content.

“The Taliban is sanctioned as a terrorist organization under US law and we have banned them from our services under our Dangerous Organisation policies. This means we remove accounts maintained by or on behalf of the Taliban and prohibit praise, support, and representation of them,” a Facebook spokesman told the BBC.

Reports indicate, however, that the Facebook-owned WhatsApp was used by the Taliban to alert residents of the capital city of Kabul to their takeover. The terrorist group also used the Big Tech site to create doxing hotlines and emergency broadcast systems without any apparent penalties from Facebook.

“Twitter banned President Trump to sway the 2020 election—there was no other reason. The Taliban can get away with chanting death to America, killing civilians, and instituting Sharia law. So long as they don’t go after Section 230 protections, they’ll be fine. Twitter is morally bankrupt,” Banks told The Federalist.

"After Afghanistan, No More Moral Blackmail From Failed Interventionists","Days after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which was initially sold as a necessary pre-emptive effort to secure deadly weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein planned to use against the American people, National Review ran an op-ed by former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum attacking everyone on the right who opposed the war as “unpatriotic conservatives.”

In the nearly two decades since it was published, the column has become something of a Rosetta Stone for deciphering the underlying motivations and mindset of the most ardent proponents of the idea that stable democracies can be imposed by military force from the top down. Like an insect captured in amber, Frum’s essay is a near-perfect specimen of the neoconservative id, equal parts delusion and sanctimony.

Frum attacked legendary conservative columnist Robert Novak for correctly predicting that America’s foray into Afghanistan would be a “futile slaughter”; he attacked Pat Buchanan for correctly predicting that America’s military might wouldn’t be enough to overcome its ignorance of Afghanistan’s culture and history; and he characterized the entire movement of conservatives who opposed the neoconservative plan to democratize the world through military conquest as Vichy apologists whose sole aim was to stand up for terrorist suicide bombers.

After tarring war opponents as Nazi collaborators, Frum transitioned to tarring anyone who opposed open borders and unchecked immigration as racist relics pining for the return of the KKK. “They began by hating neoconservatives,” Frum wrote. “They came to hate their party and this president. They have finished by hating their country.”

“War is a great clarifier,” Frum concluded. “The paleoconservatives have chosen—and the rest of us must choose too. In a time of danger, they have turned their backs on their country. Now we turn our backs on them.”

Frum, who was sent packing from his perch at the American Enterprise Institute for his refusal to do much of anything in exchange for his six-figure sinecure there, was right about one thing: war is a great clarifier.

We Won Afghanistan, Then Lost It

Take Afghanistan, for example. Although the post-9/11 invasion of the country was presented to the American public as necessary to take down al Qaeda and its then-leader Osama bin Laden for their roles in perpetrating the worst attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor, the mission quickly shifted to nation-building and democracy-exporting. By December of 2001, the Taliban–which had harbored al Qaeda in Afghanistan—had been routed, and bin Laden had escaped through the mountains into Pakistan.

In his State of the Union address in 2002, President George W. Bush all but claimed total military victory in Afghanistan.

“In four short months, our nation has comforted the victims, begun to rebuild New York and the Pentagon, rallied a great coalition, captured, arrested, and rid the world of thousands of terrorists, destroyed Afghanistan’s terrorist training camps, saved a people from starvation, and freed a country from brutal oppression,” Bush stated.

At that point, the military mission in Afghanistan should have concluded. But by 2004, the mission to destroy the terrorists responsible for 9/11 had morphed into a mission to export and establish Western-style liberal democracy not just in Afghanistan, but in Iraq, too.

“As long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny, despair, and anger, it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of America and our friends. So America is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater Middle East,” Bush told Congress in 2004. “We also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater Middle East, where freedom is rare. Yet it is mistaken, and condescending, to assume that whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and self-government.”

The subtext of Bush’s address was no different than the overt charge leveled by Frum: if you opposed the bait-and-switch from defeating terrorists to nation-building all over the Middle East, either because you believed it be contrary to the purpose of the military or you believed it was futile and doomed to failure, you were racist and xenophobic.

Let’s Just Try It and See What Happens

Bush’s sentiments were echoed more eloquently by the late Charles Krauthammer in a speech delivered to the American Enterprise Institute in February of 2004. Krauthammer’s remarks, entitled “Democratic Realism,” extolled the virtues of democracy promotion by force, and scoffed at the idea that a liberal Western democracy in a tribal nation like Afghanistan with no history whatsoever of secular, representative government would do anything but flourish.

“Realists have been warning against the hubris of thinking we can transform an alien culture because of some postulated natural and universal human will to freedom,” Krauthammer acknowledged. “And they may yet be right. But how do they know in advance?”

When he then asked during his speech where it is written that tribal Islamic societies with no sense of national identity akin to the American esprit de corps that unites all people within its borders regardless of color or creed, let alone a tradition of Western rule of law and civic order, are incapable of peaceful, secular democracy, an attendee at the dinner yelled out “the Koran!” Unfazed and apparently oblivious to the possibility that the vacuum created by forcibly deposing Saddam Hussein and other Middle Eastern leaders would lead to Islamists throughout the Middle East deposing their own governments, slaughtering Christians and apostate Muslims, over-running American diplomatic outposts and murdering American ambassadors, and eventually re-establishing the Islamic caliphate, Krauthammer soldiered on.

Spreading democracy around the globe, Krauthammer argued, was the only way to stop terrorism, and to argue otherwise was idiotic. To oppose the grandiose plans of the neoconservatives and liberal internationalists was, in Krauthammer’s words, “intellectually obsolete” and “politically bankrupt.”

As we all now know, having witnessed the post-invasion debacle in Iraq, the disastrous Arab Spring, the pre-meditated murder of four Americans in Libya, the rise and spread of ISIS, and the ignominious fall of Kabul in Afghanistan, the utopian vision of Frum, Bush, and Krauthammer was a lie. It was a lie that cost two decades, trillions of dollars, and tens of thousands of American lives and limbs, and it was an incalculably destructive lie that was sold by smearing its realist opponents as condescending, racist know-nothings who lacked both the brain and the heart to understand how the new world truly worked.

Smears to Substitute for Having Any Arguments

The fall of Afghanistan should have shocked the architects of its failure back into reality. Instead, they’ve moved on as if nothing much happened at all and are now arguing that America should, nay must, allow tens or even hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees into America immediately.

Being wrong means never having to say you’re sorry and being wrong about every failed foreign policy endeavor of this century apparently means you get to blather your way past America’s worst defeat since Vietnam so you can instead talk about the need for open borders. The solution for failing to export American democracy to Afghanistan, you see, is to import Afghanistan into America.

Wouldn’t you know it, the same arguments and epithets deployed against opponents of America’s failed wars are now being deployed against opponents of unchecked immigration. Moral blackmail is the stock-in-trade of the failed internationalist.

Are you concerned that people posing as refugees might be terrorists intent on killing Americans on U.S. soil? You’re a racist. Are you worried that the same government and immigration system that allowed the 19 9/11 hijackers entry to the United States might not be competent to judge who is and who is not a security threat? You’re a xenophobe.

Do you think maybe it is time for the U.S. government to focus on what is best for American citizens rather than what is best for Afghans, or Syrians, or Libyans, or Iraqis? You’re probably a Jim Crow fanatic who wants segregated water fountains. Do you think the family of the current president, via their shady business deals with corrupt oligarchs beholden to America’s enemies across the globe, might be getting rich by manipulating the president’s foreign policy to enrich themselves? Well, you’re obviously a Russian stooge.

A Projection of Their Own Guilt

The same people who tried to morally blackmail you into supporting a failed Forever War in Afghanistan—the ones who declared that you were either on board with the new international interventionist imperative or you were with the terrorists—are now trying to morally blackmail you into supporting open borders with Afghanistan and every other country that America’s incompetent elites thought they could turn into Stepford if only they invaded it hard enough. In truth, the entire foundation of the Washington establishment’s failed foreign policy is its members’ own feelings of guilt.

They felt guilty that Afghanistan looked like an awful place to live, so they set about rebuilding the country in their own image, complete with gender equity courses and lectures on how the predominantly Muslim citizens of the country need to be more like their secular Western counterparts.

They felt guilty about what they spent 20 years doing in Afghanistan—falsely offering hope of an eternal American safety net, constructed and maintained not with their own blood, sweat, and tears, but with those of enlisted American military men and women scoffed at and mocked by the smart set—so you must accept the risk posed by a terrorist who pretended to be a refugee to get across the nation’s increasingly non-existent southern border.

They feel guilty about their wealth and privilege (not guilty enough to give that wealth or privilege to anyone else, of course), so you must accept the lower wages that are the obvious result of inflating the labor supply while depressing demand through job-crushing progressive economic policy.

Triumph of Denial Above Experience

These concerns about the runaway costs of interventionism, however, are based firmly in reality. Take the story of an Afghan interpreter told in “Outlaw Platoon,” the spectacular war memoir by Sean Parnell, who served as a combat platoon leader in one of the most violent parts of Afghanistan.

In his book, Parnell details how one of the Afghan interpreters in his platoon, a man who had been thoroughly “vetted” and given access to some of the Army’s closest held secrets, helped engineer an improvised explosive attack that killed one of Parnell’s troops, Cpl. Jeremiah S. Cole, and seriously injured four others. That interpreter, who went by the name Yusef, also arranged for the murder of his counterpart Abdul so Yusef would have total access to all sensitive information, such as troop movements and attack plans, which he then passed along to America’s enemies.

“Knowing where Abdul had been going and the road he had used to get there, Yusef’s tip had allowed the insurgents to establish an ambush in time to catch Abdul on his way back to Bermel from his family’s house,” Parnell writes. “With Abdul dead, Yusef knew he would be promoted to head interpreter.”

“We’d gone through our year in country, judging these Afghans through the prism of our own value systems, never fully grasping what we were up against,” Parnell concluded.

Earlier this week, Parnell shared that story on Tucker Carlson’s primetime show on Fox News. Media Matters immediately responded by slicing and dicing the transcript of Parnell’s appearance to smear him as a racist for believing, based on his own personal experience with a vetted Afghan who murdered one of his brothers in arms, that America could not properly vet the thousands of Afghans wishing to immigrate to America.

The President Who Wouldn’t Be Morally Blackmailed

Like one of those old magic eye posters that contained images hidden among visual white noise, once you see the American ruling elite’s reflex to resort to moral blackmail to win an argument, you can never unsee it. Every policy, every argument, every talking point asserts that you are a racist and a bad person if you believe America’s government should first and foremost protect American citizens. This is a fun game for the failed foreign policy establishment, because they reap all the benefits of using Americans’ blood and money to pump up their self-esteem while bearing precisely none of the costs.

One of the primary reasons this cadre of credentialed incompetents loathed former president Donald Trump is because, as a secular, thrice-married New York billionaire, he was impervious to the moral blackmail that had worked like a charm on everyone else for over a decade. He didn’t much care if they called him racist for wanting to secure the border and put an end to open borders. He didn’t care if they called him heartless for wanting to shut down immigration from “sh-thole countries” to preserve the wages of American workers. And he didn’t care if they called him stupid for refusing to go along with their plans for forever wars all around the globe.

For a time, America had a president who wouldn’t be bullied into doing things that weren’t in America’s national security interests. They hated him for it, and it’s why they spent every waking moment for four years, including two impeachments, desperately trying to throw him out of office.

Moral blackmail only works when the target cares what the blackmailer thinks about him. America’s interventionist elites have publicly failed in the most spectacular way possible, with the evidence of their failures playing on repeat on television for all the world to see.

Breaking their hold on power from here on out is simple: stop caring what they think, and stop caring what they say about you. Their ideas are disastrous and their rhetoric—that anyone who disagrees with them is a racist traitor—is toxic in a society built on free expression. The architects of the nation-building policies from Afghanistan to Iraq are failures and should be treated with the same disdain reserved for flat earthers or bloodletters.

Do you want to prevent the next Iraq or Afghanistan or Libya or Syria from being foisted on the American public at the cost of who knows how many decades, lives, or trillions of dollars? Stop giving them an inch. Stop kowtowing to their moral blackmail. Start telling them no.

How U.S. Focus On Afghanistan Helped China Become Our No. 1 Threat,"The fiasco in Afghanistan should, by itself, bring a reckoning for the professionals who assured us it was a worthy effort. It won’t.

We witnessed the sudden, embarrassing end to a misbegotten nation-building effort killing more than 2,443 American soldiers and costing some $2.3 trillion in expenditures for warfighting, civil works projects, and the now non-existent Afghan national army — not to mention veterans’ health costs.

The two biggest national security challenges of the post-Cold War era — China and the response to 9/11 — have been gravely mishandled by America’s defense and foreign policy elite. America and its allies are now in a position of extreme vulnerability because of their gross incompetence. The Chinese Communist Party leadership under General Secretary Xi Jinping cannot help but view American capabilities as weak and its leadership as craven. Taiwan, and by extension, Japan, are in China’s crosshairs.

This danger will only begin to ebb when the United States successfully reverses a Chinese gain, shattering its aura of inevitability — something akin to the invasion of Grenada in 1983, which marked the first reversal of a Soviet bloc acquisition during the Cold War.

How did we get to our present state? What were the main policy forks where a more honest national security establishment could have taken a different path?

The beginning was with President Nixon’s opening to China in 1972, as he sought to wind down U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War while deepening and formalizing the Sino-Soviet rift that started in 1956.

U.S. Reaction to Tiananmen Square

China’s Communist Party leadership ordered the crushing of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in June 1989. During his campaign for president in 1992, then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton sharply criticized President George H.W. Bush for being soft on China in the wake of the massacre.

A mountain of strategic campaign donations from Chinese interests and a Chamber of Commerce eager to make money in China were all the urging Clinton needed to see things differently. As a result, there was no reevaluation of the American relationship with China in the early 1990s.

In 1990, the gross domestic product of the People’s Republic of China(PRC)was $1,111 billion, compared to the United States’s at $5,963 billion. The relative American economic advantage was just more than five times that of the PRC.

Technology Transfer

It was during the Clinton administration, in the heady days of the American hegemony in the post-Cold War world, that the process of accelerating technology transfer to China began in earnest. In 2000, at the urging of Silicon Valley, the Clinton administration relaxed regulations to allow the People’s Liberation Army to purchase high-speed U.S. computers capable of simulating nuclear explosions — without an export license or security review.

But in many ways, strengthening the PRC had already begun a few years earlier when Western corporations, under the thrall of the emergent Chinese market, began to transfer technology to China as a Chinese precondition for access to their markets. One illustrative example of this was the rise and fall of Lucent Technologies, a spin-off from AT&T, and the subsequent rise of China’s Huawei.

By 1999, Lucent was the world’s largest telecommunications equipment firm. In 1997, Carly Fiorina, later a candidate for the Republican nomination for president in 2016, was selected to lead Lucent’s global service-provider business, its largest customer segment. Within a year, Lucent consummated six joint ventures in China, transferring technology as the cost of doing business. By 2004, China’s Huawei started taking Lucent’s market share. By 2006, Lucent was gone — merged with France’s Alcatel.

Thus, in one example, the American system’s weakness when confronted with the PRC’s remorselessly mercantilist system can be seen: short-term profits for a business grown with U.S. support for research and development and nurtured in an environment favorable to intellectual property rights, big payoffs in the form of stock options and bonuses to executives, and the collapse of American manufacturing capacity. Elon Musk is relearning this costly lesson with his Tesla China operations today.

Normalizing Trade

In 2000, the U.S. Congress normalized trade with the PRC by approving permanent normal trade relations (PNTR). With an 11-seat majority in the House and a 55-to-45 majority in the Senate, it was mostly Republicans who approved PNTR. Only 15 senators voted against the measure, including eight Republicans. The vote in the House was much closer, 237-197, with 57 Republicans and 138 Democrats voting “no.”

A year later, China joined the World Trade Organization. In 2000, the PRC’s gross domestic product had more than tripled in a decade to $3,661 billion with the U.S. economic output less than doubling to $10,252 billion. America’s economy was now a little less than three times that of China’s.

With the election of George W. Bush in 2000, it looked as though America’s Cold War marriage of convenience with the PRC would be reevaluated. This took on greater urgency after an American surveillance aircraft was rammed in mid-air by a PRC jet fighter on April 1, 2001. The damaged aircraft was subsequently forced down on the PRC’s Hainan Island. The 24 aircrew were released after 10 days while the PRC’s military stripped and disassembled the aircraft, sending it back in pieces three months later.

Responding to the 9/11 Attacks

But soon, al-Qaeda’s 9/11 attack completely occupied the Bush administration’s attention. Any thought of reordering the Sino-American relations was abandoned and would remain so until the 2016 election of Donald Trump.

By 2010, the PRC’s GDP hit $12,291, with the United States at $14,992. China had almost caught up to the United States in economic output, yet with more than four times the population, China remained a relatively poor nation on a per capita basis.

Al-Qaeda’s successful 2001 terror attack required a U.S. response. The Bush administration issued a demarche to the Afghan Taliban that it deliver al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and expel the terror group. It refused. The United States and the United Kingdom then launched Operation Enduring Freedom on Oct. 7, 2001. About 10 weeks later, the Taliban was driven from power and back into the hills and mountains of Afghanistan.

Initially, the U.S. response took the form of a punitive expedition to kill or capture those responsible for 9/11, hitting them in their bases in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, in what should have been the decisive battle at Al-Qaeda’s mountain redoubt at Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan, some seven miles from Pakistan’s tribal territories, al-Qaeda elements exfiltrated through allied lines by negotiating a truce with a local Afghan militia commander. Thus, al-Qaeda remained intact, but was denied its freedom of operation in Afghanistan.

Nation Building vs. Deterring China

It was at this juncture that the project of trying to transform Afghanistan from a pre-modern tribal society into a modern democracy took hold. The fear was that without a stable and friendly central government in Kabul, al-Qaeda would easily return to begin plotting deadly terror attacks as soon as the United States withdrew.

Yet after the Taliban’s rout, would the Afghans, or any other nation or warlord, have risked their own lives to provide safe haven to al-Qaeda? A nation that allows itself to be used as a platform to attack America confers no obligation on America to leave that nation in better shape than it was before the punitive expedition to destroy the threat it hosted.

American mission planners should be under no obligation to occupy and then economically and politically develop terror-hosting nations. This frees resources for more punitive expeditions — a virtuous circle — as well as more dollars for R&D and procurement to deter or defeat China.

Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw makes much the same point in his Aug. 17 Wall Street Journal piece, drawing the distinction between nation-building and maintaining the ability to kill our enemies as they emerge to present a threat to Americans. Crenshaw argues that Americans “became exhausted over the years with the vast sums of money spent and lives lost, seemingly in a futile attempt to build democracy,” and had “a lot of foreign policy options between nation building and giving up.”

In March 2003, fearful of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq using weapons of mass destruction to carry out terror attacks — or lending such weapons to terror groups — the United States invaded Iraq. It began the process of remaking that land and people as well, although in comparison to Afghanistan, Iraq was at least 100 years further along the process of becoming a modern state.

Bush vs. Gore on Nation Building

Here it’s useful to return to 2000 and the second presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.

Bush cited the Somalian intervention as an example of nation-building gone wrong, saying, “It started off as a humanitarian mission then changed into a nation-building mission and that’s where the mission went wrong. The mission was changed. And as a result, our nation paid a price, and so I don’t think our troops ought to be used for what’s called nation-building. I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war.”

Gore harkened back to America’s occupation and rebuilding of Europe and Japan in the post-World War II, early Cold War period to broadly support the concept of nation-building. The preponderance of America’s foreign, defense, and intelligence establishment agreed with Gore, failing to see the vast distinction between rebuilding a modern nation with a highly educated population and rule of law versus the far more daunting task of birthing a modern nation from scratch out of tribal societies owing no allegiance to a distant central government.

Gore’s views represented the views of the national security clerisy. Views beyond the pale were excluded from consideration. Even before 9/11, Bush’s opposition to nation-building would have never had a chance among the permanent officials who would have been tasked with implementation. It’s not in the foreign policy blob’s cultural DNA.

Thus, from the fall of the Taliban in late 2001 to its triumphant and chaotic return almost 20 years later, we temporized in Afghanistan. But while we borrowed and spent $2.3 trillion, the Chinese modernized their military, vastly enlarged their nuclear weapons arsenal, and extended their reach, both in the South China Sea and abroad, with extensive predatory infrastructure projects in strategic locations. By 2020, China’s GDP was $24,143 billion, eclipsing American output at $20,933 billion.

Had our Afghan adventure been limited to punitive strikes, saving $2 trillion, it’s possible that an additional $500 billion might have been invested in military R&D and procurement, rebuilding the Navy, bolstering missile defense, and developing entirely new capabilities. Chinese adventurism would have been easier to deter. Instead, a large-scale war is more probable than the elites who brought us Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and others would like to admit.

Why Won't The Pentagon Name The Terrorists Its Drone Strikes Allegedly Killed?,"It’s been days since the Pentagon first announced it conducted a drone strike in response to the ISIS-K suicide bomb attack that killed 13 American service members, but the names of the reportedly “high-profile” terrorists the Pentagon claimed to have taken out in the operation have yet to be released.

U.S. Central Command originally touted the “over-the-horizon counterterrorism operation” as having successfully killed one “ISIS-K planner.” Later, the U.S. Department of Defense clarified that two terrorist “planners and facilitators” reportedly died as a result of the operation and a third was wounded.

Subsequent news reports indicated that the U.S. strike had killed 10 family members, seven of whom were children. The Pentagon pledged to investigate these civilian deaths, but has since said nothing on the matter.

It didn’t take long for the corporate press to publish the names of the dead relatives of “a former interpreter who had been seeking a U.S. special immigrant visa,” but Pentagon press secretary John Kirby adamantly refused to name the terrorists allegedly killed in the drone strike or reveal their potential roles in the deadly explosions that took the lives of 13 U.S. service members.

“The fact that two of these individuals are no longer walking on the face of the Earth, that’s a good thing,” Kirby said. “It’s a good thing for the people of Afghanistan, and it’s a good thing for our troops and our forces at that airfield.”

The Pentagon and U.S. Central Command did not immediately respond to The Federalist’s request for comment.

The corporate press appeared to take Kirby’s words at face value, and suddenly what should have been one of the biggest revenge stories of the week died out of the news in days. While it is not uncommon for U.S. military operations against terrorists to remain secret until they are completed, it is unusual for the Biden administration to reveal the strike itself while masking just which danger to the U.S. and our citizens they took out.

When former President Donald Trump ordered the killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guard terrorist leader Qasem Soleimani, his administration not only touted the mission as successful but Trump himself also boasted about taking out an anti-American threat as a deterrent to anyone else who might consider targeting the United States.

“Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him,” Trump said. “Under my leadership, America’s policy is unambiguous: To terrorists who harm or intend to harm any American, we will find you; we will eliminate you. We will always protect our diplomats, service members, all Americans, and our allies.”

Biden repeated a similar statement during his few afternoon speeches about Afghanistan. “To those who wish America harm, to those that engage in terrorism against us and our allies, know this: The United States will never rest. We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down to the ends of the Earth, and we will — you will pay the ultimate price,” Biden said.

But his words lack action. Biden has repeatedly refused to accept responsibility for the botched withdrawal operations, service member deaths, and stranded Americans and Afghan allies who are using private endeavors to get back to the United States. His administration’s attempts to downplay which terrorists were killed are anything but a deterrent. They are yet another sign of weakness that can be exploited by the U.S.’s foreign enemies.

Leftist School Boards Group Begs Biden To Use Domestic Terrorism Laws To Target Parents,"The leftist National School Boards Association is begging President Joe Biden to use domestic terrorism laws to target parents who oppose anti-science mask mandates for children and the infiltration of racist curriculum in schools.

In a letter sent on Wednesday, NSBA asked the Biden administration and federal law enforcement to “deal with the growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation occurring across the nation.”

“Now, we ask that the federal government investigate, intercept, and prevent the current threats and acts of violence against our public school officials through existing statutes, executive authority, interagency and intergovernmental task forces, and other extraordinary measures to ensure the safety of our children and educators, to protect interstate commerce, and to preserve public school infrastructure and campuses,” the letter states.

NSBA said local and state law enforcement agencies are already working to “prevent further disruptions to educational services and school district operations,” but that “these threats and acts of violence have become more prevalent” and require assistance from federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and the Secret Service.

“We also request the assistance of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service to intervene against threatening letters and cyberbullying attacks that have been transmitted to students, school board members, district administrators, and other educators,” the letter continues. “As these acts of malice, violence, and threats against public school officials have increased, the classification of these heinous actions could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.”

These agencies, NSBA directed, should use laws designed to target domestic terrorism such as the PATRIOT Act, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the Violent Interference with Federally Protected Rights statute, and the Conspiracy Against Rights statute. The group also requested an executive order “to enforce all applicable federal laws for the protection of students and public school district personnel, and any related measure.”

The organization cites recent “attacks” and “physical threats” against local school board members and other education officials based on what NSBA claims is “propaganda purporting the false inclusion of critical race theory within classroom instruction and

curricula” and anti-mask sentiments as the reason for intervention.

NSBA not only denies that racist teachings plague the nation’s public schools, despite countless reports indicating otherwise, but also claims that “extremist hate organizations” are protesting school board meetings and “inciting chaos.” The NSBA also characterized concerned parents’ attempts to hold school board members accountable through lists as simply “spreading misinformation.”

“These threats and acts of violence are affecting our nation’s democracy at the very foundational levels, causing school board members — many who are not paid — to resign immediately and/or discontinue their service after their respective terms,” the letter states. “Further, this increasing violence is a clear and present danger to civic participation, in which other citizens who have been contemplating service as either an elected or appointed school board member have reconsidered their decision.”

Parents Respond To U.S. Attorney General Labeling Them Terrorists,"Local mother Stacy Langton stood before the Fairfax County School Board in a suburb of the nation’s capital two weeks ago, boldly exposing explicit examples of child porn and pedophilia in library books in area schools, available to children as young as 12 years old.

Langton’s witness ended in mayhem because the school board failed to do something very simple: listen to the stakeholders — and taxpayers — who are parents. Board members rudely interrupted Langton during her two minutes of allotted speaking time and called a hasty recess, a board member later incorrectly claiming that he faced two “exorcisms” by parents praying during the meeting.

“Shame! Shame! Shame!” shouted parents, horrified at the cowardice of the board members.

Now, however, instead of recognizing Langton for the hero that she is for protecting children, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has issued a declaration of war on America’s parents.

“I am directing the Federal Bureau of Investigation, working with each United States Attorney, to … [address] threats against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff,” he wrote in a memo to FBI Director Christopher Wray and the U.S. attorneys generals on Monday night.

Langton, of course, didn’t threaten anyone. But in this war, facts don’t matter.

In just five days, Garland issued that response to a September 29 letter by the National School Boards Association alleging, incredulously: “As these acts of malice, violence, and threats against public school officials have increased, the classification of these heinous actions could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.”

Neither the school board association nor Garland mentioned the word “parents,” as if to acknowledge us, even in an attack, is to validate us. But we know. It’s now the United States vs. America’s parents.

https://twitter.com/AsraNomani/status/1443831824720056320?s=20

Parents Taking a Stand

The attacks are clearly directed at the thousands of parents who have valiantly overcome their own fears of retaliation, public speaking, and confrontation to advocate in defense of their children, from Beaverton, Oregon, to South Kingstown, Rhode Island, only to be made a caricature by media outlets from NBC News to CNN and Saturday Night Live.

There is one response parents must have: stand strong in defense of America’s children. Be unapologetic. Reject violence and threats of violence, as you always do. And do not be intimidated, silenced, shamed, or bullied.

Since the COVID pandemic shut schools down in the spring of 2020, school board officials have frustrated parents across the country with mixed messages on reopening schools and diverting attention and taxpayer money to virtue signaling, renaming schools, and promoting divisive activist causes. We have been muted, silenced, and reprimanded.

I know because all of that has happened to me since I first spoke to my school board in early June 2020. As I tried to get the last words of my statement out during public participation this past spring, the school board president yelled at me, “Go to your seat!”

Yet, we persist. Across the country, parents are more empowered than probably at any time in America’s history. At Parents Defending Education, an organization that a group of moms and others started earlier this year, we have tallied more than 160 parent groups that have organically sprung up across the country.

That is a threat to two special-interest groups: teachers unions and the politicians they prop up.

Questionable Contract

Importantly, the issues we raise before school boards are very close to home for even a political appointee such as Garland. Over the past two weeks, in Fairfax County, Virginia, parents have been challenging a $2.4 million contract with Boston-based Panorama Education.

The contractor will soon begin submitting all county students to a “social and emotional learning screener” unless parents fill out an “opt-out” form (the deadline is this Friday, October 8). Since its founding by two Yale students a few years ago, Panorama Education has built a booming business with school boards, gaining rich contracts collecting data on students with surveys asking questions like: “During the past week, how often did you feel sad?”

Garland’s daughter is married to a co-founder of Panorama Education, Xan Tanner. Parents have raised the concern with the school board that controversial Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is an investor in Panorama Education, sparking concern among parents that the company is data mining their children’s most intimate emotions. The company depends on school boards to approve its multimillion dollars of contracts – without parent dissent.

Attorney General Chills Free Speech

Garland’s memo may chill free speech – and parental opposition to waste, fraud, corruption, and incompetence by school boards. His association of parents with “domestic terrorism” is not only a slap in the face to sincere parents, it is — tragically — a cruel insult to victims of terrorism around the world. As parents, we are accidental activists in service to our children and our country, rejecting violence and actual terrorism.

Late Friday, a coalition of parent groups representing 427,000 members sent a letter to the National School Boards Association stating, “Your letter to President Biden is a thinly veiled threat, intended to intimidate into silence and submission the very constituents that your members ostensibly represent.”

Buried in the footnotes of the school board association’s letter, the slanderous charge of “domestic terrorism” was attributed to incidents including these: winery entrepreneur Jon Tigges getting arrested after he yelled at his school board in Loudoun County, Virginia, for prematurely ending public comments; an “unruly crowd” at a Spotsylvania, Virginia, board meeting; and protesters who dared to “disrupt” a school board in Poway Unified School District, California.

Launching a war on parents is a very serious mistake, not only politically but morally. It is a parent who nurses a child through the night, long after the school bell has rung. Misguided policymakers, politicians, and school board members need to stop making an enemy of parents. Issue a ceasefire. Apologize. And listen.

At Parents Defending Education, we opened an online portal at our website, so parents could send a message to the Justice Department, and parents flooded the portal with 1,508 emails to the Justice Department in the first four hours.

A Mom’s Message

Because of her courage here in Fairfax County, Langton’s issue of child porn and pedophilia in schools has emerged as a national issue, with parents planning to return to the school board this Thursday evening to protest the porn and pedophilia in school library books. Despite the threat by Garland, Langton is undeterred and readying her homemade sign for the Thursday rally with a simple message to school board members: “Resign FairfaXXX.”

Langton won’t be allowed to speak at the school board meeting Thursday, as speakers were chosen by lottery and there are new restrictions on how often a community member can speak. But she will be there, cheering on the other parents. “I won’t be cowed,” she said.

Her message to parents is also simple: “Stand up, parents. Don’t be intimidated.”

Ridiculous AP ‘Fact Check’ Claims School Boards Association Didn’t Ask Biden To Label Parents As ‘Domestic Terrorists’,"The Associated Press issued a deceptive “fact check” claiming that the National School Boards Association did not ask the Biden administration to label parents who oppose certain school policies as “domestic terrorists” even though it did.

“Contrary to false claims circulating online, the National School Boards Association didn’t ask President Joe Biden to label protesting parents ‘domestic terrorists,’ and there’s no indication Biden or the Justice Department called them terrorists, either,” the AP wrote.

NSBA sent a letter last week asking President Joe Biden to use domestic terrorism laws to target parents who oppose anti-science mask mandates for children and the infiltration of racist curriculum in schools. In the letter, the NSBA clearly demands that Biden and his team begin an investigation into “acts of malice, violence, and threats against public school officials” by parents which they say, with the right manipulation from the administration, can be classified as “equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.”

The government, NSBA demanded, should use laws designed to target domestic terrorism such as the PATRIOT Act, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the Violent Interference with Federally Protected Rights statute, and the Conspiracy Against Rights statute. The group also requested an executive order “to enforce all applicable federal laws for the protection of students and public school district personnel, and any related measure.”

In light of the letter, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced this week that the FBI would begin working with state attorneys to investigate and combat “a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who participate in the vital work of running our nation’s public schools.”

While multiple education advocates such as Chris Rufo called the letter what it is — a desperate attempt by NSBA to avoid accountability for allowing racist curriculum to be taught and promoted in public schools — the AP said these claims are “false.”

“The organization — the NSBA, for short — is not asking Biden to label parents who protest at school board meetings as terrorists,” the AP wrote.

In a single day, the Biden administration said parents shouldn't be the ""primary stakeholder"" in their children's education and the National School Board Association asked the feds to crack down on anti-critical race theory protests as ""domestic terrorism."" They want your kids. — Christopher F. Rufo ⚔️ (@realchrisrufo) October 1, 2021

Using a series of longwinded statements given to the corrupt corporate media outlet by the NSBA meant to justify and qualify their letter, AP concludes that “Biden has yet to publicly comment on the issue, and there’s no indication he or the Department of Justice has called protesting parents ‘domestic terrorists,’ despite false claims to that effect by social media users.”

School Boards' Gripes About Parents Don't Justify 'Terrorism' Probes,"The National School Boards Association (NSBA) last week begged President Joe Biden to use domestic terrorism laws to target parent protesters who oppose anti-science mask mandates for children and the infiltration of racist curriculum in schools. But the incidents the group listed as proof that “immediate assistance is required to protect our students, school board members, and educators who are susceptible to acts of violence affecting interstate commerce because of threats to their districts, families, and personal safety,” are hardly worth the involvement of federal law enforcement.

In the letter to the Biden administration, the NSBA listed out pages of examples of what it classified as “immediate threats” to the people in and of public schools across the nation. But as Zaid Jilani points out in his Substack article “Rowdy Town Halls Aren’t ‘Domestic Terror,’” the NSBA’s written request for the U.S. Department of Justice, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service “to intervene against threatening letters and cyberbullying attacks” and label these “heinous actions” as “a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes” is unnecessary.

One of the incidents raised by the NSBA occurred at the Marysville School Board meeting in Washington state where protesters against mask mandates for children “banged on windows” and yelled enough to force the gathering into a recess. A handful of the protesters reportedly “surrounded a district official’s car, preventing the driver from leaving” in what one article author characterized as “a violation of democratic principles, one with all-too-familiar overtones of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.”

Other incidents the NSBA listed that occurred in Sarasota, Florida, and San Diego focused on disruptions by protesters but were handled fine by local police fine, and neither produced any arrests.

“One man made a satirical Nazi salute to protest a mask mandate for students at the Birmingham Board of Education. (It’s pretty obvious that the man was protesting what he believed to be authoritarianism and was not, in fact, a neo-Nazi. If you were alive during the Bush years, you saw a million progressive protesters doing similar stuff.)” Jilani wrote.

The NSBA also cited a case where local law enforcement in Norfolk, Virginia, was already reviewing a series of social media threats. The kicker is “the threats appear to be related to typical school violence.”

“The local news has been reporting on this story notes that one teenager recently shot two others at a Virginia high school, an incident that had nothing to do with conservative mobs terrorizing school boards,” Jilani said.

Jilani noted that some of the incidents listed do “include some type of actual physical confrontation” and a couple of arrests, but “none of this even comes close to terrorism or other crimes that would justify the involvement of the FBI, DHS, and DOJ as well as federal prosecutions.”

“Local police have all the resources they need to handle a few disruptive parents,” he wrote.

Despite the weak case NSBA presented for federal involvement, Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the FBI and state attorneys to address “a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who participate in the vital work of running our nation’s public schools.”

On Wednesday, the Associated Press amplified the NSBA’s claims with a false “fact check” simply restating the organization’s intentions to use the Biden administration’s prosecution and law enforcement power to curb parents’ protests.

Biden Admin: Parents Who Oppose Racism Are Domestic Terrorists,"It is no coincidence that the Department of Justice heeded the National School Boards Association’s call for the Biden administration to target parents critical of critical race theory curricula and dubious coronavirus policies in schools by labeling them domestic terrorists and mobilizing the DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The administration’s National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism mandates just such chilling action.

That little-discussed but hugely significant document codifies a War on Wrongthink, demanding that the full weight of the federal government and private-sector allies like Big Tech be brought to bear against dissenters from Biden regime orthodoxy. Consider “pillar four” of the strategy, titled “Confront Long-Term Contributors to Domestic Terrorism.” It reads in part:

…tackling the threat posed by domestic terrorism over the long term demands substantial efforts to confront the racism that feeds into aspects of that threat. We are, therefore, prioritizing efforts to ensure that every component of the government has a role to play in rooting out racism and advancing equity for under–served communities that have far too often been the targets of discrimination and violence. This approach must apply to our efforts to counter domestic terrorism by addressing underlying racism and bigotry.

On day one of the Biden presidency, the administration issued an executive order lamenting America’s “systemic racism.” In response, it called for the administration to pursue “an ambitious whole-of-government equity agenda.”

It also revoked the Trump administration’s executive order barring training of federal employees in “anti-American race … stereotyping and scapegoating” — an implicit reference to critical race theory and related critiques of America. This revocation could be seen as at minimum a tacit endorsement of CRT, as could the Biden administration’s dissolution of the Trump administration’s 1776 Commission, a group whose work could be seen as challenging CRT.

Administration Backtracked For Now

A Department of Education proposal in April represented a more direct demonstration of the Biden administration’s pro-CRT position. The rule would have prioritized grants for American history and civics programs that “incorporate racially, ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse perspectives,” citing as examples The New York Times’ 1619 Project and “anti-racist” par excellence Ibram X. Kendi.

The rule promoted “culturally responsive teaching,” which Ethics and Public Policy Center senior fellow Stanley Kurtz describes as an “ultra-woke and utterly politicized pedagogy derived from Critical Race Theory.” That rule was ultimately shelved amid a massive backlash, but the administration’s position was made clear: It fully supports critical race theory.

It stands to reason that the Biden administration would see support of CRT as consistent with its “equity” agenda, and therefore opposition to CRT as an impediment to it. “Equity” is a concept firmly rooted in the “anti-racism” of the likes of Kendi. Kendi asserts that “Antiracist ideas argue that racist policies are the cause of racial inequities.” CRT is therefore an anti-racist idea. To critical race theorists, then, opposing them is racist.

Whites As Greatest Domestic Threat

If, as the Biden administration argues, countering domestic terror, the greatest threat of which comes from white supremacism, requires “addressing underlying racism and bigotry,” as the national strategy says; and opposition to CRT is racist; then targeting CRT critics becomes a national security imperative.

With respect to the Chinese coronavirus, the Biden administration’s purported counter-terror strategy quotes from a March 2021 intelligence community domestic violent extremism (DVE) threat assessment noting that “Newer sociopolitical developments—such as narratives of … conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic … will almost certainly spur some DVEs to try to engage in violence this year.”

That assessment followed a January 2021 national terrorism advisory bulletin noting that in 2020 “domestic violent extremists” were motivated by “anger over COVID-19 restrictions” and that “Threats of violence against critical infrastructure … increased in 2020 with violent extremists citing misinformation and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 for their actions.”

Subsequently, an August 2021 national terrorism advisory bulletin warned that:

…anti-government/anti-authority violent extremists will remain a national threat priority for the United States. These extremists may seek to exploit the emergence of COVID-19 variants by viewing the potential re-establishment of public health restrictions across the United States as a rationale to conduct attacks.

The bulletin cited “continued, non-specific calls for violence on multiple online platforms associated with DVE ideologies or conspiracy theories on…alleged reinstatement, and responses to anticipated restrictions relating to the increasing COVID cases.”

Questioning the Government Is a Domestic Threat

The Biden administration of course supports more restrictive coronavirus measures generally, and has vowed to combat policies barring universal masking in classrooms — the kind of policy parents have protested nationwide. Its purported counterterror strategy notes that “domestic terrorists” “espouse a range of violent ideological motivations,” including not just racism but “anti-government or anti-authority sentiment.”

The Biden administration apparently believes challenges to school boards on its favored coronavirus policies reflect such anti-government or anti-authority sentiment, as the DOJ memorandum responding to the NSBA argues that it is compelled to act given “Threats against public servants.” The NSBA notes that “groups” are “spreading misinformation that [school] boards are … working to maintain online learning by haphazardly attributing it to COVID-19.”

The Biden strategy calls for “enhancing faith in government and addressing the extreme polarization, fueled by a crisis of disinformation and misinformation … which can tear Americans apart and lead some to violence … Enhancing faith in American democracy demands accelerating work to contend with an information environment that challenges healthy democratic discourse. We will work toward finding ways to counter the influence and impact of dangerous conspiracy theories that can provide a gateway to terrorist violence.”

Seeking to frighten parents into silence by threatening to sic our nation’s most powerful law enforcement bodies on them for challenging critical race theory, or coronavirus policies, would seem to be perfectly consistent with the Biden administration’s “National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.”

Its reach is virtually limitless if dissent from the regime’s agenda constitutes a danger to “democracy.” At minimum, it should be clear that critics of the regime’s CRT ideology, and coronavirus policies, have been classified as threats.

Parents Speak Up, Get Labeled Terrorists

The irony here, in the case of school boards, is that to justify its call for federal protection, the NSBA cites all of two instances where individuals were arrested at school board meetings for their behavior. Those two arrests concerned disgruntled parents at board meetings, one of whom allegedly struck a school official escorting him from the premises, and another of whom reportedly physically threatened someone and resisted arrest.

These acts are unacceptable, and anyone who breaks laws ought to be prosecuted accordingly. But is this the stuff of domestic terrorism?

Otherwise, the NSBA largely substantiates its concerns by flagging a series of disrupted school board meetings, some ending in the face of “angry mobs”; a report of menacing social media posts threatening several schools without any readily discernible connection to school boards and their positions on CRT or Chinese coronavirus policies; and another report that “A resident in Alabama, who proclaimed himself as “vaccine police,” has called school administrators while filming himself on Facebook Live.”

It appears the NSBA actually got this story wrong. “Vaccine police,” according to the link it includes, was “confronting pharmacists in a Missouri Walmart.”

Once again, is this the stuff of domestic terrorism? Is the threat so dire that it demands, as the NSBA called for, the intervention of no less than: the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, National Threat Assessment Center, and U.S. Postal Service, under laws including the Gun-Free School Zones Act, PATRIOT Act, Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, Violent Interference with Federally Protected Rights statute, Conspiracy Against Rights statute, an executive order to enforce all applicable federal laws for the protection of students and public school district personnel, and any related measure?

So far, the Biden administration has only enlisted a subset of these agencies, but perhaps more is to come. One thing is clear: The Biden administration’s War on Wrongthink, masquerading as a domestic counterterrorism mission, will inflict infinitely more terror on America than will loving and impassioned parents concerned about the education and health of their children in the taxpayer-funded schools.

"Garland Admits War On Parents Sprang From NSBA Letter, Not Evidence","Attorney General Merrick Garland admitted on Thursday that the basis for targeting and potentially charging parents concerned about what their children are learning in schools with domestic terrorism was a letter from the National School Boards Association, not real evidence.

“When did you first review the data showing this so-called disturbing uptick?” Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan asked during a House Judiciary hearing on Thursday.

“I read the letter, and we have been seeing over time—” Garland began before Jordan interrupted him.

“So you read the letter? That’s your source?” Jordan asked incredulously. “Is there some study, some effort, some investigation someone did that, said there’s been a disturbing uptick, or you just take the words of the National School Board Association?”

Garland then confirmed it wasn’t until NSBA contacted him that his department began to investigate claims of violence and terrorism.

“Well, the National School Board Association, which represents thousands of school boards and school board members, says that there are these kinds of threats. When we read in the newspapers reports of threats of violence—” Garland said before Jordan interjected again.

“The source for this … was the National School Boards Association letter,” Jordan reiterated before his time expired.

Biden AG Merrick Garland concedes that he started targeting parents for ""possible domestic terrorism"" because the NSBA sent a letter. pic.twitter.com/ZDvhZ6vDzO — The First (@TheFirstonTV) October 21, 2021

The NSBA sent a letter to the Biden administration last month begging federal law enforcement to use domestic terrorism laws to target parents who oppose anti-science mask mandates for children and the infiltration of racist curriculum in schools. The school board organization claimed federal action was warranted to “deal with the growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation occurring across the nation.”

Most of the incident examples the NSBA used to justify intervention by the Biden administration did not escalate to a level that even yielded arrests or charges on the local level, yet Garland quickly directed the FBI and state attorneys to address “a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who participate in the vital work of running our nation’s public schools.”

Multiple state school board associations reported that they were not consulted before the NSBA sent its letter to the Biden administration. While a handful of the state associations simply said they were unaware of the NSBA’s letter until it was published, most state groups condemned the national association’s request to use domestic terrorism laws to target parents and said the protests they’ve experienced have not warranted law enforcement involvement beyond the local and state level.

The Pennsylvania School Boards Association voted unanimously to withdraw from its parent organization in protest of the national organization’s political war on parents.

During his hearing, Garland also confirmed that no one involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot has been charged with “insurrection.”

NSBA Apologizes For Branding Concerned Parents 'Domestic Terrorists',"The National School Boards Association has apologized for a letter that Attorney General Merrick Garland used to target parents as “domestic terrorists.”

“We regret and apologize for the letter,” the NSBA said in a memorandum sent to members on Friday. “To be clear, the safety of school board members, other public school officials and educators, and students is our top priority, and there remains important work to be done on this issue. However, there was no justification for some of the language included in the letter.”

The original letter, publicly sent to Biden administration officials after the organization worked with the Biden administration to craft its language, asked the federal government to take action against parents and citizens who “threaten” or “intimidate” school board officials and education administrators. It said nothing of the reports of some school officials engaging in the same behavior against parents.

“NSBA believes immediate assistance is required to protect our students, school board members, and educators who are susceptible to acts of violence affecting interstate commerce because of threats to their districts, families, and personal safety,” the original letter read. “… As these acts of malice, violence, and threats against public school officials have increased, the classification of these heinous actions could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.”

As many as 20 state school boards have since distanced themselves from the NSBA in backlash against the letter: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming.

Fourteen state school boards, including Pennsylvania’s, said they were not alerted before the NSBA sent the letter. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association voted unanimously last week to exit the NSBA.

“The Pennsylvania School Boards Association was not consulted prior to the letter being sent by the National School Boards Association to President Biden. We were not asked for input nor discussion on its content,” said Annette Stevenson, PSBA’s chief communications officer.

The Georgia School Boards Association said it was “not consulted about this letter, did not provide information to NSBA, and was not informed that the letter was being sent, even though a Georgia school district was used as an example in the letter.” Similarly, the Idaho School Boards Association Executive Board distanced itself from the NSBA’s statement, announcing that, “Had we been asked, we would have readily pointed out the mischaracterization of parents and patrons in our communities as domestic terrorists who merited federal investigation. We want parents and patrons engaged in our public schools — we have sought that for years.”

The NSBA’s initial letter was the basis for Garland’s Oct. 4 announcement that the FBI would investigate what he called “a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff.” He also ordered the bureau to “facilitate the discussion of strategies for addressing threats” between state and local law enforcement.

“The Department takes these incidents seriously and is committed to using its authority and resources to discourage these threats, identify them when they occur, and prosecute them when appropriate,” Garland wrote in a memorandum sent to Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI. “In the coming days, the Department will announce a series of measures designed to address the rise in criminal conduct directed toward school personnel.”

The directive came only five days after the NSBA sent its original letter labeling parents as “domestic terrorists.” When he testified before Congress Thursday, Garland confirmed that the NSBA’s letter was the foundation for his Oct. 4 memorandum.

“Obviously the [school board] letter, which was public and asked for assistance from the Justice Department was brought to our attention” Garland said. “I read about the letter in the news. No one in the White House spoke to me about the memo at all.”

Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley called for Garland’s resignation Friday, calling the attorney general’s use of the FBI to monitor school board meetings unprecedented.

“Merrick Garland mobilized the FBI to intimidate parents without legal basis and, we now know, premised on misinformation he didn’t bother to verify,” Hawley said. “It was a dangerous abuse of authority that has badly compromised the Justice Dept’s integrity and Garland’s. He should resign.”

According to emails obtained by Parents Defending Education, the NSBA collaborated with White House officials weeks before drafting the letter. The emails, reported by The Washington Free Beacon on Thursday, show that the White House reviewed the letter before it was released and knew about specific wording referring to parents at school board meetings as “a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.”

“A $19 million trade association has nothing on a bunch of mad moms,” Nicole Neily, president of Parents Defending Education, said Friday.

At the hearing Thursday, Garland acknowledged his office only started investigating local claims of violence and terrorism after NSBA published its letter. The letter cites no evidence, nor does it explain the categorization of parents as “domestic terrorists.”

House Republicans grilled Garland on his decision to mobilize the FBI against parents.

“It concerns us that [your letter] was issued just five days after the National School Board Association sent a letter to President Biden which referred to concerned parents as the equivalent of ‘domestic terrorists and perpetrators of hate crimes,’” Louisiana Rep. Mike Johnson said. “Given the timing of all this, your memo appears to have been motivated by politics more than any pressing law enforcement need. This is concerning to us and it’s worthy of investigation.”

“A snitch line on parents, started five days after a left-wing political organization asked for it,” Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan said. “If that’s not political, I don’t know what is.”

Biden Admin Gave NSBA President Ed Appointment Two Days After Letter,"The Biden administration and the National School Boards Association have been in hot water since news broke that the two had colluded to use “domestic terrorism” laws to wage a war on parents concerned about school coronavirus policies and left-wing curricula. The plot thickened on Monday with the revelation that the administration rewarded the NSBA’s president with a cushy education appointment just two days after she sent the infamous letter.

Purportedly to “deal with the growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation occurring across the nation,” the NSBA sent a letter to the Biden White House on Sept. 29 begging the president to deploy law enforcement and invoke domestic terrorism laws against concerned parents, including the father of a girl who had allegedly been raped in a school bathroom by a boy in a skirt.

Just two days later on Oct. 1, NSBA President Viola Garcia began her tenure on the National Assessment Governing Board, a pivotal position within the education bureaucracy as the board decides which questions are asked on Nation’s Report Card assessment tests, which help determine federal education policies.

Garcia was one of five board members appointed by Biden’s Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, as The Washington Free Beacon first reported. Biden’s Department of Education kept these appointments hush-hush for nearly two weeks until it finally sent out a press release announcing the appointees on Oct. 13.

The Biden administration appointing Garcia to the plum education post comes immediately after she and her colleagues at the NSBA colluded with the Democrat administration, which raises suspicions about whether the appointment fulfilled a presidential quid pro quo. Emails obtained and released last week by Parents Defending Education through the Freedom of Information Act revealed that the head honchos at the NSBA had actually been working with the Biden White House before the national school board group sent its official letter requesting a federal crackdown on parents, which would have mutually benefited both parties.

In a Sept. 29 email to the board, National School Boards Association CEO Chip Slaven said there had been “talks over the last several weeks with White House staff” who “requested additional information on some of the specific threats, so the letter also details many of the incidents that have been occurring.”

Garcia penned an email to the board on Oct. 2 saying the NSBA had communicated with the White House “for several weeks” to collect examples of parents protesting against local school boards.

“We felt compelled to say something when we started hearing about the threats, harassment, and acts of intimidation at school board meetings,” Garcia wrote one day after beginning her tenure at the National Assessment Governing Board.

Despite most of the incidents the NSBA cited in its letter to justify federal intervention not having escalated to arrests or charges by even local law enforcement, Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the FBI and state attorneys to address “a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who participate in the vital work of running our nation’s public schools,” a spike that Garland later admitted in congressional testimony was based on the bogus NSBA letter, not on real evidence.

In an Oct. 2 email, Garcia attempted to justify her actions, saying the “pattern of threats and violence occurring across state lines and via online platforms” rapidly required “the federal government’s assistance.”

After receiving sharp blowback from parents, conservative media, GOP lawmakers, and state school board associations that condemned the “domestic terrorism” letter and said they had not been consulted or notified about it, the NSBA expressed “regret” for sending it and noted “there was no justification.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/10/25/biden-admin-gave-school-board-organization-president-plum-education-appointment-two-days-after-she-issued-bogus-domestic-terrorism-letter/,2021-10-25
Law Firms That Raced To Defend Terrorists Ignore J6 Defendants,"At least 50 high-powered law firms that went out of their way to defend foreign terrorists in Guantanamo Bay free of charge are nowhere to be found as hundreds of American citizens languish in prison for charges related to entering the U.S. Capitol building during the January 6 riot.

When foreign terrorists, including the accused mastermind who helped plan the 9/11 attack, were being held in the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp, law firms from across the country volunteered to represent them pro bono. Now, nearly 600 Americans face an intense legal battle over their participation in the events of January 6, and these same firms are leaving them defenseless. Not one of the legal firms that assisted Gitmo terrorists have helped any of those charged with ties to January 6.

Getting Out of Guantanamo

In 2009, the American Civil Liberties Union went so far as to create an entire group of lawyers ready to defend Gitmo detainees under the John Adams Project, to show their dedication to ensuring all have a top-notch defense.

John Adams, whose patriotism was proven in his instrumental legal role in helping found the American republic, defended British soldiers after the Boston Massacre in an American courtroom. Although undoubtedly a revolutionary hero, Adams felt convicted that the judicial system cannot be just if everyone doesn’t receive a quality defense. With popular opinion so staunchly against the soldiers, Adams risked his reputation to uphold this principle.

Attorney Steve Schaefer explained to me that a strong legal defense for all accused of crimes is necessary, as it is the only way to reveal the truth of what occurred before the court. If the facts don’t come to light, the American justice system is in jeopardy, as people are at the will of an arbitrary power. Schaefer said, that causes Americans to lose trust in the American experiment, so the importance of quality representation prior to adjudication in court can’t be overstated.

“It’s indispensable to have to have a strong advocacy on behalf of criminal defendants — even if the allegations are unsavory — because our entire process hinges on a protection of the citizen and that the government has to meet the highest burden, which is beyond a reasonable doubt, in order to convict them of a crime,” Schaefer said.

Without a strong criminal defense, the government can take away individual rights without a clear demonstration of the guilt of the accused. The firms who trumpeted the right to a strong defense for everyone charged in the American legal system when it came to Guantanamo Bay are well aware of the need for a competent defense for citizens today, yet they have not allocated any resources to an equal defense for some accused of crimes.

The law firm Wilmer and Hale told The New York Times in 2008 that establishing a proper defense for Gitmo detainees “was about as important as anything we could take on.”

Despite widespread allegations of prosecutorial zealotry and differing standards of prosecution for the January 6 rioters compared to the thousands of rioters across the nation in 2020 who besieged the White House, federal courthouses, police precincts, national symbols, and small businesses, no similar defense fund or coordination has been provided for those charged in the January 6 riot.

‘Gitmo in Washington D.C.’

Julie Kelly, a reporter covering dozens of January 6 defendants since their cases began, said the majority of those who have been charged have no prior experience navigating the legal system. Few have been charged with any crime before in their lives and now must rely on government-provided public defenders because they can’t afford anyone else.

“We have a Gitmo in Washington D.C.,” Kelly told me. “We have a prison that has been used solely to house and detain men arrested and charged — not convicted, just charged with offenses — related to January 6.”

Some of the nonviolent defendants were so misinformed by the FBI that they thought they were being questioned to help them find violent offenders, all while the FBI was gathering evidence against those being questioned, she said.

“These people are being treated in court as domestic terrorists. Dozens of them are held under pre-trial detention orders, which means they don’t even have a chance to make bail,” Kelly noted. “They are considered too dangerous to be let out of jail, awaiting trials which won’t start until the middle of next year at the earliest.”

Capitol rioter Paul Hodgkins’ prosecutor referred to him as a domestic terrorist in his sentencing, and FBI Director Christopher Wray has designated January 6 an act of domestic terrorism. Many who didn’t even know they were doing anything wrong, entering the Capitol as police opened doors for them, face detrimental charges threatening to turn them into convicted felons, revoking their rightr to vote and to own a gun for the rest of their lives.

While corporate media and other establishment institutions have long encouraged pro-bono legal representation of those held at Gitmo, they have discouraged it for those charged in the January 6 riot. Media and political figures argue those charged in the riot were violent insurrectionists seeking to overthrow the government.

However, not a single person at the riot has been charged with inciting insurrection. They have instead been charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, which is the felony charge that the government is adding to mostly misdemeanor cases of trespassing.

The vast majority of those charged with ties to January 6 carried no weapons, harmed no one, vandalized nothing, and stole nothing, according to Kelly. Most walked through the capitol against no resistance at 2:40 p.m., took a selfie, and were out by 3 p.m. These defendants are also being tried in front of a jury in Washington, D.C., a city where more than 92 percent of the voters voted to elect Joe Biden last November.

Destroying Civil Liberties

Civil liberties advocates say the treatment of January 6 defendants reveals an alarming threat to American jurisprudence. Some blame intimidation from well-funded leftist groups for the lack of a competent defense. Lawyers who do exert effort in providing such a defense have been harrassed.

According to NPR, attorney Nabeel Kibria represented one of the first defendants in the investigation to plead guilty, after which point Kibria began facing attacks and death threats 48 hours after her client’s plea deal “from people … who you would think were on a whole different spectrum than what the Bustles [a married couple on trial] are in terms of political ideology or the people of the January 6 riots.”

Firms that consider themselves advocates for the least among us fail to uphold their convictions by abandoning people like Hodgkins. The system of justice that exists in this country, outlined in the Constitution in no uncertain terms, requires a strong defense.

“It is extremely frustrating and heartbreaking to see the Beltway’s legal and judicial system so heavily stacked against these people who have no means to defend themselves,” Kelly said. “And you have no lawyers on the right willing to step up and take these cases either pro bono, or even low bono, to help these people.”

One thing is clear: Those on the left put a lot of work into defending Afghan terrorists a decade ago, touting the need for providing a quality legal defense to those who were least likely to have quality, willing representation. Now, in the hour of need for Americans charged with much lesser crimes than mass murder, the same firms remain silent.

Ohio's School Boards Association Is Latest To Divorce From NSBA,"The Ohio School Boards Association voted to leave the National School Boards Association after the NSBA sent a letter to the Biden administration urging them to use federal law enforcement and “domestic terrorism” laws to target parents who protest at school board meetings.

“The Board of Trustees’ decision was prompted by NSBA’s recent letter to President Joe Biden requesting federal intervention at local school board meetings,” OSBA Chief Executive Officer Rick Lewis confirmed in a statement.

Statement: Ohio School Boards Association trustees vote to leave national school boards group https://t.co/XfPFbuIk1F pic.twitter.com/TN5JEzcn8s — Josh Caplan (@joshdcaplan) October 26, 2021

The Ohio chapter not only condemned the NSBA’s letter as demonstrative of how “out of touch the national association is with the concerns of local school boards and the principle of local control” but also frowned upon the national chapter’s decision not to consult state associations before proceeding.

“We believe in the value of parental and community discussion at school board meetings, and there is tremendous value in allowing and encouraging the public to have meaningful input into the decision-making process,” Lewis said. “However, that participation should not come at the expense of interfering with the board’s ability to conduct its business or subjecting individual board members to threats of violence, abuse, or harassment. But dealing with such interference should be dealt with at the local level, not by federal officials.”

At least 21 states’ school board associations reported that they were not consulted before the NSBA sent its letter to the Biden administration.

Recently released emails obtained by Parents Defending Education through the Freedom of Information Act indicate that NSBA President Viola Garcia and CEO Chip Slaven conspired and exchanged information with the White House before releasing official demands for the Biden administration to target parents. The emails also show that the NSBA’s board of directors, much like the state school board associations that denounced the national organization over the letter, were not consulted about the plea before it was released to the public.

The NSBA released a statement last week expressing regret for sending the letter and even admitted that “there was no justification for some of the language included in the letter.”

In a House Judiciary hearing on Thursday, Garland admitted that the basis for targeting and potentially charging parents concerned about what their children are learning in schools with domestic terrorism was the official letter from the NSBA, not real evidence. Garland is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.

Merrick Garland Says He'll Keep Targeting Parents After NSBA's Apology,"Attorney General Merrick Garland indicated in a Senate Judiciary oversight hearing on Wednesday that the Department of Justice will keep targeting parents even after the National School Boards Association walked back the inflammatory language contained in its letter demanding that the Biden administration intervene.

The NSBA released a statement last week expressing “regret” for sending the letter and even admitted that “there was no justification for some of the language included in the letter.”

“Your memo mentions that the national security division will get involved in school board investigations. Is the Justice Department national security division really necessary for keeping local school boards safe if parents aren’t domestic terrorists?” Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley asked. “Why is the national security division involved at all? This kind of looks like something that would come out of some communist country.”

Garland claimed the memo he publicized is focused on “violence and threats of violence” but did not commit to rescinding the memo nor disavowing the involvement of federal law enforcement in local issues.

Earlier in the hearing, Grassley accused Garland of moving the DOJ “as far left as it can go” and targeting “parents [who] are trying to protect their children.” The Republican also criticized the DOJ for refusing to answer GOP members’ letters, questions, and demands even though Garland previously promised to be transparent in his confirmation hearing.

In a House Judiciary hearing last week, Garland admitted that the basis for targeting and potentially charging parents concerned about what their children are learning in schools with domestic terrorism was the official letter from the NSBA, not real evidence.

“When did you first review the data showing this so-called disturbing uptick?” Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan asked.

“I read the letter, and we have been seeing over time—” Garland began before Jordan interrupted him.

“So you read the letter? That’s your source?” Jordan asked incredulously. “Is there some study, some effort, some investigation someone did that, said there’s been a disturbing uptick, or you just take the words of the National School Board Association?”

Garland then confirmed it wasn’t until the NSBA contacted him that his department began to investigate claims of violence and terrorism.

“Well, the National School Board Association, which represents thousands of school boards and school board members, says that there are these kinds of threats,” Garland said.

The NSBA sent a letter to the Biden administration last month begging for federal law enforcement to use domestic terrorism laws to target parents who oppose anti-science mask mandates for children and the infiltration of racist curriculum in schools. The NSBA claimed that federal action was warranted to “deal with the growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation occurring across the nation.”

Most of the incident examples the NSBA used to justify intervention by the Biden administration did not escalate to a level that even yielded arrests or charges on the local level, yet mere days after the letter was sent, Garland directed the FBI and state attorneys to address “a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who participate in the vital work of running our nation’s public schools.”

Dozens of state school board associations reported that they were not consulted before the NSBA sent its letter to the administration and some have even voted to withdraw their membership from the national chapter whose President Viola Garcia and CEO Chip Slaven colluded with the White House before releasing their official demands. The emails also show that the NSBA’s board of directors, much like the state school board associations, were not consulted about the plea before it was made public.

School 'Domestic Terrorism' Dumpster Fire Proves Parents Are Gaining,"After Attorney General Merrick Garland’s disastrous performances in congressional hearings Wednesday and last Thursday — bookending a fake apology from the National Association of School Boards over their collusion to target parents — it’s gleefully obvious that the educrats are in deep trouble.

In Wednesday’s hearing, Garland embarrassed himself by indicating he would keep targeting parents even after the NSBA walked back their letter, feigning ignorance of memorandums circulated by U.S. attorneys he supposedly oversees, and refusing to meaningfully answer questions about his own ethics complications. Multiple senators called for his resignation to his face.

Last Friday, the National School Boards Association (NSBA) apologized to its members for asking that our country’s top law enforcement organizations treat concerned parents as domestic terrorists. This sudden reversal came the day after Garland’s also-disastrous testimony before the House Judiciary Committee.

It’s no surprise that the educational establishment, terrified by the blowback it has been receiving lately, should seek to use the Department of Justice as its version of the Stasi. What is somewhat surprising, however, is that Garland was so ill-prepared to answer questions regarding the NSBA’s now-infamous Sept. 29 letter and his Oct. 4 response to it. This combination of hubris and incompetence has given parents an important victory in their war for the minds and souls of their children.

Garland Fumbled Last Week’s Hearing, Too

On Thursday, the attorney general appeared to believe the American people had forgotten all about his disgusting efforts to silence parents, since his opening statement made no reference to them. Indeed, the only mention of schools at all in that document was in the context of ransomware attacks.

Rep. Steve Chabot questioned Garland about whether parent asking school board members in Sarasota, Fla. if they had high school diplomas constituted domestic terrorism. Garland admitted it did not, contradicting the claims of the NSBA, which cited both those and similar comments at meetings across the country as “threats and acts of violence.”

When Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, asked the attorney general about the recently reported cases of rape and sexual assault involving the same “gender fluid” perpetrator in two Loudoun County high schools, Garland stammered his way through the exchange by repeatedly claiming to be ignorant of the basic elements of the case.

The NSBA’s ‘Sorry Not Sorry’ Apology

Garland’s testimony at Thursday’s hearing apparently scared the NSBA Board of Directors into issuing a memo to the organization’s members (many of whom have denounced the original letter). In it, they apologized for their ham-fisted effort to make complaining at a school board meeting a de facto federal crime.

After expressing their “regret,” the board fell back on typical bureaucracy-speak, promising a “formal review” that will result in “specific improvements … to ensure that there is improved coordination and consultation” among the members, the board, and the staff. In other words, the next time the NSBA colludes with the White House to trash engaged parents, everyone in the organization will know about it in advance.

Although the memo pays lip service to listening to “the voices of parents” on “their children’s education, health, and safety,” it offers no apology to those parents whom the NSBA casually compared to violent criminals.

The Enemy Is Desperate

What do all these political machinations mean for the current conflicts in American education? The educational establishment has all the earmarks of an authoritarian regime. When parents started asking questions in the wake of school shutdowns and these questions could no longer be safely ignored, the regime turned to accusations of racism and procedural changes to silence them.

When these efforts didn’t work, the educrats begged their allies in Washington to use the force of law to bludgeon their enemies back into quiet submission. The NSBA letter was a Hail Mary pass, a last-ditch effort to go back to business as usual. But Garland flubbed the reception on national TV, forcing the NSBA to publicly back off. Hopefully, the Biden administration will take the hint and abandon its role in this unconstitutional effort to intimidate parents.

For decades, the educational establishment has relied on bullying tactics and parents’ complacency to maintain their intellectual monopoly over children. Garland’s testimony and the NSBA’s sudden (if dishonest) reversal show that, despite the odds, parents are winning victories in their fight to slowly take back control over their children’s education. We should celebrate this victory over the tyranny of these “experts” and their political allies, while continuing to remind them who they actually serve.

"Democrats: If You Disagree With Us, You're An Insurrectionist","For Democrats, Groundhog Day came nearly a month early this year. For them, like the character in the classic Bill Murray comedy, every day is Jan. 6. For them, every challenge to leftist orthodoxy, whether in the form of Biden administration policy or local school boards attempting to impose critical race theory, unreasonable COVID precautions, or transgender policies, is another day of insurrection.

They see insurrectionists everywhere. They see them in the media, where they demand that Fox News be canceled or demonetized because of its Trumpist heresies and refusal to treat a Capitol riot — in which the only person killed was an unarmed protester gunned down in cold blood by a police officer — as a new Civil War.

They see them in Congress, where anyone who challenged the 2020 results or resists the Democrats’ bills to ban voter ID laws and make permanent pandemic-based election changes that removed guardrails against cheating are seeking to steal not just the 2020 election but the ones yet to be held in 2022 and 2024.

They also see insurrectionists in state capitals, where legislatures that have passed voter integrity bills that seek to prevent future fraud without taking away anyone’s right to vote as not merely advocates of a new “Jim Crow” but the moral equivalent of the Confederates who fired on Fort Sumter to save slavery.

When Everyone Is an Insurrectionist

It also explains why U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland isn’t backing down on his outrageous effort to treat school board protests as an insurrectionist terrorist conspiracy.

Despite heated questioning from furious Republican senators last Wednesday, he wouldn’t concede that his directive to the FBI and the rest of the Department of Justice to investigate school board critics around the country was based on a lie. He denied that he was targeting the free speech of parents who have protested decisions by school boards on curricula and other policies.

That Garland would stand by the rash directive was all the more curious because the hearing came after the National School Boards Association (NSBA) had apologized for the letter that began this shocking episode.

Garland’s doubling down at the hearing about the need for the government to crack down on opponents does make sense. Or at least it does when placed in the context of his party’s current political obsession.

For nine months the Biden administration, its congressional allies, and its media cheerleaders have treated the Jan. 6 Capitol riot as not merely a disgraceful episode but an “insurrection” and “attempted coup” that represented an ongoing threat to the government rather than just a mob that ran amuck. At this point, it’s clear the Biden team has come to view any dissent from leftist dictums — be they national or local — as not merely unwelcome criticism but the work of Trumpist insurrectionists who must be put down rather than tolerated.

Democrats are determined to go on running against former President Donald Trump and his “deplorable” band of insurrectionists indefinitely. But they have been dismayed by the turn of events in Virginia, where resistance against the radical takeover of the schools by angry parents has transformed the gubernatorial race in what the left assumed was a securely blue state. So it was hardly surprising that the administration would seek to brand those citizens outraged by what was being done to their children as just another outbreak of the same insurrection they have been inveighing against all year.

Cornered by Republican senators, Garland asserted that his memo had not ordered investigations of angry parents as “domestic terrorists. Yet his memo characterized criticisms of officials at public meetings as “harassment, intimidation and threats of violence.” In it, he stated plainly that Department of Justice would use its authority to “identify,” “discourage” and “prosecute” these alleged threats while maintaining “coordination and partnership with local enforcement.”

Even more disingenuously, he denied that the letter from the NSBA, which had been coordinated with the White House had prompted his directive. It labeled people like a Loudoun County parent whose daughter was allegedly raped by a boy in a girl’s bathroom then covered up by the school district as “domestic terrorists.”

‘Terrorists’ Have No Rights

Garland’s willingness to jump into that mess was predictable. Tellingly, earlier this month even after the truth had come out about the alleged rape and its coverup, Loudoun County Democratic Party Chair Lissa Savaglio called the parents “Republican insurrectionists.”

Republicans asked Garland about why the attempt to intimidate Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema into going along Biden’s spending spree when she was followed, harangued, and filmed in a bathroom wasn’t as worthy of investigation as incidents in which school board members were yelled at. Similarly, the invasion of the Department of the Interior earlier this month by a leftist mob demanding Biden adopt even more radical environmental policies didn’t make it onto his radar screen.

Nor is Garland or the mainstream media willing to admit that the hundreds of Black Lives Matter “mostly peaceful” riots in cities around the nation in the summer of 2020 were far more of a threat to public order and government authority than the misguided people who illegally entered the Capitol on Jan.6. But if we have learned anything in the last year, it should be this: Democrats will never stop talking about the insurrection.

In part, that’s because they actually believe their political foes don’t deserve constitutional rights. As we saw with their reaction to the fatal police shooting of Capitol protester Ashli Babbit and the treatment of those facing prosecution over their illegal behavior on Jan. 6, they believe insurrectionists have no rights, including those that guarantee due process.

Democrats also understand that labeling conservatives as domestic terrorists is key to their political survival as Biden’s presidency unravels in the face of domestic problems like the southern border crisis, the supply chain disaster, and feckless conduct abroad. Running on Biden’s record or defending efforts to impose woke ideology on children isn’t likely to bring them success. That means they will go on labeling anyone who questions their ideological hobby horses as Trumpist “traitors” so long as they think it will help them rally their voters to turn out and preserve their power.

Grassley: Garland's Double-Down On Parents Will Have 'Chilling Effect',"Sen. Chuck Grassley said Attorney General Merrick Garland’s stubborn refusal to retract the “domestic terrorism” memo authorizing federal law enforcement to target frustrated parents who speak out against local school boards will have a “chilling effect” on parents’ willingness to hold their children’s education system accountable.

In a Senate floor speech delivered on Monday, the Iowa Republican explained how Garland made an “extraordinary” admission that he “instructed the FBI to get involved with local school boards” and doesn’t have any plans of rescinding his memo directing that action.

“If there is a reason for law enforcement to be involved, it’s probably something local law enforcement can handle. So the direction will have the effect of intimidating parents who speak out about their children’s education. Make no mistake about it. The attorney general should withdraw that memo,” Grassley said.

The National School Boards Association sent a letter to the Biden administration last month begging for federal law enforcement to use domestic terrorism laws to target parents who oppose anti-science mask mandates for children and the infiltration of racist curriculum in schools. The NSBA claimed that federal action was warranted to “deal with the growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation occurring across the nation.”

Most of the incident examples the NSBA used to justify intervention by the Biden administration did not escalate to a level that even yielded arrests or charges on the local level, yet mere days after the letter was sent, Garland directed the FBI and state attorneys to address “a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who participate in the vital work of running our nation’s public schools.”

“Attorney General Garland has since testified that he gave the Department of Justice this instruction because of what he read in the National School Boards Association letter to President Biden from just five days earlier. This is an extraordinary deployment of federal law enforcement, when we have problems like a historic murder surge and an open southern border,” Grassley said.

Dozens of state school board associations reported that they were not consulted before the NSBA sent its letter to the administration, and some have even voted to withdraw their membership from the national chapter whose President Viola Garcia and CEO Chip Slaven colluded with the White House before releasing their official demands. The emails also show that the NSBA’s board of directors, much like the state school board associations, was not consulted about the plea before it was made public.

“The White House helped write a letter to itself comparing parents who love their kids to domestic terrorists — but the actual members of the National School Boards Association had nothing to do with it,” Grassley said before noting that 17 state attorneys general have written to Garland to state that “there has been no spike in violence against local school boards.” “So, the idea that parents pose any sort of federal threat to local school boards is all just made up — what looks to be by the White House — for political purposes.”

Garland previously told Grassley that he would not rescind the memo despite an apology from the NSBA. This lack of clarification on behalf of parents, Grassley noted, is going to have a “chilling effect” on their willingness to keep speaking out at school board meetings.

“That memo stands, as far as he’s concerned. He says he doesn’t see how it could be interpreted to mean the FBI will go after impassioned parents. He says there are lines in Constitutional law that law enforcement can’t cross. Well, that’s true, but he’s been working with the Constitution his entire adult life. However, most parents and most school board members aren’t experts in the First Amendment,” Grassley noted.

“These parents are reading the attorney general’s own words to mean that when they speak passionately at local school board meetings, they could get in trouble with the feds,” Grassley continued. “So parents are going to stop speaking up at local school board meetings. And that’s what’s known as a chilling effect. That might be what some at the White House or the National School Boards Association wanted all along, but it’s a horrible thing for democracy, and it should never happen in the United States of America.”

During the same Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week, Grassley accused Garland of moving the DOJ “as far left as it can go” and targeting “parents [who] are trying to protect their children.” The Republican also criticized the DOJ for refusing to answer GOP members’ letters, questions, and demands even though Garland previously promised to be transparent in his confirmation hearing.

“Attorney General Garland has said how he wanted to de-politicize the Department of Justice. Now he wants federal prosecutors parsing what parents say to their local school board members,” Grassley said in his floor speech. “This is because he thinks there’s a disturbing spike in violence by parents, but he’s not actually sure if that’s right. And this instruction is going to scare parents out of speaking their minds at local school board meetings. But the attorney general won’t change his instruction to the FBI.”

“Mr. Attorney General,” Grassley continued, “parents are not domestic terrorists, and you have only one reasonable choice. Withdraw your memo and focus on the real threats. Stop being a pawn for the White House by politicizing the Department of Justice.”

Whistleblower Documents Show Garland Lied About Targeting Parents,"New whistleblower documents suggest Attorney General Merrick Garland lied to lawmakers last month when he denied that the Department of Justice was being weaponized to target concerned parents at school board meetings.

Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee in late October, Garland said the agency’s interest in parents was provoked by a letter from the National School Boards Association asking for federal law enforcement to use “domestic terrorism” laws to go after those who are concerned about what is taught in classrooms.

“The National School Board Association, which represents thousands of school boards and school board members, says that there are these kinds of threats,” Garland said, explaining the DOJ’s investigation of parents while denying that divisions dedicated to counterterrorism were being deployed.

Garland told lawmakers he could not “imagine any circumstance in which the Patriot Act would be used in the circumstances of parents complaining about their children, nor … a circumstance where they would be labeled as domestic terrorists.”

“I do not think that parents getting angry at school boards for whatever reason constitute domestic terrorism,” Garland said. “It’s not even a close question.”

Biden AG Merrick Garland concedes that he started targeting parents for ""possible domestic terrorism"" because the NSBA sent a letter. pic.twitter.com/ZDvhZ6vDzO — The First (@TheFirstonTV) October 21, 2021

Records from an anonymous whistleblower released by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Tuesday, however, reveal that the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division is engaged in categorizing threat assessments relating to parents with a “threat tag.”

An internal email attached to a letter from Jordan to the attorney general references an Oct. 4 memorandum from Garland for the FBI to address “investigations and assessments of threats specifically directed against school board administrators, board members, teachers, and staff,” with the tag.

“This disclosure provides specific evidence that federal law enforcement operationalized counterterrorism tools at the behest of a left-wing special interest group against concerned parents,” Jordan wrote. “We know from public reporting that the National School Boards Association coordinated with the White House prior to sending a letter dated September 29 to President Biden labeling parents as domestic terrorists and urging the Justice Department to use federal tools — including the Patriot Act — to target parents.”

The NSBA later apologized with “regret” for the letter days after Garland’s testimony.

“To be clear, the safety of school board members, other public school officials and educators, and students is our top priority, and there remains important work to be done on this issue,” the NSBA wrote. “However, there was no justification for some of the language included in the letter.”",https://thefederalist.com/2021/11/16/doj-whistleblower-documents-suggest-merrick-garland-lied-about-the-targeting-of-parents-as-domestic-terrorists/,2021-11-16
Florida School Boards Group Ditches NSBA After 'Domestic Terror' Letter,"The Florida School Boards Association announced on Tuesday it would leave the National School Boards Association (NSBA) effective Wednesday, in a continuation of the backlash from state board associations against the NSBA for colluding with Attorney General Marrick Garland to target parents under domestic terrorism laws.

“The board voted to condemn the letter that [NSBA] sent to the White House requesting the FBI to get involved with local school board businesses,” Escambia County School Board Member Kevin Adams told a local ABC News affiliate.

The FSBA sent a letter to their national umbrella organization in October to express concern about the NSBA’s letter to Garland, explaining the FSBA’s decision to withhold its membership dues and threatening to continue withholding them.

“We … both encourage and welcome parents, as well as other concerned citizens into our school board meetings to engage in lively, respectful, and civil civic discourse,” the letter said. “If we are to ever again have a strong national federation, it must be one that eschews rhetoric, avoids partisanship, collaborates with its members, and focuses its energies on intentional impact.”

Brevard County School Board Member Matt Susin told local news that the lack of a response by the NSBA to the Florida group’s demands played an important role in discussions before this week’s unanimous, bipartisan vote to cut membership ties completely.

Florida joins about half the states in the country that have distanced themselves from the national organization. Montana and South Carolina withdrew from the group last month, joining Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, New Hampshire, and Louisiana in ditching membership in the NSBA.

These states make up some of the 25-plus state school board groups that have taken action to distance themselves from the NSBA, such as withholding membership dues or planning to withdraw in the future.

DeAngelis (@DeAngelisCorey) November 10, 2021

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis weighed in to support the FSBA’s decision on Thursday. “I support what the Florida School Board Association did,” he said. “The National School Board Association was using its organization to advance a partisan narrative and agenda. And they created this letter to try to get the FBI to start basically running interference at school board meetings.”

“They’re not interested in having the FBI go after the guy in Waukesha, Wisconsin, which was an intentional act of terrorism,” DeSantis added. “But they somehow think a parent who is upset that there’s bad curriculum being put in schools, or forced masking or all these other things, that if they speak out, then somehow they are a domestic threat? Give me a break.”

GOP Senators Demand AG Garland Rescind War-On-Parents Memo,"Nearly a dozen GOP senators from the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday demanding that he rescind a memo greenlighting a campaign by federal law enforcement to go after parents who speak up at school board meetings across the country.

“Are concerned parents domestic terrorists or not?” the letter asked.

As noted in the letter, the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division took action on Garland’s October directive to target parents after the National School Boards Association begged the Biden administration to get involved in silencing those opposed to COVID-19 protocols and objectionable content in curricula. The senators said this information came to light after a whistleblower from the U.S. Department of Justice shared an email detailing the FBI’s Counterterrorism and Criminal Divisions decisions to tag and track “instances of related threats” related to school board members and other educational staff.

“This followed your October 4 memorandum alleging a ‘disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who participate in the vital work of running our nation’s public schools,’” the letter to Garland said.

The Judiciary Committee lawmakers noted that Garland had previously claimed parents should exercise their First Amendment rights to express discontent at local school board meetings but also pointed out that “it should be abundantly clear to you now that no matter what your claimed intention was at the time of issuing that memo, the subsequent reaction of American parents and the public shows it has had a clear chilling effect on them.”

The FBI’s new plan initiated shortly after Garland’s memo, the letter continued, “leads normal, loving, and impassioned parents to wonder whether the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division – an eyebrow raising fact that cannot be emphasized enough – will be reviewing and storing videos of them speaking at school-board meetings.”

“Speaking in public is a nerve-racking experience for most people. Undoubtedly many of them will now just skip it. When that happens, democracy is failing. Other parents will be even more nervous speaking their minds and will not be as clear as they would like to be when speaking. All of this is an outrageous tipping of the scales in the marketplace of ideas in favor of school officials, who just happen to be a major constituency of the political party that currently controls the White House and the Department of Justice. And you have now enlisted the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division as muscle in that marketplace of ideas,” the letter said. “No matter how you might rationalize this, the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division should never have had anything to do with school-board meetings.”

The senators concluded the letter by once again demanding that Garland withdraw his October memo encouraging further action by the federal government.

“By now involving the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division in this effort, even if you personally believe that division would never cross a line into silencing criticism of local governments, you have given life to the idea that dissidents are synonymous with terrorists. This is a common tactic of third-world dictatorships, but it should never be FBI practice,” the letter stated. “Parents and other citizens who get impassioned at school-board meetings are not domestic terrorists. You may believe that, but too many people involved in this issue seem to think harsh words can be criminalized. Getting the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division involved in the matter only makes this worse—dramatically worse.”

FBI's McCabe Calls For Feds To Surveil 'Mainstream' Conservatives,"Have you ever wondered what disgraced former deputy FBI directors do after trying to stage a coup and lying under oath? Apparently, they give talks about “protecting democracy” at top-rated institutions of higher learning. Indeed, this last Thursday the University of Chicago invited former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe to join a panel of partisans to discuss the Jan 6 “insurrection.”

McCabe was fired as the deputy FBI director for leaking sensitive information about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation and then lying about it under oath. He also took part in spying on the Donald Trump campaign through a secret warrant granted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court.

The dossier he used to obtain the surveillance warrant was funded by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and, in an ironic twist, was itself the product of Russian disinformation. McCabe and his allies in corporate media justified all sorts of similar illegal and undemocratic tactics to discredit and attempt to unseat President Trump.

Of course, neither the University of Chicago nor McCabe acknowledged the irony in him discussing the integrity of “democracy” in America on Thursday evening. In fact, what McCabe said at the University of Chicago event on Jan. 6, 2022 is even more shocking than his invitation to speak in the first place. Below are four of the most appalling assertions and policy proposals McCabe made at the public event.

1. Conservatives Are in The Same Category As Islamic Terrorists

McCabe likened conservatives to members of the Islamic Caliphate: “I can tell you from my perspective of spending a lot of time focused on the radicalization of international terrorists and Islamic extremist and extremists of all stripes… is that this group shares many of the same characteristics of those groups that we’ve seen radicalized along entirely different ideological lines,” he said.

McCabe went on to describe the rise of the Islamic caliphate in Syria and how Islamic extremists were radicalized across socioeconomic, educational, and racial lines, likening it to the “mass radicalization” of the political right across demographics. That’s right, according to McCabe a grandma who shares a Federalist article on Facebook and your uncle with a “Let’s Go Brandon” coffee mug are in the same category as a jihadist who killed 49 people at an Orlando nightclub.

2. Parents at School Board Meetings Pose A ‘Threat To National Security’

“Political violence [is] not just confined to the Capitol,” McCabe asserted. “It’s going on in school boards around the country. It’s going on in local elections. It’s happening, you know, even to health-care workers.” According to this politically protected former FBI no. 2, the “political violence” occurring recently at school board meetings and during local elections is a “very diverse and challenging threat picture.”

If you haven’t heard already, Democrats are branding parents who oppose child mask mandates and racist critical race theory indoctrination as “domestic terrorists.”

McCabe said moms and dads who stand up for their children’s health and education at school board meetings in ways Democrats disagree with are very dangerous. So dangerous that it is actually “essential” we have a “rapid and complete response by law enforcement at the state, local and federal level to this sort of political violence…”

Holding America’s parents “accountable” is not enough for McCabe. He wants to make sure that federal agencies also put “out that message that this sort of conduct that both horribly victimizes individuals, but also serves to undermine our democratic process” is “considered a threat to national security [that is] not tolerated.”

3. McCabe Wants More Surveillance of ‘Mainstream’ Conservatives

“I’m fairly confident,” McCabe said, “[that] the FBI [and other agencies] have reallocated resources and repositioned some of their counterterrorism focus to increase their focus on right-wing extremism and domestic violent extremists. And I think that’s obviously a good idea.”

But McCabe wants more. McCabe asserted that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and FBI need to stop merely focusing on the “fringes of the right-wing movement,” in order to “catch this threat” of the “right.”

“Are you going to catch this threat if your focus is only on the traditional, right-wing extremist, those groups that we know about, the quote-unquote, fringes of the right-wing movement?” asked McCabe. “And I think the answer to that is no.”

“It’s entirely possible that when the intelligence community and the law enforcement community looks out across this mainstream,” McCabe continued, “they didn’t assume [on January 6] that that group of people — business owners, white people from the suburbs, educated, employed — presented a threat of violence, and now we know very clearly that they do.”

McCabe wants to get around constitutional obstacles that restrict the abuses of federal agencies. He explained that the path to granting the feds more power to spy on and punish “extremists,” a.k.a. conservatives, is by implementing federal penalties against “domestic terrorism.”

A measure like this would grant domestic agencies the intelligence capabilities of the international terrorism-focused National Counterterrorism Center. It would, McCabe says, “give investigators the ability to begin investigating when folks are plotting or planning or organizing to use violence for the purpose of coercing the population or influencing government…”

Joshua Geltzer, President Joe Biden’s advisor on “countering domestic violent extremism,” made the same proposal in a 2019 hearing before a subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee. In his proposal, Geltzer suggested that we need to “polic[e] [tech company] platforms to remove not just incitement to violence, but also, the ideological foundations that spawn such violence.”

McCabe claims these proposed federal laws against domestic terrorism can be implemented without infringing on Americans’ First Amendment right to free speech. That seems quite impossible, however, given Geltzer is proposing government oversight of social media, for example.

It is even more difficult to believe when you consider that Democrats are not going after real domestic terrorists and have literally defined parents speaking out at school board meetings as national security threats. As McCabe said himself, to Democrats, the extreme right is the mainstream right.

4. McCabe Believes No One Is Above The Law (Except Himself)

Ironically, one of McCabe’s last remarks was a proclamation of equality under the law. “Whether you are a Trump supporter or a Biden supporter, right, left, or otherwise, we should all be able to agree on the principle that no one is above the law,” stated McCabe.

“… [F]rom the lowliest trespasser on January 6, up to the highest-ranking government officials who may have been aware of a plan that would ultimately lead to violence in the Capitol––those people should be held accountable, period,” he announced. “And if we can’t do that, that is just another sign that we are becoming a non-functioning democracy.”

Ironically, McCabe’s firing for repeatedly breaking the law was expunged from the record only because he settled with a partisan Biden Department of Justice. If no one is above the law, as McCabe claims to support, then he would be in jail. Of course, McCabe is above the law. Only dissenting conservatives, in his view, deserve the suspicion and wrath of unelected federal agencies.

Disturbingly, the University of Chicago does not care about national introspection post-January 6, 2021. If it did, it would not have invited McCabe, of all people, to speak about “protecting democracy.”

UChicago allowed McCabe to spin lies about what truly happened one year ago and filtered student questions via Zoom, refusing to ask him any tough questions. Consequently, McCabe was given a platform to teach young, impressionable college students without question that the federal government should be weaponized against fellow Americans whom leftists brand as “extremists.”

To the elites in America — Democrats like McCabe, university administrators, and professors – January 6 is the key to labeling their political opponents as dangerous, “white supremacist extremists” and enacting new policy accordingly.

America’s universities are now indoctrination machines that shape the minds of the next generation. Academia openly exploits its power and rewrite history to serve their illiberal agenda.

Sadly, McCabe’s dishonest version of January 6 is happily accepted by the academic elites who invited him Thursday night. His frighteningly despotic views and policy prescriptions will likely be accepted and implemented by his young listeners.

Biden Isn’t Even Hiding Designation Of Americans As ‘Domestic Terrorists’,"In my legal career, I often taught younger colleagues that good lawyers are like good generals—they win by picking the terrain upon which they fight. The duke of Wellington won the battle of Waterloo, in part, because he chose the terrain and forced Napoleon to attack uphill, through the mud.

Lawyers’ terrain is the issues to be decided and the words they use to define those issues. Winning a complex legal case often depends upon who can define and shape the issues in the way that best favors them.

The same is true for politicians. To define the issues—the terrain upon which they wish to fight—politicians choose their words carefully.

The battlefield can be a negative characterization of one’s opponent. For example, if the opposition can be defined as racist, insurrectionist, terroristic, or any other inflammatory and pejorative label, the fight is won. The remaining issues are just the terms of the surrender.

Such efforts to define the terrain for the fight are going on now in the political wars over the January 6, 2021 insurrection , riot , attack on democracy , demonstration , whatever-you-choose-to-call-it. The real danger to our republic is the Joe Biden administration’s totalitarian effort to label millions of ordinary Americans as supporters of terrorists.

Smears Are a Control Tactic

In their effort to define the terrain, or the narrative, politicians and commentators have used a variety of overly simplistic descriptions to characterize all the hundreds of people who were on the Capitol grounds or in the Capitol building on January 6. Depending upon the person describing them, they are “insurrectionists,“ “rioters,“ “demonstrators,“ “goons,” and a variety of other things. When you hear the label, you know the speaker’s political views.

The primary labels Democrats have deployed are “insurrectionists,“ and “terrorists,” even though not a single person there that day has yet been charged with insurrection or terrorism (although U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has left that door open). It is a sign of the success of the Democrats’ choice of this as their terrain that such inflammatory labels are now routinely used, including by those who know better.

Even Sen. Ted Cruz recently referred to all those entering the Capitol building that day as “violent terrorists.” Although Cruz has attempted to backtrack, it shows how an opponent founders if you have defined the terrain upon which you fight.

Nobody There Was a Terrorist

Most of these labels are accurate for some of the people present that day, although “terrorists“ is not. However, when applied to all of those present, as is the usual practice, the labels are inaccurate and misleading. When it is necessary to describe the January 6, 2021 group as a whole, I prefer “RPGs,” for rioters, protesters, and gawkers.

No doubt, some in the crowd should be characterized and charged as “rioters.” But although their number is unknown, it is highly likely that some were FBI agents or informants, or, as documented by The Federalist, other agents provocateurs, perhaps including the mysterious Ray Epps. But the federal government has stonewalled requests from GOP members of Congress for more information about this.

Likewise, it cannot be seriously disputed that many in the crowd are more accurately described as “protesters.” They are not unlike many of the hundreds, if not thousands, of political dissidents who have previously invaded public buildings, including the U.S. Capitol, to protest a variety of things, from the Vietnam War to the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. As The Federalist has documented, many of the protester RPGs are less culpable than were many of the protestors who came before them.

Even though the government has refused to release most of the video footage of the events of that day, there are videos and reports of people freely entering the Capitol building through doors and barricades opened by Capitol Police, snapping selfies with police officers, walking calmly between the velvet rope lines in statuary hall while taking photos and videos, and generally gazing around like tourists on any other day.

In short, describing all the RPGs as “insurrectionists” or “terrorists” trying to destroy “our democracy” is clearly inaccurate, but is Democrats’ chosen line of attack. It defines their enemies. After all, what truly independent voter would not be against insurrectionists and terrorists who engaged in an “armed insurrection” intended to “subvert the Constitution”?

The War on Trump Is a War on His Voters

This is an intentional strategy with a malevolent purpose: Former President Trump and his supporters must be utterly destroyed. Make no mistake about it: Democrats’ goal is the total destruction of former President Trump, any GOP politician who questions either the way the 2020 elections were conducted or the tactics being employed by the House January 6 committee, and anyone who supported Trump.

No quarter is to be given to Republicans unless, like Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, they fully support the Democrat war on anyone suspected of being insufficiently opposed to the former president who has questions about the propriety of the 2020 election, or even who just opposes the lawless tactics being used against Trump’s supporters.

If the Democrats and their media allies succeed in defining their terrain and enemies as an insurrection supported by terrorists who, in Joe Biden’s words, want to “subvert the Constitution,” then the full force of the federal government can be brought to bear against them. This will include ordinary American citizens whose only “crime” has been to support Trump or raise questions about the propriety of Biden’s election, or, as we have seen, those who just oppose the Democrats’ pet projects, such as the indoctrination of school children with racists philosophy, by showing up and protesting at school board meetings.

Pursuant to standard counter-terrorism doctrine, and like the terrorists that Biden and his supporters claim they are, they and their supporters must be hunted down, harassed, imprisoned, bankrupted, excluded from any office, and ostracized from polite society until they have been “reprogrammed.”

Democrats Are Crystal Clear About Their Aims

This month, the University of Chicago sponsored a forum introduced by President Obama’s chief strategist, David Alexrod, that included disgraced former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Democrat Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Washington Post “national security reporter,” and a bobble-headed university professor who spent the better part of an hour nodding in agreement with everything anyone else said.

As Evita Duffy chronicled in The Federalist, the forum participants made it clear that everyone who set foot in the Capitol building on January 6, 2020, was a “domestic terrorist” guilty of “insurrection,” even though no one has been charged with either. Accordingly, all must be prosecuted.

The panelists are teaching that the “combustible mass” of Americans who “harbor insurrectionist sentiments” are not just the “traditional threats” from a radical fringe. Rather, they are from “mainstream America,” and they are fomenting “collective political violence.” According to McCabe “national security” is implicated because these people are engaged in a “wave of political violence that is not just confined to the Capitol” but is “going on in school boards around the country.”

This panel of “experts” compared these “mainstream Americans” to al-Qaeda, the Fort Hood shooter (three murdered, 14 injured), the Boston Marathon bombers (three killed, hundreds wounded), and Slobodan Milošević, the Serbian war criminal charged with genocide and ethnic cleansing.

Joe Kent, a highly experienced veteran of sophisticated counter-terrorist special operations and a congressional candidate from Washington, put the dynamic plainly in a recent interview with Tucker Carlson. Referring to Vice President Kamala Harris’ comparison of January 6 to Pearl Harbor and 9/11, Kent said, “I fought these wars before and I’ve seen this playbook run before. What Kamala Harris is doing, what Joe Biden is doing, is they’re taking very powerful imagery and they’re saying that the attack on Pearl Harbor, the attack on 9/11, this is the same thing that took place on January 6th because that allows people to compare Trump supporters to Nazis, to actual members of al- Qaeda, and with that imagery comes the justification to turn the tools of the state against them.”

Kent’s 20-plus years as an Army Ranger, Special Forces Green Beret, and intelligence officer gives him the experience to recognize the counter-terrorism strategy being employed by the Biden administration against “mainstream America.”

'Domestic Terror Unit' Is A Way To Punish Americans For Thought Crimes,"On Tuesday, Department of Justice representatives informed a Senate committee of plans to gather a group of select attorneys to form a “Domestic Terror Unit” in light of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, noting that its number of investigations of alleged domestic terrorists have more than doubled since the spring of 2020. While admitting “there is no single federal crime labeled ‘domestic terrorism,’” a DOJ official promised to invoke a “criminal code” that allows enhanced sentences for certain crimes listed as “terror offenses.”

There are many reasons to doubt the authenticity of the federal government’s efforts against this “persistent and evolving” threat, including its conveniently blurred definitions.

The National Defense and Authorization Act’s definition of “domestic terrorism” distinctly refers to “unlawful use or threat of force of violence in furtherance of ideological agendas” in the context of political or anti-government extremism. Most other common-sense definitions clearly denote violence as an essential feature. However, federal agents have a poor track record in their use of the label, not only in the case of parents angry at school boards, but most recently in relation to Jan. 6, 2021.

In July 2021, after pleading guilty to “obstruction of an official proceeding,” non-violent Jan. 6 defendant Paul Hodgkins, who had no prior criminal record, was given a heavy eight-month sentence. Judge Randolph Moss described him as one of many “terrorists” that day, baselessly lumping him in with those who committed actual violence.

In all his insufferable rantings about an “assault on democracy” and the rebellious “symbolism” of Hodgkins raising a Trump flag, Moss could not explain how his particular crime of roaming the Senate floor for 22 minutes had enabled violence. In fact, he plainly admitted that the punishment wasn’t based entirely on individual guilt, but on a perverse idea of “balanced” justice:

The court here had to consider both what I think are the extremely damaging events that occurred that day but also who Mr. Hodgkins is as an individual. And as I think is reflected by the sentencing I imposed, I tried to strike that balance.

This implies one may be considered a terrorist by virtue of being within geographical distance of what terrorists are doing if one’s political leanings are on a similar spectrum.

Despite the court’s claims, neither the prosecution nor the judge brought forth a sentencing enhancement based on the existing code of terror offenses mentioned Tuesday. Why? Because Hodgkins’ crime isn’t on it. It was terrorism because the court said it was, not by law.

More judicial malpractice occurred in the case of non-violent defendant Jacob Chansely, the infamous “Q shaman” who was held in solitary confinement for months while Judge Royce Lamberth repeatedly denied his release. In November, Chansely received an unbelievable 41-month sentence when he pleaded guilty to the same charge as Hodgkins.

While admitting Chansely committed no violent crime at the Capitol (in fact, he openly called for peace), the court cited a “need to deter others especially in cases of domestic terrorism.” By punishing a non-terrorist more harshly than necessary to “deter others,” our bloodthirsty DOJ showed a willingness to weaponize federal convictions that deplete a defendant’s civil rights just to make an example out of him.

In August, the government extended its wild accusations out of the courtrooms and into local police departments. Leading up to the anniversary of 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert advising police and neighborhoods to be on the lookout for potential terror threats. Among them were “opposition to COVID measures,” or association with “conspiracy theories on perceived election fraud.”

Do you oppose certain COVID policies or hold a skeptical view of the 2020 election’s security but have no intent to respond violently or illegally? The DHS draws no line; to them, you may be a terrorist. Their language spreads beyond actions to include statements or beliefs that are inherently devoid of any call to action, violent or not. One could almost call it an indictment of “thought crime.”

Lastly, while the Jan. 6 Capitol attack obviously involved acts of political violence, it hasn’t been linked to any broader, organized threat to the country, raising more questions as to what exactly justifies a new Terror Unit in response.

In August, after hundreds of arrests and investigations, the FBI admitted to finding no hard evidence of an elaborate political plot on Jan. 6, a confession no one in the government has retracted since. The most concerning evidence of a plot may be the FBI’s own use of provocateurs, but it’s looking doubtful the FBI or DOJ will investigate itself.

When asked by the Senate committee if any Jan. 6 defendants have been charged with “insurrection,” DOJ representatives said they were unaware of any. That’s because the answer is no. Regardless, the feds continue to ramp up their already fanatical response to a problem they haven’t clearly defined.

Our self-serving ruling class hasn’t conducted itself responsibly or transparently in the wake of the Capitol attack, and we can expect this new development to be no different. While the Biden administration would have us believe that the aimless actions of a few foolish troublemakers represent the greatest authoritarian threat to the United States, its systematic purge of political opponents indicates otherwise.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/01/17/doj-domestic-terror-unit-is-just-a-new-way-to-punish-americans-for-thought-crimes/,2022-01-17
FBI's Explanation For Attack On Texas Synagogue Reeks Of Politicization,"Image Credit Flickr/Sammy Six

In the wake of last weekend’s terrorist attack that targeted a Texas synagogue, a highly trained FBI professional said, in effect, the attack had nothing to do with the Jewish community. That he felt the need or was trained to make such a risibly false statement needs to be investigated.

On January 15, a 44-year-old man, later identified as Malik Faisal Akram, entered Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, and took four hostages. He demanded the release of a Pakistani national, Aafia Siddiqui, who is serving an 86-year federal sentence for assault and attempted murder of federal agents and military personnel.

The intent of Akram’s attack was clearly terrorism — the definition being “unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.” Akram died of gunshot wounds received as the hostage ordeal came to an end, with all four hostages emerging unharmed. Had it not been for Covid-19 concerns, there may have been far more people, as most congregants were worshiping from home on Zoom.

FBI’s Incredulous Explanation

In his post-incident news conference, Matthew J. DeSarno, the FBI’s special agent in charge of the Dallas field office, said of Akram’s attack, “We do believe from our engagement with this subject that he was singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community.”

When I heard DeSarno’s remarks, I was immediately incredulous. When some intrepid reporters asked about motives again, DeSarno doubled down, asserting, “I’m not ready to add any more about the demands set [by the hostage taker], except that they were specifically focused on one issue that was not specifically threatening to the Jewish community.”

Akram was heard to say via the live stream that operated from the synagogue for much of the incident that he chose it because he thought it was the closest assemblage of Jews to the federal facility holding Siddiqui. There are about 1,000 churches in the Fort Worth area within a half-hour drive of Siddiqui’s place of incarceration, compared to seven Jewish centers of worship — but sure, Special Agent DeSarno, the terrorism was “not specifically threatening to the Jewish community.”

Siddiqui came to local attention just last month when the Dallas-Fort-Worth chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) held an event called “In Pursuit of Freedom” about 35 miles away from Colleyville’s Congregation Beth Israel and 55 miles from where Siddiqui is being held. The event called for Siddiqui’s release with the incendiary claim that she had been “kidnapped, ripped apart from her children, shot at, renditioned to the U.S., and is currently serving an 86-year prison sentence for a crime she did not commit.”

This is potent propaganda. CAIR condemned the hostage incident as it took place.

Siddiqui’s Anti-Semitism

DeSarno, a former Army infantry officer with the First Cavalry Division in Fort Hood, Texas — where, seven years after DeSarno joined the FBI, Muslim terrorist Nidal Hasan fatally shot 13 people and injured more than 30 others — was promoted to deputy assistant director of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division in 2017.

DeSarno is supposed to know terrorism inside and out. As such, it is highly implausible to suggest that DeSarno didn’t know about Siddiqui’s own anti-Semitic rantings during her trial, where she refused to cooperate with the three lawyers hired by the Pakistani embassy to augment her two public defenders, on the grounds they were Jewish. Siddiqui even demanded that there be no Jewish people on the jury and wanted all jurors to be DNA-tested to check “if they have a Zionist or Israeli background.”

But, of course, Siddiqui’s words and Akram’s deeds are not “related to the Jewish community.”

Even President Joe Biden suggested the attack had intent beyond Siddiqui when he said, “This was an act of terror… and not only was related to someone who had been arrested… 15 years ago and had been in jail for 10 years.” The FBI changed its tune hours later, releasing a new statement on Sunday night admitting that the attack was a “terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted.”

Biden also said Akram bought his gun “on the street,” feeding into the left’s gun control narrative that firearms are too easily obtained in America. But that claim raises interesting questions that might be better answered if law enforcement were able to ask questions without fear of being labeled bigots. For instance, how does a foreign national in the United States for less than a month obtain a weapon? Did he have help?

Woke Indoctrination at the FBI

What we do know is that the FBI isn’t in the habit of promoting its agents to run large field offices if senior leadership doesn’t see them as right for the job. This raises the very disturbing likelihood that DeSarno, experienced as he is in counterterrorism, knew exactly what he was saying on Saturday before FBI headquarters walked it back on Sunday night after a hail of incredulous criticism.

DeSarno said what he said — “no connection to the Jewish community” — for a reason, that being that to say or think otherwise is now a thoughtcrime. Bright, ambitious professionals in federal service, whether civilians or military officers, have endured nearly 13 years of non-stop woke indoctrination from the left.

If you know what’s good for you and your career, there are simply some things you don’t say. And suggesting that attacks on America’s Jewish community might have something to do with them being Jewish might then lead to forbidden questions about who is doing a disproportionate amount of the attacking these days.

This brings to mind the nearly memory-holed December 2019 Jersey City terror attack by antisemitic black nationalists who, were it not for an unexpected encounter with local law enforcement, aimed to kill a large number of Jewish people and still ended up killing four people at a Kosher supermarket. Bari Weiss, in her indispensable substack “Common Sense,” noted on Jan. 17 that some black community leaders in Jersey City rationalized the attack:

Joan Terrell-Paige, a school official in the city, explained on her Facebook page that the murderers effectively had no choice. The Jews (she called them ‘brutes’) had caused their killers to murder them. ‘I believe they knew they would come out in body bags,’ she wrote of the killers. ‘What is the message they were sending? Are we brave enough to explore the answer to their message? Are we brave enough to stop the assault on the Black communities of America?’

In Weiss’s penultimate paragraph, she notes, “Jews thrived in an America that had confidence in its goodness. Jews are not safe—no one is—in one which does not.”

Should Republicans regain one or both chambers of Congress in the 2022 elections, one key task, among the many, needs to be added to the “to do” list. There must be a series of hearings probing whether federal employees have been under official pressure to self-censor so as not to transgress against leftist articles of faith, facts be damned—or risk missing out on that promotion.

To the extent Congress finds this is so, it may be too late to reform or undo years of ideological pressure. Instead, Congress needs to do two things: reclaim decision-making authority from an unelected elite increasingly contemptuous of the American public that pays their salaries and generous retirements; and reduce the size, and therefore the ability, of agencies like the FBI to interfere in the lives of law-abiding Americans — such as concerned parents of public school children.

Biden's Homeland Security Announces It Will Investigate Thought Crimes,"The Biden administration has been steadily ratcheting up its abuse of power to attack political enemies and criminalize dissent. The egregious overcharging and heinous treatment of January 6 detainees in the DC gulag is one painful example. But it’s making even more dangerous moves toward creating thought police. And they are bold enough to announce it publicly.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a National Terrorism Advisory Bulletin on Feb. 7, 2022 that outlined their thought crime agenda. It states, “The United States remains in a heightened threat environment fueled by several factors, including an online environment filled with false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories, and other forms of mis- dis- and mal-information (MDM).”

“False or misleading narratives” could very well be used to describe the entire programming schedule of CNN and MSNBC. They even have a TLA (three-letter acronym) for the problem, so you know we’re deep into a bad government solution.

The desire to control what people watch, hear, read and eventually think is deeply embedded in the left’s playbook. They have been at this for generations, but recently have succeeded to the point they are comfortable just saying it outright. They have convinced 40 percent of millennials that “hate speech” is not protected by the First Amendment. The trick now is linking speech they want to shut down to terrorism.

They did that very effectively after the January 6, 2021 riot. They took a political protest that spiraled out of control and labeled it an insurrection or a coup. Then they began to spread that beyond the small number who committed any violence to the vastly larger who peacefully protested. Now they are roping in anyone who supported investigating the election results in any way.

Then they added weak charges of seditious conspiracy for some of the rioters. This ignored the fact that their own indictments showed the conspiracy they found was not to overthrow the government or even the election. It was to have a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) across the river from DC in case Antifa attacked or the unlikely event President Trump himself invoked the Insurrection Act and asked for assistance.

The hysterically named Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the US Capitol is working feverishly to spin all of this into a web. They are unlikely to succeed because all available evidence so far appears to show no actual conspiracy to conduct an attack on the U.S. Capitol.

But the situation has huge usefulness to the Biden administration. It gave them a way to smear large numbers of their political opponents as seditionists, coup plotters, insurrectionists and the big prize, terrorists. That is precisely what they’re aiming at with this new threat document.

“The primary terrorism-related threat to the United States continues to stem from lone offenders or small cells of individuals who are motivated by a range of foreign and/or domestic grievances often cultivated through the consumption of certain online content,” the document states.

They make their goal of speech control perfectly clear by specifying “the consumption of certain online content.” What is stunning is their unashamed belief that policing this falls withing their purview. It seems to call for an agency focused on ensuring that only online content the government feels is legitimate is allowed—a Ministry of Truth, if you will.

The agency gets even more specific: “There is widespread online proliferation of false or misleading narratives regarding unsubstantiated widespread election fraud and COVID-19. Grievances associated with these themes inspired violent extremist attacks during 2021.”

Aha, there it is. Those right-wing extremists are at it again. And pay close attention to the phrasing “inspired violent extremist attacks.” That is a direct path to “incited violent extremist attacks” and to material support for terrorism. That is how they will criminalize speech they dislike.

Currently, this only applies to foreign terror organizations. But at this pace it won’t be long until they extend that to domestic groups.

That fits right in with their earlier National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism from June 2021, which is directed at designating political opponents of the left into that category. They explicitly tie their social engineering agenda to this new threat: “This approach must apply to our efforts to counter domestic terrorism by addressing underlying racism and bigotry.”

Anyone who is not fully on board with the left’s agenda on those topics is part of the problem, and that means you are supporting the domestic terrorists. The Biden administration also foreshadowed the thought policing by announcing they were deputizing the tech tyrants in this noble cause. Jen Psaki admitted from the podium that the administration tells Facebook what posts to censor.

They have now bragged they are using state power paired with private efforts to push a political agenda. This level of coordination calls into question the legality of having the social media sites act to censor things the government cannot. That is forbidden, but it remains now for a case to be made that Facebook, Twitter, and the rest are acting as agents of the government.

The censorship is bad, but this is really social engineering using the threat of a jackboot on your neck or a trip to the gulag as the motivation to comply. That was why they needed the additional terror multiplier.

We must resist and push back the ever-growing abuse of power in this country. If they succeed in criminalizing dissent, the left will have a clear path to the statist paradise they so deeply desire. The next elections must bring people to Washington deeply committed to rooting this out. That can begin with a new Congress writing budget instructions forbidding a single dime be spent on this anti-constitutional garbage.

“A republic, if you can keep it” was Benjamin Franklin’s worry. This is exactly what he meant. Time to do some of that We the People stuff and shut this down.

"If Canada's Crackdown Spirals Out Of Control, Trudeau Will Be To Blame","When Canadian truckers first signaled their intent to assemble a Freedom Convoy protesting their government’s draconian Covid-19 policies, including vaccine mandates and passports, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau blew them off as a “fringe minority.”

Just this week, however, Trudeau invoked for the first time ever the Emergencies Act, the successor law to the War Measures Act, in order to mobilize the Canadian military to crush the Freedom Convoy and forcibly clear the truckers and their rigs from the streets of Ottawa. Somehow, this “fringe minority” has prompted the most authoritarian response from a Canadian government since Trudeau’s father, Pierre Trudeau, deployed soldiers in the October Crisis of 1970 to quell an actual separatist movement, the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ), after it kidnapped the deputy premier of Quebec and a British diplomat.

The October Crisis marked the first time the War Measures Act had ever been invoked in peacetime. But Pierre Trudeau was dealing with actual terrorists (the FLQ had carried out a years-long bombing campaign before the kidnapping, and ended up murdering the deputy premier, Pierre Laporte). His son is dealing with a peaceful, if inconvenient, protest of government policies. Yet here we are, with the younger Trudeau invoking the Emergencies Act for the first time, and taking the remarkable step of treating peaceful protesters as domestic terrorists.

“It is now clear that there are serious challenges to law enforcement’s ability to effectively enforce the law,” Trudeau said at a news conference Monday afternoon. “It is no longer a lawful protest at a disagreement over government policy. It is now an illegal occupation. It’s time for people to go home.”

I want to be very clear about what we are – and are not – doing by invoking the Emergencies Act, and how taking this step will help get the situation under control. In case you missed our announcement earlier today, watch this: pic.twitter.com/htGmZH09Jd — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) February 15, 2022

Days after the Trudeau administration backed GoFundMe’s attempt to deplatform the truckers’ fundraising campaign, Trudeau’s Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland announced that the Canadian government would expand its terrorist financing rules to target crowdfunding sites like the convoy’s new platform GiveSendGo.

“The illegal blockades have highlighted the fact that crowdfunding platforms, and some of the payment service providers they use, are not fully captured under the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act,” she said. “We are making these changes because we know that these platforms are being used to support illegal blockades and illegal activity which is damaging the Canadian economy.”

""We are today serving notice if your truck is being used in these illegal blockades, your corporate accounts will be frozen."" https://t.co/518EU45nZj — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) February 14, 2022

Trudeau’s decision to use the Emergencies Act against Canadian citizens who have already been banned from supporting truckers and threatened with fines and prison time is unprecedented. Historically, the War Measures Act has only been invoked during the two world wars and again in 1970. Now, Trudeau is mobilizing the Canadian military and intelligence agencies against the truckers because he doesn’t like their views.

Let’s be clear: Trudeau and his administration aren’t targeting the truckers because they are violent. Even the prime minister admitted that his issue with the thousands of protesters is that they hold “unacceptable views.”

“The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa, who are holding unacceptable views that they are expressing, do not represent the views of Canadians,” Trudeau said during a press conference in January.

Even then, Trudeau knew the truckers’ true intentions were peaceful, but he didn’t lend them a listening ear. Instead, when the Freedom Convoy arrived at his doorstep, the prime minister fled his Ottowa residence and hid in an undisclosed location. Then he smeared the movement on Twitter and accused the Freedom Convoy of harboring racist vandals.

There is no place in Canada for this behaviour. So, to those responsible: It needs to stop. And to those who joined the convoy but are uncomfortable with the symbols of hatred and division on display: Be courageous and speak out. Do not stand for, or with, intolerance and hate. — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 31, 2022

Today in the House, Members of Parliament unanimously condemned the antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-Black racism, homophobia, and transphobia that we’ve seen on display in Ottawa over the past number of days. Together, let’s keep working to make Canada more inclusive. — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) February 1, 2022

It’s natural to wonder if this weeks-long tension between the Canadian government and Freedom Convoy could have been peacefully resolved if Trudeau had engaged the truckers and offered them an off-ramp. Instead, Trudeau and his team are taking notes from the Democrats’ Jan. 6 committee in the House by cutting off financial pipelines to people they deem “domestic terrorists.” In return, the Biden administration is pressuring the Trudeau government to crack down even harder on what the corporate media have labeled a “nationwide insurrection.”

The truckers and other Canadians who have stuck it out in Ottawa want freedom, and they risked their trucks, gasoline, warmth, finances, and freedom to secure it. Their reward for voicing legitimate concerns about Canada’s draconian Covid policies, however, has been an authoritarian crackdown at the behest of Trudeau, who could have deescalated the situation by listening to the convoy’s concerns. His pride and intolerance, though, allowed only one response: The truckers hold “unacceptable views” and must therefore be treated like terrorists.

By recklessly invoking the Emergencies Act and involving the Canadian military, Trudeau has massively escalated a situation that could now easily spiral out of control. If it does, he will only have himself to blame.

Canadian Veteran: Trudeau Has Declared War On His Own People,"Harold Ristau was born in Kitchener, Ontario, and deployed several times to Iraq and Afghanistan in the Canadian armed forces as a military chaplain. He told a local paper he was motivated to join the military after helping Afghan refugees with asylum cases while he pastored an inner-city church in Montreal. In 2014, Canada awarded Ristau one of its highest military recognitions, the Chief of the Defense Staff Commendation, for “achievements beyond the line of duty.”

He wore that medal atop his veteran uniform when he visited the trucker Freedom Convoy in Ottawa on Feb. 12, he told The Federalist in a phone interview. There, smartphone cameras captured him leading other veterans in slowly dismantling a blockade around a war memorial, then cleaning and decorating the monument. Police stood by and watched.

Then Ristau led attendees in the Lord’s Prayer, Apostle’s Creed, and a rendition of “O, Canada,” the national anthem. He also gave a benediction and led the crowd in an impromptu prayer for peace and the well-being of those in government, as well as accountability for their abuses of the Canadian people over the past two years. The convoy began when the Canadian government started enforcing vaccine passports on truckers and others at its border with the United States.

“We prayed to hold those who have done bad, who need to repent and take account for wrongdoing, that they be held accountable for their sins and receive the mercy of God,” Ristau told The Federalist. “We prayed that there be no injuries, that no one here would have a hateful thought in our hearts, that our hearts would be filled with love.”

Ristau noted that before police closed in on the protesters, the demonstration had a sort of market fair attitude, with bouncy castles for children, soup kitchens for the hungry, and organized cleanups of public property. When there were complaints about the truckers’ noise and local disruptions, they stopped making noise after 6 p.m., local news accounts confirm. He also witnessed that the truckers kept emergency lanes open during their protest to protect locals.

For his peaceful participation in this public assembly, Ristau has faced criticism and threats from fellow pastors, fellow citizens, the government-run Canadian media, and the government itself. On Feb. 14, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act, which he claims allows the Canadian government to seize the children and property of anyone who attended the protest, without a court order or even proceeding.

“Since this legislation was enacted in 1988, we have faced separatist movements that sought to break up the country, terrorist movements that sought to wreak havoc and a pandemic that has brought our society to a standstill. Not once has the federal government resorted to this law or these extraordinary and overreaching measures,” noted Toronto Sun columnist Brian Lilley on Sunday.

The Canadian government has also deployed anti-terrorist banking measures to shut down the personal and crowdfunding accounts of those involved in the protests.

Canadian police arrested nearly 200 protesters Sunday and threatened those who brought their children to the Ottawa protest with up to five years in prison. In response, convoy organizers announced an orderly departure from the nation’s capital. On Monday, the Canadian Senate is scheduled to review Trudeau’s use of the act previously known as the War Measures Act, which was only used once before to unilaterally suspend the rule of law in the country, during a hostage and murder situation in Parliament in the 1970s.

Using the act in response to a peaceful protest with largely only traffic violation-level offenses, Ristau said in an interview with the Christian radio program Issues, Etc. last week, means “you basically declare war on your own people.” As a Canadian veteran — he is now a civilian chaplain supervising Canadian military chaplains — threatening to use war powers against one’s own citizens is a clear breach of law and public trust, he said.

It’s also dangerous to a democracy, in which governments are supposed to wield their powers under the rule of law and with the consent of the governed. Yet “from the get-go Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has treated [the Canadian truckers] like terrorists,” Ristau said on the program. “You don’t negotiate with terrorists.”

Violence related to the protest has been largely used by those opposed to the convoy and its counterparts in other parts of Canada. Perhaps the most significant act of violence was when a man allegedly drove an SUV headlong into convoy supporters, injuring four.

While the Royal Mounted Canadian Police cleared Ottawa streets over the weekend, they trampled several protesters with their horses, including an elderly woman with a walker, according to the Toronto Sun. Police also beat journalists while clearing the streets over the weekend, according to videos. The government is investigating several incidents of alleged police violence and allegedly leaked police messages including “Time for the protesters to hear our jackboots on the ground.”

“Over in Ottawa on Friday they were singing ‘A Mighty Fortress is Our God,” Ristau told The Federalist. “We have masses of people praying in front of the police as they come in and use pepper spray and rubber bullets on them.”

Earlier, the Canadian government and crowdfunding site GoFundMe attempted to confiscate millions of dollars in donations to the convoy. The identities of donors to the fund were publicly released, after which some donors have been fired from their jobs. Private citizens who contributed have had bricks thrown through their shop windows, they told the Sun.

This is who Justin Trudeau is actually targeting with his Emergencies Act orders. — Mark Strahl, MP (@markstrahl) February 20, 2022

“When you make protesting illegality illegal, what does that mean for democracy? That’s why protesters won’t go home and are staying to be arrested. When it’s illegal to protest illegality, what measures do we have left?” Ristau asked.

“Once you’ve named someone a terrorist, I guess you can just do what you want,” Ristau said.

Due to the videos of him praying at the protest, Ristau told The Federalist, he received a death threat confirmed by local police, besides other forms of severe social rebuke. The father of five children ages 19 and younger says being treated as a domestic terrorist for peacefully petitioning his government to stop violating both Canadian laws and his Christian beliefs says he’s been more frightened by Trudeau suspending civil liberties over a peaceful protest than almost anything else in his 50 years of life.

“I’m not a chicken. I’ve been on the frontline overseas—Iraq, Afghanistan several times. I’ve been shot at, I’ve been blown off my feet. I’ve been at mass graves, I’ve been at mass casualties. I can’t count the number of bodies I’ve moved,” he told The Federalist. “I still have combat boots that I use for gardening. They’re a reminder to me of the good men, Americans and Canadians, who died for freedom. And it’s always a reminder of the importance of freedom. It’s not just about my rights but it’s also about being able to spread the gospel and to be human, to be the person God has made me to be.”

Ristau said in the last two years in Canada, the government has used people’s fear of Covid to suspend basic human rights, as well as sneak through radical changes to social policy. Those have included proposals to legally make abortion a human right — making pro-lifers de facto opponents of “human rights” — and let children medically mutilate their bodies without parental consent. Many Canadian hospitals and doctors now deny medical care to people who aren’t vaccinated.

“There hasn’t been a climate of ‘we can agree to disagree.’ Hence, people are being fired and losing their incomes and their livelihoods because they’re not vaccinated,” he said. The Freedom Convoy participants, most of whom were vaccinated, said this was too far.

Ristau also noted that government discrimination has not only been based on people’s medical decisions, but also has encompassed clear discrimination against religion. Canadian Covid regulations have banned people from singing in church, attending church for large stretches of time or unless they accept government-demanded medical procedures, handling the body and blood of Christ as their churches require, and from attending church without registering their names with the government. All of these are clear violations of the Bible or classic Christian teachings.

So Ristau considers objecting to Covid impositions not only his civic duty, but also “as standing for the sake of Christ. As a Christian, I am interested in ensuring that our freedom of speech is ensured, that the preaching of the gospel is not muzzled.”

Canada’s Parliament is considering a bill, C10, that would censor public statements of basic Christian teachings, such as about sex and marriage. It would also censor public criticism of the government, such as possibly social media postings about the Freedom Convoy and any dissent from Covid regulations.

Ristau noted both that a good number of Canadians — half in some polls — support the Freedom Convoy, but that he and his family have been repeatedly ostracized for their objections to the last two years of increasing tyranny under an unending state of emergency. But he can’t be silent, he said, even at the risk of losing his job or being prosecuted for attending a peaceful protest: “My parents escaped from Germany under the Nazis and Communists. I’ve seen real terrorism. Our freedoms are at stake here.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/21/decorated-canadian-veteran-and-pastor-trudeau-has-declared-war-on-his-own-people/,2022-02-21
GOP Senators Object To Proposal To Label Mask Objectors ‘Terrorists’,"More than half a dozen Republican senators penned a letter last week demanding the Department of Justice (DOJ) reject a request to stamp those who protest airplane mask mandates as “terrorists.”

Earlier this month, Delta Air Lines’ CEO Ed Bastian asked the DOJ to add travelers convicted of “unruly” conduct to a new “no-fly” list barring access to commercial air transport. Such conduct warranting the same expulsion granted to suspected terrorists include those who’ve resisted compliance with mask requirements, which made up nearly three-quarters of airplane disputes last year, according to data from the Federal Aviation Administration published by CNBC.

“Like other airlines, Delta maintains its own no-fly list for anyone who disrupts onboard safety or refuses to comply with crew instructions,” Bastian wrote in a Washington Post op-ed Tuesday doubling down on his request. “But unfortunately, we’ve seen cases in which unruly passengers have simply switched airlines and continued to fly even after endangering flight safety… Only a comprehensive list overseen by the federal government can close the loopholes and prevent disrupters from flying.”

Last week, Republican lawmakers objected to the push for treating those who protest airplane mask mandates as suspected terrorists.

“While airlines are currently free to deny service to any individual over past transgressions on their flights, the federal government’s role in denying access to the commercial aviation network has been limited to ensuring that suspected terrorists remain off of domestic flights,” senators wrote. “The creation of this list by DOJ would result in a severe restriction on the ability of citizens to fully exercise their constitutional right to engage in interstate transportation.”

Face masks have been required on airplanes since President Joe Biden took office last year and signed the mandate as one of his first moves in office. On track to expire March 18, the mandate is likely to be extended again as compulsory facial coverings have become a religious movement among leftists.

“While we strongly condemn any violence towards airline workers,” lawmakers added, “there is significant uncertainty around the efficacy of this mandate.”

The Republicans pointed to Senate testimony from the CEO of Southwest Airlines in December who conceded the masks “don’t add much” to passenger protection from the Wuhan coronavirus considering sophisticated ventilation on modern aircraft.

“The statistics, I recall, is that 99.97 percent of airborne pathogens are captured by the [high-efficiency particulate air] filtering system,” Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. “It’s turned over every two or three minutes.”

The efficacy of masks to stop transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus to begin with remains ambiguous at best.

Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who led the letter to Garland last week with seven GOP colleagues, told The Federalist no-fly lists have already barred law-abiding travelers from commercial airline access.

“There are real concerns about the current no-fly list for terrorists, because it has accidentally stopped honest, law-abiding Americans,” Lummis said. “This is unacceptable, and I have real concerns that an additional no-fly list would do that more and more.”

Lummis also pointed to collusion between the DOJ and the National School Boards Association (NSBC) last fall seeking to indict concerned parents about race-based curricula and obsessive COVID protocols as “domestic terrorists” as reason to be skeptical of the department’s approach weaponizing the “terrorist” label on political dissidents. Garland admitted before House lawmakers in October the NSBA’s recommendation motivated the DOJ to use resources investigating upset parents.

Biden AG Merrick Garland concedes that he started targeting parents for ""possible domestic terrorism"" because the NSBA sent a letter. pic.twitter.com/ZDvhZ6vDzO — The First (@TheFirstonTV) October 21, 2021

“Given concerns over the Department of Education and Department of Justice’s responses to parents protesting radical school boards, I think my concerns about this list are doubly warranted,” Lummis told The Federalist, as liberal columnists such as the Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin claim Republicans are defending “thugs.” “The Department of Justice must not unilaterally create a new no-fly list to restrict the constitutional rights of American citizens.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/02/27/gop-senators-object-to-proposal-to-label-mask-objectors-terrorists/,2022-02-27
Biden Admin Released A Border-Crossing Terrorist Suspect Into The U.S.,"AUSTIN, Texas –On Feb. 16, Republican Congress members asked House Democrats for permission to hold a hearing about a decision to release a suspected Islamist terrorist who in November swam the Rio Grande into Texas.

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security, penned the request to subcommittee Chair Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, in part on grounds that “There is no known case in which a foreign national who pinged on a terror watch list was simply released on his own recognizance. The facts in the case strongly suggest that the Biden Administration failed to follow appropriate protocols with respect to suspected terrorists.”

Eight GOP lawmakers on the subcommittee signed the letter. But it appears House Democrats are not as interested. An aide in the congressman’s office said they’ve heard nothing: “They’re ignoring us.” Two of my own emailed requests to Lee’s spokesperson went unanswered.

The silent treatment should come as no surprise in this era of sharp partisanship. The GOP co-signatories probably understood this when they sent the letter. But they had to send it anyway because the case at the root of this partisan kerfuffle is too serious for stupid swordsmanship. This one deserves a real hearing, perhaps an inspector general investigation, and media inquiry as the objectively non-partisan homeland security matter this is.

The case of Lebanon-born Venezuelan Issam Bazzi’s release into the American interior is just the latest such incident that raises serious questions. Chief among them is whether the historic mass-migration crisis at the U.S. southern border has seriously degraded national security.

How This Terrorist Suspect Was Set Free

Bazzi was among a swell of Venezuelans who began crossing the Rio Grande in escalating numbers last November on word that the United States was handing out free passes into the interior. Some 25,000 turned themselves in at the border in December and another 22,000 did in January. According to leaked Department of Homeland Security documents in my possession, Bazzi flew with his wife and daughter to Monterrey, Mexico, in early November, then swam the river into Brownsville, Texas.

His name and fingerprints flagged him as on the FBI’s terrorism watch list, so a mistaken identity is unlikely. In the lexicon of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Bazzi is described in the documents as a “Category 5 group member,” which can mean not considered armed and dangerous. But one of the government documents noted Bazzi’s file “contains substantive high side derogatory information.”

As I explain in my book, “America’s Covert Border War,” danger level is irrelevant for what is supposed to happen with any border-crossing terrorist group member on the FBI’s watch list. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website notes that “generally, any individual who is a member of a ‘terrorist organization’ … is ‘inadmissible and is ineligible for most immigration benefits.”

FBI agents operating in line with established post-9/11 protocols interrogate watch-listed migrants and others from countries of national security interest who cross the southern border and end up in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers. That happened when Bazzi was flagged as a suspected terrorist in Brownsville, Texas, after his crossing. But then the process went off the rails.

After interviewing Bazzi, the FBI cited “highly derogatory information” in deciding he was a flight risk and recommended ICE keep the 50-year-old Venezuelan in custody. Typically, migrants suspected of terrorism are deported to their home countries, even if they have no “highly derogatory” intelligence information on their records and don’t pose a flight risk, as the FBI said of Bazzi.

Granted, the United States could not have deported Bazzi to Venezuela because of American diplomatic estrangement with the Nicolas Madura regime. But DHS would have known that the Biden administration was working on an agreement with Colombia to air-deport Venezuelan border-jumpers there. Starting January 31, the United States began deporting Venezuelans to Colombia under that agreement.

But Bazzi was not in custody for that to happen. Something so far off the grid as to defy belief happened instead. ICE headquarters in Washington D.C. ordered Bazzi released into the United States on his own recognizance to pursue an asylum claim in Michigan, where he had family, according to the DHS documents.

This order came in defiance of the FBI’s recommendation. The reason? Bazzi was claimed to be at heightened risk from Covid-19 in the detention center due to a “Chronic Care Condition – Overweight,” the leaked DHS documents said.

Someone in federal homeland security leaked sensitive internal documents about this to Pulitizer Prize-winning former New York Times reporter Charlie LeDuff, who ran a story in a Detroit-area online publication that no other reporter has even tried to follow. LeDuff told me he made contact with Bazzi and relatives who, in brief telephone communications, denied he was a terrorist and said they had no idea why he was on a terrorism watch list.

Even Deeper Causes for Concern

According to the documents, U.S. authorities had denied Bazzi a tourist visa in 2019 to visit relatives in the Detroit area. His FBI terrorism watch list status was cited for declining him. Those systems worked in keeping him out of the country.

All thinking Americans on either side of the political aisle should find unity in asking why Bazzi’s illegal crossing of the southern border and merely asking for asylum got him inside the country. The obvious initial indicator, short of more answers, is that a border defense failed in an important national security function, most probably because a mass migration crisis of historic proportions. An overloading 2 million apprehensions during 2021, the most since the nation began counting in 1960, has broken management systems down there.

Instead of the outcome for Bazzi’s tourist visa application, Bazzi’s illegal border crossing has him living free on his own recognizance pending the outcome of an asylum case that, also because of the border, will allow him total freedom for years because of a vastly expanded immigration court backlog.

Mexico Also Released a Yemeni Terror Suspect

One reason to suspect the mass migration crisis has heightened a once fairly managed national security threat is that the Bazzi case is now the second one I have found where border counterterrorism protocols apparently broke under the weight. Mexico is staggering under the mass migration on its side too.

According to other government documents leaked to me, Mexican immigration in April 2021 caught a Yemeni just as he was about to cross into Del Rio, Texas. At that early stage of the mass migration crisis, collaborative protocols with the Americans, as I also report in “America’s Covert Border War,” seemed to be working. Notified, the Americans would have run the name and fingerprints through databases and gotten the FBI watch list hit; Yemeni national Ahmed Mohammed Ahmed was a “Category 5” member of a terrorist organization.

The Mexicans tried to deport Ahmed to Yemen. It didn’t work out. An American law enforcement intelligence source told me the Mexican intelligence officers prematurely left him at a European transit airport and returned to Mexico. Ahmed abandoned his connecting flight and returned to Mexico, too. The Mexicans caught him again in July 2021, preparing to cross into Del Rio.

By then, Mexico was struggling to manage historic numbers of migrants. They kept him for five months. But instead of deporting him this time, Mexico let Ahmed go free, an act the Americans would never have previously agreed to.

Screen shot from government document obtained by the author.

Ahmed was supposed to check in weekly with immigration once a week but, of course, disappeared. The release so alarmed the Americans that they sent out a “Be On The Lookout” bulletin to law enforcement on the Texas side to capture him. It’s unclear if anyone ever did.

Serious Action Needed, Stat

Next to the need for all Americans to demand Ahmed’s capture or evidence of it, there’s another important takeaway from this incident. It is that, like the mishandling of Bazzi, this one also presented a sharp departure from normal protocols.

President Biden barely mentioned the southern border in his March 1 State of the Union speech. Biggs needled him on Twitter at one point during the border part of the speech, expressing frustration: “You released a suspected terrorist from ICE custody so he wouldn’t catch COVID,” Biggs tweeted.

The frustration amid the silence on these cases is understandable. Democrats must hold their noses and unify with Biggs and his GOP cohort in pressing for answers.

Among the many questions they will need to ask is this: How many other border-crossing migrants on the FBI’s terror watch list have breached U.S. defensive measures apparently faltering under the border crisis?",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/04/the-biden-admin-released-a-suspected-terrorist-into-the-united-states-after-he-illegally-crossed-the-border/,2022-03-04
Docs: NBC Promised To Go Easy On Biden Official's Domestic Terrorism,"New documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the government watchdog Protect the Public’s Trust shared exclusively with The Federalist show NBC News sought to downplay a key Biden nominee’s links to domestic terrorism.

As President Joe Biden’s pick to lead the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Tracy Stone-Manning, faced controversy for her involvement with a 1989 Idaho tree spiking case last summer, NBC’s Josh Lederman sought comment from the Interior Department whether the administration stood by its nominee for the preeminent land agency.

Stone-Manning had been granted immunity in the case when she agreed to testify against her co-conspirators that she had retyped and sent an anonymous letter to the Forest Service for her friend and former roommate, John T. Blount. The letter warned of 500 pounds of “spikes measuring 8 to 10 inches in length” driven into trees of the Clearwater National Forest targeted for harvest. Such spikes can kill and maim foresters, firefighters, and animals.

“We will not go overboard on it or anything,” Lederman promised Interior Spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz on July 8. “It’s a legitimate story given the position to which she has been nominated. But we will point out that a) she did not participate in spiking trees herself, b) she was not charged, c) this was decades ago when she was in her early 20s, and d) her record is otherwise unblemished.”

Stone-Manning’s early environmental activism jeopardized her nomination to manage the more than 245 million acres under BLM oversight.

Tree spiking is a form of domestic terrorism wherein environmental activists jam 8-to-10 inch metal rods into trees. It was a popular tactic among left-wing activists 30 years ago.

Meant to terrorize mill workers as a deterrent to the lumber industry, the spikes would explode saws when processed, sending deadly steel shrapnel flying upon impact. Two years before Stone-Manning’s group spiked trees in northern Idaho, a 23-year-old millworker lost teeth and part of his cheek and jaw when an 11-inch spike driven into a tree shattered a large band saw he operated.

Senate Republicans objected to Stone-Manning’s appointment as an eco-terrorist whose group’s forest variant of roadside car bombs may still be planted in trees today, putting firefighters’ lives at risk. The nominee also lied to lawmakers about her involvement in the tree spiking case in a written questionnaire, provoking a complaint filed by Protect the Public’s Trust with the Department of Interior’s office of inspector general.

Memories of Stone-Manning’s radical community organizing remain fresh among residents of western Montana. On the Senate floor ahead of the full chamber vote, Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis railed against Stone-Manning as “one of the most egregious nominations to ever receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.”

Stone-Manning was ultimately confirmed in September along party lines.

In Montana, memories of Stone-Manning’s aggressive activism remained fresh in the mountain towns terrorized by tree spiking https://t.co/89gI5rKAve — Tristan Justice (@JusticeTristan) October 1, 2021

Stone-Manning’s nomination was also made controversial by the resurfacing of her 1993 graduate thesis which condemned children as an “environmental hazard” and called for Chinese-style child caps.

NBC’s pledge to airbrush a Democrat official is not the first time a legacy outlet has been found making such promises. Last summer, New York Times writer Elizabeth Williamson repeatedly asked Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to sit for a profile interview. After Haaland’s office refused, Williamson pleaded and seemed to assure positive coverage.

“I do think it’ll look a bit odd since so many of her colleague[s] sent and friends have spoken w[ith] me,” Williamson wrote last May in an email obtained by The Federalist through the Freedom of Information Act. “This sometimes happens on tough stories but rather a mystery here! … I still hope she will reconsider.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/07/new-documents-show-nbc-promised-to-go-easy-on-biden-officials-domestic-terrorism/,2022-03-07
'Antilynching' Law Could Let Feds Jail You For Crimes You Never Commit,"Touted as an overdue (if duplicative) law that no one could disagree with, the Emmett Till Antilynching Act signed by President Biden last week includes a subtle provision that could boost the Biden administration’s war on wrongthink.

The bill sailed through the U.S. Senate and the House with ease. The tactful naming made the bill radioactive to oppose, which is why 422 congressmen voted in favor while only three opposed.

Rep. Thomas Massie, one of the three who voted against the bill, expressed a handful of concerns, including that there are a limited number of constitutionally specified federal crimes, that lynching is already criminalized, and that “Adding enhanced penalties for ‘hate’ [on top of existing criminal punishments] tends to endanger other liberties such as freedom of speech.”

He also highlighted another potential pitfall of the legislation: “The bill creates another federal crime of ‘conspiracy,’ which I’m concerned could be enforced overbroadly on people who are not perpetrators of a crime.” Here’s the section Massie is referring to:

Whoever conspires to commit any offense under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) shall, if death or serious bodily injury (as defined in section 2246 of this title) results from the offense, or if the offense includes kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, be imprisoned for not more than 30 years, fined in accordance with this title, or both.

The bill amends the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, passed in 2009, which defines and criminalizes hate crimes. The minimum qualification is an attempt “to cause bodily injury” due to the victim’s race, sexual orientation, nationality, gender, religion, or disability.

Bodily injury can be defined as “physical pain” or “any other injury to the body, no matter how temporary.” Sensibly, the 2009 law requires an attempt at violence to be made, which is a crime itself regardless of prejudiced motives. The new “antilynching” law takes this a step further by criminalizing “conspiracy” to commit certain hate crimes.

I’m sure someone will retort: conspiracy to commit a federal crime is already a federal crime. This is not a universally accepted interpretation of conspiracy law, nor does the law’s language or historical precedent justify such a broad interpretation — hence the ostensible necessity for the new antilynching law. Criminalized conspiracies are those plotting “against the United States” – like the Volkswagen executives who attempted to defraud the Environmental Protection Agency by faking emission results and, more recently, the leader of the Oath Keepers who plead guilty to seditious conspiracy for his part in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot.

So as of last Tuesday, it is illegal to simply “agree” to participate in an act if it falls under the categories highlighted above. One can imagine dark political humor venturing into these categories (a comment such as “I hate so-and-so so much I could kill him,” for example) being interpreted as “conspiring to lynch.”

The key issue here is that intent should not be the sole subject of a court case. The purpose of courts is for a neutral arbiter to determine whether someone’s rights were violated during an encounter between two parties. Conspiracy, if no action is taken in pursuit of it, involves only one party: the conspirators. Therefore, it alone constitutes no crime as it couldn’t have possibly violated someone else’s rights.

With this new law, the U.S. government has further expanded into the realm of policing thought crimes. Ominously, this law comes on the heels of the Department of Homeland Security’s attempt to broaden the “domestic terrorism” category and expand methods for identifying “threats.”

For those unaware, killings attributed to domestic extremists in 2020 and 2021 were each far lower than in the previous five years. Overall there were only 29 such killings in 2021. Despite this, we continue to hear fearmongering from those in power.

FBI Director Christopher Wray went before Congress last year to declare “The problem of domestic terrorism has been metastasizing across the country for a number of years.” Attorney General Merrick Garland adopted a similar tone, warning “Domestic violent extremists pose an elevated threat in 2021, and in the FBI’s view, the top domestic violent extremist threat we face comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race.”

“Domestic violent extremism poses the most lethal and persistent terrorism-related threat to our country today,” claimed Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last spring. A White House press release added: “The two most lethal elements of today’s domestic terrorism threat are (1) racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists who advocate for the superiority of the white race and (2) anti-government or anti-authority violent extremists, such as militia violent extremists.”

It’s a mountain-out-of-a-molehill on par with the “Don’t Say Gay” hysteria. But this one may have far greater consequences down the road as texts, emails, social media posts, and everyday speech are monitored and analyzed by various three-letter agencies to establish the intent of our discourse. The Emmett Till Act may become a key piece in the arsenal for U.S. intelligence agencies’ war on free speech.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/05/new-antilynching-federal-law-could-let-prosecutors-imprison-you-for-a-crime-you-never-committed/,2022-04-05
Reps: Did Biden Funnel $3.5B Away From Terror Victims Toward Ex-Staff?,"Image Credit Tom Lohdan / Flickr

A trio of House Republicans is investigating whether the Biden administration improperly steered funds destined to compensate victims of terrorism to a former Biden official’s own post-employment coffers.

In February, President Joe Biden issued an executive order allocating $3.5 billion in seized assets from the Afghanistan Central Bank be held within the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as opposed to the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund (VSST Fund) where such funds might typically be held. The fund, established by Congress in 2015, sets money aside to compensate victims who suffered from entities designated by the United States as state sponsors of terrorism, such as the Taliban.

“To the extent that this plan is legal,” lawmakers wrote of Biden’s directive in a letter to the White House, “it deliberately avoids Congressionally-established mechanisms for the compensation of victims of terrorism to benefit a set of politically-connected plaintiffs and trial lawyers at the expense of other victims of terrorism.”

One lawyer who stands to “reap a windfall in attorney’s fees” by representing clients with claims against the Taliban known as the “Havlish Plaintiffs” was intimately involved in White House policy on Afghanistan after the botched American withdrawal in August.

Lee Wolosky, who also represented Russia hoaxer Fiona Hill, was hired by the West Wing in September and worked “with the National Security Council (NSC) and other administration officials on resettlement, as well as other issues related to the U.S. drawdown in Afghanistan,” according to Axios. The NSC also led the way on how to handle the $3.5 billion worth of Afghanistan assets circumventing the compensatory process created by Congress. Wolosky now works at Jenner & Block representing the Havlish Plaintiffs to a handsome payout.

“The White House has denied that Wolosky was involved in the Afghanistan Central Bank assets deliberations,” acknowledged Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Mike Johnson, R-La., and Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., in their joint letter sent Tuesday. “However, the White House’s apparent desire to avoid the established VSST Fund process, the steering of assets to plaintiffs represented by a recently-departed White House official, and the sheer amount of money at issue raise considerable questions.”

The trio of lawmakers gave White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain an April 19 deadline to provide “all documents and communications” related to deliberations surrounding the distribution of the bank’s seized assets and Wolosky’s tenure.

The letter comes as the administration remains embroiled in conflicts stemming from the president’s familial business dealings with overseas actors which openly predated Biden’s 2020 election but only recently captured legitimacy among Beltway media.

On Monday, the New York Post reported on a Hunter Biden grand jury honing in on the identity of “the big guy” in a bombshell email published in October 2020 wherein the anonymous individual was slated to receive 10 percent from a lucrative cash and equity deal. “The big guy” has long been assumed to refer to President Biden after a former family business partner, Tony Bobulinski, went on record to claim so shortly after the email discussing “remuneration packages” surfaced.

"The Feds Are So Desperate For 'White Supremacy,' They're Fabricating It","Image Credit ABC 7 Chicago

Last Friday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas declared white supremacists and “domestic violent extremism” to be the “most prominent threat” currently facing our country. The timing could not have been more perfect. Just hours later, a jury in Grand Rapids, Michigan exposed the Justice Department’s largest alleged “domestic terrorism” case of the last 18 months as a failed FBI entrapment scheme to smear conservatives as white supremacists ahead of the 2020 election.

By refusing to convict four men accused of plotting to kidnap and kill Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer before Election Day 2020, the Grand Rapids jury seemed to side with defense attorneys who argued their clients were not domestic terrorists, but entrapped by undercover FBI agents and at least a dozen informants who planned and funded the kidnapping operation.

“The key to the government’s plan was to turn general discontent with Gov. Whitmer’s COVID-19 restrictions into a crime that could be prosecuted,” defense lawyers wrote in a joint motion. “The government picked what it knew would be a sensational charge: conspiracy to kidnap the governor. When the government was faced with evidence showing that the defendants had no interest in a kidnapping plot, it refused to accept failure and continued to push its plan.”

Needing Terrorists to Justify Counterterrorism

The FBI’s governor-kidnaping hoax demonstrates just how serious federal law enforcement agencies are about pursuing domestic extremists, even if it means the alleged threat originates in Washington, D.C. or FBI field offices.

Mayorkas’s doubling-down on the threat of white supremacists, even in light of DOJ’s failure in Michigan, is a result of the time and resources the Biden administration and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have dedicated to fighting this perceived threat instead of actual threats, such as the massive migrant surge expected to overwhelm U.S. borders next month.

In his first address to Congress, President Joe Biden cited “white supremacist terrorism” as the “most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today.”

In March 2021, DHS and the FBI issued a joint memo warning that “domestic extremists” were ramping up to “take control of the U.S. Capitol and remove democratic lawmakers on or about the 4th of March.” Nothing happened on March 4.

In June 2021, DHS issued a warning, without evidence, that the centennial commemoration of the Tulsa Race Massacre might be a target of extremism. Nothing happened that day either.

That same month, the Biden White House issued a “fact sheet“ entitled the “National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.” It claimed that “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists who advocate for the superiority of the white race” are a top domestic terror threat facing America.

This “white supremacist” drumbeat was just the precursor to the creation of a new “domestic terrorism unit,” the Justice Department announced it was forming in January this year. Of course, we experienced a similar overaction in the Bush-era, when DHS was created to protect us all from another 9/11, which also led to the kinds of mass surveillance and accusations of FBI entrapment that we are witnessing now.

If the Whitmer case is any indication, this type of hyperfocus will incentivize federal law enforcement to go to whatever lengths necessary when investigating potential domestic extremists, no matter how overstated the risk.

23 Suspected Terrorists Were Stopped On The Southern Border In 2021,"Federal law enforcement caught at least 23 suspected terrorists crossing the southern border last year, according to documents revealed exclusively by Fox News and published Monday.

The 23 individuals were named on the terror watchlist, including four in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, four in the Del Rio Sector, four in the El Centro Sector, four in the San Diego Sector, three in the El Paso Sector, two in the Tuscon Sector, and two in the Yuma Sector, according to Fox News based on records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) is a government record to maintain information related to those who are known or “reasonably suspected” of engagement in terrorist activity. Most individuals listed are foreign nationals with no connection to the United States, according to the FBI, which doesn’t confirm individuals’ status on the list. Republicans, however, have made repeated demands the Biden administration disclose how many on the list have been apprehended at the border.

In August, retiring U.S. Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott warned his 19,000 agents that known or suspected terrorists were entering the United States “at a level we have never seen before.”

“Over and over again, I see other people talk about our mission, your mission, and the context of it being immigration or the current crisis today being an immigration crisis,” said Scott. “I firmly believe that it is a national security crisis. Immigration is just a subcomponent of it, and right, now it’s just a cover for massive amounts of smuggling going across the southwest border — to include TSDBs at a level we have never seen before. That’s a real threat.”

Last month, eight House Republicans led by Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security demanded hearings about the release of a suspected terrorist who swam across the Rio Grande River.

Lebanon-born Venezuelan Issam Bazzi was reportedly released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) despite being listed on the FBI terrorism database. Citing “highly derogatory information,” the FBI worried Bazzi posed a flight risk and recommended detention. Leaked documents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) however, show Bazzi was released from custody to pursue asylum in Michigan.

“There is no known case in which a foreign national who pinged on a terror watch list was simply released on his own recognizance,” lawmakers wrote in February month demanding a hearing from their Democrat colleagues. “The facts in the case strongly suggest that the Biden Administration failed to follow appropriate protocols with respect to suspected terrorists.”

After President Joe Biden’s border crisis erupted last spring with arrests at an all-time record, Federalist Senior Editor John Davidson warned in October, “Left Unchecked, Biden’s Border Crisis Will Become The New Normal.”

“Never before have federal authorities made so many arrests at the southwest border,” Davidson wrote after agents arrested 1,659,206 in the fiscal year. “This year topped the previous record in 2000 by about 15,000 illegal immigrants, marking a new milestone in what has become the dreary annals of America’s porous and crisis-stricken border.”

According to Fox News, more than 62,000 illegal immigrants, an average of 2,000 per day, evaded law enforcement while entering the country in March. More than 300,000 others have already been declared “gotaways,” or “migrants who escaped capture by border patrol since the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.”",https://thefederalist.com/2022/04/19/23-suspected-terrorists-were-stopped-on-the-southern-border-in-2021-how-many-werent/,2022-04-19
"Bill Would Let Feds Purge Military, Police With Charges Of 'Hate Crimes'","A bill in Congress would create new domestic terrorism units within the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and FBI tasked with spying on Americans considered terrorist threats, then investigating and prosecuting them.

H.R. 350, also known as the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act (DTPA) of 2022, is making its way through the House Judiciary Committee. It would give federal law enforcement agencies the power to classify as “domestic terrorism” whatever the federal government considers a “hate crime.” One of the new “domestic terrorism” agencies the bill would create would focus on “domestic terrorism matters that may also be hate crime incidents.”

These new “domestic terrorism” agencies would also “ensure that such programs include training and resources to assist…law enforcement agencies in understanding, detecting, deterring, and investigating acts of domestic terrorism and White supremacist and neo-Nazi infiltration of law enforcement and corrections agencies.”

Of course, many of those in power consider the Constitution and patriotism to be acts of “white supremacy.” That is openly stated by purveyors of the 1619 Project and its effective champions in the federal bureaucracy.

According to critical race theory, anyone born with pale skin is a potential “white supremacist” by means of his or her inborn “white privilege.” That means this bill could ultimately give federal agents the power to charge local law enforcement officers who love the Constitution with the “domestic terrorist” crime of “white supremacy.” This use of racial division to transfer local police power to federal agencies is already underway.

The Biden administration has also already proven itself willing to apply the extremist label of “domestic terrorists” to parents who publicly disagree with critical race theory at local school board meetings. This bill is exactly in step with that view of dissent as not only merely criminal, but an act of domestic terrorism. So is the Biden White House’s new “Disinformation Governance Board,” which also classifies dissent as a concern for federal law enforcement.

Indeed, H.R. 3350 would also set up a potential federal purge of U.S. law enforcement and military units. It sets up a federal “task force” “to analyze and combat White supremacist and neo-Nazi infiltration of the uniformed services and Federal law enforcement agencies.”

No reasonable person opposes legitimate policing of actual terrorist activities. The problem with the DTPA is that it is being set up for use as a political weapon against conservatives, Republicans, concerned parents, and anyone else who opposes the ruling class.

That is clear also from reading press releases from the bill’s sponsors. In a 2021 press release, main bill sponsor Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Illinois, attempted to indict Donald Trump supporters as domestic terrorists and presented the DTPA as a tool to suppress them: “Unlike after 9/11, the threat that reared its ugly head on January 6th is from domestic terror groups and extremists, often racially-motivated violent individuals.”

Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler also pushed the false idea that the 2021 Capitol riot was a domestic terrorist attack, as opposed to a riot: “In the wake of the domestic terrorist attack on our Capitol two weeks ago, it is painfully clear that the current approach to addressing the real and persistent threat posed by white nationalism and similar ideologies is not working.”

These politicians are not hiding their intentions. They are openly using disinformation and deception to brand anyone who dares question their activities as “domestic terrorists,” “white supremacists,” and “white nationalists.”

The act was first introduced in 2017, long before the events on Jan. 6, 2021. Past iterations have included a “findings” section that lists violent incidents the authors attribute to “white supremacists,” “white nationalists,” and “far-right-wing extremists.”

The 2020 version referenced a 2017 shooting in Canada and a 2019 shooting in New Zealand. It’s unclear why international cases were included in a bill that promotes the idea of a rise in U.S. domestic terrorism. Additionally, the 2020 shooting by Kyle Rittenhouse that a jury concluded was justified self-defense was added to the bill as an example of right-wing extremism.

Absent from the earlier bill version’s findings, however, were mass shootings and attacks by apparent left-wing extremists. No mention was made of the 2016 Pulse Nightclub massacre of 49 people by a Muslim domestic terrorist or the 2017 mass shooting of four white men by Muslim extremist Kori Ali Muhammed, nor the violent attacks across the country by Antifa in 2020.

The findings section was stripped out of the current 2021-2022 version of the bill, but it’s a good indicator of its underlying purpose. So are the events of the past several years, as the label “domestic terrorism” has been applied increasingly more often to Democrats’ domestic political opponents.

Perhaps the most notable of such examples is the January 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol. Leftist media and politicians continue to promote the false narrative that the riot was a planned and organized “insurrection,” a terrorist act during which multiple people, including police officers, were killed. They are keeping these lies alive in the minds of vulnerable Americans, providing a springboard for things like unusually harsh prosecutions and detainment, the partisan and possibly illegal January 6 commission, and legislation like H.R. 350.

The false premise of January 6 protesters being domestic terrorists has resulted in the justification of solitary confinement. It has also led to biased judges passing excessive sentences for misdemeanors. Giving federal law enforcement agencies more tools to brand certain groups of Americans as terrorists will likely lead to more such abuses.

The alleged kidnapping plot against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 is another prime example of an attempt to link those on the right, including Trump supporters with domestic terrorism, militia groups, and white supremacists. Although two of the defendants have now been acquitted of charges, and evidence points to at least one of those defendants holding anarchist views and expressing anti-Trump sentiment, the media and government right-wing “domestic terrorist” narrative has remained the same.

That narrative is all-important to the DTPA. Section 3(d) of the act directs the joint domestic terrorism offices to ”focus their limited resources on the most significant domestic terrorism threats, as determined by the number of domestic terrorism-related incidents … for the preceding 6 months.” Applying the label of “domestic terrorism” to those on the political right allows the joint offices to continue focusing their resources on them while ignoring left-wing threats.

When you pair false accusations of terrorism against political opponents with new federal law enforcement offices dedicated to combating “domestic terrorism,” it becomes quite obvious what those new offices are actually intended for. There are already recent, unresolved instances of federal agencies using their investigative powers to intimidate and harass conservatives for political reasons. These include the Russia collusion conspiracy against President Trump (which was aided by two federal departments given more resources here, the DOJ and FBI), the FBI raid on Project Veritas’s conservative journalists, and the designation by the Justice Department of parents opposed to radical local school boards as “domestic terrorists.”

This bill’s great expansion of the domestic surveillance apparatus in America would threaten civil liberties and freedom. The offices created by this act would surely be staffed by radical officials of the Biden administration intent on keeping power and wielding it with a heavy hand.

Contact your representatives and senators to tell them how dangerous this bill is. Then tell friends and family about it and encourage them to speak up too.

Congrats To The Media For Finally Finding A White Supremacist,"Assuming the gunman who shot up the Buffalo, New York, grocery store really was motivated by anti-black racism, let’s do what the media do when faced with an Islamic terrorist who goes on a killing spree in America and just refer to him as a “lone wolf,” a mentally unstable individual who in no way reflects any broader phenomenon or trend.

Except, unlike with violent Muslim extremism, that characterization in this case would be true.

Despite what the media, Democrats, leftists, and, of course, the permanent Washington bureaucracy say (over, and over, and over again), there is no imminent, large-scale threat from white nationalists. It doesn’t exist outside of Joe Biden’s TelePrompter.

To that claim, leftists would surely point to news reports and declarations by the U.S. Justice Department and Homeland Security. The New York Times has been all over it.

“Top law enforcement officials say the biggest domestic terror threat comes from white supremacists.”— New York Times, June 15, 2021

“Homeland Security Dept. Affirms Threat of White Supremacy After Years of Prodding.”—New York Times, Oct. 1, 2019

“The Grave Threats of White Supremacy and Far-Right Extremism.”—New York Times, Feb. 22, 2019

Even under Donald Trump—especially under Donald Trump—the permanent bureaucracy had been hyperventilating about “white supremacy” and the existential threat it supposedly represented to every American, and even democracy itself.

Strangely enough, though, there isn’t a ton of publicly available government data on the topic. More often than not, a government agency or official makes an assertion about white supremacists on a rampage and we’re just supposed to take it as fact without hearing any specifics.

For a threat so pervasive, prolific, and prominent, wouldn’t you expect there to be a nearly unlimited body of work readily available for the public to consume and understand just how grave it is?

It’s not there. You’re supposed to believe it anyway.

Sorry, government, but would you mind showing me your work on this thing you’re telling me is imminently deadly?

Shut your racist mouth!

In the final months of Trump’s term, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf released a report titled “Homeland Threat Assessment.” In that report, Wolf said he was “particularly concerned about white supremacist violent extremists who have been exceptionally lethal in their abhorrent, targeted attacks in recent years.”

The report said that domestic violent extremists, “specifically white supremacist extremists (WSEs)” were and would continue to be “the most persistent and lethal threat in the Homeland.” It made all kinds of claims about “WSEs”: that they have “demonstrated longstanding intent to target racial and religious minorities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, politicians, and those they believe promote multi-culturalism and globalization”; and “have conducted more lethal attacks in the United States than any other DVE (domestic violent extremist) movement”; and “have engaged in outreach and networking opportunities abroad.”

There was even a tally alleging that nearly 40 people had been killed in attacks perpetrated by “WSEs” from 2018 and 2019. “WSEs conducted half of all lethal attacks (8 of 16), resulting in the majority of deaths (39 of 48),” the report said.

But there was a problem with the report. There were precisely zero citations showing where the Department of Homeland Security had derived its conclusions—no news articles or academic papers. Just an assurance by the acting secretary, who was “particularly concerned about white supremacist violent extremists” of late.

Hmm — might there be information elsewhere? A document published the previous year by the same department said the agency looked at the years from 2000 to mid-2016 and counted “28 attacks in the United States committed by WSEs, which collectively resulted in 51 fatalities.”

That factoid came with a citation, so that’s good. But this was the corresponding footnote: “Based on a review of US Government information, law enforcement reporting, and open source.” There was no link to specific incidents or verifiable data. There was no cross reference. That wouldn’t fly in a high school English paper, but the feds apparently think they’re above having to back up their wild claims with any actual evidence.

There’s more publicly available information about the government spending millions of dollars to investigate the prevalence of obesity in lesbians than there is about an allegedly serious and fatal threat we’re facing from white supremacists.

What about at the state level? In 2019, Democrat New Jersey Gov. Philip Murphy’s administration published a report on individual episodes of “domestic terrorism” that purportedly took place across the nation throughout the previous year. To the department’s credit, it was highly transparent about what it was counting as an incident of “terrorism,” including names, dates, and locations of the perpetrators.

There were, the report said, a total of 32 “domestic terrorist attacks, disrupted plots, threats of violence, and weapons stockpiling by individuals with a radical political or social agenda.” Of that 32, the office said the overwhelming majority, 25, were carried out by white supremacists.

The report listed each individual incident of white supremacist-linked terrorism, with the name of the perpetrator, his age, and the location of the incident, but without references to where it drew the data. Additional information requires looking up each episode on your own.

One of the incidents involved Benjamin Morro, a 28-year-old Wisconsin man who accidentally killed himself by mishandling explosives in his apartment. No motive has ever been established as to why Morro had the combustible items but law enforcement claimed to have found “white supremacist material,” i.e., literature in pamphlets or books, in his home.

Is a dummy who accidentally blows himself up what comes to mind when you hear the phrase “white supremacist terrorist attack”?

Another one involved Ronnie Wilson, a 32-year-old Tennessee man who was charged with shooting a cop during a traffic stop. Wilson was allegedly a member of the white supremacist gang Aryan Nations, but the officer he shot was also white.

When a white man shoots another white man, is that what comes to mind when you hear the phrase “white supremacist terrorist attack”?

One other incident involved a homeless man who was yelling racial epithets in public. (To which I ask, has anyone seen or heard from Chris Matthews lately?)

Yet another pertained to a black man who was burned alive by his white housemate. The two of them lived at Frazier Young Supportive Living, a residence in Tennessee for the mentally impaired.

A homeless man and a literal mental patient. Is that what comes to mind when you hear the phrase “white supremacist terrorist attacks”?

If those four incidents don’t fill you with fear that white supremacists lurk in the shadows to commit random acts of violence, I don’t know what to tell you. You should be deathly afraid!

To be sure, not all of the entries in the New Jersey government’s report are a reach. A few appear to be legitimate, racially motivated attacks on ethnic minorities.

One involved Natasha Bowers, a 33-year-old woman who, along with five other skinheads, beat up a black man in the back of a bar in Pennsylvania. But the odd thing about that solitary episode is that it was counted by the report as six separate attacks, one for each of the attackers charged by police.

The authors of the report did the same thing with the assault of a black man at a bar in Washington state. Eight attackers identified by law enforcement were believed to be affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood. Each suspect was listed in the report as an individual “white supremacist attack,” even though there was only one incident.

This would be like saying we had 19 separate September 11s because that’s the number of hijackers who participated. No, we had just the one carried out by multiple people. That more than one attacker was involved doesn’t mean we count each one as an individual event.

To recap: of the 25 attacks labeled in the New Jersey government’s report as white supremacy, 14 were related to only two separate incidents. One of them involved a man who accidentally killed himself, another was perpetrated by a homeless guy, and yet another was committed by a mental patient in a home for the intellectually disabled. That brings the total attacks in 2018 down to more like eight—across our entire nation of 330 million people.

Fewer than ten “white supremacy” attacks doesn’t exactly sound like something the FBI should be busying itself with. The numbers on “white supremacy” couldn’t have been more padded if they were on their period.

Yet the president is scheduled to visit Buffalo this week, where he will most certainly talk up white supremacy as an all-consuming force that can only be beaten back by voting for more Democrats. It’s a lie.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/17/congrats-to-the-media-for-finally-finding-a-white-supremacist/,2022-05-17
It’s Long Past Time For Congress To Break Up The FBI,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s long history of abusing its power is once again prominent amid the continued expose by Special Counsel John Durham. His prosecution is demonstrating the FBI’s use of its power to deploy federal intelligence assets against political opponents of Democrats.

The FBI routinely intervenes in politics, such as when the FBI assisted the Hillary Clinton campaign in painting former President Donald Trump as a Russian intelligence asset, as Durham’s investigation is emphasizing with more evidence. By getting a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on Carter Page, the FBI also likely spied on Trump and his inner circle via something called the two-hop rule.

Stunningly, it appears the FBI’s animus for Trump was rooted in disagreements about the foreign policy that Trump campaigned on. Spygate, however, is only a more recent manifestation of a long history of FBI abuses that Congress must rein in as soon as possible.

A Long History of Impropriety

The FBI has a long history of impropriety. Ever since the War on Terror started, the FBI has targeted Muslim communities with informants, who receive $100,000 or more for their work and may be engaged in illegal activities that go unaddressed.

Trevor Aaronson analyzed thousands of FBI cases and found that, “Of these defendants caught up in FBI terrorism sting operations, an FBI informant was the person who led one of every three terrorist plots, and the FBI also provided all of the necessary weapons, money, and transportation.”

The most infamous example is when an FBI agent told a soon-to-be shooter to “Tear up Texas,” right before that person shot up a crowded hall. Even the San Bernadino shooter had contact with people “on the FBI’s radar.” More recently, there were allegations that Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock’s girlfriend was an FBI informant.

Since Trump was elected, the FBI’s focus has shifted away from Islamic terror toward supposed far-right terror. Even Sen. Ted Cruz called the January 6 attack “terrorism” (he later apologized for this terminology).

Just like the FBI’s role in Muslim communities after 9/11, the plot involving Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, timed to take place heading into the 2020 election, involved mostly FBI informants and agents. Journalist Glenn Greenwald has asked similar questions about the FBI’s involvement in the January 6 U.S. Capitol riot, given the number of persons named in government court documents who are not being prosecuted.

In a major abuse of power, the Biden administration mobilized FBI counterterrorism resources to investigate parents for expressing concerns at local school board meetings. Now, the FBI’s 2022 budget has the largest funding increase request under the category of combatting “domestic terrorism,” which includes the addition of many more agents and informants.

To top all this off, the FBI has a reputation of protecting the powerful and trampling on justice. The latest example is the FBI protecting sex predator Larry Nassar because of his powerful position in the U.S. gymnastics program. And don’t forget the likely intelligence agency involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein affair, where Epstein’s predations were allowed because this allowed blackmail to increase the power of U.S. intelligence agencies, including the FBI.

Break Up the FBI

To preserve our democratic republic, the FBI needs serious reform. But serious reform ideas are lacking on the conservative right. Meanwhile, Democrats, who traditionally questioned intelligence agency power, are increasingly aligned with these intelligence bureaucracies against their political enemies.

While many right-wing politicians call for “investigation,” regular folks need to realize that these are useless fundraising ploys. History-minded traditionalists might believe that in a perfect world the FBI would be ended entirely, with its duties given back to state police forces, but try finding support even among Republican House and Senate members for that idea.

A radical, impactful, but also politically workable solution is to instead break up the FBI into many smaller components—at least one-dozen separate agencies. These smaller components would have less power and prestige, and allow Congress greater oversight over the specific results and actions at each newly independent organization. Further, Congress would have far greater ability to tweak funding for these separate smaller agencies based on results, and the priorities of the American people.

Most important, splitting the FBI into smaller and more focused organizations would allow the White House—the president, elected by the people—direct control over the goings-on of each individual agency. This is more desirable because politicians are answerable to the people, while the bureaucracy is not. The smaller agencies would also carry far less weight and prestige than the former behemoth that was the FBI, which limits their ability—even that of the standalone counterterror or counterintel agencies—to intervene in domestic politics.

Some will argue that breaking the FBI into smaller organizations just creates more problems. But this ignores the benefits of less complexity and the additional oversight and control granted to Congress and the executive, respectively.

Others will argue that greater presidential control is dangerous. Yet this is already the status quo, but only if the president is a Democrat. And the whole problem with our intelligence bureaucracies today is that the bureaucracy is a government unto itself, unaccountable to elected officials.

Here’s the Roadmap

When breaking up the FBI, locate the headquarters of those agencies across America, especially in the Midwest, rustbelt, and southeastern United States. The organized crime agency can be placed in Indiana, the counterterrorism agency in Raleigh, North Carolina, and the anti-human trafficking agency in Kansas City. The heads of all these new, smaller, agencies will still be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.

The upside is obvious. The FBI’s roughly $10 billion budget can be apportioned across these agencies, but the creation of separate agencies allows Congress much more control over funding.

For example, relative to the problem, fighting human trafficking and child exploitation and abuse is completely under-resourced in the FBI. Yet the FBI’s politicization has it adding agents to go after political opponents, instead of adding more resources to protect children.

Specifically, create a separate anti-trafficking agency altogether, headquartered in the heartland. The FBI’s additional “domestic terrorism” agents should be removed and replaced with new roles in the anti-trafficking agency.

In other words, this new framework would create more direct and less opaque accountability to Congress and the president. This then would allow the public—who are actually smarter than the politicians—to better hold the government accountable.

The public would be stunned to know how little our federal government spends on measures to fight against trafficking and child exploitation. The public would also be stunned to know how much more we are spending on entrapping people in the name of fighting “domestic terrorism,” which the public would rightly judge far less a problem than the human trafficking problem. So let the sunlight in.

Finally, if Republicans are dissatisfied with this plan, let them come up with something better. But too often our elected politicians hide behind rhetoric of outrage while failing to craft any real hard-nosed policy solutions to fix the thing they are supposedly outraged about. Now is the hour for action, and talk is incredibly cheap.

The whole point of America’s founding documents is that too much power concentrated in too few hands is always corrupting, especially when this power is unaccountable to the people. The D.C. bureaucracy and specifically the intelligence agencies have long become powers unto themselves, and a threat to our democracy. The FBI is a poster child for this perversion of our system, and no political movement will save our democratic republic without reforming it.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/23/its-long-past-time-for-congress-to-break-up-the-fbi/,2022-05-23
"3 New Movies For Weekend Streaming: ‘Terror On the Prairie,’ ‘Rise,’ And ‘Operation Mincemeat’","To generate buzz over the holiday weekend, top streaming services are premiering big titles—while a conservative-driven upstart is making a splash with their independently produced drama. It comes as stakes for the streaming wars have never been higher.

Market leader Netflix has faced massive stock declines and staff layoffs in recent months. Their major competitors like Disney Plus, HBO Max, and Paramount Plus have altered strategies to better compete. And, in light of some parents’ backlash to Hollywood agendas, right-leaning players like Daily Wire are making initial moves to reach critical mass.

Increased competition could mean better value for subscribers — if people can navigate the glut of new films and series, many of them forgettable. This weekend, Netflix has the latter half of “Stranger Things” season four rolling out, but they’re holding big-budget actioner “The Gray Man” until July 22. Prime Video has premiered Chris Pratt’s “The Terminal List” Navy SEALS series, while Paramount Plus comedy flick “Jerry and Marge Go Large” is getting rave reviews.

Three recent film releases deserve a closer look, including the much-talked-about Western produced by Daily Wire and a couple of based-on-true-story dramas from top streamers. Here are three capsule reviews as your family considers what to watch during downtime.

‘Terror On the Prairie’: Aptly Titled Drama Depicts Violent Conflict With Evil

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which tracks the most popular streaming films, has lately ranked two films from conservative distributor Daily Wire in its Top 10 list: documentary “What Is A Woman” and old-school Western “Terror On the Prairie.” While the latter made Hollywood headlines when announced, mainstream critics have kept quiet since release.

“Terror On the Prairie,” featuring a cast led by Oscar winner Nick Searcy (“The Shape of Water”) and Gina Carano–former co-star of “The Mandalorian” famously fired for some errant tweets—marks a strong second effort for Daily Wire Entertainment. The first, “Shut In,” introduced audiences to filmmaker Dallas Sonnier and his R-rated “pressure-cooker movies” which he aims to be “unadulterated, unfiltered, genuine, [and] not neutered by the studio system.”

With stunning, untouched Rocky Mountains as a backdrop, this post-Civil War story unfolds on the barren landscapes of southwestern Montana. A mother of two, including a newborn, Hattie McAllister (Carano) feels no qualms about her husband leaving their cabin for a day to get supplies in town. Until, that is, four men on horseback arrive uninvited.

Producer Sonnier is known for crafting scenes of breathless tension, certainly in evidence here as the black-hat gang chats over food with the fierce mother — until all hell breaks loose. Film critic Christian Toto describes one unexpected element of their stand-off: “The characters shoot, and shoot, and rarely hit their targets. It’s a more realistic version of Wild West gunplay that offers another layer of realism.”

Carano, a mixed martial arts champion prior to her acting career, plays to her strengths without coming off as a superhero. Unquestionably bloody and almost too efficient — a stronger music score might’ve helped a sometimes-lagging pace —“Terror On the Prairie” isn’t for everyone. Despite pulpy archetypes, this revenge plot has more layers than may be immediately apparent.

‘Rise’: Gripping Family Drama Deflated By Flat Basketball Action

Anyone who grew up watching “Remember the Titans,” “Miracle,” or other inspired-by-true-stories films, have longed for Disney to return to high-caliber sports dramas. After seeing middling biopic “Rise,” just out on Disney Plus, it’s apparent fans will have to keep waiting.

The story of star power forward Giannis Antetokounmpo certainly provides the raw material: raised in poverty in Greece, tried out for a local basketball team, trained to improve himself, and ultimately was picked 15th in the NBA Draft in 2013. Last year, he was named NBA Finals MVP after leading his Milwaukee Bucks to take home the championship trophy.

“Rise,” produced with Giannis’ family, depicts the origins and personal context of his journey. Viewers encounter Giannis’ parents emigrating from Nigeria to Turkey to Greece, in search of a better life. They raise four sons in Athens, only able to take odd jobs due to their uncertain legal status; a fifth son, their eldest, even had to be left behind with his African relatives. While unexpected in a sports flick, all the immigration policy drama brings greater realism.

Struggling to provide for and raise his boys right, Charles (Dayo Okeniyi, from “The Hunger Games” films) has many up-close conversations with them about discipline and risk. Real-life Nigerian-American brothers Uche and Ral Agada portray rising athletes Giannis and Thanasis. When first joining a regional basketball team, their family can only afford one pair of sneakers; a scene of one in socks as the other laces up tangibly illustrates their shared sacrifice.

The family’s Christian faith shows up, albeit in a minor role. Parents lead their sons in the Lord’s Prayer before bedtime, and a crucifix hangs prominently in their home. But the script doesn’t engage those really interesting questions: why did a Nigerian family convert to the Greek Orthodox Church? Their mother Vera (Yetide Badaki) says, “God makes no mistakes. Give it your all then let God do his work.” But it lacks context to know the true role of faith in their lives.

What “Rise” glaringly lacks is compelling in-the-paint basketball. The film’s limited hoops action consists mostly of layup shots and players doing drills — less than some Disney Channel flicks. There’s even buildup to Greece’s national scouting exhibition game filmed in a large arena. Characters react as if seeing some incredible Giannis plays on the court, but it’s not there.

A cross-cultural story built on family bonds, “Rise” aims for the inspirational genre similar to last year’s “Blue Miracle.” By the end, with its dramatic NBA Draft scenes and highlight reel of Antetokounmpo brothers, three of them now NBA stars, it leaves viewers inspired. But it also underlines the film’s lack of actual basketball play, an egregious oversight that sadly limits potential impact and shelf life of “Rise.”

‘Operation Mincemeat’: War Thriller Soars With Spycraft, Unrequited Romance

As theater screens shift to mostly big-spectacle blockbusters, it’s led to mid-budget dramas and comedies gradually drying up. Thankfully, streamers have stepped up — with World War II drama “Operation Mincemeat” on Netflix a stellar example.

Academy Award winner Colin Firth (“The King’s Speech”) stars as an MI5 agent seeking to fool the Third Reich with an elaborate hoax and ultimately get Hitler to relocate troops. Another newly-minted spy (Matthew Macfadyen, who also once played Mr. Darcy in “Pride & Prejudice”) proposes hiding deceptive documents on a corpse, and the two collaborate to execute the ruse.

Comparisons to last year’s “The Courier” are inevitable, as it’s another British-produced “dad movie” that brings viewers behind-the-scenes of spy craft. While that past war film explored the sacrifice of an everyman keeping his family in the dark, “Operation Mincemeat” depicts a love triangle between the two agents and a member of their clandestine team (Kelly Macdonald, sparkling as ever.) Vying for her affections starts as subtext, gradually coming to the forefront.

Veteran director John Madden (“Miss Sloane”) exudes class and precision in every shot, aided by cinematographer Sebastian Blenkov whose lighting expertly accentuates the ensemble cast. Screenwriter Michelle Ashford, who previously penned episodes of “John Adams” and “The Pacific,” collaborated with author Ben Macintyre to craft a script packed with historical details.

In plotting that recalls “Top Gun: Maverick,” the central mission gets summed up, detailed, and tested about three times before it’s executed—which actually makes it work. How does one stage a floating corpse with a briefcase and other minutiae so it’s believable to the best minds in espionage? A curious wrinkle of history, author Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond, played a role in this real-life operation and is depicted in a cameo. An odd title for a unique mission, “Operation Mincemeat” recounts a story worth knowing.

"Good Friday, Joe Biden","Image Credit Twitter/RNC Research

Here is the president of the United States speaking in East Jerusalem:

BIDEN in East Jerusalem: ""…the background of my family is Irish American and we have a long history not fundamentally unlike the Palestinian people, with Great Britain and their attitude toward Irish Catholics over the years for 400 years."" pic.twitter.com/stj17lgSvv — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 15, 2022

My first thought on hearing Biden’s comment was that the women of Easter Rising would have wanted to string him up for abortion heresy. But jokes (and eternal damnation) aside, it’s difficult to understand what the president is saying here.

Is he contending that the “Palestinian people,” like the Irish, have first claim to the land, ignoring the consistent Jewish presence in Israel since — let’s be conservative — a few centuries before the unified Kingdom of Israel, around 1000 BC, or around 1600 years before the Muslims invaded? Is he saying that the British took control of Israel in 1917 so they could settle the land with foreigners and displace Muslims? Does he realize that the British were in “Palestine” — where they often abdicated their responsibility to protect the Jewish minority — only 30 years, as opposed to 850? Doesn’t the Jew who fled Europe to return to the Middle East have more in common with the Catholic who fled England for Ireland in the 1600s or America later on?

The first mention of a modern “Palestinian people” did not appear until the early 20th century, an invention of the British mandate. It initially described both Jew and Arab. The latter people incited pogroms, then wars, and then campaigns of terror to rectify the situation, all of which led to their tragic fate. A Good Friday agreement for the Palestinians is always within reach. All they need do is embrace reality and reject terror.

But let’s concede that Biden, who not long ago reportedly discussed a united Ireland with an IRA fugitive, isn’t merely repeating some progressive speechwriter’s words. And let’s point out that an ideological kinship between terror groups PLO and IRA existed in the ’70s, ’80s, and ’90s (though, of the two, only the Irish would make peace.) In some Irish communities, where dueling Israeli and PLO flags still fly, there is a political affinity between people who view themselves either as occupied or terror victims, even though the situations aren’t really comparable. Maybe Biden finds himself in agreement with those who fly the Fatah colors?

Maybe someone will ask him what he meant.

Biden's Border Policies Ignore The Lessons We Learned From 9,"Image Credit White House photo by Eric Draper

It was a generation ago when the 9/11 terrorist attacks killed nearly 3,000 Americans. How many of the post-9/11 generation know what happened that day? And how many of us who lived through it know what allowed that tragedy to happen?

Homeland security is no less at-risk today than it was 21 years ago. To avoid yet another catastrophe, we would do well to revisit some key findings from the 9/11 Commission.

The commission found four failures across the government: imagination, policies, capabilities, and management. With respect to imagination, the commission found that political leaders did not understand the gravity of the terrorist threat posed by Al Qaeda. It was barely discussed among the public, media, or Congress.

The current administration’s open border policies, combined with that same lack of imagination, are actively undermining our national security.

In the last two years, Customs and Border Protection has apprehended 81 known and suspected terrorists illegally crossing our southern border. During that time, another 900,000 “gotaways” have successfully evaded the Border Patrol. It doesn’t take any imagination to assume foreign terrorists have been among them. This should be the overriding national security concern for the U.S. government.

As for capabilities, the commission noted that the “CIA needed to improve its capability to collect intelligence from human agents.” It also reported that “[t]he most serious weaknesses in agency capabilities were in the domestic arena. The FBI did not have the capability to link the collective knowledge of agents in the field to national priorities.”

As terrorists cross our borders, the FBI seems most interested in tagging everyday Americans as domestic terrorists for displaying common flags or symbols or for voicing opposition to school board decisions. Indulging in this nonsense distracts the FBI from investigating real terrorists and plots to harm America.

With respect to management, the commission blamed the lack of information-sharing across agencies, stating “action officers should have been able to draw on all available knowledge about al Qaeda in the government.” Today, many barriers to information-sharing are back in place. The Biden administration bars several federal agencies—including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, and the U.S. Census Bureau — from sharing information with Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). So does every sanctuary city and state.

Yet according to the commission, one critical factor leading to the 9/11 terrorist attack was “permeable borders and immigration controls.” It noted agencies did not discover false statements on visa applications, recognize fraudulent passports, or take adequate steps to find two of the hijackers residing illegally in the United States.

The 9/11 terrorists made false statements to border officials to gain entry into the United States and violated immigration laws while in the United States. The commission concluded that “protecting borders was not a national security issue before 9/11.”

Today, we have an open border and few immigration controls. The Biden administration has directed ICE not to arrest, detain, prosecute or deport the majority of categories that make an alien removable. It effectively grants a provisional status of “asylum-seeker” to any immigrant claiming to live in fear in their native lands. It cuts corners in vetting applicants and adjudicating applications to grant more benefits more quickly.

All of this encourages more illegal immigration and makes it easy for terrorists and other bad actors to enter our country. The Biden regime has returned us to a pre-9/11 posture.

Clearly, it is up to Congress to take back control of our homeland security. This includes: defunding Biden’s open border policies, processes, and grants to NGOs; securing the border; stopping the fentanyl crisis; significantly increasing ICE resources for detentions and removals; requiring information-sharing among government agencies at all levels; defunding FBI and other agencies’ efforts against citizens who pose no threat and redirecting them toward real threats such as those posed by agents of Iran, ISIS, China, Russia, and North Korea.

The 9/11 commission stated that the “9/11 attacks were a shock, but they should not have come as a surprise.” They succeeded because “[t]he nation was unprepared.” Our current leaders have scorned learning from history and instead put our nation on a path to repeat it. We need leaders who will quickly right this ship. And we need them fast.

Top Foreign Funder Of Terrorism Funds Democrat-Tied Think Tank,"American policy makers, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies often rely on U.S.-based think tanks for research and policy recommendations. While many institutions produce academic products with intellectual sovereignty and moral integrity, too many receive undisclosed foreign funding from countries hostile to the United States and our interests.

Funding from these countries is generally associated with a quid pro quo. For this funding, the think tank provides analysis that is less than objective, which may lead to devastating international and national security consequences.

The looming threat of the revival of 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) should compel the examination of American think tanks’ relationships with subversive regimes, such as Iran. Among the leading think tanks pushing for reinstating the JCPOA is the Qatari-funded Brookings Institution. Brookings is a top incubator of staffers for Democrat presidential administrations, including the current Biden administration.

Concerns about U.S. think tanks’ foreign ties are not new. In September 2014, The New York Times published an investigative report titled, “Foreign Powers Buy Influence At Think Tanks.” The report states that funding sources are often undisclosed and listed European and Arab countries that fund American think tanks. The donations that present the greatest concerns are provided by Qatar, a country ruled by an Islamic monarchy with ties to Iran’s mullahs and the Muslim Brotherhood.

In 2013, Qatar’s mediation between the Taliban and the United States resulted in the release of Taliban mass murderers and war criminals from prison and led to the opening of the Taliban’s “political” office in Doha. Negotiations with the Taliban ultimately resulted in handing Afghanistan to the Taliban to run it as a jihadist base for transnational terrorism.

Qatar Funded the Brookings Institution

Also in 2013, according to The New York Times report, Qatar provided a “$14.8 million, four-year donation” to the Brookings Institution. Not coincidentally, the following year Brookings began a disinformation campaign on behalf of the Muslim Brotherhood.

For instance, a 2014 article posted on Brookings’ Arabic website deliberately misstated the fourth of the Muslim Brotherhood’s ten thawabet (precepts) by writing “during the process of establishing democracy and relative political freedom, the Muslim Brotherhood is committed to abide by the rules of democracy and its institutions.” In fact, the fourth precept translates to “violent jihad and martyrdom.” It states “al-jihad sabiluna” (“jihad is our way”), which the Brotherhood insists is an obligation of every individual Muslim, as well as the collective obligation of the organization.

Qatari funding to Brookings and other foreign policy think tanks has devastating foreign policy repercussions that go beyond the pro-Muslim Brotherhood propaganda.

Last June, the FBI seized electronic data from John R. Allen, a retired four-star general who led U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan prior to becoming the president of Brookings from November 2017 until June of this year. Federal prosecutors obtained records indicating that Allen, while serving as Brookings’ president, “secretly lobbied for the government of Qatar, lied to investigators about his role and tried to withhold evidence sought by a federal subpoena.”

Court documents revealed “substantial evidence” that Allen’s violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) were “willful.” While these allegations were levied against Allen, they should have also included Brookings. After all, Brookings was the conduit through which Qatari funds and influence were peddled.

Qatari Ties to Muslim Brotherhood

Qatar’s ties to the Muslim Brotherhood are clear. Author Muhammad al-Honi is a personal advisor to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. In his book, “Saif al-Gaddafi,” al-Honi wrote that former emir of Qatar Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani “stated that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.”

Al-Honi added that the emir’s successor, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, followed in his father’s footsteps and was able to stage a “coup against his father and seize power with the help of the Brotherhood.” Al-Honi and Saif al-Gaddafi’s claims that the Qatari royal family are card-carrying members of the Brotherhood are confirmed by Qatar’s militant support of the group and its terror and jihadist offshoots.

For example, since 2013 Qatar has become either a permanent destination or a transit route for the Brotherhood’s convicted terrorists and jihadists fleeing prosecution for a wide array of terror attacks and assassinations they perpetrated in Egypt. Qatar would either host these jihadists or facilitate their migration to Turkey, the United States, Europe, and elsewhere.

Among the most notorious jihadists who benefited from this policy was Brotherhood leader and ISIS supporter Wagdy Ghoneim. Qatar hosted him for a few years until they trafficked him to continue his jihadist agitation in Turkey.

Another example is convicted terrorist Ahmed Abdel-Basit Mohamed, also known as Basit. Basit was involved in the assassination of Egypt’s Prosecutor General Hisham Barakat in 2015. On his Facebook page, Basit admitted to involvement in jihadist activities including a terrorist attack that killed and injured 506 people. Basit fled Egypt to Qatar, which subsequently facilitated his relocation to the United States.

The Qatari government’s brazen support for transnational terrorism is self-confessed. Qatar’s deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman bin Jassim al-Thani, admitted to Qatar’s terror funding, stating, “as for the issue of terrorism financing, this exists in all countries in the region and it doesn’t only apply to Qatar. Qatar is actually at the bottom of the list of nations implicated in this crime.”

Finally, let’s not forget about Al Jazeera, the state-owned broadcasting company of Qatar with a U.S. channel. There is little doubt that the information disseminated by Al Jazeera is information deemed acceptable by Qatar’s emir, Al Thani, a self-acknowledged Muslim Brotherhood member.

In 2020, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo published “On Transparency and Foreign Funding of U.S. Think Tanks” stating: “To protect the integrity of civil society institutions, the Department requests henceforth that think tanks and other foreign policy organizations that wish to engage with the Department disclose prominently on their websites funding they receive from foreign governments, including state-owned or state-operated subsidiary entities.” We have yet to see that transparency.

It is time to designate Qatar as a state sponsor of terrorism, and the Department of Justice should require Brookings and any other think tanks affiliated with Qatar to register as foreign agents. Our national security depends on a clear-eyed response to Qatar’s funding and the Muslim Brotherhood’s influence.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/09/19/top-foreign-funder-of-transnational-terrorism-funds-think-tank-that-staffs-democrat-presidential-administrations/,2022-09-19
DHS Disinterested In Muslims-Only Immigrant Shelter At US Border,"In October, U.S. Border Patrol caught another nine border-crossing immigrants who were on the FBI’s terrorism watch list, adding to the already record-breaking 98 during the just-ended fiscal 2022 and 14 during the prior fiscal year.

Those 121 suspected terrorist border crossings should strike President Joe Biden’s homeland security establishment and the general public as a “system blinking red” moment, to requote the infamous 9/11 Commission Report line about failures to act on threat information.

But my recent fact-finding trip to Mexico’s first and only shelter that expressly caters to U.S.-bound Muslim immigrants indicated Biden’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sees no blinking red lights amid this current mass-migration border crisis.

In June 2022, the San Diego-based Latina Muslim Foundation noticed significant enough numbers of U.S.-bound travelers from the Islamic world to justify opening the Albergue Assabil/Mesquijta Taybah shelter in a two-story, 8,000-square-foot former nightclub in Tijuana just two blocks from the border wall, which all who stay there intend to bypass one way or another. The shelter serves as a waystation for 30 to 140 immigrants at a time coming from Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Somalia, Chechnya, and other regions in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia where terrorist organizations operate.

Latina Muslim Foundation Director Sonia Garcia told me she is concerned that Islamic terrorists may use her Tijuana shelter and does her best to ferret them out during interviews. She’ll even call in Mexican law enforcement authorities to investigate deceptive and suspicious persons. Mexican authorities recommended that she reject two of them for shelter assistance on terrorism grounds.

“I’m not the person who is going to hide the reality of what people do, regardless of their religion,” Garcia said. “Just because they are Muslims, [we] are not going to let them come to the United States or Mexico to hurt people. That’s it. We’re not into that. We’re just here to help people.”

In ordinary times, when a historic-sized mass migration crisis is not raging, clientele like hers would bring the shelter more attention from law enforcement. That’s because, for more than 15 years, American homeland security has officially tagged U.S.-bound immigrants from such countries as “special interest aliens.” The SIA tag is supposed to trigger bilateral law enforcement and counterterrorism screening with Mexico to investigate them further.

Mexico Collaborates When Manageable

As noted in my book “America’s Covert Border War, The Untold Story of the Nation’s Battle to Prevent Jihadist Infiltration,” Mexico’s collaboration with the United States on counterterrorism has been extensive and to great effect — in non-crisis times when human flows are manageable.

Mexican intelligence often runs the names of special interest aliens through American security databases and allows U.S. officers into detention facilities to interview many of them — before they can cross. Mexican customs officers working in Mexican airports also run identities of arriving special interest aliens through U.S. databases. Mexico has proven sensitive to U.S. requests that it deport the identified extremists to their home countries before they can reach the southern border.

A recent Milenio newspaper investigation based on leaked classified Mexican Ministry of National Defense documents revealed a variety of cases where Mexican and American intelligence agencies working together discovered Islamic terrorists in Mexico in 2015, 2016, and 2017 — a number of them in Tijuana. Some were working on behalf of the Islamic State. The Milenio story details extensive Mexican collaboration with American intelligence agencies on these cases, for example on a January 2017 investigation of an Algerian in Mexico that resulted in the dismantling of an ISIS cell in Algeria.

Between 2014 and 2018, Mexico’s National Institute of Migration identified 19 suspected terrorists in its territory and deported them all, undoubtedly at American behest.

U.S. Not Inquiring About Shelter

But nothing is normal now with the crisis. Garcia told me the Americans have never called asking about any of the terror-watch-listed immigrants caught crossing the border, except early on when Afghans started showing up and the U.S. consulate in Tijuana came to interview them.

Garcia said she would be happy to provide the Americans with all information the shelter maintains about every person who stays overnight if they ever call.

Outside the shelter, November 2022 (Photo by Todd Bensman)

“If somebody’s on the [FBI] list and they want to find out if they came from the shelter, well, they’re welcome to come to the shelter and ask us,” she said. “We have no problem in giving the information or in hiding the information, no. If he is on the watch list and he came into the shelter, well it’s very good because we’ll give [the Americans] the information. We’re not hiding the information.”

The Mexicans are no more proactive about her guests, she said, beyond when she calls them in. Outside her facility recently, several young Chechen men described journeys in which they flew to Mexican airports on Russian passports and were never delayed or interviewed.

Is this a replay of unseen red lights blinking amid a massive crush of millions of immigrants overwhelming both the Americans and the Mexicans?

Going to ‘Blow Something Up’

“Eventually these guys are going to go in and blow something up and it’s going to be a huge scandal,” said former President Donald Trump’s ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau, when I described my findings. “You’d think we’d learn something from 9/11. I would think that this is a DHS concern about monitoring who is making their way to our country. If I were the ambassador, I’d be very curious about this shelter, like who is there and what kind of people are trying to come into our country.”

So too would retired FBI Supervisory Special Agent James G. Conway, who led post-9/11 counterterrorism programs in Mexico for years and vetted thousands of special interest aliens. After all, in no other single shelter would SIAs planning border crossings congregate as they do in this one.

“I would be all over this place,” Conway said. “The fact that terrorist organizations are based in some of those countries and want to bring harm to the United States, and that this shelter that specifically caters to citizens from special interest countries two blocks from the U.S. border is helping to funnel them into the United States, should certainly be a concern to law enforcement and the intelligence community.”

Covert Operations

It is possible that both the Americans and Mexicans are running covert operations in and around the shelter. But that’s doubtful too, according to two intelligence community sources who told me it wasn’t on the radar.

“If the Mexicans see that we don’t care about something, then the Mexicans won’t care,” Landau said. “They’re not going to knock themselves out if they see we’re not going to knock ourselves out. I can’t blame them.”

Infamously, the George W. Bush administration — up until Sept. 10, 2001 — didn’t seriously consider intelligence reports that terrorists would ever fly planes into buildings.

Does the Biden administration not believe terrorists could cross the southern border amid the current chaos and could get through to do harm?",https://thefederalist.com/2022/12/06/why-isnt-homeland-security-monitoring-a-muslim-only-immigrant-shelter-at-the-us-border/,2022-12-06
21 AGs Push Biden To Classify Drug Cartels As Terrorist Groups,"Image Credit CBP Photography/Wikimedia Commons

In a bid to rectify the chaos caused by President Joe Biden’s open border policies, 21 Republican attorneys general are formally requesting the federal government designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations.

In a letter sent to Biden and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday, the Republican coalition asked that “the Sinaloa Cartel, CJNG, and other similarly situated Mexican drug cartels be designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations” under federal law so state and federal law enforcement agencies would be granted “increased powers to freeze cartel assets, deny entry to cartel members, and allow prosecutors to pursue tougher punishments against those who provide material support to the cartels.”

“Traditional counter-narcotics efforts are inadequate to address the threat posed by the Mexican drug cartels,” the document says. “Now that the cartels have made widespread use of assassinations and armed insurgency against the Mexican government, FTO designation is the only way to disrupt these increasingly violent cartel tactics and weaken their criminal enterprise.”

[WATCH: Cartel Country: The Untold Story Of America’s Black Market On The Border]

Throughout the letter, the signers, led by Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, also point to the alarming rise in American drug overdoses, particularly those caused by heavily trafficked synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. According to figures from the Drug Enforcement Administration, 66 percent of America’s more than 100,000 overdose deaths last fiscal year were related to synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. From Oct. 2021 to June 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized 8,425 pounds of fentanyl being smuggled into the country through the U.S.-Mexico border.

“The threat these drug cartels pose is real and imminent—which is why this country must escalate its response,” Miyares said in a statement. “Law enforcement agencies need every tool available to fight against this public health and national security crisis, and designating these cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations would be an important first step in confronting the gravity of this dangerous crisis.”

While Mexico-based cartels trafficking drugs into the U.S. isn’t a new problem, the Biden administration’s open border policies have made it easier. In June 2021, for instance, the administration announced it would end the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” policy, which required illegal border crossers seeking asylum to stay in the Latin American country until their court hearing. The administration has also sought to eliminate Title 42, a health policy that allows federal officials to expel illegal migrants with minimal processing.

As a result of such policies, attempted illegal border crossings have skyrocketed, forcing CBP officials to prioritize processing the lawbreakers over securing the border. In December, the agency processed more than 250,000 illegals, representing a 7 percent increase from the month prior. In fiscal year 2022 alone, CBP officials reported an astonishing 2.3 million apprehensions, compared to the 1.7 million reported in 2021.

A Terrorist Victim Can Help The Supreme Court Fix Section 230,"In 2015, Nohemi Gonzalez—a 23-year-old American studying in Paris—was gunned down by Islamic State (ISIS) terrorists while dining at La Belle Equipe bistro. The U.S. Supreme Court will consider these wrenching facts of Gonzales v. Google on Feb. 21. Bound up with Nohemi’s fate is the fate of Section 230.

That 1996 federal statute privileges Big Tech, excusing it from laws that constrain newspapers and other old-style communication. But does it relieve Big Tech from complying with all laws affecting communication? For example, those against aiding terrorism?

Nohemi’s relatives and estate have sued Google—the owner of YouTube—for algorithmically encouraging followers of ISIS to view ISIS videos, in violation of the law against assisting terrorism. Google responds that Section 230 gives it sweeping immunity. It claims to be privileged for a host of abuses, including aiding terrorism and censoring Americans.

Big Tech thus takes a big interpretation of Section 230. The statute and the Constitution, however, suggest Big Tech has overplayed its hand.

The statutory problem is textual. According to Google and the rest of Big Tech, YouTube enjoys protection as a “publisher” under Section 230(c)(1) for its “editorial functions,” whether in sharing and recommending videos or in blocking them. But that’s not what the section says.

It says such companies shall not be “treated as the publisher” of information provided by others. So Google, comically, is seeking to be treated as a publisher under a section that says it shall not be treated as a publisher. Its argument proves too much.

The context confirms the narrowness of the text. The section was a response to cases such as Stratton Oakmont v. Prodigy, a defamation case in which Prodigy was held to be “a publisher rather than a distributor.” A key element in defamation cases is to show that the defendant is the publisher of the defamation. Section 230(c)(1) protected against such suits by saying the companies should not be “treated as the publisher” of information supplied by others.

This leads to the sensible conclusion that YouTube and Google should not find any shelter in Section 230 for supporting terrorism. Being a publisher is not an element of a case for aiding terrorism, so Section 230(c)(1) gives them no cover.

Unfortunately, Big Tech’s big interpretation of Section 230(c)(1) also excuses its censorship. In fact, this section merely protects Big Tech from defamation suits for what they disseminate. The protection for their censorship comes, instead, in Section 230(c)(2).

But Big Tech downplays that section. Instead, it claims Section 230(c)(1) fully protects companies for all publishing activities, including both carrying and suppressing information. So, if the Supreme Court accepts Big Tech’s big rewriting, the decision in Gonzales v. Google could privilege Big Tech both as to terrorism and censorship.

The constitutional difficulties reinforce the conclusion that Section 230 is no excuse. An initial problem is that the government enjoys no regulatory power over speech. The significance of this point becomes more evident with each new “Twitter Files” release. When the federal government can regulate speech, as in Section 230, it can use the threat of altering that regulation to secure censorship by the regulated companies.

Section 230 is especially unconstitutional because it privileges electronic communication over print and in-person communication, thereby subjecting these older modes to discriminatory restraints. This is speaker discrimination, which the Supreme Court rightly held unconstitutional in Citizens United v. FCC.

The speaker discrimination, moreover, comes with viewpoint discrimination. Newspapers tend to have more local or regional perspectives than do Big Tech companies. So, by privileging electronic carriers, Section 230 favors their relatively national and international views and disadvantages the localized views of more traditional modes of communication.

Of course, if electronic communication is the way of the future, perhaps government should help it along. But even if government can help new paths financially, it cannot excuse electronic communication from legal duties that continue to apply to newspapers and books. This penalizes the “old” on behalf of the “new.”

That’s especially offensive because the dominance of the new was not a natural product of market forces. It was much accelerated by Section 230’s discrimination, which financially depressed print and elevated the alternative.

Section 230(c)(2) privatizes censorship. It relieves Big Tech of liability for censoring Americans in line with a congressional list of disfavored content, thus standing out as Section 230’s most egregious provision. This brings the question back to Big Tech’s strained interpretation of Section 230(c)(1).

If Section 230(c)(2) protects companies for censoring material, why does Big Tech insist that Section 230(c)(1) does the same thing? That’s oddly redundant. But it’s precisely what one would expect from Big Tech if it understood that Section 230(a)(2) doesn’t fully protect censorship.

Even if that section were constitutional—and it isn’t—it focuses on content-based censorship and so doesn’t protect viewpoint-based censorship. In the long term, therefore, Big Tech can’t rely on Section 230(a)(2). But the justification for viewpoint-based censorship that’s missing from that section can be concocted elsewhere. Big Tech just has to persuade the Supreme Court to take a big interpretation of Section 230(a)(1).

The perverse beauty of Gonzales v. Google, from the Big Tech perspective, is that Big Tech could secure Supreme Court support for the big interpretation in a case that does not involve censorship. Terrorism could be a backdoor for censorship to sneak in unobserved.

Nohemi’s murder was utterly unjustified. So is the big interpretation of Section 230. It contravenes the statute’s text. It departs from the concerns underlying the act’s adoption. It privileges Big Tech to aid terrorism and impose censorship. And the statute is unconstitutional.
